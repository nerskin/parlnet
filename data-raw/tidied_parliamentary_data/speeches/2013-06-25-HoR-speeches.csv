Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:48):  I thank all those who stood to support me on this occasion. Perhaps they may even like to stay and listen to what I have to say. As the government lurches towards the end of its term Australians are looking for change. Frankly, they have had enough. They have had enough of three years of constant internal warfare which has just left the country with a feeling of despair. Here we are, just two days of parliamentary sittings left and just 80 days away from an election, and the government still has not made up its mind who its leader is going to be when it comes to this election campaign. Will it be the current Prime Minister or are we going to get a re-run of the previous Prime Minister? The facts are that, with all the division, the chaos and the dysfunction, neither is worthy of the Prime Minister's office. The party they purport to lead is not worthy of being entrusted with government. Both have proved that they cannot be trusted by the Australian people. 


The coalition is focused on a better future for our country, focused on families and businesses. Labor have forgotten all about the people they purport to represent. They just look inwards. They are fighting amongst themselves. Australia's national interest does not get a look in. Families are forgotten. The people are forgotten. Is it any wonder that so many people look at their lives and wonder how the last three years could have been so wasted? They wonder how the opportunities that our country had, with the best terms of trade that it has enjoyed for ever, could have been squandered by a government that has no direction, knew not where it was going. This government was just being as creative as it possibly could be to develop and invent new taxes that actually hurt the Australian people and have sent our country backwards. Labor has just governed itself for almost six years now, self-obsessed and self-destructive. Around 40 new or higher taxes have been imposed on the Australian people. 


Above all, Labor's carbon tax is hurting Australian families. It is costing jobs. It is sending manufacturing overseas, as was just alluded to in the previous debate. Under this government, three manufacturing jobs are being lost every hour. Is that the kind of record a Labor government would want to leave behind? The Treasurer said in his last budget that this budget would be about growth and jobs, except the budget forecasts lower growth and fewer jobs, more unemployment. There was a budget a few years ago that was about jobs, jobs, jobs. But this government has in fact stalled the rate of jobs growth and manufacturing jobs. Indeed, so many other jobs are being sent overseas on a daily basis.


But the carbon tax is slugging all Australian families, particularly those who live in the regions. For most of the last 12 months, the $23 per tonne carbon tax that Australians are paying has been more than five times higher than the rate in Europe. What is worse, our tax is much more comprehensive in its coverage of the economy. The European tax just touches a handful of industries. Many of Europe's key industries—the export industries, the food-processing industries—are exempt. If you go to New Zealand, the food-producing industry is exempt, but the rate is only 75c a tonne.


Australia has the world's biggest carbon tax and it has done the world's biggest damage. It is a tax that is costing jobs and hurting families. But Labor has not yet had enough. Next week the carbon tax goes up. It goes up to $24.15 per tonne, 32 times higher than New Zealand's effective rate of 75c a tonne. Is it any wonder, therefore, that jobs are moving to New Zealand, that the people at SPC, at Simplot and at so many of our processing industries are worried about their jobs going to New Zealand? Indeed, food processing was Australia's largest secondary industry, but it is largely now being exported to other countries, and permanently lost as a result of this government providing an uncompetitive environment in which to operate. Is it any wonder that Australian food producers are moving to New Zealand? Is it any wonder that Australian manufacturers are giving in to competition from Asia? They do not have any of these sorts of taxes to pay. They are not lumbered with these burdens.


People who live in regional communities have to pay over the odds when it comes to the cost of living, and the carbon tax just makes life harder for them. But there is more to come. If Labor are re-elected, the carbon tax will go up again next year, on 1 July 2014. It comes with an extra kick in the guts, especially for regional Australians. If the Rudd-Gillard soap opera gets another run, the carbon tax slug will hit road transport for the first time. The government have not actually legislated for this carbon tax on road transport, although the Prime Minister has reaffirmed again and again and again that they intend to do so. They would save the embarrassment of the members for New England and for Lyne from the magnitude of what they have done in supporting this tax on distance. But if this government is re-elected, there will be an increase in the carbon tax to above $25, and there will be a 7c a litre or thereabouts increase in the price of diesel.


That is going to make it more expensive to move things around our country. Every item on every shelf in every supermarket in the country will be more expensive as a result of the extension of the carbon tax to include transport fuel. That means higher costs of living for families. It means that everyone will have to pay more for the basics in life. If you happen to be unfortunate enough to live outside of a capital city, you will pay even more, because you have to pay more freight on everything that goes to your stores.


The reality is that this is a government that has lost touch with the impact of its policies on Australian families and on their lifestyles. It means that every Australian family lives with an Australian government that no longer cares about the impact on their lives and on their lifestyle. There will be less profits to go home and investments are being put on hold. More jobs are at risk, and the opportunities that have generally been regarded as the birthright of every Australian are disappearing. As a nation, we need to be investing in industries that create Australia's wealth—the mining industry, the farming industry, the manufacturing industry, the electricity generation industry, the tourism industry and small businesses. We should be supporting them, not penalising them. A coalition government will abolish the carbon tax. We will get our industries competitive again. We will give families hope for a better future. 


Australians have also suffered from other taxes in Labor's plethora of taxes. What about the mining tax? This is a tax that has undermined investment and cost jobs, but the much promised windfall of revenue simply has not happened. For regional Australia, therefore, the so-called benefits from the regional investment fund have just disappeared—$2 billion simply taken away from that fund in the last budget, because the government recognised the money was not there. They have not earned the money because the tax, personally negotiated by the Prime Minister, has been a debacle. It is the bitter fruit of the secret deal hatched by the canny negotiator, our Prime Minister, with the three big miners. Big miners managed to carve themselves out of the mining tax and to leave the small miners to carry the can and so, not surprisingly, the can is empty.


The Treasurer stripped this $2 billion out of the regional infrastructure fund and moved another amount of money across to try and prop up the roads budget, which has basically been halved in this year's budget. The attempt to prop it up is to try to make the figures look as though they are not as disastrous as they actually are. A coalition government will abolish the mining tax as well. We will restore confidence to our great mining industry, and we will give them the opportunity to invest and to create jobs—jobs for Australian families and opportunities for our country.


Small business has been the backbone of our country for such a long, long time. But Labor's high-tax, high-debt and high-regulation merry-go-round is also undermining the engine room of our country. Under Labor's mismanagement, the engine room of our country has seized up because of a lack of confidence, a lack of optimism. As a nation we have stopped playing to our strengths. We have stopped looking after the engine in our economy. Small businesses are being vilified in the name of green dogma or union power and the tax binges from this government. Their costs are increasing, and the skids are being put under the millions of Australian jobs that they support. The job losses are mounting, and job security is simply a pipe dream, particularly for employers and employees in regional communities. Many of these industries are facing the impact of the carbon tax, which is affecting them not just directly through electricity prices but also through extra costs on things like the gases in their freezers. Shopkeepers are pulling out refrigerators and abattoirs are unable to afford to recharge their freezers because of all of these costs.


When employees and families feel as though their futures are threatened they can no longer afford to go for the holidays they once had, and so our tourism industry suffers. Our new industrial relations climate makes it so difficult for a restaurant to open on a weekend or to serve a cup of coffee after hours, reducing the pleasure of the experience of holidaying in our own country. It also reduces the pleasure for those coming to Australia, who have paid all the extra arrival taxes and so forth that this government has imposed only to be greeted with closed restaurants or special surcharges for weekends because businesses and restaurateurs are simply unable to afford the high costs of labour in this country. That does not make us competitive; that gives us disadvantages. That makes it harder to be successful in this country, and that is, sadly, the record of this government along with its endless regulations, destroying the spirit of somebody who may be wanting to invest in or to propose a new project.


A coalition government will slash red tape, saving at least $1 billion a year. We will reward those who are prepared to invest. We will reward those people who have the willingness to work hard in this country. We are prepared to back them when they back themselves, and to give them a real chance to succeed.


The reality is that this government has lost its way. Its proposed NBN, which is going to save the nation, is years and years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget. There is virtually no-one signing up and there are more costly delays yet ahead. The wireless network, we are now told, is so far behind that fewer than 10 per cent of the target businesses and homes will be connected by 30 June. And the latest excuse that the NBN has for not being able to get its wireless up and running? They did not realise there were trees in Australia! The tall trees are blocking the signal. This is the whole scheme that never had a business plan, that does not know where it is going, but we certainly know it is not getting there. The reality is that Australians are being left without the services that they were promised. A coalition government will deliver fast broadband sooner and more cheaply, at an affordable rate.


This government has delivered a gross debt that is going to take generations to recover from. This government has left families without hope, without opportunity and in despair for the future of their country. We need a change. We need a new government. We need somebody who believes in our nation and who is prepared to back it, invest in it and make sure things happen—to give Australian families the hope, the reward and the opportunity that they need to build for themselves and for their families.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2013-06-25,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Minister for Higher Education and Skills) (16:03):  It was an interesting story of doom and gloom by the member for Wide Bay. I am pleased that he managed to just fit in his little spiel at the end on the current theme of the opposition. The claim that they are going to deliver for the Australian population has an interesting disconnect between the claim and the reality. That is not an uncommon circumstance in terms of the arguments put forward. I am going to try to encapsulate what was a stab in the dark by the member across a number of portfolio and policy areas, and to address it and respond from the government's perspective.


The member seemed to be progressing an argument that there was a significant problem with the Australian economy. This is a key area in which the member, in his contribution, made a lot of doom-and-gloom claims—a bit of a nightmare bedtime story for people but, I suggest, very little connected to the facts of the situation. Just for his information I indicate that the facts of the economy are quite contrary to the doom and gloom that he outlined, in particular in his story on employment. For the member's interest, since this government came to power there have been over 960,000 jobs created within the context of an international situation that has put a lot of pressure on advanced economies, including ours, and a situation where most advanced economies would be giving their eye teeth to have the outcomes that we have achieved in this nation.


I know that this does not fit the doom-and-gloom story; I understand the political dynamic that is going on on the other side; I understand the standard procedure that rolls out from coalition oppositions—we have seen it in state governments up and down the east coast. In opposition you have to create a sense of crisis. You have to get an argument up that things are terribly difficult, that we are faced with a position that will require, when they come to government, some serious intervention. This then lays the groundwork for some form of audit or review of the circumstance. My colleague would know this very well in Queensland, where the former Treasurer Mr Costello came in and did an audit for the state government. It lays the foundation for an audit, and then they will wring their hands and say, 'It's so terrible, we're going to have to cut to the bone across a whole range of services and, in fact, walk away from a lot of the very investments that this nation will need to create a future of growth and opportunity for the populations of all of our communities.'


In particular I would point out that the member for Wide Bay in his contribution expressed a great deal of concern about jobs and a great deal of concern about families and providing some security for them. However, as some of my colleagues noted in the previous debate when we were talking about the potential to suspend the procedures of this House, the member for Wide Bay indicated that a lot of this problem came down to wages and conditions and things like penalty rates. We well know what this debate means; in fact, it is not even code these days. We are again hearing from those opposite an engagement in a conversation that makes it quite clear what the future for families across this nation will be under a coalition government, and that will be a revisiting of all of those interventions under industrial relations that caused such distress and rejection in the broader community that saw Work Choices profoundly rejected at the 2009 election. Indeed, it led to the current Leader of the Opposition, and other leaders of the opposition that have progressed through this place since that time, saying that the thing was 'dead and buried' and saying, 'We are not going anywhere near it anymore.' Yet suddenly the ghost of Work Choices starts to filter through the contributions in this place. So I think families know very well what the reality will be under those opposite.


The MPI talks about the cost of living for families. It is the case that the most profoundly important contributor to sustainability for families is a job. That is absolutely true. It has been the permanent and ongoing focus of this government to support access to jobs for people, particularly during the time when the international economy went through the global financial crisis. It has not only been our focus; it has been an achievement. As I said at the beginning of my contribution, over 960,000 jobs were created in that period, despite those serious international headwinds for our economy. I know this only too well, as do many of my colleagues, having come from an economy that is in transition and that has a manufacturing, mining and service industry base. We live it every day and we absolutely know it.


But I also know that the reality is that businesses across our communities benefitted from the interventions by this government and the stimuluses that we put in place. There was the immediate short-term stimulus of the cash injection which kept people spending over the Christmas period during the initial impact of the GFC and helped keep open those businesses that the member for Wide Bay talked about—all those small businesses in retail, hospitality and tourism who are, as we know, run on a cyclical yearly income and need that expenditure over the Christmas-New Year period to make their books balance for the year. That initial, short-term cash injection in response to the global financial crisis actually kept open a lot of doors of small businesses over that period of time. I remember those opposite rubbishing it and saying how outrageous it was that people were buying TV sets—and now we are worried that the very small businesses that sell the TV sets might be in trouble. It was a really significant and important intervention to support jobs and to support small businesses.


Of course, off the back of that, there was the more medium-term intervention in terms of the building and construction programs that occurred. As many of us know, the Building the Education Revolution provided facilities that are greatly valued by schools. If you want to talk about cost of living, try being a family buying raffle tickets all the time because the school needs a new hall—and then there is the lamington drive, the chocolate drive and the raffle—as school families try to raise the funds that they need for those facilities. I can assure you that they were profoundly grateful for that injection.


Also, as a result of that building program there were a lot of small and medium building and construction companies in my electorate—and I am sure they were in everybody else's electorate—that got work through that period. I met companies in my area working on BERs who said to me, 'We were within weeks of laying off staff.' That was the reality—and they were not only keeping their staff but also putting on apprentices. One of the really important outcomes—if you want to talk about jobs and security for families—out of the global financial crisis was the fact that apprenticeship commencements were sustained through the global financial crisis at their pre-crisis levels. That is an unprecedented outcome for an economic downturn.


I live in the Illawarra and I well remember the downturn that occurred in the late eighties and early nineties. One of the first things that paid the cost was apprenticeships. During that downturn, there was a massive drop-off in the recruitment of apprentices and the opportunity for young people to get a start in life to get a good quality job for the long-term future and to raise a family off the back of that. The outcome of that, of course, was that as we went through the cycle and the upswing occurred, we had significant skill shortages across this country. The intervention by this government, particularly through the Apprentice Kickstart program, meant that those companies not only had work to do through that period but also had the capacity and support to employ the next generation of young tradespeople on those job sites. It was significantly important, and we will be for the next generation very grateful that we had those skills in place and rolling out across our communities.


Job security and access to jobs are important, and we have been all about that the whole time that we have been in government. I will not go through the extensive interventions that we have made in the education system more broadly to ensure that the jobs that are emerging, the jobs of the future—which of course will require much higher levels of qualifications and skills—are going to be available to the Australian population because we have upped the standards of our preschool teaching, we have upped the standards of our schools, we have upped the standards of our vocational providers and our universities and we have injected into them in significant ways and created new training opportunities.


On top of having access to a job, you also want fair remuneration for your work and reasonable working conditions that make it possible to actually engage with and have a family life as well as financially support your family. The interventions that we have made in getting rid of Work Choices and putting the Fair Work Bill into place and supporting things like the accumulation of superannuation—an historic Labor reform that we are now expanding—and making sure that there is fair pay for all workers have been significant. In particular, for me, the fair pay case that enabled community service workers—many of whom are women—to get some pay equity was a significant outcome. I sat on the House's committee chaired by Sharryn Jackson, a former member, that did the pay equity report. I indicate that it was a bipartisan report.



Mr Neumann interjecting—




Ms BIRD:
  That is right—the member was also on the committee. It was a bipartisan report. It acknowledged that there had been an inherent, entrenched discrimination against what was generally termed 'women's work', although there are a lot of really fine men working in the field, of course, too. But it had become an entrenched equity issue in terms of pay and remuneration. As a result of the government's reform, action was able to be taken on that front.


So there have been a number of initiatives over a number of areas by this government to ensure fair remuneration and decent working conditions are in place for Australian families—and they value that very much. That was reflected, I would suggest to those opposite, in the 2007 election. So it is very interesting to see the emergence again on that side of some of those Work Choices type campaigns, particularly, as the member for Wide Bay said, around penalty rates and conditions. So we put the facts on the table.


The other area I want to identify some facts around was the member's contribution on the National Broadband Network. It is astonishing. I think there will be a lot of people sitting on that side of the House who, when their grandchildren say, 'What did you do in parliament? Can I have a look at some of your contributions?', will be directing them to everything but their contribution on the NBN. It is going to be one of those spaces where, as the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport showed today, in another generation they will be reading into the new Hansard the contributions of those opposite in the current Hansard around the NBN and having a good old chuckle about it, because it will seem inconceivable that people who said they had a focus on the future could have made the contributions that they made. 


I actually feel a real twinge of sympathy for those on the other side who I know actually get this and actually do understand why it is such significant nation-building infrastructure and would no doubt like to break out of the shackles of the Leader of the Opposition, who will struggle I think to comprehend why that is such a significant future investment for this nation. They would really like to break out of those shackles and say, 'Look, can we just support the government? They are on the right track here.' This is significant and it will make a huge difference, particularly in rural and regional areas, where you know as well as I know that the rollout of telecommunications infrastructure is never as good as what they get in the city. How you could not be getting right behind a platform that rolls out broadband across this nation and provides equity at that access level for the infrastructure? I really don't understand. It is going to be the technology that will create connections across the nation, that will give equity to people wherever they live in accessing services, and that will provide the backbone of a whole lot of new business activity—new small businesses that the member for Wide Bay said he was so concerned about. The reality is that that program is the program of the future, and it is the one that delivers to rural and regional areas. The reality for families under the coalition's policy is that it will come to the end of their street and if they have got $5,000-odd they will be able to connect it to their house. I just think that is an appalling position to be in.


So across all the policy areas that the member for Wide Bay made a contribution about, it is quite clear that they are still living in the past. They want to revisit pre-2007—they want to go back to an outdated NBN program, they want to go back to a rejected industrial relations policy, they want to go back to a world before the GFC and pretend it never happened. Fairy tales do not happen in reality. This government deals with the facts. We deliver the policies that address the future and we will continue to do that in the interests of families.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (16:14):  I rise to contribute to this matter of public importance debate initiated by the Leader of the National Party. The reality today is that, wherever you go around this country, there is a lack of confidence about economic management and a lack of security about the future. People are concerned about their jobs and they are saving because they are concerned about what might happen next week, next month or next year. If you walk down the high street of any town or suburb in Australia you will see shops that are closed. You know that businesses are not employing people. Indeed, many of them are laying workers off. When people look for some sense of security at the present time all they see here from the leadership of this country is a sense of chaos and confusion.


Three years ago this week the Australian Labor Party was arguing about who should be the leader—who should be the Prime Minister of Australia. Three years on, this week, what is happening? That same Australian Labor Party is arguing about who should be the leader, the Prime Minister of Australia. Of course, the current Prime Minister came to office having removed the previous Prime Minister by saying, 'We had lost our way'—the government had lost its way. Have they found their way since then? We still have the same chaos—still the sense that the only thing that matters for this government is who lives in the Lodge, who has got the job of Prime Minister, rather than the jobs, the future and the security of the people of Australia.


There is no greater impact upon the cost of living of Australians than the introduction of a carbon tax. Remember prior to the last election that famous statement of the Prime Minister—'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.'



A government member interjecting—




Mr ANDREWS:
  The honourable member opposite can interject all he likes. All that indicates is once again why the people of Australia so distrust this government. Because having made the statement in the dying days of the election campaign that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—and this comes to their manic concentration on just the top job—and having failed to secure a majority on the floor of this House, enough members to form a government alone, the Prime Minister was prepared to walk away from that solemn promise to the people of Australia and to introduce a carbon tax. And that carbon tax is having an impact on the cost of living of ordinary Australians.


Let us just look at the increase in the cost of living that people in Australia are bearing, the percentage increase since the ALP came to power from the December quarter of 2007 to the March quarter of 2013, CPI data taken from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Electricity, one of the most basic commodities that Australian households and businesses need, has increased by 93.8 per cent. Water and sewerage have increased by 63.1 per cent. Other utilities have increased by 79.2 per cent. Gas has increased by 61.8 per cent. Insurance has gone up by 45.4 per cent. Education expenses have increased by 38.7 per cent. Rents have increased by 30.2 per cent. Housing costs are up by 29.6 per cent. 


Let us just take the period in which this government has supposedly found its way, the period since the current Prime Minister has been the occupant of the Lodge. Over that period, the last three years, since Ms Gillard has been the Prime Minister of Australia, electricity has gone up by 44.7 per cent, water and sewerage have gone up by 26.4 per cent, utilities by 36.9 per cent, gas by 28.6 per cent, insurance by 21.3 per cent and education by 18.8 per cent.


Childcare expenses—something which many families are struggling with in terms of cost of living—alone have gone up by 26 per cent. There are many struggling families today whose childcare costs are so great that it is hardly worth them being able to work. In fact, what I am hearing from childcare centres and operators in my electorate and elsewhere around the country is that the childcare costs are going up by such an amount that it is becoming almost unaffordable for many struggling families to keep their kids in child care.


Rents have gone up by 11 per cent. In Australia today, according to the experts, we have a deficiency of about a quarter of a million dwellings. That means more people are renting if they can get into renting. There are more people that are homeless. There was the famous promise by the previous Prime Minister that he would do something about homelessness. Homelessness has gone up by almost 15,000 to 16,000 in Australia since then and housing has gone up under this Prime Minister by 13 per cent. 


What is the only response we get from the government? The only response is a series of excuses. It was the global financial crisis some years ago. What was the government's response to the global financial crisis? To waste more taxpayers' money on things like pink batts in housing roofs causing fires and on a cash-for-clunkers scheme. That was a waste of money. Or they blamed the states or anybody but this government that was in power. The reality is this: when you are elected to occupy those Treasury benches in this place, you are elected to take responsibility for the government of this country. What we have instead of that is chaos and confusion, this internal warfare going on between various factions as to who supports Mr Rudd, who supports Ms Gillard. I suspect a majority support neither of them and would like to get some new leader, but this continues to be played out. All the time what are being forgotten are the people and the families of Australia. 


On top of that this government have taken decisions which have cost more for families in this country, whether you are talking about the family tax benefit part A or part B, or the four lots of changes they have made resulting in the abolition of the baby bonus, or the changes they have made about other taxes—the cutting and the capping of the childcare rebate, which was capped to a maximum of $7,500. If it was still being indexed as it was, families would be receiving $700 or more in assistance. Since Ms Gillard became the Prime Minister, childcare costs in this country have increased by 26 per cent. There are the means test on the private health insurance and the changes in the net medical expenses tax offset. We can go on and on.


There are the changes in the means testing of our aged-care system, the parenting payment recipients taken from people who have been moved from a system where they received a much higher parenting payment to the Newstart allowance. The reports I get back from emergency relief centres, not just in my electorate but as I travel around the country, are that we have effectively created a new group of poor parents by simply ripping away those payments from them in every area. This government has been concerned about simply who is going to be the Prime Minister, and how it is going to continue to stay in office, rather than doing the things it was elected for—that is, to provide security to the people of Australia. 


No wonder wherever we go around this country people are concerned about the future. People are concerned about whether they will have a job next week or next month or next year. They are certainly concerned about whether their children and their grandchildren will inherit the sort of Australia that they have inherited. I believe it is the aspiration of every Australian to be able to hand on to the next generation—and the generation after that—a better country than they inherited. That is something that is central to our belief, it is central to what we as Australians want, and yet here we have a government which over the last three years has put very much in danger that ability to say, 'We can hand on to the next generation a better Australia than we inherited.' That is a pity, that is a shame on this government. In distinction from that, the coalition have a plan in which we will deliver a prosperous economy and a safe and secure country for the people of this nation.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2013-06-25,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (16:28):  We have heard from those opposite a list of fiction. I am going to give a list of facts in relation to what this government has done to make Australia a stronger and smarter and fairer country. We heard the deputy leader of the coalition, the Leader of the Nationals, talk about wages and labour costs in two speeches in the last hour or so. On each occasion he inferred quite clearly that in fact wages were too high in this country and that we had to drive down wages. This is from a person who voted for Work Choices on more than two dozen occasions. 


One of the proudest days I have had in the six years I have been in this place was when we got rid of Work Choices. We know what Work Choices did. It drove down wages and made it more difficult for Australian families to be able to meet their costs of living, pay for the education and health needs of their kids and the recreational pursuits that they wanted for their families. The reality of those opposite is that they brought in Work Choices in this country and the result was that on average women and low-paid earners lost about $115 per week from their wages and salaries. 


They bleat in this place about adverse impact on families. I would have more respect for what they had to say if they supported things that actually helped families. For example, we increased the childcare rebate from $4,354 per child to $7,500 and doubled the funding for child care. One of the first acts of the Howard coalition government when they came to power in 1996 was to rip a billion dollars out of the childcare sector in this country. In addition to that we are putting millions of dollars into child care to assist in increasing wages and conditions and making fairer each and every place—whether it is bush kids in my electorate or some other childcare facility in any other place in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane or in any regional part of this country—to make sure that people get a fair go when it comes to the workplaces of this country. 


With respect to wages and conditions we have provided $2.8 billion for the social and community sector to fund the equal remuneration order that took place with respect to Fair Work Australia. Those opposite did not support that. It was 150,000 low-paid workers—people who work in childcare centres; in domestic violence facilities, helping women in distress; people working in the tenancy advocacy services—who all got assistance. Of those 150,000 low-paid workers, 120,000 were women. So we are helping Australian families. If those opposite get on the Treasury benches, on average a family with a couple of kids going to school will lose about $15,000 because they will lose their Schoolkids Bonus. What I cannot understand about those opposite is that they supported an education tax refund. We brought the Schoolkids Bonus in to make it easier for families to not have to keep a list on the fridge of all the expenses for computers, uniforms et cetera. Those opposite opposed it and their policy is to rip it away.


Superannuation is a big difference between us and them. They want to impose a $500 tax on low-income earners. If you are earning up to $37,000 a year you will pay $500 more in tax every year under a coalition government. They oppose our increase to the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent over a number of years. They oppose it again and again because they have never believed in superannuation. The Leader of the Opposition at a press conference on 23 March last year said: 


We have always as a Coalition been against compulsory superannuation increases.


They are against families' financial security in retirement. By our superannuation reforms we are boosting by $500 billion the benefit to Australian families by 2037—a $500 billion increase in superannuation to help Australian families. That is government policy on this side helping Australian families, opposed by those opposite. Again and again they voted against superannuation assistance for Australian families. For a 30-year-old on average full-time wages the government's changes will put an additional $127,000 into their superannuation by the time they retire at 67 years of age. That is the difference.


When it comes to telecommunications there is also a big difference. The member for Wide Bay is in a regional seat in Queensland. I am in a regional seat in Queensland as well. What the Liberals and Nationals intend to do to regional Australia is to put them into the technological Neanderthal days. They will make sure that these people will be disadvantaged compared to people who live in Sydney and Melbourne. If you live in, say, Bulimba in Brisbane or Toorak or Vaucluse, you will get access to high-speed broadband and you will have to pay the $5,000 to connect the fibre to your home because they will leave it at the node and will make you pay for the connection to the premises. If you are living in the Lockyer Valley or the Brisbane Valley or Wide Bay region, you will have to pay. It is broadband for the rich and nothing for the poor. That is typical of those opposite when it comes to telecommunications.


It is not just that, it is other areas as well like education. They are opposed to the National Plan for School Improvement. In the last hour or so I had a phone call from the Queensland Times newspaper talking about the study in relation to schools in the Ipswich and West Moreton region and the fact that we were underfunded. I said to the journalist, Peter Foley: 'Listen, if they pass the National Plan for School Improvement and Campbell Newman signs up, we will be in a position where Queensland schools will get an average $2.2 million more.' Barry O'Farrell in New South Wales has had the wit and wisdom to do this—they will get an average $1.6 million more for schools in New South Wales. So Campbell Newman and the Leader of the Opposition in this place believe that a person's state of origin determines their educational outcome. That is exactly their position. 


As Peter Doyle, school principal at Springfield Lakes State School in my electorate, said in the Queensland Times recently, teachers are paying thousands of dollars to pay for the education needs in their classrooms. If the Queensland government sign up for the National Plan for School Improvement, schools in my electorate will benefit to the tune of about $184 million, making sure that their families are assisted, so that mums and dads do not have to put their hand in their pocket all the time. It means that schools like Bremer State High School get about $13.9 million more than the current funding for the next six years. Redbank Plains State High School, another big high school in the Ipswich and West Moreton region, would get $12.2 million more. Ipswich state highway would get $10.5 million more. It applies to electorate after electorate across this country, making an impact for families, helping them with their education needs. 


The member for Wide Bay talked about infrastructure and the like. He said that we were not doing Regional Development Australia projects around the country. He must be politically blind when it comes to that. I could point him to things in the Lockyer Valley, the Brisbane Valley, Ipswich and other parts of Queensland where Regional Development Australia funding has been rolled out for major community infrastructure, creating jobs and supporting Australian families. 


The member for Wide Bay was opposed to the biggest road infrastructure project we had in South-East Queensland in the last six years, the Ipswich Motorway upgrade, with 10,000 jobs being created and sustained. He voted against it and campaigned for three federal elections his opposition to it. He talks about helping Australian families, jobs creation, growth and economic development. Those opposite have been opposed to it again and again. And guess what? We have more than doubled the road and rail funding in Queensland in the last six years. We have done that in the first stage. We have put more money in road, rail and port infrastructure in Queensland than the coalition ever did in their 12 years in office—supporting jobs, growth, development; sustaining jobs during the global financial crisis, creating 960,000 jobs, when those opposite voted against it again and again.


They talk about the car industry and manufacturing, but they would take half a billion dollars out of the car industry, leaving 255,000 jobs in the car industry at risk in the southern parts of Australia. That is what they would do. They do not support jobs; they want to drive down wages. They do not support education reform; they disinvest in health. They take away doctors and health services in this country, making it harder for health services and costs to be met by Australian families. That is the legacy of those opposite. And that is why they should not be on the treasury bench.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (16:38):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. We have a crisis in this country. If you get out into your electorate and spend some time on the ground, which the previous speaker obviously does not, you will hear the tragedy of living in a country where the costs of doing business, the costs of trying to raise a family, the costs of trying to be educated have grown so high under Labor that, as I began by saying, we are now in a crisis in this country.


I never thought we would have sovereign risk in Australia. It was always our boast that, if you choose or chose to invest in this country, you could expect some stability in the tax regime or a lot of notice would be given if there were going to be changes to the costs of you doing business in this country, including the regulatory environment. But who could forget the shock of the mining sector when they discovered these new taxes—suddenly thrown into their midst without much notice at all and then negotiations with just a couple of the bigger operators. And these taxes have not even raised for the government the revenue they planned for. It is not just a case of the damage to our national and international reputation; so many of the mining companies are now thinking it looks pretty good in Brazil or in the African nations. 


Let me talk about the manufacturing sector in this country and the extraordinary costs of energy, including refrigerant gases. If you have the sorts of rises in costs that I am about to enumerate for you, you actually lose jobs. My electorate of Murray has been so hard hit. We have lost half of our dairy farmers as a consequence of the absolutely shocking Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which did not take a triple bottom line approach at all but which was a captured process, with the Greens demanding the biggest possible volume of water to be thrown down the Murray River—and to hell with those who produced food—using their water security. So we lost half of our dairy farmers through the process of water buyback.


On top of that, let me tell you about the price increases of refrigerant gas as a consequence of the so-called equivalent carbon tax. These are real figures from real bills, real accounts from my electorate, which I will seek to table at the end of my remarks. So often when we ask questions at question time of the Prime Minister in particular about these horrendous carbon tax increases, she says: 'No, that's not true. That's about state infrastructure or it's about some other nonsense going on with the companies themselves.' These are actually itemised accounts which give you the carbon tax as a line item and the cost.


I will begin with the refrigerant gases. The R-22 refrigerant gas cost $56 in May 2012, plus GST. It has now gone up to $160. That is a 285 per cent increase. By the way, refrigerant gases are used in the dairy industry to cool the milk after you have milked the cows. These gases are used in cool stores so that fruit does not deteriorate after it is picked. Refrigerant gases are used in shops and supermarkets. These are very commonly used products. R404A is another very commonly used refrigerant gas. In May, it cost $44. After October, it cost $230 per unit. That is a 522 per cent increase. The gas R134A, in May 2012, cost $36. After October, it cost $112. That is a 311 per cent increase in the cost of refrigerant gases which are, as I say, a critical part of food preservation, of manufacturing and of selling products in shops that have not spoiled.


What about the electricity costs that have gone up? Unfortunately, food processing, which used to be the highest employer in this country, is now being decimated with almost a race to export not just the food but the companies themselves to New Zealand and other countries—our competitors. These countries do not have the imposts and costs that we have. Let us look at the electricity bills of the Mulcahy Pastoral estate, which are the biggest dairy farm in my region and, in fact, one of the biggest dairy producers in Australia. They actually value-add to their milk to make it a product they can deliver straight to the customer. This is a one-month electricity account of theirs and they have many such accounts across the enterprise. In August 2012, the cost of electricity for this particular part of their business was $7,069.97. The itemised carbon charge was $1,142.48. That is a 17.77 per cent increase in their electricity bill. Bear in mind that the GST is charged on the sum of their electricity charge, plus the carbon tax. So, for them, that is a 17.77 per cent increase in cost. 


I have another bill—and, as I say, I will seek to table these with the itemised account—showing the carbon tax and a 20.06 per cent increase in their electricity charges. How can this pastoral company, this dairy farm, compete? How can it compete with New Zealand, which has a carbon tax equivalent charge of only 75c per tonne? How can we compete when our equivalent is $24.15 or 32 times higher than New Zealand's? And guess what? We compete head-on in the international export markets with their dairy products. How can our dairy producers compete with those costs around their necks? It is not fair. It means a loss of jobs in my part of the world. It means despair for farmers who have worked for generations to build up their herds and to build up the infrastructure on their properties. And what is killing them? Not drought, not pestilence and not plant disease. What is killing them is this Labor government's charges. That is disgusting when, of course, at the end of all of this we know that we not making one iota of difference to the greenhouse emissions around the planet. What a tragedy and what a travesty!


Let us look at child care. A previous speaker mentioned child care. If we do not have affordable child care in Australia, how does a mother return to work or how does a father participate in the workforce if he is sharing the parenting role with his wife. They are seeing their childcare costs rise by 30 or 40 per cent. We are told that with this new legislation, which was debated in the House this morning, we are going to see some $300 million go towards higher wages for some childcare workers, but not all of them. If less than half of the childcare workers are going to get a pay rise in some centres, obviously the rest of the childcare centres are going to have to put up their childcare fees in order to retain their staff. Who is going to pay? The mums and the dads—the single mums and the single dads who are trying to stay in the workforce. They simply cannot cope with higher childcare fees, yet this government brags: 'Hey, we've done a beautiful job in child care. We've brought in the fantastic new national standards accreditation scheme.' But the Australian Childcare Alliance are begging the government to delay the new regulations, which are supposed to begin on 1 January, because they say that, if no more money is provided by the government to parents and as well for more staff to be qualified, the whole system is going to collapse, particularly in the not-for-profit sector. They cannot go on with the sorts of fees and charges that they are trying to extract out of families through parents because the parents are often not paid enough to make it worth their while even to go back to work. I think this is disgusting.


The schools education minister, Peter Garrett, said no independent evidence was around 'to support claims of an impending shortage of early childhood education and care workers or a significant impact on childcare costs'. I suggest the minister had better get out more. He had better go and talk to some parents about the cost—often over $100 a day for child care.


What is blighting our productivity in this country? The fact is we have a very poor return to work rate for women after they have had their children. We have one of the lowest rates of women in the workforce in the developed world and yet we have some of the highest formally educated women of any country in the world. We have a shocking situation in Australia. Magnificent country that we are, we should be the envy of the world. In fact, we are the laughing stock of the world because we are taxing away, through the carbon tax and the carbon equivalent tax and the mining taxes, our natural competitive advantage. We are making our families fearful of the future and, in my area, we are killing an economy that was something to be envied by other parts of the world. It was the food bowl. As I speak there are bulldozers bulldozing hundreds of hectares of magnificent fruit trees because SPC Ardmona cannot compete any longer given their energy costs, their wages bill and the regulatory imposts that are now afflicting them. That is not fair. That is not honest. That is un-Australian. Bring on an election! (Time expired)

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-06-25,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (16:48):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance, put forward by the member for Wide Bay, about the adverse impact of government policies on the cost of living. My understanding of the geography is that the member for Wide Bay is actually an MP from Queensland, yet when he stood up and made his speech I thought that perhaps Wide Bay had moved or that maybe it should have been about Jervis Bay in the ACT or Shark Bay in WA or Port Phillip Bay in Victoria because he made no mention of the recent happenings in Queensland. The reality is that under the Liberal National Party government in Queensland and since the last election just 13 months ago families have been paying $1,000 more. Take electricity prices. My understanding is that the federal government does not own any power stations. I have not checked that exhaustively, but my understanding is we do not own any power stations. The Queensland government does own power stations and the other day the Queensland government foreshadowed a 22.6 per cent increase in electricity prices, starting in five days time. In fact, if you were an elderly person living alone, your electricity price cost would go up in five days by 27.9 per cent. So I was quite surprised that the member for Wide Bay—which I am pretty sure is in Queensland—who is a member of the Liberal and National parties coalition, made no mention, in a speech on the cost of living, of this hit to the budget.


My understanding of cost of living is pretty basic: it is about the roof over your head, the taxes you pay, your food and groceries, your electricity and heating, education costs, maybe your internet costs and health costs. So that is about it in terms of the cost of living. Let us unpack some of those things. Insurance was mentioned by the member for Menzies. I was horrified to see in the Queensland state budget that they are increasing the stamp duty on an insurance policy—a policy that actually has GST on it, so you have got a tax on a tax. So that is something that the Queensland government has introduced—but no mention of that by the member for Wide Bay. Let us have a look at the costs. The biggest cost for most households is their mortgage. Let us have a look at where interest rates were when John Howard exited stage left compared to today's. Are the interest rates higher than when John Howard left? No. In fact, most households are saving up to $100 per week—and I will say it again for the benefit of those members opposite who are from Queensland: a $100 per week saving. And it is great to see that people are paying off their mortgages.


Let us have a look at some of the other things. Obviously cost of living is one thing, but it is more important that you actually have a job. That is the best way to keep on top of your cost of living. There have been 960,000 jobs created since we came to power. Is unemployment sky high? Is there a budget emergency with sky-high unemployment like 11.9 per cent in Europe? No. It is 5.5 per cent. In fact, 10 years ago the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, said if you had an unemployment rate of 5.6 it would be a magnificent economic achievement. There is no acknowledgement of that. Let us also note that we have a AAA credit rating and our economy has grown from 15th to 12th biggest. We got through the global financial crisis.


Like anyone, if your economic circumstances change, you make a decision about your economic circumstances and say, 'Maybe we should borrow a bit of money to make sure we look after the household.' That is what a sensible economic manager does. What have those opposite done? Let us have a look. When the economic circumstances changed for the Leader of the Opposition, when he went from being a government minister to being a backbencher, what did he do? Did he do what he suggests and say debt is bad? I found this article by Simon Benson, who had dinner with the Leader of the Opposition the other night. He wrote an article saying:


OPPOSITION Leader Tony Abbott took out a new $710,000 mortgage on his family home shortly after going into Opposition, partly to help fund his family expenses after losing his ministerial salary.


But in what appears to be a breach of the parliamentary rules covering MPs' pecuniary interests, he failed to declare the loans to Parliament for almost two years.


The man who claimed in January 2008 that politicians don't get paid enough took out a new loan on his family home in April 2008, four months after losing the election and halving his salary.


   …   …   …


Mr Abbott has made no secret in the past that he had often found it challenging to make ends meet.


Great to think that you could—




Dr Stone:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not believe the details of a previous member's bank accounts and loans are relevant to this debate.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Murray will resume her seat. The member for Moreton has the call. It is the MPI. It is a far-ranging debate, but I would ask him to draw the link to the question before us.




Mr PERRETT:
  We are talking about cost of living and economic management. We are talking about a Leader of the Opposition who is, based on current polling, about to make significant decisions about the government. He said there is a budget emergency. When his budget circumstances changed, he borrowed, yet he condemns the government for having done exactly that. What he says and what he does are completely different. Obviously a sensible economic manager, when times are tough, borrows money.




Mr Robb:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We saw in question time the government get down into the gutter. Now they are getting into the gutter again.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein will resume his seat. That is an abuse of a point of order. I have just had a discussion with the member about the issue and was trying to accommodate the debate so we could get to the valedictories. I know that is not important to others, but it is to the member and her family with us. The member for Moreton has the call.




Mr PERRETT:
  Thank you. I know the member for Goldstein had been warned during question time, so I am surprised he—



The SPEAKER:  The member fore Moreton was also called to account.




Mr PERRETT:
  would object to this piece of public information. I am merely showing the difference between what people say and what they do. What people say goes to their character if they do not do it.


The reality is the Australian economy is in sound shape. We borrowed responsibly during a tough economic time. We protected jobs. We are talking about cost of living. As I said, a job is one of the most essential things for people to be able to manage cost of living. Education costs are another one. People are able to borrow money to pay off school fees. If they make a decision to borrow money to do that, that is up to them. I think it is appropriate that we give people money to pay for education costs, because education is a sound investment. It also makes sense to invest in educational and business infrastructure like the NBN.


However, we have a policy from those opposite—the fraudband plan—that will see people paying up to $5,000 to have internet connected to their home. If you are in a block of units, heaven help you, because in Queensland that means you have to get 75 per cent of the people in the unit to agree to have that connection. All you need is someone who is a bit of a Luddite, who thinks broadband is only about sending emails, and if they say no, that means you will not be able to get the NBN connected and will not get all those cost-of-living savings that come with the NBN such as being able to pay your bills from home rather than going to the bank or the post office to pay them, being able to study from home rather than going in to university and all the savings that come to small business when they connect to the NBN.


Let us look at some of the other cost-of-living pressures. CPI is well and truly under control. Health has bulk billing rates at 81.7 per cent. Under the Leader of the Opposition it was at 67 per cent when he was the health minister. I have already touched on taxes, but let us mention those three consecutive rounds of tax cuts taking one million Australians out of the tax system. Those people earning about $50,000 are paying $2,000 less in tax. Let us contrast that with the opposition's plan to hike up the GST, rip away the Schoolkids Bonus and hike superannuation by 15 per cent for low-paid people. We have seen what happens with the Costello stealth approach. You soften up people by talking about budget emergencies and then outsource decision making to the Smirk. We saw it in Queensland. They said, 'Oh, we've got a crisis.' You bring in Peter Costello and then you sell off assets and hike taxes. That is what would happen under those opposite, so do not talk about cost-of-living increases. You have no credibility whatsoever. (Time expired)

I want to talk to every person who is out in rural and regional Australia. You have a really simple choice to make at this election. If you vote for Labor, you will be voting for a 7c-a-litre increase in heavy diesel fuel. Every single thing that you eat, drink or use is delivered on the back of a truck in this country, and every one of those is going to cost you more courtesy of the Labor government. So be really clear when you have your vote on 14 September. Do not worry about the spin—



The SPEAKER:  I am actually very clear about how I am voting on 14 September. The use of the word 'you' is inappropriate, I remind the member for Forrest. I get to vote for myself. The member for Forrest has the call.




Ms MARINO:
  Thank you, Speaker. I just wanted to say to every person from a rural and regional electorate and even those in cities, virtually everything that you consume or use comes on the back of a truck. As of next year, 7c a litre is going to be added to the price of diesel for everything that you use. So we are going to see a disproportionate impact on rural and regional Australia—and that is, as we know, almost a calculated attack on rural and regional Australia. We know the distances that are involved in delivering food and goods around Australia. All the trucks you see on the road will have to add an extra 7c a litre to everything they deliver to your town, to your community and to your business. That is the extra cost that you will get if you vote Labor in September—sorry, if people in the areas vote Labor, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  I apologise to the member for Forrest, but I thank her for her assistance in this very important matter. Order! The time allotted for this discussion has now expired.

These general principles have been adopted by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings and are being tabled in both chambers pursuant to the requirement to the parliamentary broadcasting act. The general principles set out in this report determine that the allocation of broadcast between the two chambers should be approximately equal, and that question time in the chamber not being broadcast live should be re-broadcast later that day. These general principles are essentially the same as those currently enforced and detailed in the back of the standing orders but have been written in a more contemporary style.


To come into force the general principles must be adopted by both chambers. I anticipate a motion to that end in the near future as part of a broader redrafting of the resolutions concerning the broadcasting of proceedings. The general principles are compiled by standing determinations which provide more detailed advice to the ABC for the radio broadcast.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (18:35):  I rise to speak on the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. In so doing I would like to particularly draw attention to three aspects of this bill. Firstly, I would like to raise in this House what it is that the bill intends to do and the associated consequences. Secondly, I will talk about why I believe this bill is being introduced, which I think is to appease the unions, and why it is that the government should govern for all Australians and not just a select few in the union movement. Finally, I will talk about why it is so important that we have affordable and accessible child care, not only as a social imperative but an economic imperative as well.


This legislation seeks to establish a $300 million fund to provide wage increases to around 30 to 40 per cent of the long day care workforce over two years. However, in order to qualify centres will need to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement with staff meeting eligibility criteria. Given the limited pool of funds, it will be on a first in, best dressed basis, and after the two years workers will revert to their previous wage.


I want to make it abundantly clear the coalition understands the need to recognise the importance of those who work in the childcare sector. However, the answer to looking at wages of those in the childcare sector is not to introduce bad legislation that will only make the situation worse, especially in the long run. We, on this side of the House, have very serious concerns about this bill. Our concerns stem from a number of reasons. First of all, the government already has a mechanism for determining wage increases. It is called the Fair Work Commission. This legislation brought before the House this evening seeks to circumvent this process and gives the government the power to appoint whatever they believe is the appropriate wage claim. I ask: what is the point of having an industrial relations policy and the Fair Work Commission only to ignore the process and for the government to take matters into their own hands?


This process of the government simply making a determination lacks transparency and in truth demonstrates that there was no process at all. We also have serious concerns about the requirements that must be met in order to gain access to this special fund. Centres will need to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement with staff and meet eligibility criteria. Clearly this is an overt attempt to increase union membership and has nothing whatsoever to do with their wages or the sustainability or the viability of the industry. As a result of these tactics, we have heard some very concerning comments. There have been reports that centre management are being told that 60 per cent of their workforce must join the union in order for them to receive the pay rise. The Australian Childcare Alliance submission to the House of Representatives standing committee includes a statutory declaration to this effect. This is quite wrong.


There are also reports that some workers are being told that if they do not sign up to the union, then their colleagues will not receive a pay rise. These are bullying tactics at their best. Upon signing up to the union, at more than $500 a year in membership fees, they are then being falsely led to believe that this will guarantee them a pay rise, which is simply not the case. We have seen, through these tactics, a change in union membership in this industry from what was only 10 per cent of the industry to now more than 25 per cent as a direct result of this bill. This has clearly been the motive of the United Voice union, previously the LHMU.


We are also concerned that only childcare educators in long day care centres will be eligible for this pay increase. This is despite the fact we know their roles are very similar to those at family day care, occasional care and budget based care and all of these are excluded from the fund that this government seeks to legislate. Unlike the Labor Party, we on this side of the chamber recognise that there are inherent dangers involved in picking specific winners, especially within a single industry, and the very severe and distorting effects that this has on the remaining players in the market. 


Let me go to why the bill is being introduced. Make no mistake that this, along with other pieces of legislation that have passed already in this place—including those that relate to the clothing, textile and footwear industry; the trucking legislation; the reregulation of ports; the legislation that is still before this place for the contrived rorting of the 457 visa systems and the dismantling of the ABCC—are union driven pieces of legislation designed to increase their power and their influence in the Australian workplace and in Australian society. We know that the government are beholden to their union masters. It was this week three years ago that the faceless men of the union movement took down one Prime Minister and installed another. I think they can be quite satisfied in their decision, given the legislation that I have just alluded to. 


It was the United Voice Union that orchestrated the Big Steps campaign. It was through this campaign that the union warned that they will not stop until every educator receives a change in their pay arrangements, irrespective of the $300 million fund already proposed and without any consideration as to the price increases and what effect this will have on the affordability or long-term sustainability of the industry. But I suppose we can expect that because this has often been the attitude taken that, no matter what the impact, it is simply all about the union, even if that means that for the workers affected there may be no job in the future. United Voice have run a very false and misleading campaign. In one of their propaganda pieces of material they have stated under the heading, 'How does my centre qualify' to: 


1. Join United Voice;


2. United Voice a negotiates new EBA;


3. Owner/Operator signs agreement with government; 


4. Get raise.


This misinformation is continued despite the department writing to the secretary of United Voice back on 11 April to indicate that union membership is not a prerequisite. Despite all of these demands, the union has never made a wage claim to the Fair Work Commission, the appropriate body to handle these cases. Instead they have gone direct to government to ask for the funds without any rationale or justification. That is simply an indication of how this Labor government operates. It operates to help its union mates who, in turn, help fund their campaign and help work on their campaign. Is it any wonder when we consider that this union has donated more than $7 million to the Labor Party over successive elections—quite a significant amount, I think most people would agree. This is yet another example of how the unions think that they are above the law and normal due process and think they can circumvent these due processes and operate in their own environment.


I come to my final point, why it is so important to have affordable and accessible child care. In the time remaining to me I want to talk about why it is that child care in all its forms needs to be flexible, accessible and affordable to cater to the needs of those that require its service. In Australia it is clear that we have a participation issue. Only 76 per cent of women aged 25 to 54 are in paid work compared with over 80 per cent in other developed economies such as Canada and Germany. One of the most effective ways that we can lift the participation rate is to encourage women back into the workforce after childbirth if that is indeed what they want. Clearly the coalition's paid parental leave scheme is just one mechanism to assist with this. Another way is to ensure that individual families can access child care that caters to their needs. 


In this modern economy, where women can work in many and varied environments, one size does not fit all and we know that affordability is one of the key aspects to whether or not the women and families in this country can access child care. That is why I am concerned about the changes the government has made to the childcare system, including the National Quality Framework and universal access. These regulatory changes, while potentially good in intent, have not been thought through, like so much of the government's actions. At the time we were promised by the minister that the changes would only result in an increase in costs of around 57c per week, yet the reality is that costs have gone up by more than $100 per week. I recently met with a number of childcare providers and local councils to talk to them about the impact of these additional regulations on the services that they themselves provide and the impact of maintaining current levels of staffing. They have told me that it has a very direct impact as to the cost of services and one council told me that the impact of upgrading a number of their capital structures in order to comply with the new regulations was more than $1.5 million. Who will ultimately pay for that? I think the answer is clear: it will be the parents who choose to send their child to that childcare centre.


In conclusion, we on this side of the House have serious concerns about this legislation. That is why we oppose it. We also have grave concerns about the direction of this government as a whole and the direction they have taken when it comes to child care. We, should we have the privilege of forming government after 14 September, have been upfront with the Australian people that we will work hard to make sure that we meet their childcare needs and have said that we will have a Productivity Commission inquiry into how we can make the childcare sector more affordable and more accessible to all who require the services. Unlike this government, when we look at an issue we do not simply ask the question, how can we help our union mates? We ask how can we help all Australians? How can we be a responsible government, a government that governs for all and will restore hope, reward and opportunity?

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (18:50):  I rise to speak on the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. I find the comments by the minister in his introductory speech balanced against the actual effect of this bill to be an absolute farce and at odds with each other. This is a bill that seeks to provide $300 million over two years: $135 million in the first year and $165 million in the second year. It is about lifting wages for the workers in the childcare industry, but $300 million will not provide that increase for all workers in the childcare industry. I would have thought the one thing coming from a Labor Party driven by the unions, owned by the unions, would have been an equality for all workers—the same people doing the same job in the same environment getting paid the same amount of money. Isn't that what the union movement is supposed to be all about? But here we have a minister who is introducing a special fund for the benefit of a select few. 


This was brought to my attention by one of my electorate's childcare directors, and I will not name her for a few reasons. She had real concerns. She came to see me with some of her workers. One of their concerns was that they were told by the union movement that to access this fund the workers in that centre needed to join the union movement. In fact, they needed seven workers to join the union before they could be eligible for this program. And that is a lie in itself because you do not need to be a member of the union to apply for this grant. However, they needed to sign up to the enterprise bargaining agreement to access this fund.


It is abundantly clear that this funding will provide a wage increase for only 30 to 40 per cent of the workers in long day care and only over two years. So here is the predicament that my long day childcare centre owner has. She has put it to her workers and they have decided: 'We might as well, so, yes, we have to join the union and we'll pay $500 a year each for the pleasure of joining the union. We'll enter into this enterprise bargaining agreement, we'll put our name down for this fund and if we get the funds for two years, what happens at the end of the two years?' Guess what? The fund goes, but how easy will it be to reduce the wages by that amount? That ain't going to happen, so parents are going to get slugged for an increase in childcare costs. And there is no guarantee on the funding coming through to that centre, so if the workers enter into the enterprise bargaining agreement and do not get the funding the costs of child care will have to go up from 1 July. How smart is that?


People in the industry, who actually understand the childcare industry and who interact with parents on a daily basis, want stability and affordable child care. And one thing that really disappoints and annoys those people is that this program seeks to drive division in the industry—division because some workers will get compensatoryfunding, others will not; division because this only applies to those workers in long day care, not those in preschools or in other forms of childcare provision.


One thing that the coalition did, and did well, was bring all of the workers involved in the childcare industry together. This bill is a farce. Do I think that childcare workers are worth more money? Absolutely. I am married to a person employed in the childcare industry and I see what they go through on a daily basis. I see the care and love that they provide to children who are not their own but who are put into their care. They are fantastic people and they work incredibly hard. I think this legislation is dangling a carrot at the end of a stick, which will only to be snatched away from them after two years—after they have made that commitment to pay $500 a year in union membership; after their employers have been locked into an EBA—and it will drive up the costs of child care.


Some queries came in from centre operators, particularly not-for-profit centre operators, in my electorate. One read:


The government has pledged funding for some educators for two years. Conditions apply such as signed workplace agreements. We're a small community centre in a very needy area.


Another one said:


Pay increases for some childcare workers and educators have already been contracted. The New South Wales branch of the union, Big Step, said only educators that signed the contracts would be getting the increases. This makes us worried. We're a small centre in—


a certain area—


Not many of us out here look after the real interests of the children. Thank you for reading my email.


The final one that came through read:


The Federal government funding pledge for some childcare workers have told and have read we need to sign contracts, work agreements for funding for two years only. Can you please spare the time to help our little community centre with only 39 children—cannot come up with this funding like the commercially owned. Thank you. I don't know what to do.


I met with them in my office. Their paramount concern was for the future of their workers and the care being provided to the children under their arrangements. If you have a condition where one centre is paying more, you are going to see a drain from one centre to another. What will happen at the end of the two years? Deputy Speaker, I am sure in your position and in my position as local members, if we got a pay increase for two years—if we signed up to an agreement and we entered into that as part of our workplace agreement—and then after two years that funding was pulled, are we going to happily sit back and say: 'That's great. It was great that it was there for two years and now, all of a sudden, we're expected to take a pay cut?' We know that will not happen. The cost of child care under this government will go up. That is an undisputed fact. For some parents it will go up immediately; for others, where it is being subsidised, the cost will go up in two years.


There is no doubt that childcare workers are some of the lowest paid people in this country and they deserve more. I found the second paragraph of the introductory speech by the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, on 30 May, when this bill was introduced, rather offensive. He said:


Core to our values is giving every child an opportunity to succeed …


That is somewhat hypocritical because, if you are providing different funding for different child care, it means you will get different outcomes. So that is not giving every child an equal opportunity. Further, he said:


At the heart of this bill is this government's commitment to quality early childhood education, a commitment to early childhood education that is accessible and affordable and a commitment to having a highly qualified early childhood workforce.


That sounds wonderful, an absolute dream and something that should be achieved. But how do you achieve that if you are only providing a limited amount of money to cover a small percentage of the workforce for only two years? It cannot be done. So it is built on a false premise.


Finally, in the same speech, under the title 'Affordability and Accessibility', he said,


This government has been working hard to ensure that quality early childhood education and care remains affordable and accessible for all Australian families.


He kept repeating himself. This legislation is not sustainable by any stretch of the imagination. Further, in his speech, when he got into the targeted area of this Early Years Quality Fund, he said:


The fund, which will operate for two years, will enable grants to be paid services to supplement wage increases of all educators and staff assisting in the provision of quality early childhood education and care.


He used the word 'all' there. The fund does not cover all providers. So I am very disappointed but, in particular, people in my constituency are very disappointed. The people who work hard in a very low pay environment committed to the provision of quality child care are disappointed that, as they see it, they are being driven to join a union movement against their will to be able to access funds. What about freedom of choice in this country? It does not seem to exist.


What this bill is about is the government spending $300 million of taxpayers' funds to do nothing more than build union membership, under the Big Steps campaign, to give themselves sustainability and increased numbers in the trade union movement. So I oppose this bill. I want people to have higher wages—absolutely—but I want them based on productivity and affordability, and if the government is going to shell out taxpayers' funds they should be shelled out for all of the workers providing the same service, not for a select few—a select few that have been forced to join a union movement against their will. That is why this government and this bill need to be condemned.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (19:01):  I would like to commend the member for Paterson and the member for Higgins for their speeches because I think they have summed up exactly what this bill, the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013, is all about. Sadly, it is this government giving another sop to the union movement. It is remarkable that we are debating it on this day, this third anniversary of Julia Gillard becoming the Prime Minister of our great nation, because that event was all about the union movement regaining control of the Labor Party—and, boy, are we seeing the Prime Minister repay the unions' faith in her in spades and that is what this bill is all about.


We have seen that with another bill we have been debating in this chamber in the last two weeks, the bill about 457 visas with the union movement looking for the government to crack down on the so-called rorting there—a union inspired campaign which the government decided to get behind. There is quite an irony as to that bill because it seems it is the media communications guru in the Prime Minister's office, on a 457 visa himself, who thought: 'Oh, there's a great convergence here. We've got the 457 visa issue which the unions want us to push and we can use that to try and disguise the issues that we have with our borders.' So they brought those two issues together in that bill, and now we are also seeing it here, because United Voice have run a very strong campaign to get action in this area. But it is not to get action on behalf of all childcare workers and it is not to get action to see wages rise across the sector in a fair way. It is a call to arms by United Voice to get the Gillard government to act on behalf of them. That is what is so shameful about this piece of legislation because, as the member for Paterson identified, what it does is divide worker against worker and it divides various segments of the childcare sector against each other. What we on this side cannot understand about this Prime Minister is why she continually wants to divide Australian against Australian. Why is it? Leadership is not about division; leadership is about uniting. Yet this Prime Minister seems hell-bent on just making one Australian be pitted against another Australian be pitted against another Australian. It is not the way to govern a nation.


Let us go to the specifics of the bill. What is it about? It is about providing a commitment of $300 million over two years to various members of this sector—and I say various members of this sector, not all. How do you see whether you can qualify for some of this $300 million? The government have set up a seven-member panel which has responsibility for deciding the criteria that centres will need to meet in order to be eligible for the funding. How have they gone about establishing who should be on that committee? Have we got a wide range of voices? Have we made sure that we have got the sector as a whole well represented on that seven-member panel? No, we have not. But what have we made sure of? Who have we made sure are represented on that seven-member panel? It should come as no surprise. United Voice, of course, are on that panel. But do we have private sector engagement on that panel? No, of course not. Heaven forbid that we could have broad representation on it, but, my word, have we insisted that United Voice get one seat? Yes, we have.


What then are the guidelines that are going to lead how this funding is allocated? They are still yet to be determined, meaning we are unable to consider whether they are even fair and reasonable. So here we are debating this legislation, which is going to dish out $300 million over two years, and we have a seven-member panel set up—and we know that United Voice are on that—but what are the criteria? No criteria! But we have seen, through United Voice's campaign—and can I say it is a fairly deceitful campaign—the type of guidelines that they would like to see. They would like to make sure that the union is front and centre when it comes to allocating these funds. They would like to see, whether a centre has an EBA or not, the level of union membership that a centre has within its workforce. That is the key criterion that they would like to see. We will wait and see whether or not the government actually puts that in the criteria, but there is no doubt that, by giving United Voice representation on that seven-member panel, those are the things they will want to bring to the table.


And what does it mean for the other types of child care? What does it mean, for instance, for family day care? What does it mean for occasional care? What does it mean for budget based care? They are excluded entirely from this funding. I have already had an approach from an occasional care provider in my electorate in Warrnambool. They are incredibly fearful of what this means for their ongoing viability. It is worth mentioning because occasional care is sometimes frowned upon by the other side for being there for those who can afford it. I tell you: when you go and sit down and talk to the parents, grandparents or carers who use occasional care, it is often the most needy and vulnerable who use it, yet, through what the government is doing here, it is going to make it harder for them to continue to employ people. It is going to threaten the ongoing viability of this sector. That means that the poor and the needy who use occasional care—those parents, grandparents and carers—are going to be left with little alternative. Often it is the single parents who have to use it the most, yet, through this piece of legislation, the government is going to make it harder for those occasional care providers to operate. I ask anyone on the other side, if they query this, to come down to Warrnambool. I would love to take them to the occasional care centre there and to get them to talk to the parents, grandparents and carers so that they can hear firsthand what this piece of legislation has the potential to do.


So there are serious problems with this bill. They come on the back of other pieces of legislation which have been introduced to this House and which have also caused considerable concern to the sector. I will say about these two other initiatives the government has put in—the national quality framework and the universal access—that they at least have the right intent, whereas this bill before us today does not have the right intent. It has been singly about making sure that United Voice has got the policies that they were seeking, in many ways, it is worth reminding the House, rewarding them for their support for the Labor government. Let us not forget that, as the member for Higgins put on the record, $7 million has been donated over the last two election campaigns by United Voice to the Labor Party. That is what is driving this piece of legislation.


What drove the national quality framework and universal access was good intent, and we on this side recognise that. Of course, the implementation has, sadly, been lacking and has caused a lot of concern within the sector. So why, having caused that concern and still trying to bed down the disruption which has been caused by the national quality framework, including the increased amount of staff necessary to implement the national quality framework—and, of course, with universal access there are the difficulties in getting the staff needed to implement it—has the government come and sought to divide the sector by presenting this piece of legislation, which we know and the government has admitted cannot cover the whole workforce in the childcare sector? As a matter of fact, it is expected that it will only cover between 30 and 40 per cent. So you bring in two pieces of legislation, which caused concern through their poor implementation, and then you bring in this piece of legislation, which will divide the industry. It will only cover 30 to 40 per cent of the workforce. As I have said before, that is going to pit centre against centre, but it is also going to pit against each other the types of child care provided.


So what does the coalition want to offer in this space? In the first instance, it wants to offer good governance. It wants to say to United Voice: 'Do this properly. Don't go to the government and say you want a cosy deal. Use the system. Put in an application through the proper channels to get a pay rise for the childcare sector workforce as a whole. Let's work so that the whole sector can get the type of remuneration that the sector deserves and that we on this side recognise that it deserves. Don't go and do a cosy deal which shows that, once again, it is the union movement that has the strings to pull to get this Prime Minister in particular to do what it wants done. Use the proper process.'


What else do we want to do? We want to make sure child care is affordable and accessible for all, whether it be in metropolitan areas or in regional and rural areas. We will embark on that process. We will look at ways to make sure everyone in the sector can make sure they continue to provide services which are affordable and accessible. It will not just be long day care centres; it will also be family day care, occasional care, budget based care and others excluded entirely despite their roles being very similar.


There is one thing that the Leader of the Opposition has made clear—that is, we want to get away from this politics of division. We want to get away from this politics of representing part of the community and then pitting that part of the community against another part of the community. We want to get back to where the national interest comes first, where the community comes first and where all Australians come first—not a government which seems hell-bent and a Prime Minister who seems hell-bent on making sure that the only way government occurs is by dividing the nation.


On this side, we are opposed to this bill. We can see it transparently for all it is—that is, repaying United Voice for everything they have done in getting rid of a Prime Minister three years ago and putting in a new Prime Minister to be at the beck and call of the union movement. It is a shameless piece of legislation. It covers only 30 to 40 per cent of the workforce. It covers only one sector of child care. It is not about improving the sector as a whole; it is about rewarding the union movement and that is why we oppose it.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2013-06-25,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (19:16):  When they want to oppose something, what do they default to? Good old union bashing is what we are seeing from the other side. It is extraordinary. They are straight into it. They talk about the national interest. The national interest is educating the future of this nation and caring for the welfare of the future of this nation which is children, and ensuring that they get a quality education. Members will be aware of my passion for education. In my first speech in parliament, I spoke about how I was proof of the transformative powers of education and it is a sentiment I have repeated again and again. Through education, I escaped the cycle of disadvantage. There are thousands and thousands more like me.


Often when I speak of education, I focus on primary schools, high schools or even universities. These are the years of education we remember, so they feel the most formative to us. However, countless studies, countless pieces of research and countless experts tell us that it is the early years of education that make the biggest difference—and the Jesuits tell us that as well. There is a compelling body of evidence showing that 90 per cent of a child's brain development happens in these critical early years. These are the formative years. These are the years we need to get right if we are to give our children all the opportunities they deserve.


I am very pleased, therefore, to be talking tonight about the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013, which seeks to improve quality outcomes for children in early childhood education and care services by enhancing the professionalism of the sector and improving the attraction and retention of a skilled and professional workforce. I am very proud of this Labor government's record of achievement in early childhood education and care. This government have been working hard to ensure that quality early childhood education and care remains affordable and accessible for all Australian families in the national interest. 


We are investing a record $25 billion over the next four years in early childhood education and care, of which $22.1 billion will be in direct childcare assistance to parents. We have also delivered nearly $970 million between 2008 and 2013 to provide all Australian children in the year before they start primary school with access to a quality preschool education, delivered by a quality, qualified early childhood teacher.


These investments are already paying off. Recent data shows that because of this investment preschool enrolments have increased. In 2012, 266 four- and five-year-old children were enrolled in a program in the year before full-time school. This was 60,000 more children enrolled in 2012 than in 2008. So we have seen a dramatic increase in preschool enrolments. 


In this year's budget, the government announced a further $666 million to extend the universal access commitment to quality early childhood education in the year before school to the end of 2014. The Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth has also announced that this year the early childhood education and care Closing the Gap target will be met—a significant development. In 2008, the Labor government pledged to deliver access to early childhood education to all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities within five years, and we have achieved that. These are significant achievements for this sector and I am particularly proud to be part of a government that has delivered them.


The bill we are debating tonight supports a very particular aspect of early years education—that is, supporting the employment retention and better pay of more highly qualified staff. Specifically, this bill establishes a special account to administer the Early Years Quality Fund. The fund will provide $300 million over two years to assist long day care services to offset the costs of employing higher qualified staff, who are required as part of the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care from 1 January next year. Funding will be provided directly to eligible services to improve quality outcomes for children by supplementing wage increases of $3 per hour for cert III qualified educators. There will be proportionately higher wage increases for diploma and degree qualified educators.


Australian and international research shows that having educators with higher qualifications is closely associated with improved outcomes for children. More highly qualified staff have a better understanding of early childhood development and this results in better and more targeted education and care for our children to help them learn and develop. 


Funding for wage increases will be assessed and approved based on a defined set of criteria and these are: a demonstrated commitment at the service to quality outcomes for children under the National Quality Framework, including a detailed plan to meet NQF qualification requirements; an agreement to use grant funds exclusively for wage increases, including detailed acquittal of funds to improve transparency; a commitment to affordability for families through fee restraint limited to actual operating cost increases, and no increases as a result of wages arising from the operation of the fund; increased fee transparency requirements for services, including explaining to parents the level of financial assistance provided by the government through childcare benefit and childcare rebates; meeting specific reporting requirements for the government's online childcare portal MyChild; and wage increases being included in an enterprise bargaining agreement. 


In my electorate of Canberra I have visited many early childhood centres and met wonderful staff, gorgeous kids and wonderful parents. I know that the staff in these centres—who are mostly women because early childhood workers are still predominantly women—are incredibly committed to the children they care for. Earlier this year I spent one morning and one afternoon at a childcare centre at Isaacs in my electorate, walking in the shoes of a childcare worker as part of the Big Steps campaign. In the morning, I spent time with babies, changed nappies and cleaned lots of little bottoms, entertained these children, put them to bed, and through each half-day I spent a lot of time with kids in every age group. It was an absolutely delightful experience—but absolutely exhausting.


Looking after all these children on such a scale with all their different needs, and particularly with little ones going down at different times—so putting them down and getting the others up at the same time; taking them outside to play; keeping an eye on them and keeping them entertained, because at that stage you really do need to spend a lot of time entertaining them; as well as having them en masse trying to keep them all happy—it was exhausting on both of those half-days. I told the staff that I saluted them. I take my hat off to them for the work they do, caring for these children but also keeping them stimulated and educated. 


I particularly admired the real rigour around the whole process for the day. If the children were playing with a toy, then the educator would observe what they were doing and repeat the experience of what they learned from playing with that toy. Or, if they were playing with other little children, then the educator would assess what the child was learning from that experience—the use of words, colours, sharing activity and team-building activity. There was not just a lot of play there but also a lot of education happening. There was a lot of assessment going on about the education of these children.


What particularly impressed me was that the educators could pick up on those kids who were quite often a bit shy—those who were not as socially advanced as the others in the same peer group or the same age group. They could pick up on that child and spend some time with them trying to encourage them to interact more closely with their peers or just spend some one-on-one time trying to draw out their strengths and the specific qualities of these children. So it was not just a case of an en masse approach to these small children. They were there as educators but they were also doing assessments throughout the time that I was with them, and throughout their day, on the advances that each child was making, and also attempting to fill those gaps, which I think was particularly important. Again, they were applying a rigour to it in doing an assessment in writing of that child. I understand that assessment goes into a system so that you can see the development of the child over the period of that child is in child care.


As I said, what would appear to be just playing with building blocks, looking at colours and reading books actually had this underpinning of learning and education throughout the day. I was incredibly impressed and absolutely exhausted after those two half-days.


This bill acknowledges the commitment of those workers by securing higher wages in recognition of their professionalism and qualifications. It is important to note that the establishment of this fund is intended only as a first step in a process that will, in time, see an overhaul of the remuneration of the entire early childhood workforce. This government has also announced the establishment of a pay equity unit in the Fair Work Commission. The primary role of the unit will be to assist the Fair Work Commission with data and research collection and specialist pay equity information. Of particular importance, it will assist in a long-term overhaul of pay equity in feminised workforces. The pay inequity at the moment not only causes day-to-day pay inequity but also means that women are going into superannuation with less money. They get less superannuation and so go into retirement with less money. I have said many a time in this House that I have had these women presenting at my electorate office every week.


It is also important to note that these wage increases are designed not to put upward pressure on fees. In fact, one of the conditions of receiving this funding is that there are no fee increases as a result of the wage increase that will occur from the fund. We know that parents and carers cannot afford to pay higher fees. That is why this government is taking action to increase wages while ensuring that fees do not increase. According to research by United Voice, childcare fees have risen on average by 11.2 per cent in the last 12 months—from $63.21 to $70.29 per day. Both the early childhood sector and families are under pressure in this regard and this bill has a requirement to contain childcare fee increases, meaning staff will get an increase in wages without fees going up.


This Early Years Quality Fund builds on steps this government has already taken to ensure we have a better qualified, better paid workforce in the early childhood sector. These initiatives include: the TAFE fee waiver that enables students to obtain a diploma or an advanced diploma in children's services without paying fees; the recognition of prior learning initiative, which provides grants of up to $3,500 to enable educators to have the skills they have acquired through working in the sector recognised and enables them to obtain or upgrade their qualifications; the HECS-HELP initiative, which provides funding to reduce the Higher Education Loans Program debts of early childhood education teachers who work in areas of high need such as remote areas of Australia; and the Inclusion and Professional Support Program, through which the educators and services receive professional development and support to enhance the provision of quality education and care services.


As I have mentioned, the early childhood workforce is a feminised workforce—it is predominantly women. As is too often the case in workforces dominated by women, early childcare workers are amongst the lowest paid skilled workers in this country. Workers have been fighting long and hard to receive professional wages in the early childhood sector. In particular, as I mentioned over the past year or so, the Big Steps campaign has united workers, parents, families and employers to support wage increases for early childhood educators. I have spoken to these parents in the afternoons. I have been there in these childhood centres talking to the staff and meeting the kids. I have spoken to the parents and they have all pushed for an increase in wages for the workers, the educators who are educating their children.


To the hundreds of people who contacted me in my electorate of Canberra, I say to them: firstly, thank you for sharing your concerns with me on this important issue and, secondly, we listened. This government is taking action. Higher wages are deserved by these skilled and qualified workers. Higher wages will help keep workers in the sector and higher wages will help attract more and better staff. As we know, we have a chronic lack of qualified staff in this sector at the moment, which is dramatically affecting childcare availability. This fund puts us on track to reform wages in this sector and it puts us on track well into the future. Qualified and skilled early childhood workers deserve this bill. Most importantly, our kids, our future and our nation deserve this bill. I commend it to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (19:31):  I rise to speak on the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. Before I get to the specifics of the bill I would like to say what a wonderful job that the many childcare centres in the electorate of Hughes actually do. As a member, I have had the great pleasure to visit many of these childcare centres and participate in the activities with the staff: reading books to the kids, playing with them and enjoying their ice-creams at lunchtime. It was a truly wonderful experience. There is no doubt that we would like to see the staff at these centres earn more money, like we would many employees right across the economy.


However, the childcare centres I have been to say their biggest problem is with government regulation and red tape putting additional cost on those childcare centres. In fact, over the last few years under this government we have seen a 26 per cent increase in the cost in childcare in this nation, mainly because of the red tape this government has put in. When those costs increase and the costs to a childcare operator increase because of the red tape, that simply takes away their ability to pay their staff more wages. So the ability to pay the staff more wages, to get higher wages in the childcare centre, has been taken away by a lot of the red tape and new regulations we have seen this government introduce.


The legislation actually seeks to establish a $300 million fund to provide wage increases, which are estimated to go to only 30 or 40 per cent of long day care workers and only over two years. Also, centres will need to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement with staff and meet the eligible criteria. Given this limited pool of funds, they will be allocated on a first-in basis and then after two years the workers will simply revert to their previous wage. 


The coalition oppose this bill, regrettably. We would like to see childcare workers earn more money, take home more pay, but there are several reasons for opposing this bill. The first reason is this is $300 million worth of spending this government simply does not have. This is simply more spending that will be added to our nation's debt. In the first four years of this government we have seen the largest deficits in our nation's history, a cumulative $172 billion. Then we had promise after promise after promise of this year the budget being returned to surplus. Of course, we know that that $1 billion surplus is now, at last estimate, a $19.8 billion deficit. This $300 million for childcare workers simply goes onto that deficit. It is more money that we have to borrow. Ultimately, it is money that has to be paid back. In fact, it is actually the children at these childcare centres who will be burdened with this debt and who will be paying off this debt when they eventually get through school and get through university and start to earn dollars. Their taxes will be higher because of this government. 


The other reason the coalition oppose this bill is that we looked at what industry has said. The Australian Industry Group, a group that represents 440,000 businesses and employs over 2.4 million people, said of this legislation:


… Ai Group expresses a strong view on the proposal to make funding conditional upon day care centres having an enterprise agreement. This proposal is unfair and inappropriate.


How can this government sit here and want to pass this legislation through the parliament when we have the Australian Industry Group saying categorically that this proposal is unfair and inappropriate? That alone is reason not to pass this legislation. 


It will set two types of childcare centres: those that are unionised and those that are not unionised. The real concern is this funding is actually over only two years. The question is: what happens when those two years are up and this funding runs out? We are going to see a massive distortion in the childcare market with staff going from one centre to another hoping to get their hands on some of this money, which in two years is going to run out.


Another real concern is what has been told to some of the staff in the childcare industry, which makes it very clear that this money is more a taxpayer funded union recruitment drive. Workers have been told that if they do not sign up to the union they will not get a pay rise. We have seen employees signing up and then having to pay the union fees. They are committing to pay more than $500 a year to the union to sign up to get their hands on this taxpayer money, which the government does not have and is borrowing. We have seen some centres' managers being told that 60 per cent of their workforce must join the union in order for them to receive the pay rise. We have also seen in the Australian Childcare Alliance's submission to the House of Reps standing committee a statutory declaration to this effect. This is not something that the coalition is saying; this is something that the Australian Childcare Alliance has put in a statutory declaration to the committee. 


Of course, we have seen a great deal of union propaganda about this, again a recruitment drive. We have seen under the heading 'How does my centre qualify?' the statement: '(1) join your union United Voice; (2) United Voice negotiates a new EBA; (3) the owner-operator signs the agreement with the government; (4) get a raise.' Of course, it does not say that you must pay the union fees along the way. It does not say that this money is borrowed money. And it does not say this money will run out after two years. This is typical of this government: bad legislation done to support their mates in the union rather than doing what is in the best interests, the long-term interests, of the nation. 


The Australian Industry Group have also put forward 10 separate points about their objections to this legislation. I would like to go through each one of those. The first is that this requirement will simply remove the ability of a childcare centre to freely choose whether an enterprise agreement suits its business. We should be giving the childcare centres the ability to choose which way they want to operate, but this forces them down the track of going into an enterprise agreement. The second reason given is that a childcare centre could feel coerced to make an enterprise agreement, regardless of whether the business is happy with its pay-setting arrangements. Again, it reduces the individual ability of a childcare centre to determine what is best. The third reason given is that employees of a childcare centre could feel coerced to make enterprise agreements, regardless of whether the majority of employees of that centre support the negotiation of a collective agreement. 


The fourth reason given is the requirement may lead to a childcare centre breaching section 344 of the Fair Work Act, which prohibits an employer from exerting undue influence or pressure on an employee to make an enterprise agreement. In fact, the Fair Work Act 2009 outlaws the taking of an adverse action against a person simply because that person has or has not exercised a workplace right. Sections 340 and 341 include the right to make or not to make an enterprise agreement. The act also outlaws action taken against another person with the intent to coerce the other person to exercise or not to exercise that right. It is clear that what is going to happen is there will be coercion in this industry because of this money, the $300 million thrown in, to force and coerce workers to sign up to enterprise agreements to try and get their hands on these funds for two years whether they like it or not.


The fifth reason the Australian Industry Group have given is that enterprise agreements typically reduce the ability of an employer to pay employees different salaries based on individual performance, a pay-setting system which many employees strongly support. I am sure there are many childcare centres around our nation today that have different salaries based on different individual performance. That encourages greater participation, higher levels of productivity and greater work ethic. But this legislation threatens to take away that ability. The sixth reason given is that, if a childcare centre decides not to have an enterprise agreement, it is going to experience greater difficulties in attracting and retaining staff, because the centres with enterprise agreements would be able to pay higher rates of pay due to the funding. We are looking at having a two-tiered system. We are going to have the potential of good staff at one centre being attracted to another centre for no other reason than the one centre has been handed out government money and the other has not. This is not good policy.


The seventh reason is that, if employees in a childcare centre are not willing to enter into an enterprise agreement, say because they prefer the existing pay-setting arrangements, the employer would experience greater difficulties in attracting and retaining staff. Again, this is likely to damage many of our childcare centres. Yes, it will be good for the 30 per cent to 40 per cent that get their hands on this pot of borrowed money that runs out in two years, but the other centres, the 60 per cent that will miss out on this pot of money, will be put at a competitive disadvantage and they will have difficulty retaining and hiring staff. That has the potential to cause damage to our childcare centres, not improve them. 


The eighth reason given is that if a childcare centre decides not to have an enterprise agreement it may need to raise its prices to attract and retain staff, given the higher pay rates offered by centres which receive funding, creating hardship for parents. That is exactly right. If we have two centres in one suburb and one is unionised, so they get their hands on this pot of money, and the other centre is not, how will that centre retain its staff? It might have to lift its wages. Deputy Speaker Georganas, you might say that could be good, but we must think of the hardship for parents. If we raise our childcare fees, it would be wonderful if we could pay them. Someone has to pay for this at the end of the day. If we lift the cost of child care in this nation then what happens? It is the parents from the most disadvantaged backgrounds and the people from the lowest socioeconomic areas of our nation who have difficulty in paying, and they miss out on getting child care altogether. What looks on the surface like a great, wonderful and generous idea, if it leads to this happening, will price many parents out of child care. 


Parents across our nation today are really struggling with the cost of living. Next week they are going to be slugged with an increase in the carbon tax of five per cent. They are going to see their electricity prices hit again. The last thing they need is a government policy that is going to further lift the cost of child care and make it difficult. How will that help any of the kids in our nation?


The ninth reason that they give—a very good reason—is:


Concerns have been expressed to Ai Group by employers in the child care industry about the complications which are likely to arise when the funding is exhausted. Childcare centres may not be able to afford to continue to pay the higher wage rates without increasing prices.


Again, there are two things that could happen: we are building in a price increase in the childcare industry or we are going to create a situation where people go into the childcare industry, take some of this pot of money and when that pot of money runs out in two years they are likely to leave the childcare industry and look for jobs with equivalent wages. This is a bad bill. The coalition rightly opposes it.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (19:46):  I also rise this evening to speak against the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. While the objectives of the bill may be sound, it has some deleterious consequences. The member for Hughes, who spoke very eloquently before me, outlined many of them here this evening.


Before I go into my concerns—and I have four to outline this evening—let me say a couple of things about the objectives of the bill and also the process for getting to where we are here. First of all, the objective. Ostensibly, the objective of this bill is to support the wage increases of workers in the childcare sector. We have no problem with this objective; it is an admirable objective because, as you would probably be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, childcare workers are not paid high salaries. They are paid ordinary salaries, like many other workers in the Australian community, so we have no problem with the objectives as such.


What we have difficulties with is that there is a process within the community and a legal framework that is already established for seeking legitimate wage increases. That process is through the Fair Work Commission. One can lodge claims there and people have the right to do so. We support those people with that right to lodge a claim. We submit that this would be the right process to go through in order to receive a salary increase, rather than coming into the parliament and having the parliament legislate a salary increase through a two-year special compensation package.


It is interesting to note that the union which is primarily behind this push has not lodged any formal request to the Fair Work Commission for a salary increase. Rather, the union is going to its puppet masters here in the Labor government and is getting a $300 million gift by going through this process rather than going through the process which every other Australian has to go through.


Let me also say about the process to get to where we are with this bill that I, along with the member for Grey, who will be speaking subsequent to me, sat in on a very brief inquiry which looked into this bill. One of the difficulties we had with this is that this bill was rushed into the parliament, rushed into an inquiry—we had one week at the most to look into this and to try to make some sensible findings—and then pushed through this parliament in the dying days of this government. This government has known that the election will be on 14 September since the beginning of the year. If this bill were so important, the government could have scheduled it properly so that it had a proper chance to be debated and considered, for a parliamentary inquiry to properly undertake an investigation and to improve the bill should that parliamentary inquiry find ways to improve it. But the government has not done that. To the contrary: it has rushed it through in the last couple of weeks along with many other pro-union bills in order to try to get them through in the dying days of this government. That is no way to run a country. This bill is illustrative of the very poor processes which this government undertakes.


Let me go to the substance of the bill. As I said at the outset, I have four concerns in relation to this bill and the effects it will have, despite having no objection to the objectives of the bill. My first concern is in relation to equity. The particular provisions will be of benefit to only about 40 per cent of childcare workers, while 60 per cent or more of childcare workers will miss out on this benefit. If we think that childcare workers are underpaid then surely all childcare workers should receive the salary increase rather than just 40 per cent of them. Many submissions to the public inquiry and other publicly made submissions make this exact point: that there is great inequity here that such a small section of the sector will be beneficiaries of this $300 million fund but the vast majority will not receive any of that funding.


My second concern relates to the fact that the bill, despite it going to have the effect of putting up salaries for at least 40 per cent of the childcare sector, has provision in it for only two years of funding. So years one and two are covered and provide that additional salary boost for 40 per cent of childcare workers, but after that there is no funding.


Ordinarily, if we have a program that is going to be ongoing it would be legislated for in the forward estimates for four years. That is how things are ordinarily done if you are serious about making a particular measure an ongoing one. But it seems that this government's only purpose for this bill is to get them through the election. It is to be sop to the unions to show that they care, to give them two years of funding and then to say, 'You will look after yourself after that.' But salaries will not come down after two years and someone else will then have to pay for those salaries—and that someone else, as the member for Herbert outlined, will be the parents. It will be the parents who have to pay for that.


So we have before us a structural fee increase in the childcare sector through this provision which will come into play in two years time if this bill goes through. That is what we have before us. It will be a further 10 per cent increase on childcare fees per day—a $10 per day increase—that parents will have to pay in two years time because the funding is only for that short period of time. Again, this government are not serious about this. If this government were honestly concerned with childcare workers' salaries and putting them on a sustainable ongoing footing, this would be for a four-year period and it would be an ongoing program—but it is not.


My third concern—and this is perhaps my greatest concern with the bill—is that it is basically just a sop to the unions. The bill does not specify precisely that one must be a union member to be a beneficiary of the $300 million fund, but that is how it is being interpreted across the sector—and, in practice, that is what is occurring. That is understood; it is known. It was the intent of this government to do so from the get-go, and that is the primary purpose of this bill. The primary purpose of this bill—make no bones about it—is for the Prime Minister to shore up the support of another union. The Prime Minister's leadership is under significant threat in the dying days of this government. She needs to get herself through these couple of weeks so that she can be Prime Minister leading up to the election, and she thinks that she can buy off an additional union through this particular measure. It is a $300 million purchase.


And it is not just this side of the parliament who is saying this, who is using such strident language. The Australian Childcare Alliance, who represent about 60 per cent of the childcare sector in this country, have written to all members of parliament with the following words: 


The Federal Government's recent release by the Prime Minister of a Grant funded program with $300 million to be paid over a two year period to lift the wages of early childhood educators, is nothing more than a gift by the government to the United Voice Union.


That is the Australian Childcare Alliance. They are the peak body for the childcare sector in this country. They themselves are saying that this is nothing more than gift by the government to the United Voice Union—a $300 million gift.


They also outline in their letter that each new member the United Voice union will recruit as a result of this process will pay about $572 per annum. And we know that that money will then be used at election time to support the re-election of the Gillard government—or the Rudd government or the Shorten government, whichever it may be come 14 September. That is how this is working. It is taxpayers' funds going to the union and then from the union being used to try to get the Gillard-Rudd-Shorten governments re-elected. It is an outrage—and it is such an outrage because it is not the first time this has been done.


We have in fact seen a similar pattern in the aged-care sector, where a very similar arrangement is being made to try to reunionise the aged-care sector in the dying days of this government. We have seen similar sweetheart deals in relation to the right of entry provisions which have been introduced by this government in recent weeks, which mean that any workplace in the country is in danger of a union official rocking up and entering into the lunchroom and trying to recruit members. No lunchroom is safe after the introduction of those provisions.


We have also seen it in relation to the aggressive attacks on the 457 visas which the immigration minister has unleashed over the last couple of weeks—attacking all of those terrific workers that we have in this country. Why are they doing that? They are doing it because the unions do not like the 457 visas and they are delivering for their paymasters in terms of cracking down on them. This bill is in the same vain as all of that. It is just a sop to the unions, as the Australian Childcare Alliance has said, and as we have seen elsewhere over the last few weeks in terms of delivering for their unions in the dying days of this government purely to shore up support for Julia Gillard personally to stay in the job for another couple of weeks.


Finally, my fourth concern is in relation to the centres that are not eligible for this funding. As I said at the get-go, only about 40 per cent of centres will be eligible to receive some of this $300 million in funding and 60 per cent of centres will receive no such funding but they will be negatively impacted by this bill. Why is that? It occurs because, if the salaries go up in 40 per cent of the childcare centres, naturally there will be additional claims made by the workers in the 60 per cent who are not beneficiaries of this bill. Those childcare centres will then have two choices. They can try to keep salaries at a lower rate compared to the 40 per cent—in which case they are likely to lose workers. They will find it difficult to retain staff and they will find it difficult to attract staff, particularly at a time when there is an acute shortage. That is one choice that they have, but they will have difficulties retaining and attracting staff.


The other option they have is to put up salaries, but knowing that that would have to be immediately passed on to the parents who use their childcare centre. It is estimated by the Australian Childcare Alliance that fees would have to go up by about $10 per day. This government has already passed a myriad of regulations in relation to the childcare sector, which is putting fees up by 10 to 15 per cent and pricing people out of the market. This bill will have the effect of putting up fees by an additional $10 per day. That will just mean that the people who are already struggling to make ends meet, already suffering from the increases in the carbon tax, already suffering from all the other prices that are going up as a result of this government's mismanagement and over-regulatory zeal, will then have to pay higher childcare fees on top of all of that.


The government was forewarned in relation to its regulations by the Productivity Commission that fees would have to go up 15 per cent if it went through with them. It went ahead with its regulations. We are forewarning the government here, as has the Australian Childcare Alliance, that if it goes ahead with this now, then fees will go up an additional $10 on top of that. That is what is at stake here. It is actually the affordability of child care centres. We think they need to be made more affordable, not less.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (20:01):  What fine words from the member for Aston, who sums up very well what this move by the government is about. As he said, I was the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment that did a very rushed inquiry into this bill, the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. I did speak on that report when it was tabled in the House, but I thought I would take this opportunity to further tease out some of the issues that I raised at that time.


I was very disappointed that we were not able to give this bill the consideration that I believe it needed. We had one short hearing from the department and a number of submissions—in fact, quite a number; 99, if I remember rightly—to the House of Representatives committee—largely expressing some distress with the legislation it must be said. Yet we had no time at all to call any of those contributors to come before the committee and express their concerns.


Earlier today the member for Barker spoke in his valedictory speech about the opportunity within this parliament for the House of Representatives committees to change their role somewhat. But unfortunately, under these kinds of timelines, there is an inability to appropriately consider legislation, as I think was intended originally under the new paradigm. It is unfortunate that in many cases much has been left wanting with these bill inquiries.


To the legislation itself, there is no doubt in my mind that this is really a fit-up. It is all about politics and not all that much about early years child care. It is difficult to rise and speak against a wage rise for people who are not highly paid, but when you realise, as I do, that the wage rise is only for a certain percentage of those in the industry—the government claims 40 per cent; in fact, others suggest it will only go so far as 27 per cent—and that the other 60 to 73 per cent will miss out, it is in itself very divisive.


Perhaps that is not that surprising because this government, this Prime Minister in particular, has chosen to be very divisive over a number of issues. There was the singling-out of wealthy miners. There is a case of dog whistling going on with the xenophobic calls around the 457s at the moment. There is certainly a tilt at men with blue ties. I would consider that the one I am wearing at the moment is a blue tie, but I do not think that that puts me in a box of unmentionable people. It is divisive within the industry. In fact, in the submissions made to the inquiry, Childcare Queensland, for instance, said:


The 27% - 40% of services that are successful in gaining the grant will only receive the funding for a period of two years as there is no provision for this grant funding to be continued past 30/06/2015. It will be extremely difficult for these services to reduce the wages at this time so they will all be forced to increase their fees by $10+ per child per day.


Kinda Kapers at Mount Hutton in New South Wales said:


This will create a two tiered wage system with centres who are not successful in attracting the grant money either dramatically increasing fees to enable them to match the wage increase or being unable to attract the very few trained staff who available for employment. Regional and rural centres will be most negatively affected as they are the centres currently most negatively impacted by the industry skill shortage.


I am sure you would understand that, Deputy Speaker Adams, as you do represent a large part of Tasmania that is regional.


That is a two-tiered system—there is no way of dressing that up. The big question is: what is to happen after the two years when the funding ceases? It is highly unlikely that these childcare centres will be able to encourage their staff to take a wage cut, and probably no-one would want to do that. So inevitably it will almost certainly lead to higher costs for those using the services. The other question, of course, is what happens to the 60 per cent to 73 per cent of childcare centres that do not get the extra funding in any case? I can tell you, Deputy Speaker, from the broad number of submissions that came in that a lot of people were very excited in the industry about the fact they may be getting a wage increase, only to be highly disillusioned when they found out that in fact it may not be coming their way. In fact, for the majority, it certainly will not be coming their way.


In particular, this divisiveness within the industry has caused widespread unhappiness. The Australian Childcare Alliance, for instance, noted that the announcement has already caused outrage and division amongst educators in the early education and childcare sector. Educators are understandably angry as their colleagues in the long day care centre across the road may receive the grant while they receive nothing. This is hardly a way to govern for all of Australia and I am very disappointed that the government should bring this legislation into the House dressed up as something which is benefiting the industry when in fact it is going to cause division and unhappiness throughout.


One of the things that particularly concerned the coalition members of the committee was the evidence we received about the campaign by the United Voice union with their Big Steps campaign which certainly preceded the government's announcement. It was commonly reported that the union was claiming centres could not qualify for the funding unless they had a 60 per cent unionised workforce. I am aware that the department wrote to one of the union officials and informed them what the correct state of play was, but we are given to understand that the campaign still continued and that, quite disturbingly, there was a sense of menace in the workplace. The Australian Childcare Alliance said:


During the last two years there has been considerable union activity at services Australia wide increasing substantially since the announcement of the EYQF grant by the Prime Minister. Many of our members have reported that this union activity has been intimidating to both themselves and their staff.


Our members around Australia have been advising us of the strong arm tactics that United Voice Union organisers who have been telling members that they must have 60 per cent plus membership to engage with them to submit the Enterprise Agreement.


Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would be very well aware that the minister for workplace relations only two weeks ago introduced legislation into this House around workplace bullying, which came after an inquiry that I was also the deputy chair of. While I did not agree with all of the recommendations that the government put forward on workplace bullying, we on the coalition were disappointed at the time the inquiry was formed that there was no provision to look at union bullying in the workplace. It would appear that it is alive and well. Certainly those quotes from the Australian Childcare Alliance say it all.


If that is the case and the union is using this government legislation to build membership, and they have lifted membership substantially around the campaign, it is worth noting that United Voice is a major contributor to the ALP. That synergy and those relationships that are behind the scenes are not clearly transparent on this legislation. It is one of the reasons that I will be voting against it. I think that the days of tip-offs and pay-offs for mates should be behind us. I believe the government will pay a heavy price for some of those links to the union movement in the very near future when the electors of Australia, perhaps on 14 September, come to have their judgment on this government.


All of us would like to see low-paid childcare workers adequately compensated in the workplace, but there is a course of action that workers and unions, if they wish, can take to achieve those wage outcomes. It was this government that established the Fair Work Commission, and there is a correct path for industry-wide wage increases should they choose to take that path. Up to this stage they have not chosen to do that. Instead they have done a deal with the government which will see, in effect, their members get the rewards and get the extra wage increase, and those who choose not to be members of the union will probably miss out. While I know that is not strictly the wording of the legislation, it is certainly the message that is out there in the workplace, and we should not allow that to happen.


I understand $300 million is about one-third of what is needed to give this $7 to $10 an hour increase that has been claimed as an outcome of this legislation and two years clearly is not adequate. It is just about a short-term time frame. In fact, I believe overall it creates more problems for the industry, more problems for the workers, than it solves. What it does do is try to push a political problem and a political kickback just a little further down the track and to push greater problems onto a government in two years time when this finding will cease. Whoever is in government at that time will be faced with a very loud call from those people who have been receiving the higher wages for government to continue what is, in effect, a subsidy. That will be at a time when childcare subsidies, the assistance for parents to purchase child care, will have been frozen. It is unbalanced; it is not good legislation.


It is divisive, to come back to my original point. It is pitting Australians against Australians. It will be pitting those who receive the money against those who miss out. It will be pitting long-term day care up against short-term day care and these are not good outcomes. What we need is fairness right across every industry in the way that we deal with people, not selectivity and not picking out favourites and giving kickbacks and support for those that support us. When either side of parliament forms a government, it should be for all Australians, not for selected Australians, and I will be opposing the legislation.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (20:14):  I rise to speak on and oppose the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013, particularly from the perspective of the regional and rural centres. Those that I know in my electorate are going to be so badly affected by this. I know it because they have told me so. For those who are watching this debate tonight, I am sure this will lead to yet another sleepless night for them and I know they have had plenty of those since they first saw this legislation. We do know that this is just another rushed bill into this parliament. There has been no time for an appropriate parliamentary inquiry, as we heard from the two previous speakers.


Critically, this is just another piece of divisive legislation from this government and one that is really going to impact most on rural and regional day care centres. It is going to impact on the childcare centres in my electorate of Forrest because the legislation is basically going to establish a $300 million fund to provide wage increases to just around 30 or 40 per cent of just the long day care workforce, and only for two years. To achieve this the centres will have to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement with their staff and meet the eligibility criteria. As we know, given that limited pool of funds, it will be on, what, a first-in first-served basis or preferential? How will it actually work? What we do know is that there is only funding for two years and it is all being done on borrowed money by the government. We do know this was part of the union United Voice's Big Steps campaign. We do know that childcare workers and educators are low paid and any wage increase should come about through the ruling of the Fair Work Commission. This is the body that this government itself established and it has the responsibility for determining what are appropriate and fair levels of remuneration. But we do know that United Voice, the union, has refused to lodge a wage claim with the Fair Work Commission, preferring instead for the government to just hand over the money but only to the favoured few. It is, as we know, just an appeasement to the unions and is really divisive. 


This is picking winners and losers again with two types of child care: the educators in long day care centres that are eligible for the pay increase and those that are not, which will see family day care, occasional day care, budget based care excluded—there are so many of those in my electorate—in spite of the roles they perform being very similar. Two types of childcare workers: those who are union members of United Voice, who will receive this funding increase, and those who are not. Sixty per cent of childcare workers are going to miss out. The majority will miss out. So it is unfair and it is inequitable.


We know that the Australian Childcare Alliance represents approximately 70 per cent of Australia's long day care centres and they have grave concerns, as do their members. They have had a lot of representations from their members about what is contained in this bill. We know that there are still a lot of uncertainties around these actual grants, around the guidelines. We do not know what the guidelines are. We do not know how many workers will actually be eligible for the pay rise, but we do know how many will not: nearly 60 per cent of them will not in actual fact. And we do know that this will create a two-tiered system of those who receive this money and those who do not; those who are United Voice union members and those who are not. 


I have met a number of those who work in long day care and those who work in other sorts of child care in my community. They are all very concerned that their very good staff will be poached by the centres that can afford to offer the higher rate. I do know that there are managers and owners of centres in my electorate who are not sleeping, as I said, as a result of this. This threatens the very viability of their childcare and day care centres. They know that they are probably going to have to offer that higher rate of pay regardless, just to keep their staff. As I said, this will have a disproportionate impact in rural and regional areas like my own. They will have to do that to adhere to the National Quality Framework staffing requirements. 


There were thousands of submissions to the Senate inquiry, but the government allowed only a few days for reporting, so the process has been flawed. Not only is the legislation flawed and the intent of the legislation flawed, so has been the process. But it is something that is quite common with this government. I keep coming back to the fact that the government is proposing legislation where 60 per cent of centres will miss out and they will be likely forced to increase wages just to keep their staff. That is what will happen. That means that the parents are going to pay more.


Long day care KU Children's Services stated in a submission to the inquiry that the introduction of this fund to a portion of the sector will result in a division within the organisation. That is guaranteed, it is there now. The government has created this. KU Children's Services pointed out that since the 1980s many have worked tirelessly to remove the divide between preschool and long day care, yet the government has reignited that, driven a wedge down the middle and said, 'Here you are: 60 per cent this side, 30 to 40 per cent the other.' 


As the Child Care Association of WA pointed out in their submission, the bill does not consider the outcome of the fund on the sector as a whole. The government is also failing to allow time for the grants guidelines to be published before proceeding with the bill—process flawed again. Many of the submissions to both the House and Senate inquiries from centres have been extensively noting a campaign of union misinformation and quite seriously, as we heard, in some cases bullying of centre owners and childcare workers. 


I also heard that, as part of the Big Steps, United Voice's campaign, evidence or information was given to the effect that someone posted a photograph on Facebook of the home of the president of the Australian Childcare Alliance. With the work that I do in cyberbullying I find that just extraordinary. What form of bullying is that? Is that what we have come to in this place? That is exactly what this legislation has provoked. Some workers have been told that if they do not sign up to their union, their colleagues will not receive a pay rise. Claims were made throughout those inquiries. One union stated, under the heading 'How does my centre qualify?': 


1. Join United Voice.


2. United Voice negotiates a new EBA.


3. Sign agreement. Owner-operator signs agreements with government.


4. Get the raise.


Despite the department claiming that the actual amount of wage increase was to be determined by a seven-member panel, United Voice provided a handy chart for members, telling them exactly what they would get. So, clearly, United Voice knows more than the panel itself. Of course, this is a poorly designed and inequitable proposal, but it certainly will have far-reaching negative impacts, particularly on regional and rural areas, on regional and rural centres and, more importantly, on the families that rely on those great services provided. 


I want to acknowledge the wonderful job that centres in my electorate of Forrest do for families, who trust them to provide quality day care for their children. The service they provide allows parents to return to workplaces as needed, knowing that their children are safe and sound in a supportive, nurturing, caring and learning environment. In the two regional cities of Bunbury and Busselton in my electorate hundreds of families rely on this service, yet the government is putting that at risk. There are 43 childcare centres in the greater Bunbury area and another 17 based in Busselton and Dunsborough, not to mention another dozen or so in the wonderful little country towns throughout the Forrest electorate. The structural changes that the government has made will have a particular impact on these regional centres where there is already an ongoing need and a shortage of qualified staff. I heard about this from the childcare centres.


There is a major financial cost. Established centres are now fearful of their future. That is what this proposal has done. They are fearful of their future and their capacity to provide this great service to families in my electorate. By offering that government funded wage rise to perhaps one-third of the centres just so that centres are able to keep their staff and attract new ones, the Labor government has created division, inequity and a wage war between centres. For a medium-sized private childcare centre the costs are in the extreme. To match the wage rise of $3 to $4, the owner of one Bunbury childcare centre, with 20 staff, told me that it will cost her business $200,000 a year in extra wages and associated payments. A medium-sized centre like this one has about 150 to 200 families, which rely on the centre to provide quality child care, which they trust, and they do it at an affordable price for these families. So to absorb a wage blow-out of $200,000, centres will be forced—they have no choice; they cannot absorb this cost—to raise their fees, possibly by $10 a day per child.


So, for the working families in my electorate, this is about another $200 a month on top of their current fees. This is what is happening right now. I have spoken with childcare centres. The owners and managers of these centres are not sleeping, worrying about the impact on the families and how many children they will lose and whether their centres will be viable. Unfortunately, this will make the unionised government-funded centres more attractive for families because of cheaper rates, which they can afford.


When a child in care costs about the same as a mortgage payment, this has huge impacts on families making decisions about whether they can afford another child or whether one parent has no choice but to drop out of the workplace. I have seen firsthand the anguish and the fear of the childcare centre owner. I referred to her earlier. It is palpable and I know that she is not sleeping. Her feelings are shared by about a dozen others who attended childcare forums I put on two weeks ago with the shadow minister for childcare, Sussan Ley. They realise that they will be forced to pay the extra wages. It is a blatant exercise by the government to impose a political allegiance to and ideology on its union masters in a sector whose primary goal should really be that of being there for the benefit of these great kids and their families by providing great child care.


Of course, this proposal is divisive and unfair. It is an issue of equity and fairness. The government is proposing only two years of funding. Parents will have to pay even more beyond that two years. Sixty per cent of parents in my electorate who will not be funded under this legislation will have to pay now. Of course, the other 40 per cent will pay the extra beyond the two years, because the government has only funded this for two years. So it is a false promise. Centres are forced to pay more just to retain their staff. They are great staff, who do a fantastic job with our young people. 


As I have said, only union members will receive this benefit. So many of them right now around Australia must believe that they are actually going to receive this pay rise—that is, after they have paid their union fees. But I wonder how many, in reality, will actually receive it. I wonder how much they will receive over and above the union fees for what they do. I am profoundly concerned for the childcare centres in my electorate. I have met their staff. As I said, their concern and fear about their viability is palpable and the impact on the 60 per cent of families who will miss out will be direct, and then it will be compounded after the two years when the funding runs out. I oppose this measure.


Debate adjourned.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,21,1
"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (18:35):  I rise to speak on the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. In so doing I would like to particularly draw attention to three aspects of this bill. Firstly, I would like to raise in this House what it is that the bill intends to do and the associated consequences. Secondly, I will talk about why I believe this bill is being introduced, which I think is to appease the unions, and why it is that the government should govern for all Australians and not just a select few in the union movement. Finally, I will talk about why it is so important that we have affordable and accessible child care, not only as a social imperative but an economic imperative as well.


This legislation seeks to establish a $300 million fund to provide wage increases to around 30 to 40 per cent of the long day care workforce over two years. However, in order to qualify centres will need to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement with staff meeting eligibility criteria. Given the limited pool of funds, it will be on a first in, best dressed basis, and after the two years workers will revert to their previous wage.


I want to make it abundantly clear the coalition understands the need to recognise the importance of those who work in the childcare sector. However, the answer to looking at wages of those in the childcare sector is not to introduce bad legislation that will only make the situation worse, especially in the long run. We, on this side of the House, have very serious concerns about this bill. Our concerns stem from a number of reasons. First of all, the government already has a mechanism for determining wage increases. It is called the Fair Work Commission. This legislation brought before the House this evening seeks to circumvent this process and gives the government the power to appoint whatever they believe is the appropriate wage claim. I ask: what is the point of having an industrial relations policy and the Fair Work Commission only to ignore the process and for the government to take matters into their own hands?


This process of the government simply making a determination lacks transparency and in truth demonstrates that there was no process at all. We also have serious concerns about the requirements that must be met in order to gain access to this special fund. Centres will need to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement with staff and meet eligibility criteria. Clearly this is an overt attempt to increase union membership and has nothing whatsoever to do with their wages or the sustainability or the viability of the industry. As a result of these tactics, we have heard some very concerning comments. There have been reports that centre management are being told that 60 per cent of their workforce must join the union in order for them to receive the pay rise. The Australian Childcare Alliance submission to the House of Representatives standing committee includes a statutory declaration to this effect. This is quite wrong.


There are also reports that some workers are being told that if they do not sign up to the union, then their colleagues will not receive a pay rise. These are bullying tactics at their best. Upon signing up to the union, at more than $500 a year in membership fees, they are then being falsely led to believe that this will guarantee them a pay rise, which is simply not the case. We have seen, through these tactics, a change in union membership in this industry from what was only 10 per cent of the industry to now more than 25 per cent as a direct result of this bill. This has clearly been the motive of the United Voice union, previously the LHMU.


We are also concerned that only childcare educators in long day care centres will be eligible for this pay increase. This is despite the fact we know their roles are very similar to those at family day care, occasional care and budget based care and all of these are excluded from the fund that this government seeks to legislate. Unlike the Labor Party, we on this side of the chamber recognise that there are inherent dangers involved in picking specific winners, especially within a single industry, and the very severe and distorting effects that this has on the remaining players in the market. 


Let me go to why the bill is being introduced. Make no mistake that this, along with other pieces of legislation that have passed already in this place—including those that relate to the clothing, textile and footwear industry; the trucking legislation; the reregulation of ports; the legislation that is still before this place for the contrived rorting of the 457 visa systems and the dismantling of the ABCC—are union driven pieces of legislation designed to increase their power and their influence in the Australian workplace and in Australian society. We know that the government are beholden to their union masters. It was this week three years ago that the faceless men of the union movement took down one Prime Minister and installed another. I think they can be quite satisfied in their decision, given the legislation that I have just alluded to. 


It was the United Voice Union that orchestrated the Big Steps campaign. It was through this campaign that the union warned that they will not stop until every educator receives a change in their pay arrangements, irrespective of the $300 million fund already proposed and without any consideration as to the price increases and what effect this will have on the affordability or long-term sustainability of the industry. But I suppose we can expect that because this has often been the attitude taken that, no matter what the impact, it is simply all about the union, even if that means that for the workers affected there may be no job in the future. United Voice have run a very false and misleading campaign. In one of their propaganda pieces of material they have stated under the heading, 'How does my centre qualify' to: 


1. Join United Voice;


2. United Voice a negotiates new EBA;


3. Owner/Operator signs agreement with government; 


4. Get raise.


This misinformation is continued despite the department writing to the secretary of United Voice back on 11 April to indicate that union membership is not a prerequisite. Despite all of these demands, the union has never made a wage claim to the Fair Work Commission, the appropriate body to handle these cases. Instead they have gone direct to government to ask for the funds without any rationale or justification. That is simply an indication of how this Labor government operates. It operates to help its union mates who, in turn, help fund their campaign and help work on their campaign. Is it any wonder when we consider that this union has donated more than $7 million to the Labor Party over successive elections—quite a significant amount, I think most people would agree. This is yet another example of how the unions think that they are above the law and normal due process and think they can circumvent these due processes and operate in their own environment.


I come to my final point, why it is so important to have affordable and accessible child care. In the time remaining to me I want to talk about why it is that child care in all its forms needs to be flexible, accessible and affordable to cater to the needs of those that require its service. In Australia it is clear that we have a participation issue. Only 76 per cent of women aged 25 to 54 are in paid work compared with over 80 per cent in other developed economies such as Canada and Germany. One of the most effective ways that we can lift the participation rate is to encourage women back into the workforce after childbirth if that is indeed what they want. Clearly the coalition's paid parental leave scheme is just one mechanism to assist with this. Another way is to ensure that individual families can access child care that caters to their needs. 


In this modern economy, where women can work in many and varied environments, one size does not fit all and we know that affordability is one of the key aspects to whether or not the women and families in this country can access child care. That is why I am concerned about the changes the government has made to the childcare system, including the National Quality Framework and universal access. These regulatory changes, while potentially good in intent, have not been thought through, like so much of the government's actions. At the time we were promised by the minister that the changes would only result in an increase in costs of around 57c per week, yet the reality is that costs have gone up by more than $100 per week. I recently met with a number of childcare providers and local councils to talk to them about the impact of these additional regulations on the services that they themselves provide and the impact of maintaining current levels of staffing. They have told me that it has a very direct impact as to the cost of services and one council told me that the impact of upgrading a number of their capital structures in order to comply with the new regulations was more than $1.5 million. Who will ultimately pay for that? I think the answer is clear: it will be the parents who choose to send their child to that childcare centre.


In conclusion, we on this side of the House have serious concerns about this legislation. That is why we oppose it. We also have grave concerns about the direction of this government as a whole and the direction they have taken when it comes to child care. We, should we have the privilege of forming government after 14 September, have been upfront with the Australian people that we will work hard to make sure that we meet their childcare needs and have said that we will have a Productivity Commission inquiry into how we can make the childcare sector more affordable and more accessible to all who require the services. Unlike this government, when we look at an issue we do not simply ask the question, how can we help our union mates? We ask how can we help all Australians? How can we be a responsible government, a government that governs for all and will restore hope, reward and opportunity?

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (18:50):  I rise to speak on the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. I find the comments by the minister in his introductory speech balanced against the actual effect of this bill to be an absolute farce and at odds with each other. This is a bill that seeks to provide $300 million over two years: $135 million in the first year and $165 million in the second year. It is about lifting wages for the workers in the childcare industry, but $300 million will not provide that increase for all workers in the childcare industry. I would have thought the one thing coming from a Labor Party driven by the unions, owned by the unions, would have been an equality for all workers—the same people doing the same job in the same environment getting paid the same amount of money. Isn't that what the union movement is supposed to be all about? But here we have a minister who is introducing a special fund for the benefit of a select few. 


This was brought to my attention by one of my electorate's childcare directors, and I will not name her for a few reasons. She had real concerns. She came to see me with some of her workers. One of their concerns was that they were told by the union movement that to access this fund the workers in that centre needed to join the union movement. In fact, they needed seven workers to join the union before they could be eligible for this program. And that is a lie in itself because you do not need to be a member of the union to apply for this grant. However, they needed to sign up to the enterprise bargaining agreement to access this fund.


It is abundantly clear that this funding will provide a wage increase for only 30 to 40 per cent of the workers in long day care and only over two years. So here is the predicament that my long day childcare centre owner has. She has put it to her workers and they have decided: 'We might as well, so, yes, we have to join the union and we'll pay $500 a year each for the pleasure of joining the union. We'll enter into this enterprise bargaining agreement, we'll put our name down for this fund and if we get the funds for two years, what happens at the end of the two years?' Guess what? The fund goes, but how easy will it be to reduce the wages by that amount? That ain't going to happen, so parents are going to get slugged for an increase in childcare costs. And there is no guarantee on the funding coming through to that centre, so if the workers enter into the enterprise bargaining agreement and do not get the funding the costs of child care will have to go up from 1 July. How smart is that?


People in the industry, who actually understand the childcare industry and who interact with parents on a daily basis, want stability and affordable child care. And one thing that really disappoints and annoys those people is that this program seeks to drive division in the industry—division because some workers will get compensatoryfunding, others will not; division because this only applies to those workers in long day care, not those in preschools or in other forms of childcare provision.


One thing that the coalition did, and did well, was bring all of the workers involved in the childcare industry together. This bill is a farce. Do I think that childcare workers are worth more money? Absolutely. I am married to a person employed in the childcare industry and I see what they go through on a daily basis. I see the care and love that they provide to children who are not their own but who are put into their care. They are fantastic people and they work incredibly hard. I think this legislation is dangling a carrot at the end of a stick, which will only to be snatched away from them after two years—after they have made that commitment to pay $500 a year in union membership; after their employers have been locked into an EBA—and it will drive up the costs of child care.


Some queries came in from centre operators, particularly not-for-profit centre operators, in my electorate. One read:


The government has pledged funding for some educators for two years. Conditions apply such as signed workplace agreements. We're a small community centre in a very needy area.


Another one said:


Pay increases for some childcare workers and educators have already been contracted. The New South Wales branch of the union, Big Step, said only educators that signed the contracts would be getting the increases. This makes us worried. We're a small centre in—


a certain area—


Not many of us out here look after the real interests of the children. Thank you for reading my email.


The final one that came through read:


The Federal government funding pledge for some childcare workers have told and have read we need to sign contracts, work agreements for funding for two years only. Can you please spare the time to help our little community centre with only 39 children—cannot come up with this funding like the commercially owned. Thank you. I don't know what to do.


I met with them in my office. Their paramount concern was for the future of their workers and the care being provided to the children under their arrangements. If you have a condition where one centre is paying more, you are going to see a drain from one centre to another. What will happen at the end of the two years? Deputy Speaker, I am sure in your position and in my position as local members, if we got a pay increase for two years—if we signed up to an agreement and we entered into that as part of our workplace agreement—and then after two years that funding was pulled, are we going to happily sit back and say: 'That's great. It was great that it was there for two years and now, all of a sudden, we're expected to take a pay cut?' We know that will not happen. The cost of child care under this government will go up. That is an undisputed fact. For some parents it will go up immediately; for others, where it is being subsidised, the cost will go up in two years.


There is no doubt that childcare workers are some of the lowest paid people in this country and they deserve more. I found the second paragraph of the introductory speech by the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, on 30 May, when this bill was introduced, rather offensive. He said:


Core to our values is giving every child an opportunity to succeed …


That is somewhat hypocritical because, if you are providing different funding for different child care, it means you will get different outcomes. So that is not giving every child an equal opportunity. Further, he said:


At the heart of this bill is this government's commitment to quality early childhood education, a commitment to early childhood education that is accessible and affordable and a commitment to having a highly qualified early childhood workforce.


That sounds wonderful, an absolute dream and something that should be achieved. But how do you achieve that if you are only providing a limited amount of money to cover a small percentage of the workforce for only two years? It cannot be done. So it is built on a false premise.


Finally, in the same speech, under the title 'Affordability and Accessibility', he said,


This government has been working hard to ensure that quality early childhood education and care remains affordable and accessible for all Australian families.


He kept repeating himself. This legislation is not sustainable by any stretch of the imagination. Further, in his speech, when he got into the targeted area of this Early Years Quality Fund, he said:


The fund, which will operate for two years, will enable grants to be paid services to supplement wage increases of all educators and staff assisting in the provision of quality early childhood education and care.


He used the word 'all' there. The fund does not cover all providers. So I am very disappointed but, in particular, people in my constituency are very disappointed. The people who work hard in a very low pay environment committed to the provision of quality child care are disappointed that, as they see it, they are being driven to join a union movement against their will to be able to access funds. What about freedom of choice in this country? It does not seem to exist.


What this bill is about is the government spending $300 million of taxpayers' funds to do nothing more than build union membership, under the Big Steps campaign, to give themselves sustainability and increased numbers in the trade union movement. So I oppose this bill. I want people to have higher wages—absolutely—but I want them based on productivity and affordability, and if the government is going to shell out taxpayers' funds they should be shelled out for all of the workers providing the same service, not for a select few—a select few that have been forced to join a union movement against their will. That is why this government and this bill need to be condemned.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (19:01):  I would like to commend the member for Paterson and the member for Higgins for their speeches because I think they have summed up exactly what this bill, the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013, is all about. Sadly, it is this government giving another sop to the union movement. It is remarkable that we are debating it on this day, this third anniversary of Julia Gillard becoming the Prime Minister of our great nation, because that event was all about the union movement regaining control of the Labor Party—and, boy, are we seeing the Prime Minister repay the unions' faith in her in spades and that is what this bill is all about.


We have seen that with another bill we have been debating in this chamber in the last two weeks, the bill about 457 visas with the union movement looking for the government to crack down on the so-called rorting there—a union inspired campaign which the government decided to get behind. There is quite an irony as to that bill because it seems it is the media communications guru in the Prime Minister's office, on a 457 visa himself, who thought: 'Oh, there's a great convergence here. We've got the 457 visa issue which the unions want us to push and we can use that to try and disguise the issues that we have with our borders.' So they brought those two issues together in that bill, and now we are also seeing it here, because United Voice have run a very strong campaign to get action in this area. But it is not to get action on behalf of all childcare workers and it is not to get action to see wages rise across the sector in a fair way. It is a call to arms by United Voice to get the Gillard government to act on behalf of them. That is what is so shameful about this piece of legislation because, as the member for Paterson identified, what it does is divide worker against worker and it divides various segments of the childcare sector against each other. What we on this side cannot understand about this Prime Minister is why she continually wants to divide Australian against Australian. Why is it? Leadership is not about division; leadership is about uniting. Yet this Prime Minister seems hell-bent on just making one Australian be pitted against another Australian be pitted against another Australian. It is not the way to govern a nation.


Let us go to the specifics of the bill. What is it about? It is about providing a commitment of $300 million over two years to various members of this sector—and I say various members of this sector, not all. How do you see whether you can qualify for some of this $300 million? The government have set up a seven-member panel which has responsibility for deciding the criteria that centres will need to meet in order to be eligible for the funding. How have they gone about establishing who should be on that committee? Have we got a wide range of voices? Have we made sure that we have got the sector as a whole well represented on that seven-member panel? No, we have not. But what have we made sure of? Who have we made sure are represented on that seven-member panel? It should come as no surprise. United Voice, of course, are on that panel. But do we have private sector engagement on that panel? No, of course not. Heaven forbid that we could have broad representation on it, but, my word, have we insisted that United Voice get one seat? Yes, we have.


What then are the guidelines that are going to lead how this funding is allocated? They are still yet to be determined, meaning we are unable to consider whether they are even fair and reasonable. So here we are debating this legislation, which is going to dish out $300 million over two years, and we have a seven-member panel set up—and we know that United Voice are on that—but what are the criteria? No criteria! But we have seen, through United Voice's campaign—and can I say it is a fairly deceitful campaign—the type of guidelines that they would like to see. They would like to make sure that the union is front and centre when it comes to allocating these funds. They would like to see, whether a centre has an EBA or not, the level of union membership that a centre has within its workforce. That is the key criterion that they would like to see. We will wait and see whether or not the government actually puts that in the criteria, but there is no doubt that, by giving United Voice representation on that seven-member panel, those are the things they will want to bring to the table.


And what does it mean for the other types of child care? What does it mean, for instance, for family day care? What does it mean for occasional care? What does it mean for budget based care? They are excluded entirely from this funding. I have already had an approach from an occasional care provider in my electorate in Warrnambool. They are incredibly fearful of what this means for their ongoing viability. It is worth mentioning because occasional care is sometimes frowned upon by the other side for being there for those who can afford it. I tell you: when you go and sit down and talk to the parents, grandparents or carers who use occasional care, it is often the most needy and vulnerable who use it, yet, through what the government is doing here, it is going to make it harder for them to continue to employ people. It is going to threaten the ongoing viability of this sector. That means that the poor and the needy who use occasional care—those parents, grandparents and carers—are going to be left with little alternative. Often it is the single parents who have to use it the most, yet, through this piece of legislation, the government is going to make it harder for those occasional care providers to operate. I ask anyone on the other side, if they query this, to come down to Warrnambool. I would love to take them to the occasional care centre there and to get them to talk to the parents, grandparents and carers so that they can hear firsthand what this piece of legislation has the potential to do.


So there are serious problems with this bill. They come on the back of other pieces of legislation which have been introduced to this House and which have also caused considerable concern to the sector. I will say about these two other initiatives the government has put in—the national quality framework and the universal access—that they at least have the right intent, whereas this bill before us today does not have the right intent. It has been singly about making sure that United Voice has got the policies that they were seeking, in many ways, it is worth reminding the House, rewarding them for their support for the Labor government. Let us not forget that, as the member for Higgins put on the record, $7 million has been donated over the last two election campaigns by United Voice to the Labor Party. That is what is driving this piece of legislation.


What drove the national quality framework and universal access was good intent, and we on this side recognise that. Of course, the implementation has, sadly, been lacking and has caused a lot of concern within the sector. So why, having caused that concern and still trying to bed down the disruption which has been caused by the national quality framework, including the increased amount of staff necessary to implement the national quality framework—and, of course, with universal access there are the difficulties in getting the staff needed to implement it—has the government come and sought to divide the sector by presenting this piece of legislation, which we know and the government has admitted cannot cover the whole workforce in the childcare sector? As a matter of fact, it is expected that it will only cover between 30 and 40 per cent. So you bring in two pieces of legislation, which caused concern through their poor implementation, and then you bring in this piece of legislation, which will divide the industry. It will only cover 30 to 40 per cent of the workforce. As I have said before, that is going to pit centre against centre, but it is also going to pit against each other the types of child care provided.


So what does the coalition want to offer in this space? In the first instance, it wants to offer good governance. It wants to say to United Voice: 'Do this properly. Don't go to the government and say you want a cosy deal. Use the system. Put in an application through the proper channels to get a pay rise for the childcare sector workforce as a whole. Let's work so that the whole sector can get the type of remuneration that the sector deserves and that we on this side recognise that it deserves. Don't go and do a cosy deal which shows that, once again, it is the union movement that has the strings to pull to get this Prime Minister in particular to do what it wants done. Use the proper process.'


What else do we want to do? We want to make sure child care is affordable and accessible for all, whether it be in metropolitan areas or in regional and rural areas. We will embark on that process. We will look at ways to make sure everyone in the sector can make sure they continue to provide services which are affordable and accessible. It will not just be long day care centres; it will also be family day care, occasional care, budget based care and others excluded entirely despite their roles being very similar.


There is one thing that the Leader of the Opposition has made clear—that is, we want to get away from this politics of division. We want to get away from this politics of representing part of the community and then pitting that part of the community against another part of the community. We want to get back to where the national interest comes first, where the community comes first and where all Australians come first—not a government which seems hell-bent and a Prime Minister who seems hell-bent on making sure that the only way government occurs is by dividing the nation.


On this side, we are opposed to this bill. We can see it transparently for all it is—that is, repaying United Voice for everything they have done in getting rid of a Prime Minister three years ago and putting in a new Prime Minister to be at the beck and call of the union movement. It is a shameless piece of legislation. It covers only 30 to 40 per cent of the workforce. It covers only one sector of child care. It is not about improving the sector as a whole; it is about rewarding the union movement and that is why we oppose it.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2013-06-25,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (19:16):  When they want to oppose something, what do they default to? Good old union bashing is what we are seeing from the other side. It is extraordinary. They are straight into it. They talk about the national interest. The national interest is educating the future of this nation and caring for the welfare of the future of this nation which is children, and ensuring that they get a quality education. Members will be aware of my passion for education. In my first speech in parliament, I spoke about how I was proof of the transformative powers of education and it is a sentiment I have repeated again and again. Through education, I escaped the cycle of disadvantage. There are thousands and thousands more like me.


Often when I speak of education, I focus on primary schools, high schools or even universities. These are the years of education we remember, so they feel the most formative to us. However, countless studies, countless pieces of research and countless experts tell us that it is the early years of education that make the biggest difference—and the Jesuits tell us that as well. There is a compelling body of evidence showing that 90 per cent of a child's brain development happens in these critical early years. These are the formative years. These are the years we need to get right if we are to give our children all the opportunities they deserve.


I am very pleased, therefore, to be talking tonight about the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013, which seeks to improve quality outcomes for children in early childhood education and care services by enhancing the professionalism of the sector and improving the attraction and retention of a skilled and professional workforce. I am very proud of this Labor government's record of achievement in early childhood education and care. This government have been working hard to ensure that quality early childhood education and care remains affordable and accessible for all Australian families in the national interest. 


We are investing a record $25 billion over the next four years in early childhood education and care, of which $22.1 billion will be in direct childcare assistance to parents. We have also delivered nearly $970 million between 2008 and 2013 to provide all Australian children in the year before they start primary school with access to a quality preschool education, delivered by a quality, qualified early childhood teacher.


These investments are already paying off. Recent data shows that because of this investment preschool enrolments have increased. In 2012, 266 four- and five-year-old children were enrolled in a program in the year before full-time school. This was 60,000 more children enrolled in 2012 than in 2008. So we have seen a dramatic increase in preschool enrolments. 


In this year's budget, the government announced a further $666 million to extend the universal access commitment to quality early childhood education in the year before school to the end of 2014. The Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth has also announced that this year the early childhood education and care Closing the Gap target will be met—a significant development. In 2008, the Labor government pledged to deliver access to early childhood education to all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities within five years, and we have achieved that. These are significant achievements for this sector and I am particularly proud to be part of a government that has delivered them.


The bill we are debating tonight supports a very particular aspect of early years education—that is, supporting the employment retention and better pay of more highly qualified staff. Specifically, this bill establishes a special account to administer the Early Years Quality Fund. The fund will provide $300 million over two years to assist long day care services to offset the costs of employing higher qualified staff, who are required as part of the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care from 1 January next year. Funding will be provided directly to eligible services to improve quality outcomes for children by supplementing wage increases of $3 per hour for cert III qualified educators. There will be proportionately higher wage increases for diploma and degree qualified educators.


Australian and international research shows that having educators with higher qualifications is closely associated with improved outcomes for children. More highly qualified staff have a better understanding of early childhood development and this results in better and more targeted education and care for our children to help them learn and develop. 


Funding for wage increases will be assessed and approved based on a defined set of criteria and these are: a demonstrated commitment at the service to quality outcomes for children under the National Quality Framework, including a detailed plan to meet NQF qualification requirements; an agreement to use grant funds exclusively for wage increases, including detailed acquittal of funds to improve transparency; a commitment to affordability for families through fee restraint limited to actual operating cost increases, and no increases as a result of wages arising from the operation of the fund; increased fee transparency requirements for services, including explaining to parents the level of financial assistance provided by the government through childcare benefit and childcare rebates; meeting specific reporting requirements for the government's online childcare portal MyChild; and wage increases being included in an enterprise bargaining agreement. 


In my electorate of Canberra I have visited many early childhood centres and met wonderful staff, gorgeous kids and wonderful parents. I know that the staff in these centres—who are mostly women because early childhood workers are still predominantly women—are incredibly committed to the children they care for. Earlier this year I spent one morning and one afternoon at a childcare centre at Isaacs in my electorate, walking in the shoes of a childcare worker as part of the Big Steps campaign. In the morning, I spent time with babies, changed nappies and cleaned lots of little bottoms, entertained these children, put them to bed, and through each half-day I spent a lot of time with kids in every age group. It was an absolutely delightful experience—but absolutely exhausting.


Looking after all these children on such a scale with all their different needs, and particularly with little ones going down at different times—so putting them down and getting the others up at the same time; taking them outside to play; keeping an eye on them and keeping them entertained, because at that stage you really do need to spend a lot of time entertaining them; as well as having them en masse trying to keep them all happy—it was exhausting on both of those half-days. I told the staff that I saluted them. I take my hat off to them for the work they do, caring for these children but also keeping them stimulated and educated. 


I particularly admired the real rigour around the whole process for the day. If the children were playing with a toy, then the educator would observe what they were doing and repeat the experience of what they learned from playing with that toy. Or, if they were playing with other little children, then the educator would assess what the child was learning from that experience—the use of words, colours, sharing activity and team-building activity. There was not just a lot of play there but also a lot of education happening. There was a lot of assessment going on about the education of these children.


What particularly impressed me was that the educators could pick up on those kids who were quite often a bit shy—those who were not as socially advanced as the others in the same peer group or the same age group. They could pick up on that child and spend some time with them trying to encourage them to interact more closely with their peers or just spend some one-on-one time trying to draw out their strengths and the specific qualities of these children. So it was not just a case of an en masse approach to these small children. They were there as educators but they were also doing assessments throughout the time that I was with them, and throughout their day, on the advances that each child was making, and also attempting to fill those gaps, which I think was particularly important. Again, they were applying a rigour to it in doing an assessment in writing of that child. I understand that assessment goes into a system so that you can see the development of the child over the period of that child is in child care.


As I said, what would appear to be just playing with building blocks, looking at colours and reading books actually had this underpinning of learning and education throughout the day. I was incredibly impressed and absolutely exhausted after those two half-days.


This bill acknowledges the commitment of those workers by securing higher wages in recognition of their professionalism and qualifications. It is important to note that the establishment of this fund is intended only as a first step in a process that will, in time, see an overhaul of the remuneration of the entire early childhood workforce. This government has also announced the establishment of a pay equity unit in the Fair Work Commission. The primary role of the unit will be to assist the Fair Work Commission with data and research collection and specialist pay equity information. Of particular importance, it will assist in a long-term overhaul of pay equity in feminised workforces. The pay inequity at the moment not only causes day-to-day pay inequity but also means that women are going into superannuation with less money. They get less superannuation and so go into retirement with less money. I have said many a time in this House that I have had these women presenting at my electorate office every week.


It is also important to note that these wage increases are designed not to put upward pressure on fees. In fact, one of the conditions of receiving this funding is that there are no fee increases as a result of the wage increase that will occur from the fund. We know that parents and carers cannot afford to pay higher fees. That is why this government is taking action to increase wages while ensuring that fees do not increase. According to research by United Voice, childcare fees have risen on average by 11.2 per cent in the last 12 months—from $63.21 to $70.29 per day. Both the early childhood sector and families are under pressure in this regard and this bill has a requirement to contain childcare fee increases, meaning staff will get an increase in wages without fees going up.


This Early Years Quality Fund builds on steps this government has already taken to ensure we have a better qualified, better paid workforce in the early childhood sector. These initiatives include: the TAFE fee waiver that enables students to obtain a diploma or an advanced diploma in children's services without paying fees; the recognition of prior learning initiative, which provides grants of up to $3,500 to enable educators to have the skills they have acquired through working in the sector recognised and enables them to obtain or upgrade their qualifications; the HECS-HELP initiative, which provides funding to reduce the Higher Education Loans Program debts of early childhood education teachers who work in areas of high need such as remote areas of Australia; and the Inclusion and Professional Support Program, through which the educators and services receive professional development and support to enhance the provision of quality education and care services.


As I have mentioned, the early childhood workforce is a feminised workforce—it is predominantly women. As is too often the case in workforces dominated by women, early childcare workers are amongst the lowest paid skilled workers in this country. Workers have been fighting long and hard to receive professional wages in the early childhood sector. In particular, as I mentioned over the past year or so, the Big Steps campaign has united workers, parents, families and employers to support wage increases for early childhood educators. I have spoken to these parents in the afternoons. I have been there in these childhood centres talking to the staff and meeting the kids. I have spoken to the parents and they have all pushed for an increase in wages for the workers, the educators who are educating their children.


To the hundreds of people who contacted me in my electorate of Canberra, I say to them: firstly, thank you for sharing your concerns with me on this important issue and, secondly, we listened. This government is taking action. Higher wages are deserved by these skilled and qualified workers. Higher wages will help keep workers in the sector and higher wages will help attract more and better staff. As we know, we have a chronic lack of qualified staff in this sector at the moment, which is dramatically affecting childcare availability. This fund puts us on track to reform wages in this sector and it puts us on track well into the future. Qualified and skilled early childhood workers deserve this bill. Most importantly, our kids, our future and our nation deserve this bill. I commend it to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (19:31):  I rise to speak on the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. Before I get to the specifics of the bill I would like to say what a wonderful job that the many childcare centres in the electorate of Hughes actually do. As a member, I have had the great pleasure to visit many of these childcare centres and participate in the activities with the staff: reading books to the kids, playing with them and enjoying their ice-creams at lunchtime. It was a truly wonderful experience. There is no doubt that we would like to see the staff at these centres earn more money, like we would many employees right across the economy.


However, the childcare centres I have been to say their biggest problem is with government regulation and red tape putting additional cost on those childcare centres. In fact, over the last few years under this government we have seen a 26 per cent increase in the cost in childcare in this nation, mainly because of the red tape this government has put in. When those costs increase and the costs to a childcare operator increase because of the red tape, that simply takes away their ability to pay their staff more wages. So the ability to pay the staff more wages, to get higher wages in the childcare centre, has been taken away by a lot of the red tape and new regulations we have seen this government introduce.


The legislation actually seeks to establish a $300 million fund to provide wage increases, which are estimated to go to only 30 or 40 per cent of long day care workers and only over two years. Also, centres will need to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement with staff and meet the eligible criteria. Given this limited pool of funds, they will be allocated on a first-in basis and then after two years the workers will simply revert to their previous wage. 


The coalition oppose this bill, regrettably. We would like to see childcare workers earn more money, take home more pay, but there are several reasons for opposing this bill. The first reason is this is $300 million worth of spending this government simply does not have. This is simply more spending that will be added to our nation's debt. In the first four years of this government we have seen the largest deficits in our nation's history, a cumulative $172 billion. Then we had promise after promise after promise of this year the budget being returned to surplus. Of course, we know that that $1 billion surplus is now, at last estimate, a $19.8 billion deficit. This $300 million for childcare workers simply goes onto that deficit. It is more money that we have to borrow. Ultimately, it is money that has to be paid back. In fact, it is actually the children at these childcare centres who will be burdened with this debt and who will be paying off this debt when they eventually get through school and get through university and start to earn dollars. Their taxes will be higher because of this government. 


The other reason the coalition oppose this bill is that we looked at what industry has said. The Australian Industry Group, a group that represents 440,000 businesses and employs over 2.4 million people, said of this legislation:


… Ai Group expresses a strong view on the proposal to make funding conditional upon day care centres having an enterprise agreement. This proposal is unfair and inappropriate.


How can this government sit here and want to pass this legislation through the parliament when we have the Australian Industry Group saying categorically that this proposal is unfair and inappropriate? That alone is reason not to pass this legislation. 


It will set two types of childcare centres: those that are unionised and those that are not unionised. The real concern is this funding is actually over only two years. The question is: what happens when those two years are up and this funding runs out? We are going to see a massive distortion in the childcare market with staff going from one centre to another hoping to get their hands on some of this money, which in two years is going to run out.


Another real concern is what has been told to some of the staff in the childcare industry, which makes it very clear that this money is more a taxpayer funded union recruitment drive. Workers have been told that if they do not sign up to the union they will not get a pay rise. We have seen employees signing up and then having to pay the union fees. They are committing to pay more than $500 a year to the union to sign up to get their hands on this taxpayer money, which the government does not have and is borrowing. We have seen some centres' managers being told that 60 per cent of their workforce must join the union in order for them to receive the pay rise. We have also seen in the Australian Childcare Alliance's submission to the House of Reps standing committee a statutory declaration to this effect. This is not something that the coalition is saying; this is something that the Australian Childcare Alliance has put in a statutory declaration to the committee. 


Of course, we have seen a great deal of union propaganda about this, again a recruitment drive. We have seen under the heading 'How does my centre qualify?' the statement: '(1) join your union United Voice; (2) United Voice negotiates a new EBA; (3) the owner-operator signs the agreement with the government; (4) get a raise.' Of course, it does not say that you must pay the union fees along the way. It does not say that this money is borrowed money. And it does not say this money will run out after two years. This is typical of this government: bad legislation done to support their mates in the union rather than doing what is in the best interests, the long-term interests, of the nation. 


The Australian Industry Group have also put forward 10 separate points about their objections to this legislation. I would like to go through each one of those. The first is that this requirement will simply remove the ability of a childcare centre to freely choose whether an enterprise agreement suits its business. We should be giving the childcare centres the ability to choose which way they want to operate, but this forces them down the track of going into an enterprise agreement. The second reason given is that a childcare centre could feel coerced to make an enterprise agreement, regardless of whether the business is happy with its pay-setting arrangements. Again, it reduces the individual ability of a childcare centre to determine what is best. The third reason given is that employees of a childcare centre could feel coerced to make enterprise agreements, regardless of whether the majority of employees of that centre support the negotiation of a collective agreement. 


The fourth reason given is the requirement may lead to a childcare centre breaching section 344 of the Fair Work Act, which prohibits an employer from exerting undue influence or pressure on an employee to make an enterprise agreement. In fact, the Fair Work Act 2009 outlaws the taking of an adverse action against a person simply because that person has or has not exercised a workplace right. Sections 340 and 341 include the right to make or not to make an enterprise agreement. The act also outlaws action taken against another person with the intent to coerce the other person to exercise or not to exercise that right. It is clear that what is going to happen is there will be coercion in this industry because of this money, the $300 million thrown in, to force and coerce workers to sign up to enterprise agreements to try and get their hands on these funds for two years whether they like it or not.


The fifth reason the Australian Industry Group have given is that enterprise agreements typically reduce the ability of an employer to pay employees different salaries based on individual performance, a pay-setting system which many employees strongly support. I am sure there are many childcare centres around our nation today that have different salaries based on different individual performance. That encourages greater participation, higher levels of productivity and greater work ethic. But this legislation threatens to take away that ability. The sixth reason given is that, if a childcare centre decides not to have an enterprise agreement, it is going to experience greater difficulties in attracting and retaining staff, because the centres with enterprise agreements would be able to pay higher rates of pay due to the funding. We are looking at having a two-tiered system. We are going to have the potential of good staff at one centre being attracted to another centre for no other reason than the one centre has been handed out government money and the other has not. This is not good policy.


The seventh reason is that, if employees in a childcare centre are not willing to enter into an enterprise agreement, say because they prefer the existing pay-setting arrangements, the employer would experience greater difficulties in attracting and retaining staff. Again, this is likely to damage many of our childcare centres. Yes, it will be good for the 30 per cent to 40 per cent that get their hands on this pot of borrowed money that runs out in two years, but the other centres, the 60 per cent that will miss out on this pot of money, will be put at a competitive disadvantage and they will have difficulty retaining and hiring staff. That has the potential to cause damage to our childcare centres, not improve them. 


The eighth reason given is that if a childcare centre decides not to have an enterprise agreement it may need to raise its prices to attract and retain staff, given the higher pay rates offered by centres which receive funding, creating hardship for parents. That is exactly right. If we have two centres in one suburb and one is unionised, so they get their hands on this pot of money, and the other centre is not, how will that centre retain its staff? It might have to lift its wages. Deputy Speaker Georganas, you might say that could be good, but we must think of the hardship for parents. If we raise our childcare fees, it would be wonderful if we could pay them. Someone has to pay for this at the end of the day. If we lift the cost of child care in this nation then what happens? It is the parents from the most disadvantaged backgrounds and the people from the lowest socioeconomic areas of our nation who have difficulty in paying, and they miss out on getting child care altogether. What looks on the surface like a great, wonderful and generous idea, if it leads to this happening, will price many parents out of child care. 


Parents across our nation today are really struggling with the cost of living. Next week they are going to be slugged with an increase in the carbon tax of five per cent. They are going to see their electricity prices hit again. The last thing they need is a government policy that is going to further lift the cost of child care and make it difficult. How will that help any of the kids in our nation?


The ninth reason that they give—a very good reason—is:


Concerns have been expressed to Ai Group by employers in the child care industry about the complications which are likely to arise when the funding is exhausted. Childcare centres may not be able to afford to continue to pay the higher wage rates without increasing prices.


Again, there are two things that could happen: we are building in a price increase in the childcare industry or we are going to create a situation where people go into the childcare industry, take some of this pot of money and when that pot of money runs out in two years they are likely to leave the childcare industry and look for jobs with equivalent wages. This is a bad bill. The coalition rightly opposes it.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (19:46):  I also rise this evening to speak against the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. While the objectives of the bill may be sound, it has some deleterious consequences. The member for Hughes, who spoke very eloquently before me, outlined many of them here this evening.


Before I go into my concerns—and I have four to outline this evening—let me say a couple of things about the objectives of the bill and also the process for getting to where we are here. First of all, the objective. Ostensibly, the objective of this bill is to support the wage increases of workers in the childcare sector. We have no problem with this objective; it is an admirable objective because, as you would probably be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, childcare workers are not paid high salaries. They are paid ordinary salaries, like many other workers in the Australian community, so we have no problem with the objectives as such.


What we have difficulties with is that there is a process within the community and a legal framework that is already established for seeking legitimate wage increases. That process is through the Fair Work Commission. One can lodge claims there and people have the right to do so. We support those people with that right to lodge a claim. We submit that this would be the right process to go through in order to receive a salary increase, rather than coming into the parliament and having the parliament legislate a salary increase through a two-year special compensation package.


It is interesting to note that the union which is primarily behind this push has not lodged any formal request to the Fair Work Commission for a salary increase. Rather, the union is going to its puppet masters here in the Labor government and is getting a $300 million gift by going through this process rather than going through the process which every other Australian has to go through.


Let me also say about the process to get to where we are with this bill that I, along with the member for Grey, who will be speaking subsequent to me, sat in on a very brief inquiry which looked into this bill. One of the difficulties we had with this is that this bill was rushed into the parliament, rushed into an inquiry—we had one week at the most to look into this and to try to make some sensible findings—and then pushed through this parliament in the dying days of this government. This government has known that the election will be on 14 September since the beginning of the year. If this bill were so important, the government could have scheduled it properly so that it had a proper chance to be debated and considered, for a parliamentary inquiry to properly undertake an investigation and to improve the bill should that parliamentary inquiry find ways to improve it. But the government has not done that. To the contrary: it has rushed it through in the last couple of weeks along with many other pro-union bills in order to try to get them through in the dying days of this government. That is no way to run a country. This bill is illustrative of the very poor processes which this government undertakes.


Let me go to the substance of the bill. As I said at the outset, I have four concerns in relation to this bill and the effects it will have, despite having no objection to the objectives of the bill. My first concern is in relation to equity. The particular provisions will be of benefit to only about 40 per cent of childcare workers, while 60 per cent or more of childcare workers will miss out on this benefit. If we think that childcare workers are underpaid then surely all childcare workers should receive the salary increase rather than just 40 per cent of them. Many submissions to the public inquiry and other publicly made submissions make this exact point: that there is great inequity here that such a small section of the sector will be beneficiaries of this $300 million fund but the vast majority will not receive any of that funding.


My second concern relates to the fact that the bill, despite it going to have the effect of putting up salaries for at least 40 per cent of the childcare sector, has provision in it for only two years of funding. So years one and two are covered and provide that additional salary boost for 40 per cent of childcare workers, but after that there is no funding.


Ordinarily, if we have a program that is going to be ongoing it would be legislated for in the forward estimates for four years. That is how things are ordinarily done if you are serious about making a particular measure an ongoing one. But it seems that this government's only purpose for this bill is to get them through the election. It is to be sop to the unions to show that they care, to give them two years of funding and then to say, 'You will look after yourself after that.' But salaries will not come down after two years and someone else will then have to pay for those salaries—and that someone else, as the member for Herbert outlined, will be the parents. It will be the parents who have to pay for that.


So we have before us a structural fee increase in the childcare sector through this provision which will come into play in two years time if this bill goes through. That is what we have before us. It will be a further 10 per cent increase on childcare fees per day—a $10 per day increase—that parents will have to pay in two years time because the funding is only for that short period of time. Again, this government are not serious about this. If this government were honestly concerned with childcare workers' salaries and putting them on a sustainable ongoing footing, this would be for a four-year period and it would be an ongoing program—but it is not.


My third concern—and this is perhaps my greatest concern with the bill—is that it is basically just a sop to the unions. The bill does not specify precisely that one must be a union member to be a beneficiary of the $300 million fund, but that is how it is being interpreted across the sector—and, in practice, that is what is occurring. That is understood; it is known. It was the intent of this government to do so from the get-go, and that is the primary purpose of this bill. The primary purpose of this bill—make no bones about it—is for the Prime Minister to shore up the support of another union. The Prime Minister's leadership is under significant threat in the dying days of this government. She needs to get herself through these couple of weeks so that she can be Prime Minister leading up to the election, and she thinks that she can buy off an additional union through this particular measure. It is a $300 million purchase.


And it is not just this side of the parliament who is saying this, who is using such strident language. The Australian Childcare Alliance, who represent about 60 per cent of the childcare sector in this country, have written to all members of parliament with the following words: 


The Federal Government's recent release by the Prime Minister of a Grant funded program with $300 million to be paid over a two year period to lift the wages of early childhood educators, is nothing more than a gift by the government to the United Voice Union.


That is the Australian Childcare Alliance. They are the peak body for the childcare sector in this country. They themselves are saying that this is nothing more than gift by the government to the United Voice Union—a $300 million gift.


They also outline in their letter that each new member the United Voice union will recruit as a result of this process will pay about $572 per annum. And we know that that money will then be used at election time to support the re-election of the Gillard government—or the Rudd government or the Shorten government, whichever it may be come 14 September. That is how this is working. It is taxpayers' funds going to the union and then from the union being used to try to get the Gillard-Rudd-Shorten governments re-elected. It is an outrage—and it is such an outrage because it is not the first time this has been done.


We have in fact seen a similar pattern in the aged-care sector, where a very similar arrangement is being made to try to reunionise the aged-care sector in the dying days of this government. We have seen similar sweetheart deals in relation to the right of entry provisions which have been introduced by this government in recent weeks, which mean that any workplace in the country is in danger of a union official rocking up and entering into the lunchroom and trying to recruit members. No lunchroom is safe after the introduction of those provisions.


We have also seen it in relation to the aggressive attacks on the 457 visas which the immigration minister has unleashed over the last couple of weeks—attacking all of those terrific workers that we have in this country. Why are they doing that? They are doing it because the unions do not like the 457 visas and they are delivering for their paymasters in terms of cracking down on them. This bill is in the same vain as all of that. It is just a sop to the unions, as the Australian Childcare Alliance has said, and as we have seen elsewhere over the last few weeks in terms of delivering for their unions in the dying days of this government purely to shore up support for Julia Gillard personally to stay in the job for another couple of weeks.


Finally, my fourth concern is in relation to the centres that are not eligible for this funding. As I said at the get-go, only about 40 per cent of centres will be eligible to receive some of this $300 million in funding and 60 per cent of centres will receive no such funding but they will be negatively impacted by this bill. Why is that? It occurs because, if the salaries go up in 40 per cent of the childcare centres, naturally there will be additional claims made by the workers in the 60 per cent who are not beneficiaries of this bill. Those childcare centres will then have two choices. They can try to keep salaries at a lower rate compared to the 40 per cent—in which case they are likely to lose workers. They will find it difficult to retain staff and they will find it difficult to attract staff, particularly at a time when there is an acute shortage. That is one choice that they have, but they will have difficulties retaining and attracting staff.


The other option they have is to put up salaries, but knowing that that would have to be immediately passed on to the parents who use their childcare centre. It is estimated by the Australian Childcare Alliance that fees would have to go up by about $10 per day. This government has already passed a myriad of regulations in relation to the childcare sector, which is putting fees up by 10 to 15 per cent and pricing people out of the market. This bill will have the effect of putting up fees by an additional $10 per day. That will just mean that the people who are already struggling to make ends meet, already suffering from the increases in the carbon tax, already suffering from all the other prices that are going up as a result of this government's mismanagement and over-regulatory zeal, will then have to pay higher childcare fees on top of all of that.


The government was forewarned in relation to its regulations by the Productivity Commission that fees would have to go up 15 per cent if it went through with them. It went ahead with its regulations. We are forewarning the government here, as has the Australian Childcare Alliance, that if it goes ahead with this now, then fees will go up an additional $10 on top of that. That is what is at stake here. It is actually the affordability of child care centres. We think they need to be made more affordable, not less.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (20:01):  What fine words from the member for Aston, who sums up very well what this move by the government is about. As he said, I was the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment that did a very rushed inquiry into this bill, the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. I did speak on that report when it was tabled in the House, but I thought I would take this opportunity to further tease out some of the issues that I raised at that time.


I was very disappointed that we were not able to give this bill the consideration that I believe it needed. We had one short hearing from the department and a number of submissions—in fact, quite a number; 99, if I remember rightly—to the House of Representatives committee—largely expressing some distress with the legislation it must be said. Yet we had no time at all to call any of those contributors to come before the committee and express their concerns.


Earlier today the member for Barker spoke in his valedictory speech about the opportunity within this parliament for the House of Representatives committees to change their role somewhat. But unfortunately, under these kinds of timelines, there is an inability to appropriately consider legislation, as I think was intended originally under the new paradigm. It is unfortunate that in many cases much has been left wanting with these bill inquiries.


To the legislation itself, there is no doubt in my mind that this is really a fit-up. It is all about politics and not all that much about early years child care. It is difficult to rise and speak against a wage rise for people who are not highly paid, but when you realise, as I do, that the wage rise is only for a certain percentage of those in the industry—the government claims 40 per cent; in fact, others suggest it will only go so far as 27 per cent—and that the other 60 to 73 per cent will miss out, it is in itself very divisive.


Perhaps that is not that surprising because this government, this Prime Minister in particular, has chosen to be very divisive over a number of issues. There was the singling-out of wealthy miners. There is a case of dog whistling going on with the xenophobic calls around the 457s at the moment. There is certainly a tilt at men with blue ties. I would consider that the one I am wearing at the moment is a blue tie, but I do not think that that puts me in a box of unmentionable people. It is divisive within the industry. In fact, in the submissions made to the inquiry, Childcare Queensland, for instance, said:


The 27% - 40% of services that are successful in gaining the grant will only receive the funding for a period of two years as there is no provision for this grant funding to be continued past 30/06/2015. It will be extremely difficult for these services to reduce the wages at this time so they will all be forced to increase their fees by $10+ per child per day.


Kinda Kapers at Mount Hutton in New South Wales said:


This will create a two tiered wage system with centres who are not successful in attracting the grant money either dramatically increasing fees to enable them to match the wage increase or being unable to attract the very few trained staff who available for employment. Regional and rural centres will be most negatively affected as they are the centres currently most negatively impacted by the industry skill shortage.


I am sure you would understand that, Deputy Speaker Adams, as you do represent a large part of Tasmania that is regional.


That is a two-tiered system—there is no way of dressing that up. The big question is: what is to happen after the two years when the funding ceases? It is highly unlikely that these childcare centres will be able to encourage their staff to take a wage cut, and probably no-one would want to do that. So inevitably it will almost certainly lead to higher costs for those using the services. The other question, of course, is what happens to the 60 per cent to 73 per cent of childcare centres that do not get the extra funding in any case? I can tell you, Deputy Speaker, from the broad number of submissions that came in that a lot of people were very excited in the industry about the fact they may be getting a wage increase, only to be highly disillusioned when they found out that in fact it may not be coming their way. In fact, for the majority, it certainly will not be coming their way.


In particular, this divisiveness within the industry has caused widespread unhappiness. The Australian Childcare Alliance, for instance, noted that the announcement has already caused outrage and division amongst educators in the early education and childcare sector. Educators are understandably angry as their colleagues in the long day care centre across the road may receive the grant while they receive nothing. This is hardly a way to govern for all of Australia and I am very disappointed that the government should bring this legislation into the House dressed up as something which is benefiting the industry when in fact it is going to cause division and unhappiness throughout.


One of the things that particularly concerned the coalition members of the committee was the evidence we received about the campaign by the United Voice union with their Big Steps campaign which certainly preceded the government's announcement. It was commonly reported that the union was claiming centres could not qualify for the funding unless they had a 60 per cent unionised workforce. I am aware that the department wrote to one of the union officials and informed them what the correct state of play was, but we are given to understand that the campaign still continued and that, quite disturbingly, there was a sense of menace in the workplace. The Australian Childcare Alliance said:


During the last two years there has been considerable union activity at services Australia wide increasing substantially since the announcement of the EYQF grant by the Prime Minister. Many of our members have reported that this union activity has been intimidating to both themselves and their staff.


Our members around Australia have been advising us of the strong arm tactics that United Voice Union organisers who have been telling members that they must have 60 per cent plus membership to engage with them to submit the Enterprise Agreement.


Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would be very well aware that the minister for workplace relations only two weeks ago introduced legislation into this House around workplace bullying, which came after an inquiry that I was also the deputy chair of. While I did not agree with all of the recommendations that the government put forward on workplace bullying, we on the coalition were disappointed at the time the inquiry was formed that there was no provision to look at union bullying in the workplace. It would appear that it is alive and well. Certainly those quotes from the Australian Childcare Alliance say it all.


If that is the case and the union is using this government legislation to build membership, and they have lifted membership substantially around the campaign, it is worth noting that United Voice is a major contributor to the ALP. That synergy and those relationships that are behind the scenes are not clearly transparent on this legislation. It is one of the reasons that I will be voting against it. I think that the days of tip-offs and pay-offs for mates should be behind us. I believe the government will pay a heavy price for some of those links to the union movement in the very near future when the electors of Australia, perhaps on 14 September, come to have their judgment on this government.


All of us would like to see low-paid childcare workers adequately compensated in the workplace, but there is a course of action that workers and unions, if they wish, can take to achieve those wage outcomes. It was this government that established the Fair Work Commission, and there is a correct path for industry-wide wage increases should they choose to take that path. Up to this stage they have not chosen to do that. Instead they have done a deal with the government which will see, in effect, their members get the rewards and get the extra wage increase, and those who choose not to be members of the union will probably miss out. While I know that is not strictly the wording of the legislation, it is certainly the message that is out there in the workplace, and we should not allow that to happen.


I understand $300 million is about one-third of what is needed to give this $7 to $10 an hour increase that has been claimed as an outcome of this legislation and two years clearly is not adequate. It is just about a short-term time frame. In fact, I believe overall it creates more problems for the industry, more problems for the workers, than it solves. What it does do is try to push a political problem and a political kickback just a little further down the track and to push greater problems onto a government in two years time when this finding will cease. Whoever is in government at that time will be faced with a very loud call from those people who have been receiving the higher wages for government to continue what is, in effect, a subsidy. That will be at a time when childcare subsidies, the assistance for parents to purchase child care, will have been frozen. It is unbalanced; it is not good legislation.


It is divisive, to come back to my original point. It is pitting Australians against Australians. It will be pitting those who receive the money against those who miss out. It will be pitting long-term day care up against short-term day care and these are not good outcomes. What we need is fairness right across every industry in the way that we deal with people, not selectivity and not picking out favourites and giving kickbacks and support for those that support us. When either side of parliament forms a government, it should be for all Australians, not for selected Australians, and I will be opposing the legislation.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (20:14):  I rise to speak on and oppose the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013, particularly from the perspective of the regional and rural centres. Those that I know in my electorate are going to be so badly affected by this. I know it because they have told me so. For those who are watching this debate tonight, I am sure this will lead to yet another sleepless night for them and I know they have had plenty of those since they first saw this legislation. We do know that this is just another rushed bill into this parliament. There has been no time for an appropriate parliamentary inquiry, as we heard from the two previous speakers.


Critically, this is just another piece of divisive legislation from this government and one that is really going to impact most on rural and regional day care centres. It is going to impact on the childcare centres in my electorate of Forrest because the legislation is basically going to establish a $300 million fund to provide wage increases to just around 30 or 40 per cent of just the long day care workforce, and only for two years. To achieve this the centres will have to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement with their staff and meet the eligibility criteria. As we know, given that limited pool of funds, it will be on, what, a first-in first-served basis or preferential? How will it actually work? What we do know is that there is only funding for two years and it is all being done on borrowed money by the government. We do know this was part of the union United Voice's Big Steps campaign. We do know that childcare workers and educators are low paid and any wage increase should come about through the ruling of the Fair Work Commission. This is the body that this government itself established and it has the responsibility for determining what are appropriate and fair levels of remuneration. But we do know that United Voice, the union, has refused to lodge a wage claim with the Fair Work Commission, preferring instead for the government to just hand over the money but only to the favoured few. It is, as we know, just an appeasement to the unions and is really divisive. 


This is picking winners and losers again with two types of child care: the educators in long day care centres that are eligible for the pay increase and those that are not, which will see family day care, occasional day care, budget based care excluded—there are so many of those in my electorate—in spite of the roles they perform being very similar. Two types of childcare workers: those who are union members of United Voice, who will receive this funding increase, and those who are not. Sixty per cent of childcare workers are going to miss out. The majority will miss out. So it is unfair and it is inequitable.


We know that the Australian Childcare Alliance represents approximately 70 per cent of Australia's long day care centres and they have grave concerns, as do their members. They have had a lot of representations from their members about what is contained in this bill. We know that there are still a lot of uncertainties around these actual grants, around the guidelines. We do not know what the guidelines are. We do not know how many workers will actually be eligible for the pay rise, but we do know how many will not: nearly 60 per cent of them will not in actual fact. And we do know that this will create a two-tiered system of those who receive this money and those who do not; those who are United Voice union members and those who are not. 


I have met a number of those who work in long day care and those who work in other sorts of child care in my community. They are all very concerned that their very good staff will be poached by the centres that can afford to offer the higher rate. I do know that there are managers and owners of centres in my electorate who are not sleeping, as I said, as a result of this. This threatens the very viability of their childcare and day care centres. They know that they are probably going to have to offer that higher rate of pay regardless, just to keep their staff. As I said, this will have a disproportionate impact in rural and regional areas like my own. They will have to do that to adhere to the National Quality Framework staffing requirements. 


There were thousands of submissions to the Senate inquiry, but the government allowed only a few days for reporting, so the process has been flawed. Not only is the legislation flawed and the intent of the legislation flawed, so has been the process. But it is something that is quite common with this government. I keep coming back to the fact that the government is proposing legislation where 60 per cent of centres will miss out and they will be likely forced to increase wages just to keep their staff. That is what will happen. That means that the parents are going to pay more.


Long day care KU Children's Services stated in a submission to the inquiry that the introduction of this fund to a portion of the sector will result in a division within the organisation. That is guaranteed, it is there now. The government has created this. KU Children's Services pointed out that since the 1980s many have worked tirelessly to remove the divide between preschool and long day care, yet the government has reignited that, driven a wedge down the middle and said, 'Here you are: 60 per cent this side, 30 to 40 per cent the other.' 


As the Child Care Association of WA pointed out in their submission, the bill does not consider the outcome of the fund on the sector as a whole. The government is also failing to allow time for the grants guidelines to be published before proceeding with the bill—process flawed again. Many of the submissions to both the House and Senate inquiries from centres have been extensively noting a campaign of union misinformation and quite seriously, as we heard, in some cases bullying of centre owners and childcare workers. 


I also heard that, as part of the Big Steps, United Voice's campaign, evidence or information was given to the effect that someone posted a photograph on Facebook of the home of the president of the Australian Childcare Alliance. With the work that I do in cyberbullying I find that just extraordinary. What form of bullying is that? Is that what we have come to in this place? That is exactly what this legislation has provoked. Some workers have been told that if they do not sign up to their union, their colleagues will not receive a pay rise. Claims were made throughout those inquiries. One union stated, under the heading 'How does my centre qualify?': 


1. Join United Voice.


2. United Voice negotiates a new EBA.


3. Sign agreement. Owner-operator signs agreements with government.


4. Get the raise.


Despite the department claiming that the actual amount of wage increase was to be determined by a seven-member panel, United Voice provided a handy chart for members, telling them exactly what they would get. So, clearly, United Voice knows more than the panel itself. Of course, this is a poorly designed and inequitable proposal, but it certainly will have far-reaching negative impacts, particularly on regional and rural areas, on regional and rural centres and, more importantly, on the families that rely on those great services provided. 


I want to acknowledge the wonderful job that centres in my electorate of Forrest do for families, who trust them to provide quality day care for their children. The service they provide allows parents to return to workplaces as needed, knowing that their children are safe and sound in a supportive, nurturing, caring and learning environment. In the two regional cities of Bunbury and Busselton in my electorate hundreds of families rely on this service, yet the government is putting that at risk. There are 43 childcare centres in the greater Bunbury area and another 17 based in Busselton and Dunsborough, not to mention another dozen or so in the wonderful little country towns throughout the Forrest electorate. The structural changes that the government has made will have a particular impact on these regional centres where there is already an ongoing need and a shortage of qualified staff. I heard about this from the childcare centres.


There is a major financial cost. Established centres are now fearful of their future. That is what this proposal has done. They are fearful of their future and their capacity to provide this great service to families in my electorate. By offering that government funded wage rise to perhaps one-third of the centres just so that centres are able to keep their staff and attract new ones, the Labor government has created division, inequity and a wage war between centres. For a medium-sized private childcare centre the costs are in the extreme. To match the wage rise of $3 to $4, the owner of one Bunbury childcare centre, with 20 staff, told me that it will cost her business $200,000 a year in extra wages and associated payments. A medium-sized centre like this one has about 150 to 200 families, which rely on the centre to provide quality child care, which they trust, and they do it at an affordable price for these families. So to absorb a wage blow-out of $200,000, centres will be forced—they have no choice; they cannot absorb this cost—to raise their fees, possibly by $10 a day per child.


So, for the working families in my electorate, this is about another $200 a month on top of their current fees. This is what is happening right now. I have spoken with childcare centres. The owners and managers of these centres are not sleeping, worrying about the impact on the families and how many children they will lose and whether their centres will be viable. Unfortunately, this will make the unionised government-funded centres more attractive for families because of cheaper rates, which they can afford.


When a child in care costs about the same as a mortgage payment, this has huge impacts on families making decisions about whether they can afford another child or whether one parent has no choice but to drop out of the workplace. I have seen firsthand the anguish and the fear of the childcare centre owner. I referred to her earlier. It is palpable and I know that she is not sleeping. Her feelings are shared by about a dozen others who attended childcare forums I put on two weeks ago with the shadow minister for childcare, Sussan Ley. They realise that they will be forced to pay the extra wages. It is a blatant exercise by the government to impose a political allegiance to and ideology on its union masters in a sector whose primary goal should really be that of being there for the benefit of these great kids and their families by providing great child care.


Of course, this proposal is divisive and unfair. It is an issue of equity and fairness. The government is proposing only two years of funding. Parents will have to pay even more beyond that two years. Sixty per cent of parents in my electorate who will not be funded under this legislation will have to pay now. Of course, the other 40 per cent will pay the extra beyond the two years, because the government has only funded this for two years. So it is a false promise. Centres are forced to pay more just to retain their staff. They are great staff, who do a fantastic job with our young people. 


As I have said, only union members will receive this benefit. So many of them right now around Australia must believe that they are actually going to receive this pay rise—that is, after they have paid their union fees. But I wonder how many, in reality, will actually receive it. I wonder how much they will receive over and above the union fees for what they do. I am profoundly concerned for the childcare centres in my electorate. I have met their staff. As I said, their concern and fear about their viability is palpable and the impact on the 60 per cent of families who will miss out will be direct, and then it will be compounded after the two years when the funding runs out. I oppose this measure.

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2013-06-25,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (20:35):  I wish to speak on the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013, which I oppose in its entirety. This legislation seeks to establish a $300 million fund to provide wage increases to around 30 to 40 per cent, although this figure is not clear, of the long day care workforce and it only lasts for two years. As for what happens after two years, we guess it reverts back to where it is today. The centres will need to enter into enterprise bargaining agreements with staff and meet eligibility criteria. Given the limited pool of funds, it could be on a 'first in' basis, yet this is not even clear. After the two years workers will revert back to their previous wage. This would be history-making if this were the case. This bill is unbalanced. It is divisive, it is unfair and it will create a wage war.


The bill has come around as a result of the union involved waging the Big Steps campaign, seeking to increase wages and conditions in the early childhood sector. The United Voice union—previously the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union, or the LHMU—have been campaigning for an increase in childcare sector wages since 2008, with their requests for increases ranging between $7 and $10 an hour. They proposed that the government fund this increase, and they were actually originally looking for $1.4 billion a year—and indexed.


The coalition have a number of serious concerns with this bill. We do not dispute that childcare educators are low paid. We know these workers are skilled and work long and hard hours. Any wage increase should come through the Fair Work Commission, the body that the government has established with the responsibility of determining appropriate and fair levels of remuneration. Yet the United Voice union has refused to lodge a wage claim with the Fair Work Commission. Can you believe this? They rely instead on a Labor government to just hand over money hand over fist. It is unheard of.


This $300 million is nothing more than an act of appeasement to the unions, which will use it to enable them to go on a recruitment drive within the sector. In my seat of Flynn union delegates have been around the child-minding centres, telling the workers and management that, if the staff do not join the unions, which will cost around $500 a year, they will not be eligible for this pay rise. When they are confronted with this, they say they do not know anything about it, but I can tell the House that I have numerous people saying they have gone to just about every agency that I know of. They have been there. They have even got the contracts to join the union. This $300 million is nothing more than an act of appeasement to the unions and has to be stopped.


How is the increase in salaries going to be distributed to roughly one-third of the staff? How does this work in practice? It does not. It is going to send a wedge through the workforce. Thirty per cent are going to get a wage rise; the other 70 per cent will miss out. This is going to cause bedlam in the industry. You will have staff jumping ship and going to where they can gain $7 to $10 an hour extra in their pay. Why wouldn't you jump the fence if it meant getting an extra $400 a week in your pay packet? Think of the carnage it is going to cause. The operators, if they want to stop the staff from jumping the fence, will have to increase their wages, and where does this money come from? They will have to put their fees up, and it is going to have to come from the public themselves. It is a very unfair system. How can anyone rule that one-third of the workforce gets it and two-thirds miss out? It is totally incredible that anyone could devise a bill that would say that to the staff. Imagine if one-third of your staff had the wage increase and two-thirds did not have it. What would you tell them as an employer? You would be ducking for cover.


We are still unsure how many workers will be eligible for the pay rise. There is even an argument going on between Minister Garrett, who says 68,000 people are involved, and the media, who say there are 78,000. There is a difference of 10,000 staff.




Mr McCormack:
  They were never good at figures!




Mr O'DOWD:
  You are right. But this is just a debacle. How anyone can vote yes on this has got me.


Thirty to forty per cent is a pretty rough guide too. The government have established, to their credit, a seven-member panel that has the responsibility for deciding the criteria centres will need to meet in order to be eligible for the funding. I would like to sit in on that meeting and see how that works! Yet these guidelines are not yet determined, meaning they are unable to consider whether they are fair or unreasonable.


This bit of legislation is being rushed through at a hundred miles an hour so that no-one really knows the facts or how this bill is going to work. It sounds to me a bit like the grabbing of funds from bank accounts and superannuation funds. They can take it all right, but they have no idea how they are going to return the funds once the public realise the funds have gone out of their account and they squeal. They do not know how they are going to give it back. This sort of legislation has been rushed through this House time and time again. The public is getting pretty sick of it.


Membership of the panel seems deliberately slanted away from the private sector, though the unions secured a seat around the table. The coalition has extensive correspondence with childcare providers regarding this bill. The childcare sector as a whole expresses concern that the $300 million fund will create a two-tier system, driving a wedge in the system. You are going to have two classes of workers. Is this fair? They are gravely concerned that the centres that are not successful in securing funding will have their staff poached by the other centres. The staff will be very hard to retain if there is a difference of $400 a week in their pay packets. How are they going to hold onto those staff? A number of centre owners have indicated they will have to offer a higher wage rate in order to keep the staff and adhere to the national quality framework staffing requirements.


The coalition referred the bill to the House standing committee, and the bill was automatically referred to the Senate committee for an inquiry; however, at the end of the day, this bill is being rushed through without proper consideration. I have a letter here from a child-minding centre in my area. It says: 


It distresses me greatly to have the uncertainty that this bill focusses on our profession. The problems that I see with this Bill are as follows:


There is simply not enough money for the process to be effective. First not all services will be able to access the grant. The big question is how will it be decided who will miss out …


It goes on:


There seems to be absolutely no link between who gets the grant and the quality of the service.


… … …


Even if the grant is obtained there is no guide to who is able to receive it within the service. 


… … …


Ability to plan for the future is compromised due to the grant dropping back in 2 years. It would not be sustainable to keep fees reduced and maintain approx an extra $85,000 to the bottom line.


Another letter says:


In regards to the current talks of a pay rise to the Child Care industry I am totally confused and dumbfounded. After hearing about a pay rise to the industry we had a visit from United Voice in April who informed us they would be responsible for deciding which Child Care Centres would be receiving the pay rise and that it would go first to the centres with the highest Union membership. 


That is a quote from a union delegate. It says further:


None of our employees were happy about this, including our Director. The Union rep when later talking to the employees told them that most people had signed up and that … our Director, was fully on-board. 


This was not the case. The letter goes on:


… had earlier had strong words with the rep but like the rest of us had felt strong pressure to join up, believing this was our only way to be in the running to receive the raise. The Union told us the only other way to be in the running was to privately organise as an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement which would cost of tens of thousands of dollars. 


If that is not bullying, I do not know what is. It further says:


I have personally tried to find out information regarding the how, where's, why's, and whose of this whole thing and the only information I have been able to find is very vague and left me more and more confused. 


'Can you please help me with this important legislation and please oppose it at every opportunity.' That was from two childminding centres in my area. Some workers have been told they do not get it if they do not sign up and their colleagues will not receive a pay rise. Employees signing up and committing to pay more than $500 a year in union fees are falsely being led to believe that they will be guaranteed a pay rise. There is much confusion out in the workplace. It is divisive. It is unbalanced. It is not fair and that is why I totally oppose this bill. I think it is the worst bill that I have come across in my three years in parliament.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-25,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (20:48):  Quality childcare services and facilities are an integral component to modern Australian families. As the requirement of more families grows to have a dual income stream in order to keep pace with the cost of living, so too does the need for childcare centres. The cost of child care is high and it is increasing. Many families have to make savings in other areas of the household budget in order to afford care for their children. With the cost of living rising and quality child care becoming more and more unaffordable for families, the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013 is set to pass yet another cost on to families.


This bill is seeking to establish the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account. This account will provide wage increases to long day care workers, costing some $300 million over two years. It is important that our childcare centres, particularly those in rural and regional areas, remain well staffed with highly trained and skilled professionals and have the resources they need to carry out their work. But, in typical Labor style, this bill is seeking to achieve that by caving in to the demands of unions and adding caveats to funding which require childcare centres to increase their levels of union membership.


There is nothing wrong with being in a union. I was a member of the Australian Journalists Association and later the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance for more than 20 years.




Ms Plibersek:
  Did they kick you out?




Mr McCORMACK:
  No, they certainly did not kick me out, Minister. In fact, they were very pleased to take my union membership fees, and I know that they put them to good use. Unfortunately, I note some other unions' fees have not been put to good use. We have certainly heard that in this federal parliament in so many other ways and means and forms. But, thanks for the interjection, Minister. I do hope you stay at the table because I want to give you in particular a mention a little later on and it is going to be a nice mention, so stay tuned.


As a former business owner and as a former member of a union, I know how important it is to ensure that unions do not have unfettered power within a workplace. This is exactly what the Labor Party are seeking to do. We know this bill will provide a $300 million fund over two years to provide pay increases to childcare workers. What those opposite may not mention, however, is the fact that the genesis of this bill came from the Big Steps campaign mounted by United Voice. 


In order to comply with the United Voice's demands, this bill will require childcare centres to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement in order to qualify for the funding. In addition to this, a seven-member panel consisting of community and strong union representation will make determinations as to a childcare centre's eligibility. Childcare centres across the country are very, very concerned about this legislation. We have just heard the member for Flynn read some letters from his electorate of the concerns expressed by good people in his electorate about this legislation. We have heard other members on this side express similar suspicions and concerns about this bill.


Childcare centres are worried that if their application for funding is unsuccessful then they will have to pay the pay increases themselves. Imagine where that additional funding is going to come from—straight out of the hip pockets of families whose children are in the centre. This is a particular concern in regional areas. 


Recently, I visited the Billylids Early Learning Child Care Centre at Hillston and the minister at the table, the Minister for Health, might be interested to know—Minister, I hope you are listening.




Ms Plibersek:
  Intently.




Mr McCORMACK:
  As you should be. The people of Hillston were very appreciative of the $6 million that was part of the Health and Hospitals Fund that they received in the 2012 budget for a multipurpose service redevelopment. I acknowledge that. The people of Hillston are remote. They deserve the very best medical services that they can receive and they, like anybody else in regional Australia, deserve to have as good a medical service and facilities as anyone living in a metropolitan centre. I know the minister knows that. I know the member for Bowman, who has a shadow portfolio area in that respect, knows it as well.


At Hillston, I visited the Billylids childcare centre, which is having difficulty meeting costs since the establishment of a second centre in the town. Hillston Billylids is a not-for-profit community-owned organisation that is licensed to operate as a 33-place long day care centre in Hillston. It has done so since 2000. Indeed, it was opened by my predecessor Kay Hull, and I know the minister would acknowledge the work that she did on behalf of the Riverina and especially on behalf of healthcare services in rural, regional and remote Australia. She is still doing it. The minister knows that she is still doing it as an executive member of Can Assist as well as in palliative care, to services for Wagga Wagga, and in an effort—and I know the minister knows this because I am on that committee as well—to get a rural medical school at Wagga Wagga where one is very much needed.


Let me go back to Billylids, which has been receiving funding through Long Day Care Sustainability Assistance from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. The centre has relied heavily on this funding to support the vital community service it has provided to the Hillston community and surrounding region. Hillston Billylids provides the bulk of care to the community as it is licensed to have 33 children on one day. Currently, this is restricted to 29 as they do not have, and could not afford, an early childhood teacher. Currently, utilisation of the centre is 52 per cent and, unfortunately, with changes to fees which need to occur within the centre it is anticipated that the utilisation rate will drop even further, and that is a great shame.


The only way Hillston Billylids can see itself to be financially viable is to increase the fees by about $20. If fees are to be increased by this amount, a large proportion of families will not be able to afford the child care offered by this organisation and that will inevitably result in the closure of the community-owned centre. That is a great shame, particularly for a town the size of Hillston in a locality as remote as Hillston. The alternatives are few. With children split between the two centres, Hillston Billylids in April lost the support it had through the Community Support Program.


The President of the Hillston Billylids Management Committee, Shaina Peters, wrote to me and asked me to approach the Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare to request an extension of the funding arrangement, given the realities of alternative employment for workers who would lose their jobs after this funding was taken away. But the minister has deemed that the Hillston Billylids childcare centre is ineligible for sustainability assistance under the Community Support Program. Now, as if to rub salt into the wounds of the employees at the Hillston Billylids childcare centre, whose future is in jeopardy thanks to the removal of support funding from the federal government, Labor is trying to demand at the behest of the unions that childcare workers enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement.


I will read a little from a letter of 2 April from the General Manager of the Carrathool Shire Council, Ken Croskell, in relation to the Hillston Billylids Early Learning Child Care Centre. The letter states:


The Centre, which is solely operated as a community owned venture, is currently under threat to its long term sustainability …


…   …   …


The loss of funding equates to $47,000 annually and the Hillston Billylids will need to seek options to remain viable in the future. The most likely option is an increase in fees which may well drive many of their patrons to the privately operated centre and which may ultimately result in the closure of the community based centre which would be disastrous for Hillston and its ability to provide adequate long day care and child care (33 places down to 16).


The Mayor of Carrathool Shire, Peter Laird, was here in Parliament House only last week. He is a good man; he runs a good council. The Hillston community deserves the very best it can receive. 


Let us be clear about this bill before us. This is not an attempt to ensure more families can access quality child care with skilled and highly qualified carers. This is an attempt to put the unions' stamp back on this sector. Why else would United Voice be approaching centres requesting they enter into a memorandum of understanding requiring paid staff meetings and an ongoing commitment to the Big Steps program? Why indeed? Why else would United Voice have also been going around childcare centres informing owners they require 60 per cent union membership if the owners want their enterprise agreement given priority treatment? Because this is not about the cost of living and it is not about families. This is about restoring the power of the unions, which brought most of those opposite to this place. We can hear them backwards and forwards about this because this bill is important, and Labor is very insistent on getting to the forefront its union power in these last few remaining days of parliament. 


This is a plan from the same party that espouses the virtues of governing in the interests of working families. There is no argument from this side of the House: working families are very important. They keep small business running and small business is the engine room of the economy. But we cannot keep hitting working families again and again and again. Doesn't Labor think those working families would want child care to be affordable? Of course they do. Doesn't Labor think that community-owned not-for-profit facilities such as Hillston Billylids should be able to access funding from the government to ensure it can continue to provide such a vital community service to such a good community? Hillston certainly is a good community.


On 12 July last year I was very pleased to have the shadow minister for childcare, Sussan Ley, who is the member for Farrer—a neighbouring electorate to mine—visit Wagga Wagga. The member for Farrer knows the demands which are placed on rural and regional families. When it comes to childcare needs, and particularly how the rising cost of living is placing additional stresses on families who need to access affordable care for their children, the member for Farrer gets it. She understands regional areas and she certainly understands how difficult it is for families to access childcare. She knows the strains that people are under, let alone when people are hit again and again with higher and higher costs, which is what is going to result from this legislation.


Forcing childcare providers to fund additional spending on wages when government support is cordoned for those who ensure their staffroom is filled with union members is not addressing the rising cost of living, nor is forcing childcare providers who do not receive this funding to pass on the same pay rise to families of the facilities. This is the Labor Party giving in to the bullying tactics of the unions. This is the Labor Party giving in to these bullying tactics. We have seen it all too often. We have seen it time and again—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  I hear the member for Kooyong cry out, he knows of the folly of having unions running the government. He knows the folly of having unions running policy and legislation. This sort of behaviour should not be condoned. This is why I join my coalition colleagues in opposing this bill. It does need to be opposed. It is bad legislation and, like so many other things in these last sitting days of this 43rd Parliament, it is being rushed through. We have heard the Senate bells going again and again tonight as senators are scurrying about trying to get through legislation. We have got so many pieces of legislation that still need to be passed and speakers are being gagged. So many pieces of legislation are being guillotined. 



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  It is a shame and, as I heard the member for Flynn say, the public deserve better. They expect better. They demand better. I certainly do hope that after 14 September they do receive better government because we need better governance.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  I am surprised that the minister is calling out because I know she knows how important families are. They do not need to be hit with higher and higher costs. They certainly do not need to be hit with more costs at the behest of union members. As I said previously, I was a member of a union. There is nothing wrong with being a member of a union. But union fees need to be used wisely. Certainly union members need to know that their fees are going to go where they are intended.


The coalition have serious concerns with this bill. We do not dispute that childcare workers, childcare educators, are low paid. Any wage increase should come about through the ruling of the Fair Work Commission, the body that this government established. It set it up with the responsibility for determining appropriate levels of remuneration. This is not good legislation. It needs to be rejected. Certainly the people of Hillston think that, certainly the people of the Riverina think that and I hope this parliament thinks the same.

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2013-06-25,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (21:03):  I would like to provide some summing up comments for this Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013 by noting that the government has a proud record of supporting early childhood development and this bill is another example of that support. Over the next four years the government will invest a record $25 billion in early childhood education and care, of which $22.1 billion will be in direct childcare assistance to parents. That is more than triple the investment in the four years prior to 2007, making direct improvements to the lives of children and families. To the members opposite, all I would say is: this government has truly recognised how absolutely crucial it is to provide the appropriate commensurate level of investment into the early years, into childhood care and education so that we can get young Australians on a solid foundation for the rest of their learning journey.


The Early Years Quality Fund is another demonstration of the government's commitment to the sector and this time to the dedicated educators who work with children every day. I stress that these people are educators, not babysitters. This bill provides a wage of recognition of the important work they do and the critical education and care service they provide for Australian families. That is about ensuring that children have access to high-quality early childhood education and care experiences and the enormous benefits that that provides for children themselves, for their families and for the country as a whole.


I think it is fair to say that the enormous growth in the use of early childhood education and care services means that the need to ensure that there is a qualified and professional workforce is now more important than ever. The Early Years Quality Fund provides $300 million over two years in grants directly to long day care centres to supplement wage increases for educators. Funding will be provided directly to approved services to improve quality outcomes for children by supplementing wage increases. The Early Years Quality Fund will help early childhood education and care services attract and retain qualified professionals and assist in raising the professional status of the sector. The Early Years Quality Fund will further support the effective implementation of the National Quality Framework, including the educator qualification requirements commencing in 2014. 


To provide these high-quality services we now need to attract, retain and upskill qualified and committed educators to manage the ever-increasing demand in the sector. We certainly understand that support is needed for the early childhood education and care sector to meet these increased requirements embedded in the National Quality Framework and of course meet increasing growth in demand. Increased wages through the Early Years Quality Fund will provide some of that support.


I acknowledge the concerns that have been raised within the early childhood education and care sector through the committee inquiries relating to the bill. There have been concerns raised regarding the requirement for an enterprise agreement. It is important to understand that the requirement for an enterprise agreement will ensure there is a legal framework in place for the funding to flow on to workers' wages. For individual educators, having an enterprise agreement in place ensures they have a statutory enforceable right to receive the pay increases granted under the fund.


Some in the sector have also raised concerns that the quantum of funding does not provide an increase for all educators, and some have called for a smaller increase that can be distributed to all educators in the sector. I acknowledge these concerns and I know that there is more to be done within this sector to ensure that we attract and retain qualified, respected educators who are being remunerated in a way that shows their value to the Australian society and the future of Australian children.


In a challenging fiscal environment this government has made record investments in early childhood education and care, and by committing a further $300 million to support a quality early childhood workforce the government has acted to keep qualified and professional educators in the sector, maintaining the relationship with children and families that we know are so important to outcomes for children. We are laying the foundation for longer term sustainable professionalism of the early childhood sector.


I can say that a new Pay Equity Unit will be established in the Fair Work Commission, with a focus on conducting research and additionally collecting data and specialist pay equity information to inform matters related to pay equity under the Fair Work Act, modern award reviews and annual minimum wage decisions. While the Early Years Quality Fund will initially help the sector retain qualified workers, the Pay Equity Unit will examine gender and pay equity issues, particularly in female dominated areas such as child care.


I conclude by saying that I have been privileged to have the opportunity to visit many early childhood education and care centres. I have listened to the staff and the parents who say how important it is that these educators are recognised for the work they do. The government agrees with them, and the Early Years Quality Fund is a step towards achieving that recognition. I encourage the House to also agree and to vote to provide these committed and critical yet low-paid workers with the opportunity to gain the pay increase that they so surely deserve. I commend the bill to the House.

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2013-06-25,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (20:35):  I wish to speak on the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013, which I oppose in its entirety. This legislation seeks to establish a $300 million fund to provide wage increases to around 30 to 40 per cent, although this figure is not clear, of the long day care workforce and it only lasts for two years. As for what happens after two years, we guess it reverts back to where it is today. The centres will need to enter into enterprise bargaining agreements with staff and meet eligibility criteria. Given the limited pool of funds, it could be on a 'first in' basis, yet this is not even clear. After the two years workers will revert back to their previous wage. This would be history-making if this were the case. This bill is unbalanced. It is divisive, it is unfair and it will create a wage war.


The bill has come around as a result of the union involved waging the Big Steps campaign, seeking to increase wages and conditions in the early childhood sector. The United Voice union—previously the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union, or the LHMU—have been campaigning for an increase in childcare sector wages since 2008, with their requests for increases ranging between $7 and $10 an hour. They proposed that the government fund this increase, and they were actually originally looking for $1.4 billion a year—and indexed.


The coalition have a number of serious concerns with this bill. We do not dispute that childcare educators are low paid. We know these workers are skilled and work long and hard hours. Any wage increase should come through the Fair Work Commission, the body that the government has established with the responsibility of determining appropriate and fair levels of remuneration. Yet the United Voice union has refused to lodge a wage claim with the Fair Work Commission. Can you believe this? They rely instead on a Labor government to just hand over money hand over fist. It is unheard of.


This $300 million is nothing more than an act of appeasement to the unions, which will use it to enable them to go on a recruitment drive within the sector. In my seat of Flynn union delegates have been around the child-minding centres, telling the workers and management that, if the staff do not join the unions, which will cost around $500 a year, they will not be eligible for this pay rise. When they are confronted with this, they say they do not know anything about it, but I can tell the House that I have numerous people saying they have gone to just about every agency that I know of. They have been there. They have even got the contracts to join the union. This $300 million is nothing more than an act of appeasement to the unions and has to be stopped.


How is the increase in salaries going to be distributed to roughly one-third of the staff? How does this work in practice? It does not. It is going to send a wedge through the workforce. Thirty per cent are going to get a wage rise; the other 70 per cent will miss out. This is going to cause bedlam in the industry. You will have staff jumping ship and going to where they can gain $7 to $10 an hour extra in their pay. Why wouldn't you jump the fence if it meant getting an extra $400 a week in your pay packet? Think of the carnage it is going to cause. The operators, if they want to stop the staff from jumping the fence, will have to increase their wages, and where does this money come from? They will have to put their fees up, and it is going to have to come from the public themselves. It is a very unfair system. How can anyone rule that one-third of the workforce gets it and two-thirds miss out? It is totally incredible that anyone could devise a bill that would say that to the staff. Imagine if one-third of your staff had the wage increase and two-thirds did not have it. What would you tell them as an employer? You would be ducking for cover.


We are still unsure how many workers will be eligible for the pay rise. There is even an argument going on between Minister Garrett, who says 68,000 people are involved, and the media, who say there are 78,000. There is a difference of 10,000 staff.




Mr McCormack:

There is nothing wrong with being in a union. I was a member of the Australian Journalists Association and later the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance for more than 20 years.




Ms Plibersek:
  Did they kick you out?




Mr McCORMACK:
  No, they certainly did not kick me out, Minister. In fact, they were very pleased to take my union membership fees, and I know that they put them to good use. Unfortunately, I note some other unions' fees have not been put to good use. We have certainly heard that in this federal parliament in so many other ways and means and forms. But, thanks for the interjection, Minister. I do hope you stay at the table because I want to give you in particular a mention a little later on and it is going to be a nice mention, so stay tuned.


As a former business owner and as a former member of a union, I know how important it is to ensure that unions do not have unfettered power within a workplace. This is exactly what the Labor Party are seeking to do. We know this bill will provide a $300 million fund over two years to provide pay increases to childcare workers. What those opposite may not mention, however, is the fact that the genesis of this bill came from the Big Steps campaign mounted by United Voice. 


In order to comply with the United Voice's demands, this bill will require childcare centres to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement in order to qualify for the funding. In addition to this, a seven-member panel consisting of community and strong union representation will make determinations as to a childcare centre's eligibility. Childcare centres across the country are very, very concerned about this legislation. We have just heard the member for Flynn read some letters from his electorate of the concerns expressed by good people in his electorate about this legislation. We have heard other members on this side express similar suspicions and concerns about this bill.


Childcare centres are worried that if their application for funding is unsuccessful then they will have to pay the pay increases themselves. Imagine where that additional funding is going to come from—straight out of the hip pockets of families whose children are in the centre. This is a particular concern in regional areas. 


Recently, I visited the Billylids Early Learning Child Care Centre at Hillston and the minister at the table, the Minister for Health, might be interested to know—Minister, I hope you are listening.




Ms Plibersek:
  Intently.




Mr McCORMACK:
  As you should be. The people of Hillston were very appreciative of the $6 million that was part of the Health and Hospitals Fund that they received in the 2012 budget for a multipurpose service redevelopment. I acknowledge that. The people of Hillston are remote. They deserve the very best medical services that they can receive and they, like anybody else in regional Australia, deserve to have as good a medical service and facilities as anyone living in a metropolitan centre. I know the minister knows that. I know the member for Bowman, who has a shadow portfolio area in that respect, knows it as well.


At Hillston, I visited the Billylids childcare centre, which is having difficulty meeting costs since the establishment of a second centre in the town. Hillston Billylids is a not-for-profit community-owned organisation that is licensed to operate as a 33-place long day care centre in Hillston. It has done so since 2000. Indeed, it was opened by my predecessor Kay Hull, and I know the minister would acknowledge the work that she did on behalf of the Riverina and especially on behalf of healthcare services in rural, regional and remote Australia. She is still doing it. The minister knows that she is still doing it as an executive member of Can Assist as well as in palliative care, to services for Wagga Wagga, and in an effort—and I know the minister knows this because I am on that committee as well—to get a rural medical school at Wagga Wagga where one is very much needed.


Let me go back to Billylids, which has been receiving funding through Long Day Care Sustainability Assistance from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. The centre has relied heavily on this funding to support the vital community service it has provided to the Hillston community and surrounding region. Hillston Billylids provides the bulk of care to the community as it is licensed to have 33 children on one day. Currently, this is restricted to 29 as they do not have, and could not afford, an early childhood teacher. Currently, utilisation of the centre is 52 per cent and, unfortunately, with changes to fees which need to occur within the centre it is anticipated that the utilisation rate will drop even further, and that is a great shame.


The only way Hillston Billylids can see itself to be financially viable is to increase the fees by about $20. If fees are to be increased by this amount, a large proportion of families will not be able to afford the child care offered by this organisation and that will inevitably result in the closure of the community-owned centre. That is a great shame, particularly for a town the size of Hillston in a locality as remote as Hillston. The alternatives are few. With children split between the two centres, Hillston Billylids in April lost the support it had through the Community Support Program.


The President of the Hillston Billylids Management Committee, Shaina Peters, wrote to me and asked me to approach the Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare to request an extension of the funding arrangement, given the realities of alternative employment for workers who would lose their jobs after this funding was taken away. But the minister has deemed that the Hillston Billylids childcare centre is ineligible for sustainability assistance under the Community Support Program. Now, as if to rub salt into the wounds of the employees at the Hillston Billylids childcare centre, whose future is in jeopardy thanks to the removal of support funding from the federal government, Labor is trying to demand at the behest of the unions that childcare workers enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement.


I will read a little from a letter of 2 April from the General Manager of the Carrathool Shire Council, Ken Croskell, in relation to the Hillston Billylids Early Learning Child Care Centre. The letter states:


The Centre, which is solely operated as a community owned venture, is currently under threat to its long term sustainability …


…   …   …


The loss of funding equates to $47,000 annually and the Hillston Billylids will need to seek options to remain viable in the future. The most likely option is an increase in fees which may well drive many of their patrons to the privately operated centre and which may ultimately result in the closure of the community based centre which would be disastrous for Hillston and its ability to provide adequate long day care and child care (33 places down to 16).


The Mayor of Carrathool Shire, Peter Laird, was here in Parliament House only last week. He is a good man; he runs a good council. The Hillston community deserves the very best it can receive. 


Let us be clear about this bill before us. This is not an attempt to ensure more families can access quality child care with skilled and highly qualified carers. This is an attempt to put the unions' stamp back on this sector. Why else would United Voice be approaching centres requesting they enter into a memorandum of understanding requiring paid staff meetings and an ongoing commitment to the Big Steps program? Why indeed? Why else would United Voice have also been going around childcare centres informing owners they require 60 per cent union membership if the owners want their enterprise agreement given priority treatment? Because this is not about the cost of living and it is not about families. This is about restoring the power of the unions, which brought most of those opposite to this place. We can hear them backwards and forwards about this because this bill is important, and Labor is very insistent on getting to the forefront its union power in these last few remaining days of parliament. 


This is a plan from the same party that espouses the virtues of governing in the interests of working families. There is no argument from this side of the House: working families are very important. They keep small business running and small business is the engine room of the economy. But we cannot keep hitting working families again and again and again. Doesn't Labor think those working families would want child care to be affordable? Of course they do. Doesn't Labor think that community-owned not-for-profit facilities such as Hillston Billylids should be able to access funding from the government to ensure it can continue to provide such a vital community service to such a good community? Hillston certainly is a good community.


On 12 July last year I was very pleased to have the shadow minister for childcare, Sussan Ley, who is the member for Farrer—a neighbouring electorate to mine—visit Wagga Wagga. The member for Farrer knows the demands which are placed on rural and regional families. When it comes to childcare needs, and particularly how the rising cost of living is placing additional stresses on families who need to access affordable care for their children, the member for Farrer gets it. She understands regional areas and she certainly understands how difficult it is for families to access childcare. She knows the strains that people are under, let alone when people are hit again and again with higher and higher costs, which is what is going to result from this legislation.


Forcing childcare providers to fund additional spending on wages when government support is cordoned for those who ensure their staffroom is filled with union members is not addressing the rising cost of living, nor is forcing childcare providers who do not receive this funding to pass on the same pay rise to families of the facilities. This is the Labor Party giving in to the bullying tactics of the unions. This is the Labor Party giving in to these bullying tactics. We have seen it all too often. We have seen it time and again—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  I hear the member for Kooyong cry out, he knows of the folly of having unions running the government. He knows the folly of having unions running policy and legislation. This sort of behaviour should not be condoned. This is why I join my coalition colleagues in opposing this bill. It does need to be opposed. It is bad legislation and, like so many other things in these last sitting days of this 43rd Parliament, it is being rushed through. We have heard the Senate bells going again and again tonight as senators are scurrying about trying to get through legislation. We have got so many pieces of legislation that still need to be passed and speakers are being gagged. So many pieces of legislation are being guillotined. 



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  It is a shame and, as I heard the member for Flynn say, the public deserve better. They expect better. They demand better. I certainly do hope that after 14 September they do receive better government because we need better governance.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  I am surprised that the minister is calling out because I know she knows how important families are. They do not need to be hit with higher and higher costs. They certainly do not need to be hit with more costs at the behest of union members. As I said previously, I was a member of a union. There is nothing wrong with being a member of a union. But union fees need to be used wisely. Certainly union members need to know that their fees are going to go where they are intended.


The coalition have serious concerns with this bill. We do not dispute that childcare workers, childcare educators, are low paid. Any wage increase should come about through the ruling of the Fair Work Commission, the body that this government established. It set it up with the responsibility for determining appropriate levels of remuneration. This is not good legislation. It needs to be rejected. Certainly the people of Hillston think that, certainly the people of the Riverina think that and I hope this parliament thinks the same.

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2013-06-25,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (21:03):  I would like to provide some summing up comments for this Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013 by noting that the government has a proud record of supporting early childhood development and this bill is another example of that support. Over the next four years the government will invest a record $25 billion in early childhood education and care, of which $22.1 billion will be in direct childcare assistance to parents. That is more than triple the investment in the four years prior to 2007, making direct improvements to the lives of children and families. To the members opposite, all I would say is: this government has truly recognised how absolutely crucial it is to provide the appropriate commensurate level of investment into the early years, into childhood care and education so that we can get young Australians on a solid foundation for the rest of their learning journey.


The Early Years Quality Fund is another demonstration of the government's commitment to the sector and this time to the dedicated educators who work with children every day. I stress that these people are educators, not babysitters. This bill provides a wage of recognition of the important work they do and the critical education and care service they provide for Australian families. That is about ensuring that children have access to high-quality early childhood education and care experiences and the enormous benefits that that provides for children themselves, for their families and for the country as a whole.


I think it is fair to say that the enormous growth in the use of early childhood education and care services means that the need to ensure that there is a qualified and professional workforce is now more important than ever. The Early Years Quality Fund provides $300 million over two years in grants directly to long day care centres to supplement wage increases for educators. Funding will be provided directly to approved services to improve quality outcomes for children by supplementing wage increases. The Early Years Quality Fund will help early childhood education and care services attract and retain qualified professionals and assist in raising the professional status of the sector. The Early Years Quality Fund will further support the effective implementation of the National Quality Framework, including the educator qualification requirements commencing in 2014. 


To provide these high-quality services we now need to attract, retain and upskill qualified and committed educators to manage the ever-increasing demand in the sector. We certainly understand that support is needed for the early childhood education and care sector to meet these increased requirements embedded in the National Quality Framework and of course meet increasing growth in demand. Increased wages through the Early Years Quality Fund will provide some of that support.


I acknowledge the concerns that have been raised within the early childhood education and care sector through the committee inquiries relating to the bill. There have been concerns raised regarding the requirement for an enterprise agreement. It is important to understand that the requirement for an enterprise agreement will ensure there is a legal framework in place for the funding to flow on to workers' wages. For individual educators, having an enterprise agreement in place ensures they have a statutory enforceable right to receive the pay increases granted under the fund.


Some in the sector have also raised concerns that the quantum of funding does not provide an increase for all educators, and some have called for a smaller increase that can be distributed to all educators in the sector. I acknowledge these concerns and I know that there is more to be done within this sector to ensure that we attract and retain qualified, respected educators who are being remunerated in a way that shows their value to the Australian society and the future of Australian children.


In a challenging fiscal environment this government has made record investments in early childhood education and care, and by committing a further $300 million to support a quality early childhood workforce the government has acted to keep qualified and professional educators in the sector, maintaining the relationship with children and families that we know are so important to outcomes for children. We are laying the foundation for longer term sustainable professionalism of the early childhood sector.


I can say that a new Pay Equity Unit will be established in the Fair Work Commission, with a focus on conducting research and additionally collecting data and specialist pay equity information to inform matters related to pay equity under the Fair Work Act, modern award reviews and annual minimum wage decisions. While the Early Years Quality Fund will initially help the sector retain qualified workers, the Pay Equity Unit will examine gender and pay equity issues, particularly in female dominated areas such as child care.


I conclude by saying that I have been privileged to have the opportunity to visit many early childhood education and care centres. I have listened to the staff and the parents who say how important it is that these educators are recognised for the work they do. The government agrees with them, and the Early Years Quality Fund is a step towards achieving that recognition. I encourage the House to also agree and to vote to provide these committed and critical yet low-paid workers with the opportunity to gain the pay increase that they so surely deserve. I commend the bill to the House.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (21:30):  I rise tonight to talk about an issue that not only affects me but also affects a lot of people of Australia, and probably a lot of members in this place as well. Hearing the member for Hume speak this afternoon so honestly about issues that are dear to him has inspired me to be a little bit more honest and not hold back as much as I would normally. 


I want to talk about a particular type of cancer called a neurofibrosarcoma, a rare type of tumour. It is also sometimes called a peripheral nerve sheath tumour. This type of growth only develops in areas around the peripheral nerves, which are parts of the nervous system that do not include the brain and the spinal cord. Just remember the brain bit there. Examples include the nerves that run along the arms and legs. Soft tissue sarcomas are one per cent of all cancers diagnosed each year. The neurofibrosarcoma makes up six per cent of that one per cent, so it is very rare. My wife Cheryl's daughter died at the age of 10 of a neurofibrosarcoma in her brain. It was extremely rare. It very rarely goes in the brain.


That segues into a particular issue that one of my constituents has contacted me about. He wrote to me:


Steve, 


Thanks for the opportunity to bring your attention to some very major concerns about the unavailability of Zelboraf on the PBS.


I see the shadow minister for health in here and I will make sure I send this speech to him to have a look at and fight the fight for us. The letter continued:


The subject of Metastatic Melanoma treatment for those that are diagnosed with it, is highly emotional, because we are dealing with peoples life or death choices. Melanoma can be quite complex in terms of what treatment, (if any), can be administered & in Dianne's case, she was tested to see if she had a particular mutant gene BRAF V600, which meant she did, she could be included in the GSK drug trial that they were recruiting for at the time. The possibility of her having that gene for treatment with Zelboraf, (Vemurafenib—Roche product), or the combination of BRAF Inhibitor, Dabrafenib and the MEK Inhibitor, Trametinib, (GSK product) was a 50/50 chance. Luckily for her, she had it present in her Melanoma's. IF she hadn't, she probably had 3-6 months life expectancy. As it is, after 7 weeks of treatment with Zelboraf, her Melanoma tumours have reduced in size by 70%, which is fantastic news, so far! 


My concerns are this:-


1. Under the terms & conditions of the Patient Information & Consent document, dated 1st May, 2013, it states, ""GSK, (the study sponsor),the regulatory authority, or the study doctor, may choose to stop the study at any time. We will give you the reason at that time. If this happens, the reason will be explained to you"". My Question: if that happens, how does Dianne continue her treatment? The ONLY answer I'm aware of if this occurs, is she has to purchase Zelboraf from Roche, through a pharmacy account, at $2385 per week +. Is this a fair & just outcome for ordinary citizens of this country? The other consideration is, GSK recruitment for this trial, will cease in 2 months' time. What would have happened to Dianne, if she was diagnosed in 3 months' time? Indeed, what will happen to those that do get diagnosed within this time? Death or $2385+ per week! 


2. Roche have twice had their submission to the PBAC, rejected, for inclusion on the PBS. They have now stated that they will never submit the product again & that they have taken 370 patients off the Free Scheme. I believe that the major reason for this rejection, was that the product was far too expensive to have included on the PBS. I believe it is included on national health schemes in some countries around the world. As we are dealing with people's lives here, is it fair & reasonable to reject this drug from inclusion on the PBS, when it clearly has & is, contributing to much longer living for many patients. There is a guy in WA who has survived so far, on Zelboraf, for 38 months. 


I will finish off by going to the end of his letter:


Steve, this is a very emotional subject & through Melanoma WA, we are going to up the ante on this subject & try to get some national sentiment aroused & some action by politicians to have these drugs & particularly in my case—Zelboraf, placed on the PBS. It may sound cynical, but if you were to get really involved in this area of Government, your standing within Australian politics would go sky high. I know you alone can't deliver on any promises or requests but we need politicians to find a way with this! Maybe you can lead it. 


There was also an article by Sue Dunlevy titled 'Re-mortgage to live' about people having to remortgage their houses to pay for drugs that were not on the PBS. In a situation where we see so much bureaucratic waste, we should be looking after people in Australia. I urge that we run a trial on these drugs.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:00):  On Tuesday morning, 11 June, I was pleased to visit Monkami in Croydon in the electorate of Casey. Monkami is an adult disability service provider that was established back in 1958, originally as a special school. The organisation has grown and developed to cater for a variety of needs of people with a disability. Their day service is located in Croydon, providing a variety of programs focusing on community inclusion. About 140 adults attend these programs, and Monkami also provides supported accommodation services for nearly 30 adults, with properties located throughout the local area. Monkami is very well known throughout our local community and is held in very high regard.


I had the pleasure of visiting with our shadow minister for disability, Senator Mitch Fifield, to have a briefing and see the great work being done and also to help reopen their nursery, which will provide wonderful services to the public in Croydon. I want to pay tribute to the CEO, Jill Christie, and the hardworking management committee. 


Later in the morning, the shadow minister and I travelled out to Mount Evelyn to Eastern Outsource, which is an Australian disability enterprise. Monkami is the parent company of that enterprise. It enables 25 supported employees to engage with the community as part of their daily attendance and conducts a range of services for the community. We got to see the variety of work firsthand there in Mount Evelyn.


Some of the work they do includes secure document-shredding for businesses, two garden and maintenance crews, production and preparation of kindling and the preparation of industrial rags for sale. Many of the employees have been part of the Monkami family for 20 years and have made lifelong friendships and are active members of the community. I want to pay tribute to the manager, Max Heuston, and to all of the staff and all of those who make Monkami and Eastern Outsource the great successes that they are.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2013-06-25,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (16:31):  I do rise to speak on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment  (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. These three bills amend the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980, the Wine Australia Act, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1997 to implement the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation to create a new wine statutory authority, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. 


The authority will commence on 1 July 2014. It will undertake the functions of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia without a change in the structure or the amounts of the levies that currently fund both authorities. The assets, staff and functions of GWRDC and Wine Australia will transfer to the authority.


The wine industry is a fantastic example of a progressive Australian agricultural industry. It has progressive farmers, sophisticated wine manufacturers and innovative exporters. The wine industry, like most industries, has had its issues with periods of drought, low prices, restructuring and consolidation, and has had problems with high input costs like the carbon tax, overregulation and a high Australian dollar. But the future is bright. I believe that after years of what could be called 'overproduction', it is consolidating and I do believe that the future really is bright. The industry is proactive and has shown a great ability to change with the times and tackle issues head on. 


This legislation is a natural progression by the industry in continuing reform to meet future challenges. The GWRDC was established in 1991 under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1981. The PIERD Act plans and invests in research, development and extension programs and facilitates the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of the results throughout the industry. 


Wine Australia was established in 1981 originally as the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation under its own legislation as a statutory marketing corporation. In August 2012 the Winemakers Federation of Australia and Wine Grape Growers Australia lodged a formal submission requesting that the government agree to merge GWRDC and Wine Australia. WFA and WGGA are the peak wine industry bodies for winemaking and grape growing respectively, and obviously quite a few are in both camps. WFA and WGGA proposed creating a single new authority to undertake the existing functions of the current authorities without a change in the structure or amount of levies that fund each authority. WFA and WGGA proposed that a merged authority would enable important links between the investment initiatives and functions of the GWRDC and Wine Australia to be realised under a unified whole-of-industry strategy. WFA and WGGA argued that the major benefits would allow the industry to better align its strategy, give better service delivery, provide a single pathway for industry in communicating with the statutory authorities, and provide for administrative efficiencies. In 2012, both bodies undertook a consultative process that included providing information on the merger to levy payers and a series of public meetings. They received letters of support from the state and territory regional associations and major wine companies representing the majority of the industry.


The GWRDC and Wine Australia are both corporations established under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The authority will continue to operate under the CAC Act. The amendments to the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 ensure the new amendments operate as intended in respect of the imposition and collection of the levies.


The main bill, which creates the authority, is divided into two schedules. Schedule 1 amends the Wine Australia Corporation Act to create the authority. Schedule 2 covers matters arising from the transition to the authority such as the transfer of assets and liabilities from the GWRDC and Wine Australia to the authority and will commence on 1 July 2014.


The changes in the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 are straightforward. This amendment bill replaces references to the Wine Australia Corporation with references to the authority. The change will allow for levies collected to be paid to the authority. The bill also repeals clauses that provided for Wine Australia, following an annual general meeting, to make recommendations to the minister about the levy rate.


The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 makes amendments to the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999. These amendments involve replacing references to the Wine Australia Corporation with references to the authority. The change will allow for levies collected to be paid to the authority as previously. The bill also repeals clauses that provided for Wine Australia, following an annual general meeting, to make recommendations to the minister about the levy rate.


The main issue is again the short time frame to check the mechanics of these bill, to check that they do what they say they do and to conduct consultation to properly gauge industry support. However, in the main these bills are straightforward and industry does clearly support the amalgamation. Any concerns are with the mechanics of the amalgamation, such as the make-up of the board, and not with the amalgamation itself. So on balance the coalition has decided to support industry by supporting this bill.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (16:38):  Of course, I have a strong interest in the wine industry. It is a vital employer in many of the regions that overlap my electorate, particularly the Barossa Valley and the Clare Valley. It also spills over into manufacturing in the bottom part of my electorate: there is a labelling plant in Elizabeth and a bottling plant just outside Gawler, between Roseworthy and Freeling. So it is a big employer in my area. It is a big exporter and it is a vital part of the state economy. South Australia in particular has a lot of skin in the game when it comes to the wine industry. This is very important legislation for the wine industry. Only on the weekend, I was at Seppeltsfield with Nicole Hodgson, the tourism manager there, and the Minister Assisting for Tourism, Don Farrell, talking about some tourism grants that will transform Seppeltsfield Winery—a very famous winery in South Australia and a great place to visit. If the Deputy Speaker ever wishes to come to South Australia, I am sure we will put on a good show for him. There are, of course, many other good wineries around the place. I have, on occasion, gone and talked to Mitchell Taylor of Taylors Wines; my friend, Simon Pringle of Mitchell Wines; and Peter Barry of Jim Barry Wines about the wine industry. They have all been voices in my ears about this very important industry.


This legislative package contains three bills that provide the mechanism to implement the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation to create a new statutory authority, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. Those three bills are the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. These bills as a package wind up the GWRDC and Wine Australia, and transfer their assets, staff and functions to the authority. The authority will commence on 1 July 2014 and will undertake the functions of the two aforementioned bodies without a change in structure to the amounts of the levies that currently fund both bodies.


This whole process was set off in August 2012 when the Winemakers' Federation of Australia and Wine Grape Growers Australia lodged a formal submission requesting the government agree to merge the GWRDC and Wine Australia. They are the peak bodies for the industry, in winemaking and grape growing respectively. They are important bodies. They are bodies that are listened to by government and they are representative of industry and, certainly, of the regions I represent. So, obviously, the government took their wishes to heart. Their proposal to create a single new authority to undertake the existing functions of the current authorities without a change to the structure of levies is an important one. The industry argued that a merged authority would enable important links between investment initiatives and enable the functions of those two bodies to be better realised under a whole-of-industry strategy.


Those major benefits, principally, are the alignment of strategy, better service delivery and administrative efficiency gains. They are important things for any industry. It is not a secret that the wine industry is confronting the same struggles that the manufacturing industry across Australia is struggling with—that is, the very high cost of the Australian dollar, which is a penalty for exporters; and the emergence of our currency as something of a safeguard currency in the current world economic situation, with some 19 central banks now holding our currency. That has made the dollar persistently high, despite commodity prices coming off, and that is a very serious issue. Obviously, the only way to combat that is through high-skill, high-value exports. That is the only way you can deal with a sticky dollar, a high dollar. This single, new authority will help the industry to combat those sorts of challenges, and it is reflects the realisation that the interests of grape growers and winemakers are inextricably linked.


Both industry associations undertook a consultation process, provided information on the merger to levy payers, had a series of public meetings and got letters of support from the state and territory regional associations and the major wine companies who are representing this industry. The government has noted in its Rural Research and Development Policy Statement that combining the R&D and marketing functions in one organisation can lead to some synergies, helping research programs and the like.


This is a good bill. It does what it sets out to do: it helps the wine industry, it creates some synergies and efficiencies and a better alignment of strategy for the industry and it creates a recognition that we are all in this struggle against the high dollar together. There is a mission to, if you like, reinvent the wine industry as a higher value industry than it has been. It is still a high exporter, and I am always encouraged when I talk to people like Peter Barry up at Clare. He is a winemaker who saw this coming a long time ago, changed his strategy and is now providing jobs and export income for his company but also for this nation. I know that the minister for education, Peter Garrett, is a big fan of Jim Barry Wines. A great friendship has been spurned between the minister for education and Peter Barry, and that is no bad thing.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  Created, I should say, not spurned. That is right. Thank you to the member for Chifley for helping me! It is a real friendship. This is a good bill and I commend it to the House.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (16:46):  I rise to support the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. These bills will give effect to the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation, the GWRDC, and Wine Australia. This legislation will create a new wine statutory authority, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. The authority will commence on 1 July 2014 and will undertake the functions of the GWRDC and Wine Australia without a change in the structure or amounts of levies that currently fund both authorities. The assets, staff and functions of the GWRDC and Wine Australia will transfer into the authority.


I will address a range of issues pertinent to these bills that I have been closely following as a member representing an electorate in the Hunter Valley region, which, without doubt, is the premium wine-producing area in Australia, and as the shadow minister for regional development and the shadow minister for tourism, because wine is critically important to both those portfolio areas.


The merger of these two existing statutory bodies would see the following benefits: an ability to identify and deliver aligned industry strategic imperatives and RD&E goals; management efficiency of program delivery and associated cost savings to government and the industry; streamlined functional relationships between industry and government; genuine accountability to industry at the same time as meeting the government's requirements; and improved communication and strategic alignment between the national associations and the merged entity.


Australia is consistently ranked as one of the world's top 10 wine producers, and the finest Australian wines are amongst the best in the world. Australia is the No. 4 wine-exporting country in the world and the No. 16 wine-drinking country in the world. For Chinese tourists, Australia is the world's No. 2 food and wine tourism destination after France. The United Kingdom imports more wine from Australia than it does from France, and that is thanks, in no small part, to Robert Oatley AM, whose 1980 gold medal in London for his Rosemount Chardonnay really started the UK's obsession with our wines. Australian wines have won medals at almost every major international wine competition and have set records for prices for a single bottle. Around 78 per cent of wineries have cellar doors—no surprise in that. Twenty-nine per cent of those cellar doors have on-site dining, 11 per cent have accommodation and some offer adventure further afield into opera, theatre, musical events and festivals. Without doubt, the wine industry is a critical part of our national tourism fabric.


Recently, when I was in Tasmania, I accompanied the candidate for Bass, Mr Andrew Nikolic AM, who took me to meet another lion of the Australian wine industry, Josef Chromy AM, in Relbia, Tasmania. Joe Chromy Vineyard hosts concerts, runs an excellent restaurant and is even progressing plans to part fund a resumption of the Relbia Wine Train—helping a range of other tourist attractions in the region. Joe Chromy also showed me a mechanical invention of his own design: an improved grape-crushing machine in operation at his winery.


The inventiveness and can-do business thinking of our winegrowers is underpinned by the GWRDC, which has established a plan to invest in research, development and extension programs. It facilitates the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of the results throughout the industry. This is similar to ABARES, who produced an excellent report in 2010 on Agri-tourism, two years before the UN World Tourism Organisation published their major report on culinary tourism. I received these through the Regional Australia Institute.


Our future wine production and wine tourism success depends on high-quality primary and secondary scientific, economic and consumer preference research. This will be centrally reliant on: the new Australian Grape and Wine Authority, created by this bill; the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO; Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, ABARES; Australian Trade Commission Service, Austrade; Regional Australia Institute; and Tourism Research Australia.


A coalition government, if elected, will also rely on industry groups like Restaurant Catering Australia. Their research into food and wine tourism supported their recommendations to the NSW Visitor Economy Taskforce last year. Tourism Australia also commission useful, actionable research to inform their marketing activities, such as the GFK Blue Moon Development Plan research; and the Euromonitor food and wine tourism research, which is currently underway.


Last year's UNWTO report on culinary tourism stressed the importance of cooperation:


It is necessary for the actors operating in the destination (producers, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, chefs, restaurateurs, public administration, hoteliers etc) to be involved in the definition and management of food tourism offerings …


Last week the coalition outlined our vision to develop Northern Australia, which will do much to reinvigorate debate, interest and research into agriculture nationwide. As my colleague the shadow minister for innovation and science noted on in her 5 September media release, a World Economic Forum global competitiveness report has revealed that Australia is continuing to fall further behind its global competitors in innovation. Since the last global competitiveness report was released one year earlier, Australia has declined further in a number of key indicators, in particular capacity for innovation, where we have dropped from 27th to 32nd globally; and company spending on research and development, where we have dropped from 27th to 30th.


The report cited restrictive labour regulations and inefficient government bureaucracy amongst the most problematic factors for doing business in Australia. It also highlighted very significant concerns over tax regulations and policy instability. The model used by the World Economic Forum was the basis for Regional Australia Institute's [In]Sight modelling, which was publicly released this morning. Australia's wine regions have been done a great service by Regional Australia Institute, and I would like to thank Su McCluskey, Jack Archer and the other staff at RAI for the work that they have done.


[In]Sight is the nation's first online index and interactive map tracking the competitiveness of Australia's 560 local government areas and 55 Regional Development Australia (RDA) regions. [In]Sight spans 10 themes and 59 indicators specifically tailored to reflect the fundamentals of sustainable growth in Australia, capturing the competitiveness of LGAs and RDAs according to current economic performance and drivers of future success. While investment in research, development and extension programs, and the promotion, adoption and commercialisation of the results amongst Australian businesses is vital to secure and retain an edge, this is especially so in agriculture. 


I was pleased to attend the Winemakers Federation reception here in Parliament House last week, and spoke with the outgoing CEO of Wine Australia, Mr Andrew Cheesman. I would like to echo the remarks of Wine Australia's chairman who paid tribute to Mr Cheesman's record of service to the industry. The memorandum of understanding signed in January this year between Wine Australia and Tourism Australia on co-location of their offices was a great outcome.


According to the one-time adviser to the Hon. Robert Hill and current CEO of the Winemakers' Federation of Australia:


(1) A confluence of international and domestic financial and market impacts has severely impacted Australian producers …


   …   …   …


(2) Like most primary and value-added industries, the effect of a high dollar, increasingly fierce global competition and high costs compared with other new world producers have created serious challenges for the wine sector.


(3) Domestic demand was flat, meaning most producers had to grow their sales overseas …


   …   …   …


(4) Vineyard profitability continues to be a major concern, with Wine Grape Growers Australia figures showing average vineyard operators have not met the cost of production for the past three years.


(5) ""The costs of production are not being met by the prices paid by wine producers who also are under extreme pressure,"" …


Against this backdrop, the main concern raised in the consultation was ensuring that levy funds collected for research and development would only be spent for research and development by a new authority. This government has a habit of spending other people's money for its own political purposes.


This is a good venture by the government to bring about greater efficiency, but what is critical is that we act in the interests of the wine industry and do what we can through the various agencies available to the industry to build our export markets. We have a glut of grapes in Australia at the moment, and we need to build on those markets. One of the key issues raised in one of the weekend newspapers was that our glut of wine being sent overseas was not at the premium end of the market, and this has affected those areas whose production is solely or primarily at the premium end of the market. Of course, that is the Hunter Valley, which, as I said right at the beginning, without doubt produces the best wines in Australia. It is a source of argument from those less informed—from the Barossa Valley, Tasmania or down in the Riverina. There can only be one premium area and of course, parochially, that is the Hunter Valley. It is recognised that young Neil McGuigan is the international best winemaker in a semillon grape.


We encourage this. We always want to work to grow the industry. It is a good, high-value industry. It suffers from weather. A single session of out-of-character rain can destroy some grapes yet improve other grapes. So all we can do is support them. We wish this organisation well and we encourage further dialogue with the industry to make sure the whole of the industry goes forward.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2013-06-25,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:57):  I rise to speak on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. These three bills amend the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 and also the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 to implement the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation to create a new statutory authority, to be called the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. This authority will direct research and development in the industry and it will have a combined budget of close to $35 million, which will come jointly from levies upon growers and from a matching contribution from the taxpayer.


This is an important move. It is supported by the industry and is also supported by the coalition. The wine industry is perhaps one of our most important agricultural industries. Here are some of the numbers from 2011. In Australia our consumption of wine was 455 million litres, which works out to something like 20 litres per person. I am sure there are some that drink quite a lot more than that. Our exports in this industry are even more impressive. Something like 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of our production of wine in Australia is exported. In the last calendar year we exported over 700 million litres of wine.


It is very important that this industry remains diverse, has many players and continues to experiment—to develop new ideas and new methods of marketing—and to look for new export markets. It is also important that we have an environment that encourages investment and risk-taking amongst the entrepreneurs in the industry. However, there are threats to this industry. There is the threat of the carbon tax. A typical winery, producing 50,000 tonnes, will see its electricity bills increase close to $500,000. If the current government is re-elected, we will have the carbon tax extended to transport costs, and that would also have a substantial effect on the wine industry. Every grape has to be moved around the country. Movements from country areas to city ports will increase the tax.


Perhaps one of the main threats to the industry is the increasing market concentration in our retail sector. In that sector, under the current legislative settings of the Trade Practices Act, today we have two players, our supermarket duopoly, controlling something in the vicinity of 60 to 70 per cent of the wine sales of our nation. That has come about simply because of the legislative settings of our Trade Practices Act, which is based on the delusion that small business in the industry cannot be efficient. It has evolved so that we now see a policy that encourages not survival of the fittest, which is what we want, but survival of the biggest. 


These problems with market concentration affect the wine industry in a few ways. Firstly, there are mergers. We have seen many mergers in the industry. A lot of those mergers and consolidations have been through bullying. A paper written by Professor Evan Jones details a few of the difficulties. It cites how in 1995 in Adelaide a small market trader of organic products applied for a liquor licence to sell organic wines. Coles fought the application in the Licensing Court of South Australia and appealed an adverse judgement in the Supreme Court, all with highly paid counsel. Although Coles lost the battle, the fact that they were prepared to expend substantial resources on harassment of a minnow is indicative of a strategy of market dominance.


The other issue that we see in our wine-retailing sector is the issue of price discrimination. Certainly if someone is buying a smaller quantity of wine they would expect to pay a higher price. Likewise, if someone is buying a larger quantity, they would expect to receive a discount. But, when retailers in the liquor industry can go to their larger competitors and buy wine at a retail level at a lower price than they can get it from a wholesaler, something is significantly wrong with the workings of the market. That is simply because of price discrimination, which we are seeing rampant in the liquor and wine retail industry.


Then there is the issue of predatory pricing. For many years, we had no effective law to combat predatory pricing. However, that was remedied in 2007 when the former Treasurer Peter Costello brought in what was known as the Birdsville amendment, legislation written and drafted by Professor Zumbo. But, in the last six years of this government, the ACCC has not brought one case under that legislation. There have also been examples of geographic price discrimination damaging independent retailers. 


This is very important for our farmers and our wine producers. We need legislation not only to protect the consumer but also to make sure that our wine producers have several players to sell to. If they are forced into a market where two players control 60 to 70 per cent of the market, that damages the supply chain. That becomes a discouragement to investment. It simply becomes more difficult for a wine producer who is experimenting with a new label to get that label onto the nation's supermarket shelves and get it before consumers.


The other issue that affects our wine producers is our law on retail price maintenance. This law is a hangover from bygone years, taken from American antitrust legislation, when it was the producers who actually had the market power. Today we are seeing the inverse. The American courts have in many cases overridden that law against retail price maintenance and it is no longer anticompetitive and against the law of America. Again, that affects premium wine producers who would like to market their products at the premium end and to maintain a price.


Another law that leads to market concentration is our current licensing regime. Under that regime, anyone who wants to enter the market to sell wine on a retail basis has such regulatory barriers that the result is that only the largest players in the market have the resources to wade through all the legislation, regulation and red tape and be able to compete in the market. These are the risks to our wine producers from market concentration. We do not want to see a situation where our wine producers are the same as our dairy farmers, where they are being screwed down to the last penny, there is a lack of investment in the industry, they are getting low prices and they are basically being held hostage. This is the problem we face.


We must also look at the risks to the consumer from such market concentration in our retail wine sales. Despite the theory telling us that market concentration would lead to lower prices, what we have seen in our supermarket sector is that market concentration for food and groceries has led to the Australian consumer having to suffer some of the highest rates of food inflation in the developed world. If we do apples-for-apples comparisons of items on our grocery shelves and those in any other country, we find Australian consumers are paying some of the highest prices. For consumers who enjoy wine—and, as I said, the average is 20 litres per person; for every man, woman and child in the country—that is a risk they face from the increase in market concentration. So the idea that it will benefit consumers is wrong. There is pressure coming from this unnecessary market concentration, both for the consumer and for the supply chain. 


The coalition welcomes this legislation. We hope it will lead to some benefits and we wish the wine industry well. We hope that their marketing and research will lead to innovation and to some new export markets that Australian wine producers can sell to. But we must have a look at our competition laws to ensure we do not get greater concentration, because that is not in the best interests of this important industry.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-25,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:07):  At the outset I commend the member for Braddon, who I know is the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, because he has consulted industry on this legislation and I commend him for that. All too often in this place we have seen bills rushed through on which there has not been proper consultation with industry. In this case I know the member for Braddon has been dutiful in his portfolio area by actually consulting with industry, which is commendable. He represents a regional area in north-west Tasmania and, as far as regions go, he gets it. There are all too few people in this parliament who 'get' regional Australia, which is a unique place. There are so many people who live on the eastern fringe of Australia, overrepresented in terms of population and, dare I suggest, in the number of parliamentarians too.


Those of us who live beyond the sandstone curtain understand regional Australia and also understand the complexities, the unique challenges and the risks going forward. One of the risks is to our agricultural sector, so I am pleased that the parliamentary secretary has seen fit to consult industry. I served with him on the Regional Australia Committee, headed by the member for New England, and the member for Braddon was the deputy chair of our inquiry into the Murray-Darling Basin and the challenges facing that vital part of regional Australia—that food bowl of not only our nation but other nations too. Thanks to a bipartisan approach, the committee did some good work. The wine industry made a very good submission to the inquiry and, had all the committee's recommendations been adopted, I think we would have had a better outcome as far as the water rights debate was concerned. 


As far as this particular legislation is concerned, the three bills which we are debating as cognates amend the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act of 1997 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies 1997 to formulate the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation to establish a new wine statutory body, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. Like the parliamentary secretary and like the member for Calare—who is the shadow agriculture minister and, more importantly, the food security shadow minister—I too have done my due diligence and consulted with various industry groups and individuals within my electorate. 


My electorate has a huge stake in the future of the wine industry. Members of the Riverina Winemakers Association include five of Australia's 16 largest wine exporters—namely Casella Wines, De Bortoli, McWilliam's, Nugan Estate and Warburn Estate. The Riverina wineries produce around a quarter of Australia's wine and the region grows around 20 per cent of the nation's grapes. The Riverina wine industry is worth around $1 billion and is a huge export earner. In fact the Yellowtail, which is produced by Casella Wines Pty Ltd and based at Yenda, in 2003 was the No. 1 imported wine to the United States of America. That is a tremendous achievement by a once-small and humble winery at Yenda in the Riverina. The winery has a capacity of about 300 million litres a year at its Yenda site. The Yellowtail label—with that very familiar yellow-footed rock wallaby—is synonymous with so many good dinner parties, certainly in the United States. John Casella, the proprietor of that wonderful company, is grateful that the Australian dollar is softening—today it is 92.52 cents—and also commends this legislation. He has been watching it carefully, but he is not opposed to it, because he sees the merit in it. The Winemakers Association is similarly supportive. I spoke to the Riverina Grape Marketing Board's industry development officer, Kristy Bartrop, just a few moments ago. She said that it will be a good thing when the money that is going to be spent on promotion and tourism and on research and development is fused together—so long as the R&D side is not diluted by the promotional side. We know that in all aspects of agriculture—indeed, in all aspects of business—that R&D is vitally important. We can never underestimate the value of R&D to ensure that industry not only survives but also prospers. Speaking of surviving and prospering into the future, I would like to take a moment—with the indulgence of the member for Braddon, who has heard this before—to mention the Riverina Winemakers Association submission to the Murray-Darling Basin. Water is crucial for the Riverina, and the new statutory board will also understand just how important water is as a component in the future of the wine industry in the Riverina. I have told the House before just how big that market is, not only to the Riverina's overall exports, but also to Australia's.


In its submission to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority on 17 December 2010, the Riverina Winemakers Association said in relation to water:


There are a number of long term risks in taking a quick fix route:


It takes the Basin out of the equation for any future role it may play in Australian food security.


I talked before about John Cobb, the member for Calare, and his role in food security. Certainly, food security is very much on the coalition's radar. The Riverina Winemakers further points were:


Once you take water from the farmers you take away their capacity to continue to farm, returning highly productive land to less profitable dry-land uses.


The economic and social foundations of Basin communities are therefore diminished.


Retaining more water in storages to meet environmental needs will increase the frequency and severity of floods during periods of heavy rain.


Future generations of Australians will crowd into the coastal margins and cities—not through choice but necessity. You can only employ so many people in eco-tourism.


So the Riverina Winemakers Association highlighted the need to ensure that ecotourism, marketing and tourism do not completely wash over the R&D component research funding necessity. The Winemakers Association also told the Murray-Darling Basin Authority:


Australia is a vast land mass, rich in resources above and below the ground, but with a small population the envy of the World


It is experiencing a minerals boom which is consuming vast amounts of labour and capital


Current rates of fertility suggest any growth in the economy moving forward will require increased migration


The majority of the population—around 16 million—live in the coastal regions outside the Basin which are subject to increasing environmental and social pressure


The world’s population will continue to grow


The demand for food will continue to grow.


I might add that the demand for the wine will continue to grow as well. The submission went on with these points:


Land and water for the growth of food is a finite resource and subject to competing demands


The Murray Darling Basin is a significant national asset which contributes 40% of national agriculture production and provides critical water supplies for 3 million people.


The association finished its submission by saying:


The problem is that the environmental genie is out of the bottle. Now that the Plan has determined the range of environmental water needs, unless there are modifications to the Water Act that will allow a more balanced plan, there will be constant agitation for further reviews and harsher implementation of SDLs—


sustainable diversion limits—


until the maximum needs of the environment are achieved.


Certainly I have no argument with the Winemakers Association there and I thank the member for Braddon for allowing me to put that on the record. He has heard it before because, as I say, he was on the Regional Australia Committee which spent time in Griffith and the Riverina and heard from those people who do such a wonderful job not just on behalf of the locals but on behalf of the nation and our exports.


The merger of the two existing wine statutory bodies would see the following benefits: it would create an ability to identify and deliver aligned industries strategic imperatives and R&D goals, management efficiency of program delivery and associated cost savings to government and the industry. That is important because the industry, like all agricultural industries and all regional industries, is hurting at the moment. The high Australian dollar and a crisis in confidence in regional Australia brought about by any number of factors are really having an effect on the psyche of people in regional Australia and certainly on business confidence. When those business confidence parameters are down, people are not willing to invest and they are not willing to spend. There is, hopefully, an opportunity into the future that things will improve. The softening Australian dollar is one thing that will go a long way to ensuring that confidence in regional Australia, which relies so much on exports, particularly in agriculture, will improve.


Another benefit of merging these two statutory bodies will be a streamlined functional relationship between industry and government. That is important. I said at the outset of this speech that government has not consulted with industry enough on so many levels and so many aspects of legislation. I thank the member for Braddon for consulting with industry, because it is important. Industry need to feel not only that they are participants in the parliament but also that what they do is actually worth something. How they go about achieving and generating income and, indeed, taxes for us as a government and as a Commonwealth to spend is really important, and they need to know that their worth to the nation is valued.


Another benefit will be genuine accountability to industry at the same time as meeting government requirements. That, too, is very important. Another benefit is improved communication and strategic alignment between the national associations and the new merged entity. That, too, is absolutely critical, because the wine industry does play an important part. As I said, it has been under a lot of pressure lately, not helped by the high Australian dollar, the global downturn or poor public policy, including on water. Water, as we all know, is critical to the Riverina and to all winemaking areas. Getting those parameters right is going to be critical for the future success of the winemaking industry. It is certainly a valuable industry to the Riverina.


Whilst I highlighted the Riverina side of things, as far as the Riverina Winemakers Association goes, there are also a number of boutique wineries in the cold climate of the Riverina electorate, which I serve. I am talking about those at Tumbarumba and other parts of the Snowy Mountains, because the Riverina electorate stretches from Mount Kosciuszko right out to the fringe of the outback beyond Hillston. The former regional Australia minister, the member for Hotham, once described it as the high point of the Australian parliament because Mount Kosciuszko is in the actual electorate. I rather thought he meant it was because of its value to regional Australia. I am certain that he is a friend of regional Australia, and certainly of the Riverina, because he visited there on a number of occasions during the time he held that portfolio. He was certainly very interested in the fortunes of the Riverina, because he recognised the value of the region to our nation's exports.


I finalise on a rather sombre note: today I telephoned Brian Simpson, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Riverina Wine Grape Marketing Board, in relation to this matter and, very sadly, in the last hour, his wife Liza had passed away after a very courageous fight against cancer. I wish to pass on my condolences to Brian and his family at this very sad point in time.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2013-06-25,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (17:22):  Thank you very much for the contributions from the members for Calare, Paterson, Hughes, Wakefield—and particularly from my colleague and friend the member for Riverina. Thanks for your commitment and that of others in this chamber to regional Australia and for your support for this legislation. I assure the member for Riverina that there will be no dilution of R&D at the hands of or to the exclusion of marketing. That is not the intention here—in fact, it is the very opposite. Please be assured of that.


I will just give it some context. We are dealing with what appears on the surface to be a dry piece of legislation but which is absolutely crucial to the industry. I have actually got a specialist wine-growing area in my electorate of Braddon. I want to mention one particular white wine specialty vineyard, Ghost Rock at Port Sorell, and also the vineyards in the Lower Barrington. We are developing a really good reputation for these lovely, cool-climate wines.


Also, listening to the members opposite, and the member for Wakefield on our side, I think is really important—because it gives this legislation a very local, down-to-earth overview of how research and development and extension, and also marketing, in this important industry, is important to local economies. It is also, of course, most importantly, a significant contributor to the national economy. So it is good to give it some localised context.


In December 2012 Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, announced a merger of the two statutory wine corporations—namely, the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation. The merger of the two corporations will create a single, whole-of-industry statutory authority: the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. The new authority will offer strategic benefits to the industry—as highlighted by all those who have spoken in support of this legislation—such as improved leadership, service delivery and administrative efficiency. It will also enable a single board to make strategic links between research and development, investment initiatives and marketing. The merger creates a new authority that will inherit the functions of the two corporations.


The merger aligns with the Australian government's 2012 research and development policy statement, which noted that combining research and development, and marketing functions, in one organisation can lead to synergies such as being able to factor customer requirements into research programs, as highlighted by previous speakers.


The merger also fits with the broader government policy agenda of reducing the number of statutory bodies. There will not be any change to the structure or amount of industry levies. The legislation before us provides that all levies collected for a particular purpose, such as research and development—as I mentioned earlier to the member for Riverina, with respect to his concerns—will only be used for that purpose by the new authority. There will also be no change to the existing regulatory, marketing and compliance roles of the Wine Australia Corporation under the new authority.


The government's announcement of the merger followed an industry proposal, submitted in August 2012, by the two industry peak bodies: Winegrape Growers Australia and the Winemakers Federation of Australia. The merger has widespread industry support and addresses discussions that have been raised over the last 20 years—not recently alone, but over 20 years.


Three bills are being presented for introduction that provide the mechanism to create the Australian Grape and Wine Authority and implement the key elements of the reform. The bills are the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. I thank all those who have taken part in the consultation process, and I thank the department for the excellent work that they went about, along with the minister's office, in the consultation that took place and in the presentation of this important legislation. I commend the legislation to the House.

These three bills amend the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980, the Wine Australia Act, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1997 to implement the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation to create a new wine statutory authority, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. 


The authority will commence on 1 July 2014. It will undertake the functions of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia without a change in the structure or the amounts of the levies that currently fund both authorities. The assets, staff and functions of GWRDC and Wine Australia will transfer to the authority.


The wine industry is a fantastic example of a progressive Australian agricultural industry. It has progressive farmers, sophisticated wine manufacturers and innovative exporters. The wine industry, like most industries, has had its issues with periods of drought, low prices, restructuring and consolidation, and has had problems with high input costs like the carbon tax, overregulation and a high Australian dollar. But the future is bright. I believe that after years of what could be called 'overproduction', it is consolidating and I do believe that the future really is bright. The industry is proactive and has shown a great ability to change with the times and tackle issues head on. 


This legislation is a natural progression by the industry in continuing reform to meet future challenges. The GWRDC was established in 1991 under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1981. The PIERD Act plans and invests in research, development and extension programs and facilitates the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of the results throughout the industry. 


Wine Australia was established in 1981 originally as the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation under its own legislation as a statutory marketing corporation. In August 2012 the Winemakers Federation of Australia and Wine Grape Growers Australia lodged a formal submission requesting that the government agree to merge GWRDC and Wine Australia. WFA and WGGA are the peak wine industry bodies for winemaking and grape growing respectively, and obviously quite a few are in both camps. WFA and WGGA proposed creating a single new authority to undertake the existing functions of the current authorities without a change in the structure or amount of levies that fund each authority. WFA and WGGA proposed that a merged authority would enable important links between the investment initiatives and functions of the GWRDC and Wine Australia to be realised under a unified whole-of-industry strategy. WFA and WGGA argued that the major benefits would allow the industry to better align its strategy, give better service delivery, provide a single pathway for industry in communicating with the statutory authorities, and provide for administrative efficiencies. In 2012, both bodies undertook a consultative process that included providing information on the merger to levy payers and a series of public meetings. They received letters of support from the state and territory regional associations and major wine companies representing the majority of the industry.


The GWRDC and Wine Australia are both corporations established under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The authority will continue to operate under the CAC Act. The amendments to the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 ensure the new amendments operate as intended in respect of the imposition and collection of the levies.


The main bill, which creates the authority, is divided into two schedules. Schedule 1 amends the Wine Australia Corporation Act to create the authority. Schedule 2 covers matters arising from the transition to the authority such as the transfer of assets and liabilities from the GWRDC and Wine Australia to the authority and will commence on 1 July 2014.


The changes in the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 are straightforward. This amendment bill replaces references to the Wine Australia Corporation with references to the authority. The change will allow for levies collected to be paid to the authority. The bill also repeals clauses that provided for Wine Australia, following an annual general meeting, to make recommendations to the minister about the levy rate.


The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 makes amendments to the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999. These amendments involve replacing references to the Wine Australia Corporation with references to the authority. The change will allow for levies collected to be paid to the authority as previously. The bill also repeals clauses that provided for Wine Australia, following an annual general meeting, to make recommendations to the minister about the levy rate.


The main issue is again the short time frame to check the mechanics of these bill, to check that they do what they say they do and to conduct consultation to properly gauge industry support. However, in the main these bills are straightforward and industry does clearly support the amalgamation. Any concerns are with the mechanics of the amalgamation, such as the make-up of the board, and not with the amalgamation itself. So on balance the coalition has decided to support industry by supporting this bill.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (16:38):  Of course, I have a strong interest in the wine industry. It is a vital employer in many of the regions that overlap my electorate, particularly the Barossa Valley and the Clare Valley. It also spills over into manufacturing in the bottom part of my electorate: there is a labelling plant in Elizabeth and a bottling plant just outside Gawler, between Roseworthy and Freeling. So it is a big employer in my area. It is a big exporter and it is a vital part of the state economy. South Australia in particular has a lot of skin in the game when it comes to the wine industry. This is very important legislation for the wine industry. Only on the weekend, I was at Seppeltsfield with Nicole Hodgson, the tourism manager there, and the Minister Assisting for Tourism, Don Farrell, talking about some tourism grants that will transform Seppeltsfield Winery—a very famous winery in South Australia and a great place to visit. If the Deputy Speaker ever wishes to come to South Australia, I am sure we will put on a good show for him. There are, of course, many other good wineries around the place. I have, on occasion, gone and talked to Mitchell Taylor of Taylors Wines; my friend, Simon Pringle of Mitchell Wines; and Peter Barry of Jim Barry Wines about the wine industry. They have all been voices in my ears about this very important industry.


This legislative package contains three bills that provide the mechanism to implement the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation to create a new statutory authority, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. Those three bills are the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. These bills as a package wind up the GWRDC and Wine Australia, and transfer their assets, staff and functions to the authority. The authority will commence on 1 July 2014 and will undertake the functions of the two aforementioned bodies without a change in structure to the amounts of the levies that currently fund both bodies.


This whole process was set off in August 2012 when the Winemakers' Federation of Australia and Wine Grape Growers Australia lodged a formal submission requesting the government agree to merge the GWRDC and Wine Australia. They are the peak bodies for the industry, in winemaking and grape growing respectively. They are important bodies. They are bodies that are listened to by government and they are representative of industry and, certainly, of the regions I represent. So, obviously, the government took their wishes to heart. Their proposal to create a single new authority to undertake the existing functions of the current authorities without a change to the structure of levies is an important one. The industry argued that a merged authority would enable important links between investment initiatives and enable the functions of those two bodies to be better realised under a whole-of-industry strategy.


Those major benefits, principally, are the alignment of strategy, better service delivery and administrative efficiency gains. They are important things for any industry. It is not a secret that the wine industry is confronting the same struggles that the manufacturing industry across Australia is struggling with—that is, the very high cost of the Australian dollar, which is a penalty for exporters; and the emergence of our currency as something of a safeguard currency in the current world economic situation, with some 19 central banks now holding our currency. That has made the dollar persistently high, despite commodity prices coming off, and that is a very serious issue. Obviously, the only way to combat that is through high-skill, high-value exports. That is the only way you can deal with a sticky dollar, a high dollar. This single, new authority will help the industry to combat those sorts of challenges, and it is reflects the realisation that the interests of grape growers and winemakers are inextricably linked.


Both industry associations undertook a consultation process, provided information on the merger to levy payers, had a series of public meetings and got letters of support from the state and territory regional associations and the major wine companies who are representing this industry. The government has noted in its Rural Research and Development Policy Statement that combining the R&D and marketing functions in one organisation can lead to some synergies, helping research programs and the like.


This is a good bill. It does what it sets out to do: it helps the wine industry, it creates some synergies and efficiencies and a better alignment of strategy for the industry and it creates a recognition that we are all in this struggle against the high dollar together. There is a mission to, if you like, reinvent the wine industry as a higher value industry than it has been. It is still a high exporter, and I am always encouraged when I talk to people like Peter Barry up at Clare. He is a winemaker who saw this coming a long time ago, changed his strategy and is now providing jobs and export income for his company but also for this nation. I know that the minister for education, Peter Garrett, is a big fan of Jim Barry Wines. A great friendship has been spurned between the minister for education and Peter Barry, and that is no bad thing.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  Created, I should say, not spurned. That is right. Thank you to the member for Chifley for helping me! It is a real friendship. This is a good bill and I commend it to the House.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (16:46):  I rise to support the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. These bills will give effect to the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation, the GWRDC, and Wine Australia. This legislation will create a new wine statutory authority, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. The authority will commence on 1 July 2014 and will undertake the functions of the GWRDC and Wine Australia without a change in the structure or amounts of levies that currently fund both authorities. The assets, staff and functions of the GWRDC and Wine Australia will transfer into the authority.


I will address a range of issues pertinent to these bills that I have been closely following as a member representing an electorate in the Hunter Valley region, which, without doubt, is the premium wine-producing area in Australia, and as the shadow minister for regional development and the shadow minister for tourism, because wine is critically important to both those portfolio areas.


The merger of these two existing statutory bodies would see the following benefits: an ability to identify and deliver aligned industry strategic imperatives and RD&E goals; management efficiency of program delivery and associated cost savings to government and the industry; streamlined functional relationships between industry and government; genuine accountability to industry at the same time as meeting the government's requirements; and improved communication and strategic alignment between the national associations and the merged entity.


Australia is consistently ranked as one of the world's top 10 wine producers, and the finest Australian wines are amongst the best in the world. Australia is the No. 4 wine-exporting country in the world and the No. 16 wine-drinking country in the world. For Chinese tourists, Australia is the world's No. 2 food and wine tourism destination after France. The United Kingdom imports more wine from Australia than it does from France, and that is thanks, in no small part, to Robert Oatley AM, whose 1980 gold medal in London for his Rosemount Chardonnay really started the UK's obsession with our wines. Australian wines have won medals at almost every major international wine competition and have set records for prices for a single bottle. Around 78 per cent of wineries have cellar doors—no surprise in that. Twenty-nine per cent of those cellar doors have on-site dining, 11 per cent have accommodation and some offer adventure further afield into opera, theatre, musical events and festivals. Without doubt, the wine industry is a critical part of our national tourism fabric.


Recently, when I was in Tasmania, I accompanied the candidate for Bass, Mr Andrew Nikolic AM, who took me to meet another lion of the Australian wine industry, Josef Chromy AM, in Relbia, Tasmania. Joe Chromy Vineyard hosts concerts, runs an excellent restaurant and is even progressing plans to part fund a resumption of the Relbia Wine Train—helping a range of other tourist attractions in the region. Joe Chromy also showed me a mechanical invention of his own design: an improved grape-crushing machine in operation at his winery.


The inventiveness and can-do business thinking of our winegrowers is underpinned by the GWRDC, which has established a plan to invest in research, development and extension programs. It facilitates the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of the results throughout the industry. This is similar to ABARES, who produced an excellent report in 2010 on Agri-tourism, two years before the UN World Tourism Organisation published their major report on culinary tourism. I received these through the Regional Australia Institute.


Our future wine production and wine tourism success depends on high-quality primary and secondary scientific, economic and consumer preference research. This will be centrally reliant on: the new Australian Grape and Wine Authority, created by this bill; the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO; Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, ABARES; Australian Trade Commission Service, Austrade; Regional Australia Institute; and Tourism Research Australia.


A coalition government, if elected, will also rely on industry groups like Restaurant Catering Australia. Their research into food and wine tourism supported their recommendations to the NSW Visitor Economy Taskforce last year. Tourism Australia also commission useful, actionable research to inform their marketing activities, such as the GFK Blue Moon Development Plan research; and the Euromonitor food and wine tourism research, which is currently underway.


Last year's UNWTO report on culinary tourism stressed the importance of cooperation:


It is necessary for the actors operating in the destination (producers, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, chefs, restaurateurs, public administration, hoteliers etc) to be involved in the definition and management of food tourism offerings …


Last week the coalition outlined our vision to develop Northern Australia, which will do much to reinvigorate debate, interest and research into agriculture nationwide. As my colleague the shadow minister for innovation and science noted on in her 5 September media release, a World Economic Forum global competitiveness report has revealed that Australia is continuing to fall further behind its global competitors in innovation. Since the last global competitiveness report was released one year earlier, Australia has declined further in a number of key indicators, in particular capacity for innovation, where we have dropped from 27th to 32nd globally; and company spending on research and development, where we have dropped from 27th to 30th.


The report cited restrictive labour regulations and inefficient government bureaucracy amongst the most problematic factors for doing business in Australia. It also highlighted very significant concerns over tax regulations and policy instability. The model used by the World Economic Forum was the basis for Regional Australia Institute's [In]Sight modelling, which was publicly released this morning. Australia's wine regions have been done a great service by Regional Australia Institute, and I would like to thank Su McCluskey, Jack Archer and the other staff at RAI for the work that they have done.


[In]Sight is the nation's first online index and interactive map tracking the competitiveness of Australia's 560 local government areas and 55 Regional Development Australia (RDA) regions. [In]Sight spans 10 themes and 59 indicators specifically tailored to reflect the fundamentals of sustainable growth in Australia, capturing the competitiveness of LGAs and RDAs according to current economic performance and drivers of future success. While investment in research, development and extension programs, and the promotion, adoption and commercialisation of the results amongst Australian businesses is vital to secure and retain an edge, this is especially so in agriculture. 


I was pleased to attend the Winemakers Federation reception here in Parliament House last week, and spoke with the outgoing CEO of Wine Australia, Mr Andrew Cheesman. I would like to echo the remarks of Wine Australia's chairman who paid tribute to Mr Cheesman's record of service to the industry. The memorandum of understanding signed in January this year between Wine Australia and Tourism Australia on co-location of their offices was a great outcome.


According to the one-time adviser to the Hon. Robert Hill and current CEO of the Winemakers' Federation of Australia:


(1) A confluence of international and domestic financial and market impacts has severely impacted Australian producers …


   …   …   …


(2) Like most primary and value-added industries, the effect of a high dollar, increasingly fierce global competition and high costs compared with other new world producers have created serious challenges for the wine sector.


(3) Domestic demand was flat, meaning most producers had to grow their sales overseas …


   …   …   …


(4) Vineyard profitability continues to be a major concern, with Wine Grape Growers Australia figures showing average vineyard operators have not met the cost of production for the past three years.


(5) ""The costs of production are not being met by the prices paid by wine producers who also are under extreme pressure,"" …


Against this backdrop, the main concern raised in the consultation was ensuring that levy funds collected for research and development would only be spent for research and development by a new authority. This government has a habit of spending other people's money for its own political purposes.


This is a good venture by the government to bring about greater efficiency, but what is critical is that we act in the interests of the wine industry and do what we can through the various agencies available to the industry to build our export markets. We have a glut of grapes in Australia at the moment, and we need to build on those markets. One of the key issues raised in one of the weekend newspapers was that our glut of wine being sent overseas was not at the premium end of the market, and this has affected those areas whose production is solely or primarily at the premium end of the market. Of course, that is the Hunter Valley, which, as I said right at the beginning, without doubt produces the best wines in Australia. It is a source of argument from those less informed—from the Barossa Valley, Tasmania or down in the Riverina. There can only be one premium area and of course, parochially, that is the Hunter Valley. It is recognised that young Neil McGuigan is the international best winemaker in a semillon grape.


We encourage this. We always want to work to grow the industry. It is a good, high-value industry. It suffers from weather. A single session of out-of-character rain can destroy some grapes yet improve other grapes. So all we can do is support them. We wish this organisation well and we encourage further dialogue with the industry to make sure the whole of the industry goes forward.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:57):  I rise to speak on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. These three bills amend the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 and also the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 to implement the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation to create a new statutory authority, to be called the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. This authority will direct research and development in the industry and it will have a combined budget of close to $35 million, which will come jointly from levies upon growers and from a matching contribution from the taxpayer.


This is an important move. It is supported by the industry and is also supported by the coalition. The wine industry is perhaps one of our most important agricultural industries. Here are some of the numbers from 2011. In Australia our consumption of wine was 455 million litres, which works out to something like 20 litres per person. I am sure there are some that drink quite a lot more than that. Our exports in this industry are even more impressive. Something like 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of our production of wine in Australia is exported. In the last calendar year we exported over 700 million litres of wine.


It is very important that this industry remains diverse, has many players and continues to experiment—to develop new ideas and new methods of marketing—and to look for new export markets. It is also important that we have an environment that encourages investment and risk-taking amongst the entrepreneurs in the industry. However, there are threats to this industry. There is the threat of the carbon tax. A typical winery, producing 50,000 tonnes, will see its electricity bills increase close to $500,000. If the current government is re-elected, we will have the carbon tax extended to transport costs, and that would also have a substantial effect on the wine industry. Every grape has to be moved around the country. Movements from country areas to city ports will increase the tax.


Perhaps one of the main threats to the industry is the increasing market concentration in our retail sector. In that sector, under the current legislative settings of the Trade Practices Act, today we have two players, our supermarket duopoly, controlling something in the vicinity of 60 to 70 per cent of the wine sales of our nation. That has come about simply because of the legislative settings of our Trade Practices Act, which is based on the delusion that small business in the industry cannot be efficient. It has evolved so that we now see a policy that encourages not survival of the fittest, which is what we want, but survival of the biggest. 


These problems with market concentration affect the wine industry in a few ways. Firstly, there are mergers. We have seen many mergers in the industry. A lot of those mergers and consolidations have been through bullying. A paper written by Professor Evan Jones details a few of the difficulties. It cites how in 1995 in Adelaide a small market trader of organic products applied for a liquor licence to sell organic wines. Coles fought the application in the Licensing Court of South Australia and appealed an adverse judgement in the Supreme Court, all with highly paid counsel. Although Coles lost the battle, the fact that they were prepared to expend substantial resources on harassment of a minnow is indicative of a strategy of market dominance.


The other issue that we see in our wine-retailing sector is the issue of price discrimination. Certainly if someone is buying a smaller quantity of wine they would expect to pay a higher price. Likewise, if someone is buying a larger quantity, they would expect to receive a discount. But, when retailers in the liquor industry can go to their larger competitors and buy wine at a retail level at a lower price than they can get it from a wholesaler, something is significantly wrong with the workings of the market. That is simply because of price discrimination, which we are seeing rampant in the liquor and wine retail industry.


Then there is the issue of predatory pricing. For many years, we had no effective law to combat predatory pricing. However, that was remedied in 2007 when the former Treasurer Peter Costello brought in what was known as the Birdsville amendment, legislation written and drafted by Professor Zumbo. But, in the last six years of this government, the ACCC has not brought one case under that legislation. There have also been examples of geographic price discrimination damaging independent retailers. 


This is very important for our farmers and our wine producers. We need legislation not only to protect the consumer but also to make sure that our wine producers have several players to sell to. If they are forced into a market where two players control 60 to 70 per cent of the market, that damages the supply chain. That becomes a discouragement to investment. It simply becomes more difficult for a wine producer who is experimenting with a new label to get that label onto the nation's supermarket shelves and get it before consumers.


The other issue that affects our wine producers is our law on retail price maintenance. This law is a hangover from bygone years, taken from American antitrust legislation, when it was the producers who actually had the market power. Today we are seeing the inverse. The American courts have in many cases overridden that law against retail price maintenance and it is no longer anticompetitive and against the law of America. Again, that affects premium wine producers who would like to market their products at the premium end and to maintain a price.


Another law that leads to market concentration is our current licensing regime. Under that regime, anyone who wants to enter the market to sell wine on a retail basis has such regulatory barriers that the result is that only the largest players in the market have the resources to wade through all the legislation, regulation and red tape and be able to compete in the market. These are the risks to our wine producers from market concentration. We do not want to see a situation where our wine producers are the same as our dairy farmers, where they are being screwed down to the last penny, there is a lack of investment in the industry, they are getting low prices and they are basically being held hostage. This is the problem we face.


We must also look at the risks to the consumer from such market concentration in our retail wine sales. Despite the theory telling us that market concentration would lead to lower prices, what we have seen in our supermarket sector is that market concentration for food and groceries has led to the Australian consumer having to suffer some of the highest rates of food inflation in the developed world. If we do apples-for-apples comparisons of items on our grocery shelves and those in any other country, we find Australian consumers are paying some of the highest prices. For consumers who enjoy wine—and, as I said, the average is 20 litres per person; for every man, woman and child in the country—that is a risk they face from the increase in market concentration. So the idea that it will benefit consumers is wrong. There is pressure coming from this unnecessary market concentration, both for the consumer and for the supply chain. 


The coalition welcomes this legislation. We hope it will lead to some benefits and we wish the wine industry well. We hope that their marketing and research will lead to innovation and to some new export markets that Australian wine producers can sell to. But we must have a look at our competition laws to ensure we do not get greater concentration, because that is not in the best interests of this important industry.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-25,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:07):  At the outset I commend the member for Braddon, who I know is the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, because he has consulted industry on this legislation and I commend him for that. All too often in this place we have seen bills rushed through on which there has not been proper consultation with industry. In this case I know the member for Braddon has been dutiful in his portfolio area by actually consulting with industry, which is commendable. He represents a regional area in north-west Tasmania and, as far as regions go, he gets it. There are all too few people in this parliament who 'get' regional Australia, which is a unique place. There are so many people who live on the eastern fringe of Australia, overrepresented in terms of population and, dare I suggest, in the number of parliamentarians too.


Those of us who live beyond the sandstone curtain understand regional Australia and also understand the complexities, the unique challenges and the risks going forward. One of the risks is to our agricultural sector, so I am pleased that the parliamentary secretary has seen fit to consult industry. I served with him on the Regional Australia Committee, headed by the member for New England, and the member for Braddon was the deputy chair of our inquiry into the Murray-Darling Basin and the challenges facing that vital part of regional Australia—that food bowl of not only our nation but other nations too. Thanks to a bipartisan approach, the committee did some good work. The wine industry made a very good submission to the inquiry and, had all the committee's recommendations been adopted, I think we would have had a better outcome as far as the water rights debate was concerned. 


As far as this particular legislation is concerned, the three bills which we are debating as cognates amend the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act of 1997 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies 1997 to formulate the merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation to establish a new wine statutory body, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. Like the parliamentary secretary and like the member for Calare—who is the shadow agriculture minister and, more importantly, the food security shadow minister—I too have done my due diligence and consulted with various industry groups and individuals within my electorate. 


My electorate has a huge stake in the future of the wine industry. Members of the Riverina Winemakers Association include five of Australia's 16 largest wine exporters—namely Casella Wines, De Bortoli, McWilliam's, Nugan Estate and Warburn Estate. The Riverina wineries produce around a quarter of Australia's wine and the region grows around 20 per cent of the nation's grapes. The Riverina wine industry is worth around $1 billion and is a huge export earner. In fact the Yellowtail, which is produced by Casella Wines Pty Ltd and based at Yenda, in 2003 was the No. 1 imported wine to the United States of America. That is a tremendous achievement by a once-small and humble winery at Yenda in the Riverina. The winery has a capacity of about 300 million litres a year at its Yenda site. The Yellowtail label—with that very familiar yellow-footed rock wallaby—is synonymous with so many good dinner parties, certainly in the United States. John Casella, the proprietor of that wonderful company, is grateful that the Australian dollar is softening—today it is 92.52 cents—and also commends this legislation. He has been watching it carefully, but he is not opposed to it, because he sees the merit in it. The Winemakers Association is similarly supportive. I spoke to the Riverina Grape Marketing Board's industry development officer, Kristy Bartrop, just a few moments ago. She said that it will be a good thing when the money that is going to be spent on promotion and tourism and on research and development is fused together—so long as the R&D side is not diluted by the promotional side. We know that in all aspects of agriculture—indeed, in all aspects of business—that R&D is vitally important. We can never underestimate the value of R&D to ensure that industry not only survives but also prospers. Speaking of surviving and prospering into the future, I would like to take a moment—with the indulgence of the member for Braddon, who has heard this before—to mention the Riverina Winemakers Association submission to the Murray-Darling Basin. Water is crucial for the Riverina, and the new statutory board will also understand just how important water is as a component in the future of the wine industry in the Riverina. I have told the House before just how big that market is, not only to the Riverina's overall exports, but also to Australia's.


In its submission to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority on 17 December 2010, the Riverina Winemakers Association said in relation to water:


There are a number of long term risks in taking a quick fix route:


It takes the Basin out of the equation for any future role it may play in Australian food security.


I talked before about John Cobb, the member for Calare, and his role in food security. Certainly, food security is very much on the coalition's radar. The Riverina Winemakers further points were:


Once you take water from the farmers you take away their capacity to continue to farm, returning highly productive land to less profitable dry-land uses.


The economic and social foundations of Basin communities are therefore diminished.


Retaining more water in storages to meet environmental needs will increase the frequency and severity of floods during periods of heavy rain.


Future generations of Australians will crowd into the coastal margins and cities—not through choice but necessity. You can only employ so many people in eco-tourism.


So the Riverina Winemakers Association highlighted the need to ensure that ecotourism, marketing and tourism do not completely wash over the R&D component research funding necessity. The Winemakers Association also told the Murray-Darling Basin Authority:


Australia is a vast land mass, rich in resources above and below the ground, but with a small population the envy of the World


It is experiencing a minerals boom which is consuming vast amounts of labour and capital


Current rates of fertility suggest any growth in the economy moving forward will require increased migration


The majority of the population—around 16 million—live in the coastal regions outside the Basin which are subject to increasing environmental and social pressure


The world’s population will continue to grow


The demand for food will continue to grow.


I might add that the demand for the wine will continue to grow as well. The submission went on with these points:


Land and water for the growth of food is a finite resource and subject to competing demands


The Murray Darling Basin is a significant national asset which contributes 40% of national agriculture production and provides critical water supplies for 3 million people.


The association finished its submission by saying:


The problem is that the environmental genie is out of the bottle. Now that the Plan has determined the range of environmental water needs, unless there are modifications to the Water Act that will allow a more balanced plan, there will be constant agitation for further reviews and harsher implementation of SDLs—


sustainable diversion limits—


until the maximum needs of the environment are achieved.


Certainly I have no argument with the Winemakers Association there and I thank the member for Braddon for allowing me to put that on the record. He has heard it before because, as I say, he was on the Regional Australia Committee which spent time in Griffith and the Riverina and heard from those people who do such a wonderful job not just on behalf of the locals but on behalf of the nation and our exports.


The merger of the two existing wine statutory bodies would see the following benefits: it would create an ability to identify and deliver aligned industries strategic imperatives and R&D goals, management efficiency of program delivery and associated cost savings to government and the industry. That is important because the industry, like all agricultural industries and all regional industries, is hurting at the moment. The high Australian dollar and a crisis in confidence in regional Australia brought about by any number of factors are really having an effect on the psyche of people in regional Australia and certainly on business confidence. When those business confidence parameters are down, people are not willing to invest and they are not willing to spend. There is, hopefully, an opportunity into the future that things will improve. The softening Australian dollar is one thing that will go a long way to ensuring that confidence in regional Australia, which relies so much on exports, particularly in agriculture, will improve.


Another benefit of merging these two statutory bodies will be a streamlined functional relationship between industry and government. That is important. I said at the outset of this speech that government has not consulted with industry enough on so many levels and so many aspects of legislation. I thank the member for Braddon for consulting with industry, because it is important. Industry need to feel not only that they are participants in the parliament but also that what they do is actually worth something. How they go about achieving and generating income and, indeed, taxes for us as a government and as a Commonwealth to spend is really important, and they need to know that their worth to the nation is valued.


Another benefit will be genuine accountability to industry at the same time as meeting government requirements. That, too, is very important. Another benefit is improved communication and strategic alignment between the national associations and the new merged entity. That, too, is absolutely critical, because the wine industry does play an important part. As I said, it has been under a lot of pressure lately, not helped by the high Australian dollar, the global downturn or poor public policy, including on water. Water, as we all know, is critical to the Riverina and to all winemaking areas. Getting those parameters right is going to be critical for the future success of the winemaking industry. It is certainly a valuable industry to the Riverina.


Whilst I highlighted the Riverina side of things, as far as the Riverina Winemakers Association goes, there are also a number of boutique wineries in the cold climate of the Riverina electorate, which I serve. I am talking about those at Tumbarumba and other parts of the Snowy Mountains, because the Riverina electorate stretches from Mount Kosciuszko right out to the fringe of the outback beyond Hillston. The former regional Australia minister, the member for Hotham, once described it as the high point of the Australian parliament because Mount Kosciuszko is in the actual electorate. I rather thought he meant it was because of its value to regional Australia. I am certain that he is a friend of regional Australia, and certainly of the Riverina, because he visited there on a number of occasions during the time he held that portfolio. He was certainly very interested in the fortunes of the Riverina, because he recognised the value of the region to our nation's exports.


I finalise on a rather sombre note: today I telephoned Brian Simpson, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Riverina Wine Grape Marketing Board, in relation to this matter and, very sadly, in the last hour, his wife Liza had passed away after a very courageous fight against cancer. I wish to pass on my condolences to Brian and his family at this very sad point in time.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2013-06-25,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (17:22):  Thank you very much for the contributions from the members for Calare, Paterson, Hughes, Wakefield—and particularly from my colleague and friend the member for Riverina. Thanks for your commitment and that of others in this chamber to regional Australia and for your support for this legislation. I assure the member for Riverina that there will be no dilution of R&D at the hands of or to the exclusion of marketing. That is not the intention here—in fact, it is the very opposite. Please be assured of that.


I will just give it some context. We are dealing with what appears on the surface to be a dry piece of legislation but which is absolutely crucial to the industry. I have actually got a specialist wine-growing area in my electorate of Braddon. I want to mention one particular white wine specialty vineyard, Ghost Rock at Port Sorell, and also the vineyards in the Lower Barrington. We are developing a really good reputation for these lovely, cool-climate wines.


Also, listening to the members opposite, and the member for Wakefield on our side, I think is really important—because it gives this legislation a very local, down-to-earth overview of how research and development and extension, and also marketing, in this important industry, is important to local economies. It is also, of course, most importantly, a significant contributor to the national economy. So it is good to give it some localised context.


In December 2012 Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, announced a merger of the two statutory wine corporations—namely, the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation. The merger of the two corporations will create a single, whole-of-industry statutory authority: the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. The new authority will offer strategic benefits to the industry—as highlighted by all those who have spoken in support of this legislation—such as improved leadership, service delivery and administrative efficiency. It will also enable a single board to make strategic links between research and development, investment initiatives and marketing. The merger creates a new authority that will inherit the functions of the two corporations.


The merger aligns with the Australian government's 2012 research and development policy statement, which noted that combining research and development, and marketing functions, in one organisation can lead to synergies such as being able to factor customer requirements into research programs, as highlighted by previous speakers.


The merger also fits with the broader government policy agenda of reducing the number of statutory bodies. There will not be any change to the structure or amount of industry levies. The legislation before us provides that all levies collected for a particular purpose, such as research and development—as I mentioned earlier to the member for Riverina, with respect to his concerns—will only be used for that purpose by the new authority. There will also be no change to the existing regulatory, marketing and compliance roles of the Wine Australia Corporation under the new authority.


The government's announcement of the merger followed an industry proposal, submitted in August 2012, by the two industry peak bodies: Winegrape Growers Australia and the Winemakers Federation of Australia. The merger has widespread industry support and addresses discussions that have been raised over the last 20 years—not recently alone, but over 20 years.


Three bills are being presented for introduction that provide the mechanism to create the Australian Grape and Wine Authority and implement the key elements of the reform. The bills are the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. I thank all those who have taken part in the consultation process, and I thank the department for the excellent work that they went about, along with the minister's office, in the consultation that took place and in the presentation of this important legislation. I commend the legislation to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.
