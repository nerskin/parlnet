"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-08-27,"—I have a supplementary answer from the Minister for Trade to a question that Senator Cook asked yesterday, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Answer
The Government welcomes the successful launch of the new round of global trade negotiations at Doha, Qatar in November last year.
The agreement of World Trade Organisation members to launch new negotiations to open trade and strengthen the rules-based trading system has realised the government's number one trade policy objective.
Australian beef farmers stand to gain significantly from the commencement of negotiations.
Australia is currently leading discussions in the Cairns Group on a new set of proposals for the WTO agriculture negotiations which would seek
·	significant cuts in tariffs and expansion in agricultural tariff quotas
·	deep cuts in domestic support levels and
·	the elimination of export subsidies.
The Government is working closely with Australian industry and other Cairns Group members to build support for these positions.
The Cairns Group's aims and ambitions for market access are similar to those of the US
·	which put forward strong reform proposals on agriculture in July, including for substantial cuts to tariffs
The Cairns Group is, however, likely to propose significantly larger tariff quota expansion provisions than those proposed by the US, which has called for an increase of only 20 per cent on existing tariff quota commitments.
The Government will continue to work for the interests of all Australian agriculture sectors to maximise the benefits of the Doha Round.
With regard to the beef industry, the government is and will continue to work closely with the industry on how best we can achieve additional market access whether quotas are expanded on a country-specific or MFN basis.
The Government will work hard to ensure existing quota allocations achieved in previous trade negotiations, including those to the US, are
preserved, while at the same time securing new opportunities to compete for additional exports to the US market.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Trade: United States Beef Quota</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-08-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked by Senators Collins and Crossin today relating to Medicare and a decline in the use of bulk billing.
Senator Patterson, the minister, was asked questions in regard to the latest figures for the June quarter of this year regarding bulk-billing. What we saw during question time was the minister spending all of the time that she was allotted to answer those questions talking about everything but bulk-billing. We know why: the minister is ashamed to table those figures in the parliament. Those figures have been sitting on this minister's desk now, we understand, for some weeks, and the minister has refused or declined to make them publicly available. We understand that she proposes to release them publicly on Friday of this week. What is so significant about Friday of this week, when the figures that she will be releasing are for the end of the June quarter for this year? That is, it will be two months since the end of the June quarter when the minister releases those figures—if she in fact does that.
We know why the minister is hanging onto those figures. It is because they tell an embarrassing story for the government about the minister's disgraceful handling of the health portfolio. Furthermore, they point directly to the real agenda of the government when it comes to Medicare. I remind senators, in case they may have forgotten—I do not think they have; I know that members on the opposition side have never forgotten—of the words of John Howard, the now Prime Minister, who in the late 1980s said what they were going to do with Medicare. I do not think that the members of the government today have forgotten those words either, because I believe what John Howard said back in 1987 regarding what his party and his government intended to do to Medicare if they ever came to office is the real agenda—and it is still their agenda today. Let me remind the Senate of what John Howard said on 1 June 1987:
We will be proposing changes to Medicare which amount to its de facto dismantling ... we'll pull it right apart.
He then went on to say:
The second thing we'll do is get rid of the bulk-billing system. It's an absolute rort.
They were the words of the now Prime Minister, John Howard, back in 1987. They have had an ideological obsession with and objection to Medicare ever since it was introduced by the former Labor government—the Hawke government. Indeed, they had the same objection when Gough Whitlam and Bill Hayden brought in Medibank in the 1970s, because they have never ever accepted the concept of universal health cover in this country through Medibank and now Medicare.
But, of course, they learnt their lesson when they ran this policy during the elections of the eighties, in the years of the Hawke and Keating governments: they learnt that the people of Australia support Medicare. There is overwhelming support for Medicare in this country. Virtually the only people opposed to it are the Liberal Party and the doctors—some of the doctors, not all of them. Today, of course, we find that the government are not prepared to come out into the open and say that they are trying to dismantle Medicare. But they are allowing it to wither on the vine. They put all their energies into trying to prop up the private health insurance industry, and how often have we had to sit here and hear speeches from the government ministers about that? Even with all of the money that has been put into the private health insurance industry, people still have to pay ever increasing costs for their health insurance. The government are allowing Medicare to wither on the vine. These figures will demonstrate—if the minister is prepared to release them, as she should; she has had them on her desk for weeks—a continuing decline in the level of bulk-billing in this country. It has been happening since the government came to office in 1996. 
On top of that, given the recent crisis in indemnity insurance, we have seen GP fees increase, in some cases by 40 per cent or more. Bulk-billing is being reduced across this country. It is making it harder for families, particularly those on lower incomes, to afford to go to see their GPs, let alone see their specialists. When they do have to see the doctor, they are facing a bigger copayment because of the increase in GP fees. The Prime Minister's words are coming true, because that is the real agenda of the government. They are setting out to destroy Medicare and they are doing it by their failure to support bulk-billing and do something to ensure that families in this country can once again have access to decent health services.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2002-08-27,"—It amazes me how Labor continues to try to trawl back through past history for statements of the Prime Minister.
Opposition senator—Now we have got one.
—Paul Keating, for example, supported a GST in the past, didn't he?
—Not your GST.
—Yes, exactly right. Paul Keating supported a GST in the past.
—Not your model.
—That is exactly right: the concept of a GST is well known to have been supported by Prime Minister Keating.
—This is about bulk-billing, not the GST.
—If you guys want to bring up the past with respect to the current Prime Minister's policies, I cannot see how my bringing up the past with respect to a former Prime Minister's support for a policy is any less relevant. The government's support for Medicare is well established, as is the support for bulk-billing. Senator Forshaw has brought up the private health industry. Labor almost destroyed the private health industry and applied so much pressure to the public health system that growing waiting lists for surgery in the state hospital systems are well known. In my state, in the last 12 months or so—in fact, over the last four years, the Labor government there has not done anything to assist with waiting lists—patients have been sent home from hospital three times, waiting to get into surgery.
I do not see how Labor can in any way have any credentials or claim any credentials with respect to their support for the health system—particularly the public health system—given their record at the state level over the last few years. There has been a decline in bulk-billing services across Australia. But bulk-billing remains high, with more than seven out of every 10 GP visits being bulk-billed, so I do not understand this frenetic attack with respect to bulk-billing. What is the big deal about waiting until Friday? We will be back here in a fortnight, if you want to ask us a question about it and have a chat then. It seems that somebody wants some great excitement over the fact that, if it is going to be Friday, it is going to be Friday.
For Australians over 65, the bulk-billing rate is over 80 per cent—eight out of 10. There is a significant number of people who still have access to this service, and the federal government's commitment to it is well and truly established. The issues are extremely complex. The AMA promotes pushing up the Medicare rebates, but those sorts of actions alone will not address the problems that exist within the system. They will not ensure quality of care or provide outcomes for patients. It is an extremely complex issue. I think the ALP has also finally realised that increasing the Medicare rebate is not the answer to this problem. In fact, the shadow minister for health said so himself: 
... if you increase the Medical Services Rebate for GP consultations across the board that would cost the Commonwealth an extraordinarily large amount of money. But, you don't have to do that.
Your own shadow minister for health made that statement. There seems to be some extraordinary concern about the figures not being announced until Friday. Why is that so much of an issue? Why is it a problem that we cannot announce the figures until Friday? I really do not see that we should have a problem with that, and I do not see why the opposition should have a problem with that. It is quite a simple proposition that the government has its own timetable for making these announcements. I am sure that in past years, if you want to go back into history again, when the Labor Party were in government they would determine their timetables for these sorts of things. It is quite reasonable to expect that a government could meet its own times and timetables.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-08-27,"—With all due respect to Senator Colbeck, this has not been a `frenetic' attack; this has been a simple and straightforward call for government accountability. As we understand it, these figures should be available by now. They have again, as we understand, been sitting on the minister's desk for a couple of weeks—a claim that she did not deny in question time today. There is significant concern about the trends that were established with the last quarter's figures in March. Given this significant interest and concern about a decline in bulk-billing, it surprises me that the minister could not say today why there is a delay in the release of the figures. A certain level of parliamentary cynicism leads to the explanation that she is simply seeking to avoid public scrutiny of those figures by tabling them outside of a sitting fortnight. She may hope that in two weeks time, when we return, some of the heat of this issue will have dissipated, but I can assure Senator Patterson that the heat on this issue will not dissipate.
Senator Forshaw went back to some of the reasons why there is such a high level of cynicism about the government's position with respect to Medicare. I respond to Senator Colbeck's claim—that the government has a longstanding commitment to Medicare which has been clearly established—by saying that comments on the record clearly indicate that that is not the case. How can the Australian public not be cynical and think that there is another agenda going on with this decline in bulk-billing in Medicare when you have on the record the Prime Minister saying such things as:
We will be proposing changes to Medicare which amount to its de facto dismantling ...
Even for the Prime Minister to have used that language leads one towards cynicism.
—How long ago did he say that?
—He said in 1987:
We will be proposing changes to Medicare—
that in itself might have been fair enough, but he then went on to say:
which amount to its de facto dismantling ...
Why did he feel back then that he needed to talk in the de facto and why is he acting in the de facto today? Why is he allowing, as he has since the commencement of his government, such a significant decline in bulk-billing? Senator Patterson has said that the seeds of this problem date back to when Labor was in government, but the truth of the matter is that the seeds of this problem originate in the period for which she has had to cover up on many occasions: when the previous minister for health was at the helm. You can have some level—only a limited level—of sympathy for Senator Patterson; she has had to cover up several political problems associated with Dr Wooldridge, and this is another one. The government should have acted well before now to address the problems that would lead to this decline in Medicare bulk-billing, but the government did not act when it should have.
Senator Patterson has been left—which is typical in some respects—with an enormous mess in this area and with a significant challenge to directly fix a number of problems to ensure that we have a stable, reliable, universal health system. The test over the next few years will be whether she can succeed in that challenge, because she started with an enormous mess and she has a broad range of problems to address. Many of those problems are sores left by Dr Wooldridge. I can only hope that some of her statements about a commitment to bulk-billing will be responded to positively. 
I put out a release in relation to my local area and the March figures. These figures show that people are paying more for doctors' services in the area from the eastern fringe of Knox in Melbourne, through the Dandenong Ranges and around to Berwick, with many people being stretched by rising interest rates as well. How can this be justified? It cannot be justified. It is a mess that has been created by the Howard government, and I hope the minister is fair in her commitment to fix that mess.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2002-08-27,"—With great respect to the honourable senator who spoke before me, it is not enough simply to bring the problem to this place and, in doing so, disclose a complete lack of understanding of the genesis of the problem and the reason for the problem coming to the surface. Yes, there is a problem. The decline is in medical GP services delivered on the ground, in the regions and in the outer metropolitan regions of Australia. That in itself is a very difficult, fundamental and complex problem. I do not expect that senators on the other side of this house, not coming from those regions or even visiting them very often, have any great understanding of it. The solution to the problem is not—as the state ministers would say—simply to increase the rebate. Even your own shadow minister says that that is not the solution. It is not good enough, senators, to come here carping about the problem without even a vague hint of the solution. That indicates that you have no real understanding of what the problem is about.
In my home state we are witnessing the naked intent to downgrade regional hospitals. Let us take the hinterland and city of Albany in Western Australia as an example. Albany has no surgeons and very few GPs. The reason for that is very simply that every single month there are 40 Royal Flying Doctor Service flights out of Albany, which has 50,000 people in the hinterland and city. So if you have appendicitis or a broken leg you are taken from your family and transported to Perth. That is what the Labor Party's solution to the problem is: simply to take the patients out of their homes, to take them away.
Let me underline that this government is fully committed to Medicare and bulk-billing. It is also, in absolute stark contrast to the record of the previous Labor government, fully committed to people living in regional Australia. And that is the fundamental difference. Manjimup has over 10 Royal Flying Doctor Service flights a week. If you are expecting a baby in Manjimup you cannot even have it in your hometown hospital. I say again that the government is fully committed to Medicare and bulk-billing. The state governments and senators opposite indicate a complete antithesis to, and lack of understanding of, what is happening in the delivery of health care services in regional Australia.
The bulk-billing rate is more than 80 per cent for Australians over the age of 65. We have committed over $562 million over the last four years to initiatives and incentives to get doctors into rural areas and $80 million to get doctors into outer metropolitan areas. Last year, in stark contrast to the record of the previous Labor government, there was a 4.3 per cent increase in doctors in rural Australia. That is a significant turnaround, a significant improvement.
The real solution to this problem lies firstly in senators having some understanding of the problem and in getting and enticing, in our free society, doctors to leave their inner suburban practices and travel to work in the regions and in outer metropolitan areas. In closing, I ask this: what is being offered from the other side of the chamber towards a solution to the complex nature of the problem confronting all of us here? Nothing, not one single solitary hint of a solution. We will tell you what the problem is and we will tell you that we understand the genesis of the problem. It is complex, and we are working on it. We will be the ones who solve the legacy that you have left us, that of having medical services leave regional and outer metropolitan Australia.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2002-08-27,"—I rise to take note of Senator Patterson's response regarding the bulk-billing crisis which becomes more and more serious by the day. In particular, I would like to speak of the effect that the government's lack of action on the bulk-billing crisis is having on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The electorates of Dobell and Robertson are particularly vulnerable to any watering down of the health system. The government's inaction over bulk-billing simply serves further to punish and marginalise families who have already suffered the consequences of the Howard government's 30 per cent increase in the cost of prescription medicines.
Now it has come to light that the Central Coast of New South Wales is one of the areas which has been hardest hit by doctors being forced to charge copayments. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, has refused to admit that there was a problem. The Australian Medical Association, the ALP and every state and territory government throughout the country have told her that bulk-billing was in crisis, yet she and her government have refused to take action.
Senator Patterson said that the concerns about the fall in bulk-billing rates were alarmist. She said that three out of four people are still being bulk-billed. Three out of four people is quite simply not enough. But on the Central Coast of New South Wales, which unfortunately is represented by two Liberal members of parliament, the situation is this: three in 10 patients there were not bulk-billed in the 12 months ending in March of this year. That means that in the past two years the number of patients on the Central Coast who have made copayments when visiting their GP has almost doubled. The average cost of copayments for a visit to a GP is $12. For a family from Gosford, in the seat of Robertson, with three kids who get the flu in quick succession, that is a pretty hefty bill. If they cannot afford the bill then they will have to take their kids to the Gosford Hospital in Holden Street. 
Increased pressure on emergency rooms at hospitals has been reported, specifically because of this problem. Quite simply, the bulk-billing crisis is wreaking havoc on our system. We all know that the medical indemnity insurance crisis has haunted the medical profession. It is the increase in insurance premiums that has forced many doctors to stop bulk-billing. The insurance problem has had the direct effect of decreasing the accessibility of Australia's health services. On the Central Coast, approximately 15 per cent fewer visits to GPs are bulk-billed than they were two years ago.
It is because of Senator Patterson ignoring the problem that it has become worse. The Liberals are responsible. Every time someone goes to their GP and has to make a copayment because he or she no longer bulk-bills, it is the Liberal Party's fault. But Senator Patterson could not admit that there was a problem, because Senator Coonan, who has been given the responsibility of sorting out this blow-out of insurance costs, simply cannot handle it and simply has no solutions. Instead of focusing on the bulk-billing problems facing Australians—in particular, hurting the people of the Central Coast and in particular the people of Dobell and Robertson—Senator Patterson has been protecting her fellow Liberal minister to the detriment of the people of Australia. She has sold out the people on the Central Coast to protect one of her own.
The Prime Minister has been determined ever since he made those statements in 1987 to destroy Medicare, a system that was introduced by Bob Hawke. He said he would get rid of the bulk-billing system. Now, instead of being honest about it like he was in the 1980s, he is eroding it by stealth. Senator Patterson has denied there is a problem with the system. The people on the Central Coast know there is a problem; they see it every day. The Prime Minister's vendetta against Medicare and bulk-billing is becoming clearer and clearer. First there was the increase in the cost of medicine. Now there is the avoidance of taking action on bulk-billing. It is not good enough and people know that ignoring a problem will not make it go away.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-08-27,"—I present the 106th report of the Privileges Committee entitled Possible improper interference with a witness before the Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident.
Ordered that the report be printed. 
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate endorse the findings at paragraph 1.41 of the 106th report.
On 16 May 2002 the Senate referred the following matter to the Committee of Privileges:
Having regard to the matter submitted to the President by the Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident whether there was any attempted or actual interference with a witness before the committee in respect of a witness's evidence and whether any contempt of the Senate was committed in that regard.
The allegation was raised by Rear Admiral Raydon Gates in a minute to the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill. It related to a meeting between Dr Brendon Hammer, at the time an assistant secretary in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Commander Stefan King, who had previously been Defence liaison officer in that department, and another PM&C officer. The minute led to a letter which Dr Hammer wrote to Commander King just two days before Commander King was scheduled to give evidence before the maritime incident committee. 
The questions for the Privileges Committee to determine were: firstly, whether the meeting was called in an attempt to influence Commander King about evidence he might be called to give before the committee, and whether the letter, which responded to the allegation made by Rear Admiral Gates, itself constituted possible improper interference. The Committee of Privileges has concluded from all the evidence before it, particularly the unequivocal evidence of Dr Hammer and Commander King—the two persons primarily involved—that no improper influence was ever attempted, much less exerted, in respect of this matter. The committee's comment and conclusions are at paragraphs 1.33 to 1.40 of its report, leading to a finding that no contempt of the Senate was committed. 
The committee was anxious to make a report to the Senate at the earliest possible opportunity, in order to exonerate a senior public servant who, as he has indicated in his submission to the committee, has suffered considerably as a result of this matter having arisen. As the report makes clear, the maritime incident committee had little choice, on the basis of the material before it, but to raise the matter. It is, nevertheless, unfortunate for the individual concerned and for other officers that the process had to be gone through at all, given the nature of the committee's conclusions and findings.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2002-08-27,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the first report of 2002, entitled Proposed common use infrastructure on Christmas Island. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This report specifically deals with improvements to the Christmas Island airport and, in particular, the extension of the airport runway 460 metres north and 90 metres south. The current runway length and strength are inadequate for the freighter aircraft 747-400 and Antonov required for the space launch facility. Without the proposed airport upgrades, the Asia Pacific Space Centre operations cannot proceed. The estimated cost of the airport upgrade is $51.3 million.
I should note that on 9 August 2001 a similar proposal was referred to the committee by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. That reference lapsed as a result of the prorogation of the parliament on 8 October. That proposal included an airport upgrade, an additional port on the east coast and a new link road from the east coast to Lily Beach Road. Prior to prorogation, the department applied to the committee for concurrent documentation. The committee granted its approval in September 2001 on the ground of the urgent nature of the project. Such approval allowed the department to undertake preliminary planning associated with the project. 
The proposal referred to the committee on 21 March 2002 deals only with the upgrades to the Christmas Island airport and does not include the additional port and the new link road. These two projects were incorporated into the infrastructure works associated with the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre, which were the subject of an expediency motion moved by the parliamentary secretary in the House of Representatives on the same day.
The airport upgrade will provide improved services for the Christmas Island community and a facility for large-bodied aircraft. Attracting large-bodied aircraft is essential for the Christmas Island economy. The airport generates revenue from landing charges based on aircraft tonnage. Present forecasts indicate that the number of aircraft using the airport will rise from 423 to approximately 1,350 in 2006. 
The proposal as presented to the committee posed three major challenges. First, there is a lack of emergency services at the airport, including fire tenders and associated vehicle storage facilities. While these services were included in the original referral in August last year, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, considered that these services would not now be required because of low airport utilisation. The committee does not accept CASA's exemption of the firefighting services, particularly as the upgraded airport is designed to cater for increased traffic associated with the operations of the Asia Pacific Space Centre. As a result, the committee has recommended that an urgent approach be made by the Department of Transport and Regional Services to CASA to remove its exemption on the provision of emergency services at the airport.
The second area of concern relates to the operation of Christmas Island Phosphates. This company is currently the largest business and employer on the island. The committee is keen to ensure that employment prospects for the local community are not adversely affected by any loss of potential mining areas as a consequence of the airport upgrade. To this end, the committee has recommended that the Department of Transport and Regional Services enter into a dialogue with Christmas Island Phosphates in order to reach a compromise with regard to the removal of phosphate deposits from areas affected by the airport improvements. The company's activities, however, should not impact on the cost or the time frame of the project.
The third issue relates to the possible impact on the local infrastructure and services as a result of an anticipated increase in the number of workers associated with the public works projects. From observation and discussions with the local community, the committee was left in no doubt that any inflow of numbers of people to the island could impose a serious burden on services. The committee has therefore recommended that the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government consider a social impact study and, if necessary, institute action to upgrade the island's infrastructure and services to ensure that the local community is in no way disadvantaged by an increase in the population.
The committee supports this project and believes that, irrespective of the space centre proceeding, an upgraded airport for Christmas Island would help to decrease the isolation of the local community by improving its air services. The committee also expects that the project would generate employment opportunities for the local community as well as developing the local skills base. The committee has recommended, therefore, that the proposed common use infrastructure project on Christmas Island proceed at a cost of $51.3 million, pending approval of the draft environmental impact statement and the fulfilment of the recommendations made in this report. 
Many people assisted the committee during the course of the inspections and public hearing on Christmas Island. I wish in particular to mention the exceptional efforts of the Administrator, Mr Bill Taylor, and thank him for his assistance. As many colleagues would remember, Mr Taylor was for many years a member of the Public Works Committee, and his knowledge of the operations of the committee was very helpful in every respect.
I wish also to thank my colleagues on the committee for their positive support and contribution. Some of the members are new to the committee and attended their first public works inquiry on Christmas Island. On behalf of the committee, I also wish to thank the staff of the secretariat for their consistent and wonderful support throughout this inquiry.
A couple of issues have been raised since we went to Christmas Island. Some have been raised by the Democrats—in particular, by Senator Bartlett on one occasion—in relation to environmental effects on Christmas Island and in relation to a number of other issues. I have listened carefully to speeches that have been made in relation to this proposed infrastructure support project and any potential impact that it might have on the island. Much of what I have heard from members of this chamber who have not had the opportunity to go to Christmas Island themselves has been ill informed and certainly does not represent the facts as they were presented to the committee during our public hearings. 
I refer to the full support of Environment Australia, and note that those environmentalists who were concerned about the frigate bird and other potentially endangered species were quite sure that the work that was to be undertaken and the care which would be taken in that work being done would not in any way be of detriment to the environment on Christmas Island, to any endangered species that may exist on the island or to the lifestyle of the people who work on the island. We were very cognisant of the fact that the main employer on Christmas Island, Christmas Island Phosphates, has a very strong and loyal work force. We wanted to make sure that their future was assured and not affected by this proposed infrastructure project.
This is a wonderful piece of infrastructure. The Asia Pacific Space Centre has enormous potential for Australia. We were told during the inquiry that they could become the largest taxpayer in Australia if everything they have planned comes to fruition. At this stage there is no reason why it should not. So it is very important that this project goes ahead as soon as possible, which is why we have made these recommendations. They are the result of a very thorough public hearing and public consultation process on Christmas Island. I know that others wish to speak on this report, so I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

This report specifically deals with improvements to the Christmas Island airport and, in particular, the extension of the airport runway 460 metres north and 90 metres south. The current runway length and strength are inadequate for the freighter aircraft 747-400 and Antonov required for the space launch facility. Without the proposed airport upgrades, the Asia Pacific Space Centre operations cannot proceed. The estimated cost of the airport upgrade is $51.3 million.
I should note that on 9 August 2001 a similar proposal was referred to the committee by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. That reference lapsed as a result of the prorogation of the parliament on 8 October. That proposal included an airport upgrade, an additional port on the east coast and a new link road from the east coast to Lily Beach Road. Prior to prorogation, the department applied to the committee for concurrent documentation. The committee granted its approval in September 2001 on the ground of the urgent nature of the project. Such approval allowed the department to undertake preliminary planning associated with the project. 
The proposal referred to the committee on 21 March 2002 deals only with the upgrades to the Christmas Island airport and does not include the additional port and the new link road. These two projects were incorporated into the infrastructure works associated with the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre, which were the subject of an expediency motion moved by the parliamentary secretary in the House of Representatives on the same day.
The airport upgrade will provide improved services for the Christmas Island community and a facility for large-bodied aircraft. Attracting large-bodied aircraft is essential for the Christmas Island economy. The airport generates revenue from landing charges based on aircraft tonnage. Present forecasts indicate that the number of aircraft using the airport will rise from 423 to approximately 1,350 in 2006. 
The proposal as presented to the committee posed three major challenges. First, there is a lack of emergency services at the airport, including fire tenders and associated vehicle storage facilities. While these services were included in the original referral in August last year, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, considered that these services would not now be required because of low airport utilisation. The committee does not accept CASA's exemption of the firefighting services, particularly as the upgraded airport is designed to cater for increased traffic associated with the operations of the Asia Pacific Space Centre. As a result, the committee has recommended that an urgent approach be made by the Department of Transport and Regional Services to CASA to remove its exemption on the provision of emergency services at the airport.
The second area of concern relates to the operation of Christmas Island Phosphates. This company is currently the largest business and employer on the island. The committee is keen to ensure that employment prospects for the local community are not adversely affected by any loss of potential mining areas as a consequence of the airport upgrade. To this end, the committee has recommended that the Department of Transport and Regional Services enter into a dialogue with Christmas Island Phosphates in order to reach a compromise with regard to the removal of phosphate deposits from areas affected by the airport improvements. The company's activities, however, should not impact on the cost or the time frame of the project.
The third issue relates to the possible impact on the local infrastructure and services as a result of an anticipated increase in the number of workers associated with the public works projects. From observation and discussions with the local community, the committee was left in no doubt that any inflow of numbers of people to the island could impose a serious burden on services. The committee has therefore recommended that the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government consider a social impact study and, if necessary, institute action to upgrade the island's infrastructure and services to ensure that the local community is in no way disadvantaged by an increase in the population.
The committee supports this project and believes that, irrespective of the space centre proceeding, an upgraded airport for Christmas Island would help to decrease the isolation of the local community by improving its air services. The committee also expects that the project would generate employment opportunities for the local community as well as developing the local skills base. The committee has recommended, therefore, that the proposed common use infrastructure project on Christmas Island proceed at a cost of $51.3 million, pending approval of the draft environmental impact statement and the fulfilment of the recommendations made in this report. 
Many people assisted the committee during the course of the inspections and public hearing on Christmas Island. I wish in particular to mention the exceptional efforts of the Administrator, Mr Bill Taylor, and thank him for his assistance. As many colleagues would remember, Mr Taylor was for many years a member of the Public Works Committee, and his knowledge of the operations of the committee was very helpful in every respect.
I wish also to thank my colleagues on the committee for their positive support and contribution. Some of the members are new to the committee and attended their first public works inquiry on Christmas Island. On behalf of the committee, I also wish to thank the staff of the secretariat for their consistent and wonderful support throughout this inquiry.
A couple of issues have been raised since we went to Christmas Island. Some have been raised by the Democrats—in particular, by Senator Bartlett on one occasion—in relation to environmental effects on Christmas Island and in relation to a number of other issues. I have listened carefully to speeches that have been made in relation to this proposed infrastructure support project and any potential impact that it might have on the island. Much of what I have heard from members of this chamber who have not had the opportunity to go to Christmas Island themselves has been ill informed and certainly does not represent the facts as they were presented to the committee during our public hearings. 
I refer to the full support of Environment Australia, and note that those environmentalists who were concerned about the frigate bird and other potentially endangered species were quite sure that the work that was to be undertaken and the care which would be taken in that work being done would not in any way be of detriment to the environment on Christmas Island, to any endangered species that may exist on the island or to the lifestyle of the people who work on the island. We were very cognisant of the fact that the main employer on Christmas Island, Christmas Island Phosphates, has a very strong and loyal work force. We wanted to make sure that their future was assured and not affected by this proposed infrastructure project.
This is a wonderful piece of infrastructure. The Asia Pacific Space Centre has enormous potential for Australia. We were told during the inquiry that they could become the largest taxpayer in Australia if everything they have planned comes to fruition. At this stage there is no reason why it should not. So it is very important that this project goes ahead as soon as possible, which is why we have made these recommendations. They are the result of a very thorough public hearing and public consultation process on Christmas Island. I know that others wish to speak on this report, so I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

(11)	Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 21), at the end of the Schedule, add:
7  After section 299
Insert:
299A  Method of making payments
Payment by direct credit or by cheque
	(1)	If the Electoral Commission is required to pay an amount under section 299 to the agent or principal agent of a party, the Electoral Commission must pay the amount:
	(a)	if the party has nominated a bank account for the purposes of this section—to the credit of that account; or
	(b)	otherwise—by cheque payable to the party.
Nominated bank account
	(2)	A bank account nominated by a party for the purposes of this section must satisfy the following conditions:
	(a)	the account must be maintained by the party;
	(b)	the account must be with a bank;
	(c)	the account must be kept in Australia;
	(d)	the account name must consist of, or include:
	(i)	if the account is maintained by a registered political party—the name of the party as it appears in the Register of Political Parties; or
	(ii)	if the account is held by a State branch of a political party, and the branch is not a registered political party—the name of the State branch.
Name on cheque
	(3)	For the purposes of this section, a cheque is taken not to be payable to a party unless:
	(a)	if the party is a registered political party—the cheque is made out:
	(i)	if a determination under subsection (4) is in force in relation to the name of the party—in the special abbreviation of the name of the party; or
	(ii)	otherwise—in the name of the party, being the name as it appears in the Register of Political Parties; or
	(b)	if the party is a State branch of a political party, and the branch is not a registered political party—the cheque is made out:
	(i)	if a determination under subsection (4) is in force in relation to the name of the State branch—in the special abbreviation of the name of the State branch; or
	(ii)	otherwise—in the name of the State branch.
Abbreviation of party names
	(4)	The Electoral Commission may, by notice published in the Gazette, determine that a specified abbreviation of the name of a party is a special abbreviation of the name of the party for the purposes of this section.
	(5)	The Electoral Commission must publish a copy of a notice under subsection (4) on the Internet.
	(6)	Before making a determination under subsection (4) in relation to a party, the Electoral Commission must consult the party.
	(7)	To avoid doubt, if a cheque under this section is made out in the special abbreviation of the name of a party, the cheque is as valid as it would have been if it had been made out in the name of the party.
Dispatch of cheques
	(8)	To avoid doubt, if a cheque under this section is payable to a party, this section does not prevent the Electoral Commission from dispatching the cheque to the agent or principal agent of the party.
Definitions
	(9)	In this section:
bank means a body corporate that is an ADI (authorised deposit-taking institution) for the purposes of the Banking Act 1959.
party means a registered political party or a State branch of a registered political party.
This amendment relates to a recommendation from the Australian Electoral Commission in 1996 that provides that the Electoral Commission will make a payment of public funding by direct deposit into a nominated bank account, or by cheque when there is no nominated bank account, and provides that cheques pertaining to public funding are to be made out in the name of the registered political party, not in the agent's name, as is currently the case. I have always thought that a very sensible recommendation. I have been disappointed the government has not had the opportunity to bring it forward before. I hope it is relatively non-contentious on all sides of the parliament, but I did think this was an opportunity, if we were dealing with funding, to address this. The amendment inserts a new section 299A, which provides that the AEC will make the payment to public funding by direct deposit into a nominated bank account.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-08-27,"—I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 2593:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 21), at the end of the Schedule, add:
7  After Section 306
Insert:
306A  Repayment of donations where corporations wound up etc.
		Where:
	(a)	a political party, a candidate or a member of a group receives a donation from a corporation being a donation the amount of which is equal to or exceeds $1,000; and
	(b)	the corporation within a period concluding on year after making the donation has been wound up in insolvency or wound up by the court on other grounds;
an amount equal to the amount of the donation is payable by the political party to the liquidator and may be recovered by the liquidator as a debt due to the liquidator by action, in a court of competent jurisdiction against:
	(c)	in the case of a donation to or for the benefit of a political party or a State branch of a political party:
	(i)	if the party or branch, as the case may be, is a body corporate—the party or branch, as the case may be; or
	(ii)	in any other case—the agent of the party or branch, as the case may be; or
	(d)	in any other case—the candidate or a member of the group or the agent of the candidate or of the group, as the case may be.
Note 1:	The donation received by the liquidator is an asset of the corporation to be distributed under the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001.
Note 2:	This section applies to donations made after the commencement of this provision.
We have debated this a little, but let me outline it to the committee again. This amendment would mean that, where a donation has been made to a political party or candidate by a corporate entity and then that company goes broke, if the donation was made within 12 months of the winding up of the company then the political party would have to repay the money. The aim of this amendment is to put the people who lose their money when this corporation collapses first.
There has been some press debate about the matter, but we think it is a good thing that this amendment be dealt with now. The Labor amendment of last night that would have seen this amendment, with other amendments, go to a committee so that we could have had public submissions and a little bit more debate was a very sensible one, and the Greens supported that, but the government and the Democrats did not and so that was lost. We are therefore left with a very good amendment by the Greens which has a very important outcome but which is not subject to refinement. I know that both the Labor Party and Senator Murphy from Tasmania have some concerns, but this is the time to put forward this amendment. I recommend it to the committee.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-08-27,"—I think that Senator Brown is really onto something here—I think his intent is first-rate—but when I looked at the amendment two things worried me straightaway. One was the time period and the second was whether this would introduce another level of law related to insolvencies, apart from those which already exist, so I commissioned a bit of research. If you do not mind, Senator Brown, I will deal with it at some length. The insolvency provisions in the Corporations Act aimed to achieve a balance between payment of company debts and protecting parties that have received money from the insolvent company. Essentially, section 588FF of the Corporations Act states that if a court is satisfied that a transaction involving the payment of money is `voidable'—and that is the word they use—it may make an order directing that the party receiving the money repay the company an amount equal to some or all of the money paid by the company in the transaction. Voidable transactions are defined in section 588FE and include a transaction if—and I quote:
(a) it is an insolvent transaction—
and also an uncommercial transaction—
of the company; and
(b) it was entered into, or an act was done for the purpose of giving effect to it:
(i) during the 6 months ending on the relation-back day ...
Further, an insolvent transaction is defined in section 588FC in the following way:
A transaction of a company is an insolvent transaction of the company if, and only if, it is an unfair preference given by the company, or an uncommercial transaction of the company, and:
(a) any of the following happens at a time when the company is insolvent:
(i) the transaction is entered into; or
(ii) an act is done, or an omission is made, for the purpose of giving effect to the transaction; or
(b) the company becomes insolvent because of, or because of matters including:
(i) entering into the transaction; or 
(ii) a person doing an act, or making an omission, for the purpose of giving effect to the transaction.
Therefore, generally speaking, an insolvent transaction is one that was entered into when either the company was insolvent or the company becomes insolvent as a result of the transaction. The legislation also defines `uncommercial transaction' in section 588FB, which I will not quote unless you need it.
We consider that it is possible that a political party donation could be regarded as an uncommercial transaction. Therefore, if a political party donation has been made when the company was insolvent or the company becomes insolvent as a result of the transaction, the court may make an order for the donation to be paid back to the insolvent party as per section 588FF. There is also a section 588FG, which is protection for parties that receive payments from companies, and the Corporations Act in that section also states that some transactions are not voidable and hence may not be recovered by the liquidator for the purposes of paying out creditors. Those sections—and again I will not quote them unless you ask me to—essentially offer receivers of money the right to retain the money when they have received it in good faith, and that is important, and met the other criteria within the section. This gives parties who receive money from insolvent companies additional protection against the insolvency.
Senator Brown's amendment differs from the current legal arrangements in the following ways. There is no obvious link between the political donation and the insolvency—that is, the donation can be made at any point in time up to three years before winding up and does not need to have led the company into insolvency or had been made whilst the company was insolvent, such as in section 588FC. There is a three-year time frame governing repayments in Senator Brown's amendment. Therefore, the political party may be forced to repay donations received three years later. The Corporations Act says that uncommercial transactions are voidable under the Corporations Act only if they were entered into two years before the company wind-up began. Thirdly, there is no protection for a party that receives the money in good faith in Senator Brown's amendment, such as set out in section 588FG.  
So what I say through the chair to Senator Brown is that I think he is on the right track, but it would be preferable to link the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act across the Corporations Act so that you have the same provisions applying regardless of who the entity is. I do not think political parties should be dealt with differently from other parties that are affected by creditors' interests or insolvency circumstances.
I am hoping that an amendment to Senator Brown's amendment would have the effect of making that linkage. I am seeking a signpost which says that, in the Electoral Act here, in these circumstances, if creditors come after political parties because either they received donations when a company was insolvent or it was an uncommercial transaction and they are in liquidation, the court may provide for some or all of that money to be repaid or may say that the money was accepted in good faith and it is all right. My nervousness—and I really do emphasise, Senator Brown, that I think you are on the right track—is that, if we allow Senator Brown's amendment into the Electoral Act, we are creating a new condition for insolvency arrangements which are not the same as those which have applied in Australian law for many years and are well known. If I can use that lead-in as a means to move my amendment to Senator Brown's amendment, I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 2605:

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-08-27,"—In a spirit of cooperation, I make two technical points in response to the amendments moved by the Greens and the Democrats. I may be labouring under a misapprehension but the version of the Commonwealth Electoral Act that I have already contains a section on this— section 306A. Therefore, might I respectfully suggest that, if you do want to pursue your amendment, you make it 306B; otherwise, you would potentially be deleting the section that deals with certain loans not to be received.
Further, I draw the Greens' attention to the fact that section 287(1) contains the definition of `gift'. The Greens' amendment has the word `donation' peppered through it. In fairness, I can understand how this error has occurred, because the Electoral Commission refers to `donations' in its disclosures. I also understand that there are subheadings in the act that somehow refer to donations, yet donations are not as defined in the act but gifts are. Of course, I hope this amendment will not be carried, and I will explain the reasons for that later on, but I indicate to the chamber that if it were carried and it was legislatively sound from a technical point view, the amendment ought to be for the insertion of section 306B; wherever the word `donation' occurs it ought to be deleted and the word `gift' inserted; and wherever the word `donations' appears the word `gifts' ought to be inserted.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-08-27,"—Let me assure you that you are very even in the way you deal with these matters, Mr Temporary Chairman. At this point in the debate, I would like to address Senator Murray's amendment to Senator Brown's amendment. I could say that even the matters most recently raised by Senator Abetz, in my view, reinforce the point that Senator Brown made to the committee a short time ago about a preferable course of action being for the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and amendments to it to be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I think he was correct to stress that that would have been a preferable course of action, but it is not the case. We have already dealt with one very complex amendment from Senator Murray and I think it is appropriate now, as we are well into the committee debate, to try and bring these matters to a conclusion also. 
Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I ask Senator Murray whether he has given any consideration to the significance of bringing over concepts of Corporations Law, such as uncommercial transactions, into the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I do not know whether Senator Murray has had an opportunity to seek legal advice of any nature or advice from AEC officers, but I think it would be useful for us in the committee to understand if that is the case, because it is a crucial issue. I would like to be clear on the issue of whether a donation from a company to a political party can be an uncommercial transaction. I do not know, and on behalf of the opposition I can say, as I look at the approach the opposition will be taking, that that is the sort of clarity which will certainly inform the decision that we take. I wonder whether Senator Murray could assist the committee in relation to this matter.
I stress that there are matters of substance that go also to the amendment that has been moved by Senator Brown, but I think that at this stage I would like to confine my remarks to the issues of substance I have just discussed. I do not know whether Senator Murphy wants to make a point about that; I detect that he is at least interested in this issue, judging by his close attention to this element of the debate. It is a threshold issue that we ought to deal with, but I indicate to the committee that I want to return to Senator Brown's amendment at a later stage.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-08-27,"—Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I think you are wise, Senator Faulkner, to be cautious—let us start with that concession straight away. The amendment that Senator Brown produced was circulated yesterday. I had a look at it and thought that the intent was a good one, as I have said already. As I also said—and Senator Brown can speak for himself—the intent as I see it is that in circumstances where a donation has been made and a recovery is sought by a liquidator then in circumstances where it would be justified the donation from the corporation should be returned. That is a principle which, to my knowledge, has long been established in insolvency. When a company or an entity becomes insolvent, goes bankrupt or is put under administration or liquidation the liquidator or administrator has always had the option to recover moneys paid out if, in certain circumstances, that was justified. Those include circumstances of good faith, trading when insolvent and so on.
As Senator Faulkner knows, most political parties, in their membership nature, are constituted as unincorporated bodies, but a number of political parties have associations incorporated under state associations acts of one kind or another, and of course there are political parties that have corporate entities which fall under the Corporations Act. The section that defines an uncommercial transaction—because I think that was a good question Senator Faulkner asked—is 588FB. It states: 
(1) A transaction of a company is an uncommercial transaction of the company if, and only if, it may be expected that a reasonable person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction, having regard to:
(a) the benefits (if any) to the company of entering into the transaction; and
(b) the detriment to the company of entering into the transaction; and
(c) the respective benefits to other parties to the transaction of entering into it; and
(d) any other relevant matter.
(2) A transaction may be an uncommercial transaction of a company because of subsection (1):
(a) whether or not a creditor of the company is a party to the transaction; and
(b) even if the transaction is given effect to, or is required to be given effect to, because of an order of an Australian court or a direction by an agency.
The first question anyone should ask—and I defer, I must say, to Senator Faulkner's very long experience in electoral law—is whether there is case law that relates to this area. My answer is that I do not think so, but I do not know, because I have not turned up any research. The second question arises as to whether it is common for political parties to be subject to the provisions of the Corporations Act. The answer is sometimes. It depends on whether they have those structures within their own situation. The third question you should ask is whether political parties as institutions or entities are subject to the laws which govern entities in the broader sense— taxation, employment, the issues of reporting and responsibility—and the answer to that is yes. There is general and well-established case law that, in terms of the transactions of what may be regarded as not-for-profit organisations, there are clear common duties and obligations which are not affected by the fact that they happen to carry out a business, if I can use that word loosely, of a political party.
I readily admit to Senator Faulkner that I had to react to this on the run. I felt that Senator Brown had picked up an issue of concern. There has been some press comment over the last couple of years where donations which are believed to be improper have been made to political parties and other bodies—not just political parties—by insolvent companies or companies in administration or under liquidation. From my reading of recent corporate collapses I think that some of those may end up in the courts, but it is too early to work it out.
All the advice I have had is that the Corporations Act provisions may apply in certain circumstances to some activities or entities of political parties. All I have attempted to do is to suggest that if that is a question at issue then you signpost it across from the political donations section of the act and say, `By the way, here's the cross-reference.' My legislative understanding is that it is not uncommon for one act to signpost to another, but perhaps Senator Faulkner could tell me that. All we have done is say that if you are talking about a voidable transaction, which is the key threshold, go to the Corporations Act and see whether it applies in the circumstance of political donations. The last thing I will say is: if you want to know whether I have done extensive research, if I know all the case law or if I have inquired into it endlessly, no, I have not.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-08-27,"—I speak in regard to the two amendments thus proposed. Firstly, on Senator Brown's amendment, which I have spoken to him about, the concern that I have—and I think it was also raised by Senator Murray— is that there is no capacity in it for a person who may have received a donation to have received it in good faith. They become the person responsible for the money if the company becomes insolvent for whatever reason. There are no reasons set out here. I know Senator Brown's intention is very well aimed, but I think what he has proposed by way of amendment could catch a lot of innocent parties.
A private company could become insolvent because the owner of the company has gone to the casino too many times and lost all his money. The company therefore becomes insolvent and there is a matter of liquidation. He could be a sole creditor. Maybe there are other creditors such as the bank and/or some other people that may be involved so that a political party or a candidate is then required to repay the money because of a stupid action—or it could be that the company was manufacturing widgets which went out of fashion and therefore it became insolvent. The amendment is too open-ended in that respect, and that is what worries me. I think it is well intentioned, I think it is something that we should seek to address, but I just do not feel that the amendment proposed in its current form can actually address what it seeks to address. 
With regard to the points made by Senator Murray, and his amendment, I have some concerns that his proposal to make reference in the Electoral Act to certain circumstances being covered by the Corporations Act has its own problems as well. When we talk about a voidable transaction, as Senator Murray has said, we find that the definition in section 588FE states:
(a) it is an insolvent transaction, and also an uncommercial transaction, of the company; and
(b) it was entered into, or an actwas done for the purpose of giving effect to it, during the 2 years ending on the relation-back day.
The `relation-back day' of course is the day that the company becomes insolvent, but it has to be both of those things. Senator Faulkner raised a question about uncommercial transactions. I guess some people would say that a donation to any political party or candidate is an uncommercial transaction because some people think that they do not get much worth out of any of us. So I think there are some shortcomings with just referring this back to the Corporations Law as it currently stands.
—It's got to be insolvent first.
—Senator Murray interjects, `It's got to be insolvent first.' That is correct, but it could become insolvent for a number of reasons. We need to look at this more closely. I do not disagree with what he is proposing in respect of it being covered under the Corporations Law, but I think we need to have a little more substance and direct application to what is currently in the Corporations Law if we are to pick this matter up. In some circumstances, why should it be the responsibility of a party and/or a candidate who may have received the donation in good faith to actually repay it? Why shouldn't it be the responsibility of the directors of the company—who made the donation in the first place—to repay the money?
I often hear from the government in respect of unions making donations to the Labor Party. They say, `Well, the unions make those donations on the basis of no consent from the membership of the union.' Why should it not be the case that a company making a donation to a political party should not get the consent of the shareholders of the company? Why should that not be the case? With regard to trade unions making donations to the Labor Party, if the government want to come in here and argue, as they have done in the past, that the unions should do so on the basis that they get the consent of their membership, why should it not be the case that companies do the same with their shareholders? I believe it should be the case. Of course, I do not expect that the minister will stand in his place and argue that case. If you look at the political donations that have been made by public companies in this country, I suspect that a large proportion of those, maybe not fifty-fifty, probably vote one way or the other in a party political sense.
I have to say that I have no proposed amendment to put forward. I have been trying to look at how some arrangement might be put in place to actually put some onus on these people that are making donations when their company is in a bad state of affairs. I think that is a very worthwhile exercise; I just do not believe what is being proposed at the moment provides a solution to that problem. I think we should try and work on that. Of course, I accept the fact that we are halfway through a debate on this current bill. Maybe it is something that we need to make a commitment to look at in the future—to make some changes to both the Electoral Act and the Corporations Law to cover these sorts of things.
I have to say through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator Murray that I do not have as much faith as he does in the current Corporations Law to actually bring some of these people to justice in respect of some of the donations that have been made to executives of some of the companies that have gone down the chute in recent times. I do not think any of the money will be recovered, and I do not think these particular laws will achieve that objective. In fact, I suspect there has not been any rush to the courts at the moment because of the very failure of these particular laws as they currently stand to really deliver an outcome, and that is what concerns me with this particular approach. I think the intention of the proposed amendments is very good, but I do not think they can achieve what they are actually setting out to do.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-08-27,"—We are shortly going to have a choice between accepting the Greens' amendment— which I think very clearly improves the situation and requires political parties to return money where corporations have gone bust, so that shareholders will at least get some extra money—and doing nothing. People are going to have to make their choice on that. I would just remind Senator Murray, firstly, that this amendment from me on behalf of the Australian Greens was circulated last week; it did not come in last night.
—My apologies; that's when I saw it.
—Thank you, Senator Murray. Secondly, I did amend this, after conversing with you last night, from three years to one year. I am very sad about that because I think it would be much better if we had the situation where, if a donation has come from a corporation within three years—which is the electoral cycle—and the corporation goes bust, the political party or entity pays it back to the liquidator. Then there is that bit of extra cushion for the people who lose when such corporations go bust. But, in the hope of getting the support of the Democrats and in talking with Senator Murray, I did draw it back to one year because I think it is important that we do make a step in this direction.
Can I say that the Corporations Law is the Corporations Law. We are talking about the Electoral Act. The Electoral Act sets out the rules for accepting donations, whether they come from corporations or from individuals. It is for us to talk about the rules of when those donations should be returned, and we should not leave it to the Corporations Act. We are dealing here with an electoral matter. This is a Greens' amendment to make a first step towards dealing with what should happen with a donation in the situation where a donation has come from a corporate entity which then goes bust. The current situation is that nothing happens; we keep the donation. I agree with the Telegraph newspaper in Sydney that there is some moral case to be put here, where politicians and political parties should return the money if it was paid by a corporation that then goes bust within the near past. I do not think political parties are the same as everybody else.
We have to recognise that we have a whole suite of legislation here dealing with how we should take gifts, how they should be assessed and how they should be made public. It is unique and different; it does not apply to any entities other than political parties and candidates. In this legislation we have to work out whether or not there are circumstances—I believe there are—where the gift or donation should be returned, and then what the parameters are for that. It has turned out that this Greens amendment makes those parameters very tight indeed. I would like to see them much wider—the Greens disagree with the whole donation system. Here is a situation where there are competing interests. There are those people who suffer when a corporation goes bust and there are those political entities who are advantaged by the donation that has come from that corporation. I do not think we should leave it to the Corporations Act and some amendment at some time in the future. We are dealing with the here and now. Here is the opportunity—and the test is coming very shortly in a vote on this amendment. I want to thank Senator Abetz for drawing my attention to the lack of definition in the legislation of the word `donation', while the word `gift' is defined. I am quite happy—and I have suggested this—to move an amendment to my amendment that, where the word `donation' or `donations' appears in my original amendment, it be changed to `gift' or `gifts' as the case may be. 
—What about section 305?
—When it comes to section 306A or 306B, the process here is that this would become section 306B. This process is automatic, but if it is required of me that I actually put that into words or if it is going to change anybody's vote—if it is going to help Senator Abetz vote for the amendment—then I will move that. Otherwise it is redundant. To clear everybody's mind on this, I firstly say that it is not going to affect the Greens insofar as I am concerned. I did not approach this legislation asking who is going to gain or who is going to lose, but there are two pertinent cases in point. One is the HIH collapse. I understand that a donation of some $100,000 went to the Liberals from that company, and that could be repayable under the Greens amendment. Now that we are into a one-year restriction, though, that becomes somewhat doubtful. That worries me. On the other hand, Froggy, the Internet company, made a donation of some $180,000 to the Labor Party, and that could be repayable under this legislation. I note that a donation of $10,000 in Western Australia to, I think, the National Party has been returned, and what a good thing. I applaud that happening, but I think we should make it even for everybody.
Finally, let me say to Senator Murphy that this legislation is not meant to catch people out. It is not retrospective, tempting as it was to make it retrospective; it is prospective. It is a `Beware!' to all of us in the future: if you take a donation from a corporate entity and that corporate entity goes bust in the next 12 months, you will have to repay it. Everybody who is standing for parliament and every political party that accepts a donation is going to know that. It is fair for everybody. It is called taking a calculated risk; it is called probity, if you ask me. We take the risk in accepting a donation anyway. It is going to turn up on the public record, and you are going to have to wear the fact that you took money from this or that corporation. A whole ethical judgment is made in first taking a gift from a corporation, from a union or from somewhere else. Let us extend the ethics of that a little and say: `If this corporation or entity that gives us the money goes bust, the people that that corporation is in debt to, including its shareholders, get the benefit and we have to pay back the money.' It is a good amendment, and I hope the committee will vote for it.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I wish to take a point of order. It goes to the two questions before the chair. An amendment stands in the name of Senator Brown and an amendment to that amendment has been moved by Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats. While it could be argued that the subject area of the amendment to the amendment is similar in the broad, I respectfully suggest that there is no other relevance at all beyond the broader subject area. For the good conduct of the committee—and the reason I take this as a point of order is that I think there is a procedural issue in relation to our consideration of this bill—we may well be better off if Senator Murray's amendment to Senator Brown's amendment is moved as a separate amendment.
I think that it is appropriate in these circumstances. I accept that this is a decision on balance. As a question of good order, along with the substantive procedural point, if you do not accept the point of order that I am putting forward, Mr Temporary Chairman, I suggest respectfully to Senator Murray that he might give some consideration to it. I am just a little concerned that, if the committee makes a substantive decision on Senator Murray's amendment to Senator Brown's amendment, there may or may not be an opportunity for the committee to then pass judgment on the original amendment that stands in the name of Senator Brown.
I think the committee would be better served by two separate amendments; I think there is a strong argument for two separate amendments. There is, of course, a capacity for senators to structure the committee debate in such a way that will allow for that. My question to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, is: is there, in fact, a procedural issue in relation to Senator Murray's amendment to Senator Brown's amendment? In my view, the Senator Murray amendment only bears relevance to the Senator Brown amendment in the absolute broader sense in terms of subject area. I think that is a fair point to make. I ask you to rule on that point of order. 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I think what you are suggesting, Senator Faulkner, is entirely sensible, and if there is no opposition I intend to put two questions. Therefore, if there is no other question before the chair, I will put the amendment to the amendment moved by Senator Murray.
—I think you have misunderstood my point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. I have taken a point of order to respectfully suggest that it is not suitable for Senator Murray to move an amendment to Senator Brown's amendment in this form, if I can cut to the chase. I do not think that, in the form that Senator Murray has proposed his amendment to Senator Brown's amendment, Senator Brown's amendment it is in fact amendable. Respectfully, there is further debate to be had. I certainly want to engage in further debate about the substantive issues, and I flagged that earlier in the committee stage.
What I am doing, I hope, assists the committee. I am not proposing a mechanism here that complicates the procedures. Let us boil it all down: the impact of my point of order goes to the order in which these questions will be put by you to this committee for determination. I think it is more sensible for the substantive amendment moved by Senator Brown to be put first and determined. If unsuccessful, or even if successful, Senator Murray then has an opportunity to move a further amendment. This seems to me to make more sense. I do not know if my colleagues who are moving the amendment and the amendment to the amendment agree, but it seems sensible from my point of view. If this is not acceptable then Senator Murray's question will be put first and determined first, and there may or may not be a need for you to progress the amendment that stands in the name of Senator Brown. I am asking you for a ruling on the procedural question, and then senators can give some consideration to the matters of substance that have led me to make the procedural point. I think the point of order is, nevertheless, an important one, so I would be interested in your ruling upon it.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on the point of order: I have absolutely no objection to Senator Brown's amendment being put first and mine second.
— Therefore, I put the question that Senator Brown's amendment be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-08-27,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, just to be clear before I begin my contribution, are we now dealing with these as separate questions before the chair?
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Yes.
—And Senator Murray's amendment will be put separately?
—Yes, after the question is decided in respect of Senator Brown's amendment.
—I think the committee, as it so often does, with the good sense of the Senate, tends to deal with these matters cognately. That is how I am interpreting it. They will be put separately and that will require Senator Murray to move a separate amendment, but by the time he does that we will effectively have conducted that debate. I appreciate Senator Murray's cooperation on that. I think it makes a lot of sense.
I share with Senator Murray the view that he has expressed. I think Senator Murphy has also expressed this. I support the spirit of Senator Brown's amendment. I may, in fact, even go further than supporting the spirit of it; I may well support the letter of it. The opposition may lend its weight to that amendment on the floor. Also, in making the point about the spirit of Senator Brown's amendment, I indicate to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that I equally support the spirit of what Senator Murray is trying to achieve. I am not sure that there is a major difference in the intention of the two senators in what they are trying to achieve, but very different mechanisms are proposed in relation to achieving that outcome. I think that is a fair summation of the issue that this committee is— 
— Senator Faulkner, it is almost five o'clock.
—Yes, I am aware that one of our colleagues is to make a speech, but I was intending to wax lyrical until the appointed hour. At this hour of the afternoon it may well be described to colleagues, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, as a bit of a filler. I know there is little interest in my contribution and there will be a great deal of interest in Senator Moore's contribution in a few moments time. But I am honest enough to admit it!
One of the problems that arises here under either proposal that we are considering is that, in relation to the money going back to the liquidator, that money clawed back would be allocated by the liquidator, as I understand it, in accordance with the priorities that are set out in the Corporations Law. There is quite a clear hierarchy there.
—The liquidator is first!
—The liquidator is first, the bank is second and ordinary people—the workers, the employees, the small business men and women and so forth—are the very last. That is an issue that is germane to this debate. Given the hour is nearly five o'clock, I will speak about it a little later.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Order! It being 5.00 p.m., pursuant to order, I report progress.
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-08-27,"—Again, I recommend this amendment to the chamber. I also thank Senator Murray for accepting the proposal put forward by Senator Faulkner, because it is a good way to go. I might ask Senator Murray if he thinks that his amendment covers exactly the Australian Greens amendment that we are now dealing with. I think there is quite a difference. I point out again that the aim of this amendment is to make out a special case for political parties. I am not demurring from that at all. So it is different to the provisions that exist for everybody in the Corporations Act.
We just heard an extremely good first speech from Senator Moore, full of heart and passion. It sounds very much like we have a great addition to the Senate there. Notwithstanding that, I will be sending her a copy of proposals made on Telstra by her own spokesperson, Mr Tanner. I have heard a couple of times in the Senate in the last week that Labor is the only political party that has not wavered on the matter. By her own standards, which are if you suggest there be a debate about it or a look at it then you have wavered, Labor has fallen very short of the mark of not having wavered—and so there should be— 
—Didn't you have a look at selling Telstra, Bob?
—We have political debate on all sorts of matters.
—I wouldn't go there, Bob.
—I just thought, `What a great opportunity to put down one's marker on that!' That said, I again recommend this amendment to the chamber. It is an amendment which means we return political donations to the liquidator if a company has gone bust within a year of giving those donations. The effect of that will be to help people who have lost their money. I accept Senator Faulkner's very true observation that this is not necessarily going to go to the right people. It might go to the banks or the liquidators themselves in the main. However, that is a matter for us to fix up in the Corporations Act. I will be very much behind any Labor move to do that, to ensure that the little people who get hurt when companies go bust are, through legislation, not put at the end of the run. That is what we see at the moment, with big banks, big organisations and, indeed, the liquidators getting first bite of the cherry. I do not think that is fair. When a company goes bust, there should be a more even-handed approach to the payment of what moneys are left to all those who have lost out. It should not be the average Australian shareholder or small other entity—person, individual, company—that has a debt owed to them by the company that goes bust who is last on the line. However, that is a matter for amendment in the Corporations Act. I would be very happy to support Labor or to cohost a review of those provisions in the Corporations Act. I recommend this Australian Greens amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-08-27,"—We heard an excellent speech from Senator Moore earlier. I am very surprised at the intervention by Senator Brown after that speech. I do not know how he kept a straight face. I am used to it. I have been rolled at party conferences all my life. I have never won anything, but you got rolled yourself. Why don't you just admit it and get on with it?
—I agree. I did. I am just saying that Labor, on this subject—
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order: Senator Brown has been at great pains to point out that interjections are disorderly; I remind him that, in the spirit of consistency—as with Telstra—he should desist.
 (Senator McLucas)—There is no point of order.
—I was not going to raise the issue, because I thought it would be disorderly to talk about such a matter during debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. I am not going to mention the fact that I thought it was a fine performance from Senator Brown to keep a straight face when he made that little commentary a few moments ago.
In relation to the substance of the matter that is before the committee—and it is an important issue that this committee is considering—we have to give some thought to the application of the Corporations Law to this area of Commonwealth electoral law. There is a substantive issue here about how effectively we can transpose the concepts of the Corporations Law into electoral law. It is a substantive issue for this committee and one that I do not think this committee should deal with lightly. Having said that, I reiterate that the spirit of these amendments is to be applauded. The spirit of these amendments is strongly supported by the Australian Labor Party.
Before Senator Moore's excellent first speech, I raised the point that the problem with the return of moneys to the liquidator under the provisions of the Corporations Law is that those moneys are allocated by the liquidator. The liquidator does not have any flexibility in relation to that allocation of moneys. The priorities are also clearly set out in the Corporations Law. I was pointing out that the hierarchy of priorities is effectively very much in the interests of the big end of town. The moneys go, firstly, to the liquidator and, secondly, to the banks and financial institutions, as I understand it. Then way down at the bottom of the list—right down at the end of the food chain—who do you find? You find the workers, the employees and the small business men and women such as cleaners, suppliers, other contractors and so on. I am sure that Senator Brown and Senator Murray would acknowledge that that is the reality of what we are dealing with. I accept the point that Senator Brown made a moment ago—the sensible point he made as opposed to the silly point he made about Telstra—that this is a matter for amendment to the Corporations Law. That is not before us at the moment. It is a difficult issue for this committee to grapple with, but it is a proper issue for this committee to identify. And I do identify that as a real problem. 
It just gives further weight to the substantive position that the opposition has taken to these amendments, to other amendments and to the bill as a whole, which is that it is a little risky to bumble into these sorts of areas and have very complex amendments like the one that Senator Murray moved earlier. I am very worried about the unintended consequences of that amendment. As Senator Murray knows, I am also worried about the intended consequences of Senator Murray's proposal. There is always a problem when you trample in these areas without a thorough examination of the impact of the amendments. It is important to put down some markers as to whether a political party should in principle return donations. I think that principle is unarguable in the sorts of circumstances that have been canvassed before this committee. If that is the proposal that comes forward from this committee, it would be a step in the right direction. I think that Senator Brown and Senator Murray have both been sensible in ensuring that there is no retrospective application for this—that is important for most law-making in this place and I think that it is generally accepted around the chamber. The issue of who such moneys should be returned to is important, although, as we acknowledged, this tends to be a matter that is determined by the Corporations Law and not by electoral law.
The other thing that Senator Brown and Senator Murray need to consider—as does this committee—is the areas where you can identify a clear difference between political parties and corporations. There is a clear difference between political parties and corporations in a range of areas. Most people understand that the things that political parties are on about are just different from those that corporations are on about. We hope that political parties are not-for-profit. We hope that political parties have different objectives from those you see in the corporate sector. We hope that people would acknowledge that the social role of political parties is very different from that of corporate entities. That is why, as we examine these amendments, we have to be very careful when we start applying the concepts and principles of corporate law to electoral law. The opposition do not immediately dive in and say, `This sounds like a pretty good idea; we will support it.' In the small amount of time that has been available to this committee, we have tried to examine as closely as possible the implications of the amendments before the chair. I would say to Senator Brown that I acknowledge that some significant changes have been made in his amendment to try and accommodate some of the concerns and difficulties that have already been identified during this committee stage.
I make this general point to the committee, which I think is a fair point: transposing the concepts of the Corporations Law, such as the one that was canvassed at some length earlier today on uncommercial transactions, into electoral law runs the risk of putting a square peg into a round hole. There is a risk, and it is a pity that we have not been able to look at all those implications more closely and more carefully than we have been able to do in this committee debate. The spirit of these amendments is supported by the Australian Labor Party and, as a result, the Australian Labor Party will support the amendment before the chair.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-08-27,"—I will briefly digress by congratulating Senator Moore on her first speech, and I trust that she has a long and rewarding career in the Senate. The amendment currently before the chamber deals with the repayment of donations or gifts where a corporation is wound up. This has been in the news courtesy of certain people putting forward what is, at the moment, a fairly simplistic analysis of what actually occurs. I note, with respect—and I will make sure my comments are nice and moderate— that this amendment has been policy on the run. We had a time frame of three years; now it is only going to be one year. Yet the transactions are potentially voidable under the Corporations Act. Depending on the section and the type of transaction they are, there is clawback: in section 588FE(2) the transaction is voidable `during the six months ending on relation-back day'. In those circumstances, Senator Brown's amendment would allow the clawback to be for twice that period. Then, if you move to 588FE(3), the period of clawback is two years. Senator Brown would be halving that with his amendment. Under section 588FE(4), the period is four years. Senator Brown would be slashing that down to only one year. Why not allow the extra three years of clawback? With respect, I do not think it has been sufficiently researched. 
The real doozey is section 588FE(5). It is difficult to see circumstances in which it could apply to a political party, but potentially it could. In that section the legislation says the transaction is voidable `during the 10 years ending on the relation-back day'. In other words, Senator Brown would be limiting that section of the Corporations Act: instead of allowing a clawback for 10 years, he would be limiting it to only one year. So, in fact, what may occur with this amendment is to give corporations a lot less to worry about than they actually have to worry about at the moment under the existing Corporations Law. I am quite surprised at that.
Furthermore, as I understand it, the liquidator can, in voiding transactions, void any transaction. Therefore, somebody, if they were minded, under this amendment could make a donation to the Senator Murphy Independent Party of $999.99 the day before winding up, and it could not be clawed back, whereas under the Corporations Act, as I understand it—and somebody may correct me if I am wrong—that could be clawed back. That is the Corporations Law. If it applies to football clubs, companies and other entities, then as a matter of principle it should also apply to political parties. We have quite a strange situation here. I will not cast aspersions as to why this amendment was moved; nevertheless, we have an amendment moved which will in fact make it more difficult for certain transactions to be voided. Why you would want that to occur, I really do not know. I think it is because the Corporations Act and its provisions were not properly researched and considered in the preparation of this amendment.
If we want to have an amendment to the Corporations Act in relation to political parties, can I remind honourable senators that any amendments to the Corporations Act require consultation with the Ministerial Council for Corporations—that is the states and territories—under the Corporations Agreement. So, before we start fiddling with these proposed amendments, the Commonwealth Electoral Act and potential consequences of the Democrat amendment on the Corporations Law, it is important that the states and territories be consulted as well. I am also advised that it is undesirable to have provisions relating to insolvency scattered throughout Commonwealth legislation. The Corporations Act currently contains the provisions relating to insolvency and it is desirable, for the purposes of transparency and accessibility, to retain all provisions within that act.
The proposed amendment, I am advised, is unnecessary, as section 588FE of the Corporations Act already applies to political parties and candidates to the extent that the Corporations Act would apply to particular transactions. My advice is that the Corporations Act does not distinguish between entities. Therefore a political party, I would assume, on that basis is an entity from which a donation of $999.99 in the current law could be clawed back—albeit in hard-to-imagine circumstances but nevertheless not impossible—under section 588FE(5), or voided, up to a period of 10 years. That would be limited by this proposal to only being voided and clawed back after a period of 12 months. So for those reasons the government understands that donations made in dubious circumstances to political parties should be available to the liquidator as a matter of public policy. That is not a problem; I am simply indicating to the committee that that already exists by virtue of section 588FE of the Corporations Act. And, as I understand the Corporations Act, it does not place a limit on the transaction of $1,000 but in fact any transaction. But I stand to be corrected on that. 
In relation to Senator Murray's amendment, I assume that he wants the new provision in the Commonwealth Electoral Act to refer to all of section 588FE—the various subsections that I have dealt with with varying periods of time. I would have thought the more desirable course would have been just dealing with 588FE(3). But, that aside, the amendment reads: 
For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of section 588FE of the Corporations Act 2001apply to all donations—
—Gifts.
—or gifts—
 made by a company to a political party or candidate. 
Are we saying that, in the provisions of section 588FE of the Corporations Act, the term `transaction' shall apply to gifts? Without that, I am not exactly sure how that would necessarily marry up with the provisions of the Corporations Act. Having said that, I indicate that I think this is a matter that would be appropriate for consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in their inquiry into the last election. That is an inquiry that allows the committee to explore at large those issues that arose at the last election and, as is their wont, a whole range of other issues that have not of necessity arisen out of the particular election. I think there is agreement in general terms as to the principle. I am just not sure that the methodology being employed by the two honourable senators would necessarily achieve the results they are hoping for.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-08-27,"—A couple of points that the Special Minister of State has made interest me. I accept his argument that the Corporations Law would have application, and I would encourage the minister to encourage its application in respect of some of the most recent circumstances such as HIH. Maybe it should have application. I am not sure that I agree with you, Minister, that it has application for 10 years retrospectively. It seems to me that it has only a two-year retrospective application, but I am not an expert in this area. It is just that the information I have is that, as it stands, it has a two-year retrospective application. But, if it has 10 years, so be it.
—Which section are you referring to?
—I am referring to section 588FC and section 588FF. Section 588FF says, in terms of time limits, that an application may only be made within three years after the relation-back day to bring an action seeking a court order in relation to a voidable transaction. If there is something else that says it is 10 years, I would be interested to see that.
 (Senator McLucas)—I do not think that this conversation is orderly.
—In debating the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, Senator Brown's amendment is seeking to put into the bill an amendment that clearly sets out that if a donation or a gift—I am not sure what the interpretation is because section 305 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act talks about a donation—whatever it is, exceeding $1,000 is received by a party or a candidate such a donation is to be repaid. It says that very clearly and very specifically. I am not sure why you could not say that. As I said, I have some concerns with some aspects of Senator Brown's amendment, but I am quite sure that it could be dealt with as a separate proposal in a separate piece of legislation specifically dealing with the matters of donations to parties or individuals.
I am not sure about the note where Senator Brown is proposing that the distribution of such repayments be made under the Corporations Act. I am not sure that this is necessarily a suitable application, because I share Senator Faulkner's concern that the people that should really get the money will never get it. The most likely person to get the money will be the liquidator, and I am not sure I support that—or the bank. The poor old shareholders, who should really get it, will not see one zack. From that point of view, I am a little concerned as to how the distribution of the refunds will be made. I support what Senator Brown is proposing, or at least its intention, because I think that is an important approach to take, especially in view of what we have seen in recent times with regard to some of the corporations that have gone down the chute and some of the moneys they have paid. 
These corporations make these big donations—worth several millions of dollars— without the consent of the shareholders and they make them basically on the politically biased point of view of those that sit at the top of the tree. I have seen government senators coming in here from time to time wanting to throttle the Labor Party over the issues in respect of union donations made for political purposes without the consent of members of the union. This is the big chance for the minister and the government to act. Why don't they get up and propose some amendments that would say that political donations cannot be made by corporations unless the consent of the shareholders is granted? As I have previously heard it argued on the part of the government, there are many members of unions that would vote Liberal, National, Green, Democrat or whatever the case might be—
—But will they vote Murphy?
—You will just have to wait and see. Likewise, shareholders of most of these companies making significant donations—most of which go to the conservative side of politics—are equally split in terms of their voting intentions and the way that they apply themselves when voting day comes. I think it would be a very honourable thing for the government to seek to put in place within the Commonwealth Electoral Act a provision that says that such donations cannot be made unless they are made with the express permission of the shareholders of those companies.
With regard to the points that the minister has made in respect of Senator Murray's proposed amendment, I accept that there are some problems. The problem I have with referring this specifically to the Corporations Act is that it is going to be almost impossible for any pursuit to take place because of the way the particular sections of the Corporations Act are written. As Senator Faulkner said, it is a step in the right direction, as is the case with Senator Brown's proposal. I suppose any step in the right direction should be supported, and I am tending to do that, but I think that we have problems in both of those proposals. Maybe we could address these problems at some other time. What is being proposed here is a long way short of the mark of what we need to do to really tighten this up.
I do not accept an argument that you cannot amend the Electoral Act in the way that is being proposed by Senator Brown and have that dealt with by law under that act. I understand what Senator Murray meant when he said, `You are making a whole new set of law.' That is true in part, because we are dealing with a totally different act—we are dealing with an act that covers the election of people to parliaments. I cannot accept the minister saying that any change to the Corporations Law—if there is to be a change—has to go to a ministerial council and that you have to consult with the states. The Commonwealth parliament and the government have made laws that have overridden state laws forever without consulting state governments. The government has brought proposals into this parliament that have clearly gone through and become law from a national perspective without any consultation. Indeed, it has introduced legislation into this parliament that has sought to override, with no consultation, decisions taken by state governments in their own right. It is a bit much for the minister to say, `You can't do this, because we have not consulted with the states.'
—There is a signed agreement between the states and the government.
—Is that right?
—Yes, it is the unified Corporations Law. 
—That may be the case, but I do not know that there is a signed agreement in respect of the Electoral Act, Minister, through you, Madam Temporary Chairman. That is why I say that I believe we can place some form of amendment in the Electoral Act that can deal with the issue.
—It will override the Corporations Act.
—Through you, Madam Temporary Chairman, it does not have to override the Corporations Law at all. It can refer specifically to political donations. I am not an expert on the Corporations Law, but I cannot recall seeing any reference in it to political donations. It refers to a transaction involving `the payment', which may be considered to be a voidable transaction. It does not exclude political payments, as the minister said, but that does not mean to say that the Electoral Act cannot be amended in the way that is being proposed in Senator Brown's amendment. That is certainly my view, although I have concerns with what he is proposing—because of fact that I have a major concern with regard to distribution of any moneys recovered, as I said earlier.
My view is that the current Corporations Act will not see any claims made, and if they were to be made I do not know why they are not already being made in respect of some companies that have already gone down the chute. I will be very interested to see whether or not the minister and/or the government make any recommendations in respect of that and the companies concerned as to whether or not political donations ought to be refunded by any of the parties who have received them, including the Liberal Party, if not the National Party.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-08-27,"—I want to go back to the second reading amendment that I spoke to and to take the opportunity to reiterate some of the issues I raised then. It is perhaps much better to raise these issues during the committee stage when parties can debate some of them and encourage responsive answers from the government. Before I do that, having listened to the debate so far on this section, there are a number of matters that I wish to raise that the government or Senator Brown might be able to assist me with. One of the questions Senator Murphy raised was which act would apply if the amendment to the legislation as proposed by Senator Brown was put into effect. I thought to myself on that issue, `Well, I'm not a lawyer, but I know that perhaps Senator Abetz might be, so he might be able to assist.'
—I thought you were a lawyer.
—No. I have a law degree, but I am not a lawyer. Examining that point, I thought the government might be able, through the chair, to assist. We are talking about the law as it might be in the future in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Act or Corporations Law and, balancing the two, which one might apply. You might then have to look at the objects of either. They might both apply. Unless they are inconsistent, they could both apply. If they are inconsistent, it would depend on whether you could rule out one of the inconsistencies for it to remain okay. It is not beyond the comprehension of judges to put a reasonable mind to the issue and to come up with a conclusion as to what the law is when they read two acts.
The rules of statutory interpretation are alive with matters in which inconsistencies are raised. I do not think the argument that Senator Abetz raised in this debate—as I understand it, he was saying that there may be an inconsistency, therefore, we should not look at Senator Brown's amendment—is a valid conclusion to arrive at. There is a question as to whether the Corporations Law covers the field, whether the CEA covers the field or whether they can operate together. You then have to look at whether there is an inconsistency, the extent of the inconsistency and whether that can be resolved, depending on the actual matter. Having looked at Senator Brown's amendment, the government might then say, `Perhaps this is the way we can ensure that the principle is upheld,' rather than simply saying it is not an amendment that should be proceeded with.
Senator Faulkner highlighted that it is arguable that there could exist circumstances where a company that has been wound up should and could repay money that has been paid to a political party, subject to a company being wound up within a period of 12 months. I was concerned about part of the argument that Senator Abetz put about inconsistencies. As I understood his argument—and I am open to correction from him—he is in effect saying that Senator Brown's amendment is not favoured by this government because it might be inconsistent. He is saying that the Corporations Law applies, but it applies as Senator Abetz has described sections 588FE and 588FB; therefore it may not apply to political donations being able to be recovered. That would mean we would be in a position that is no further advanced in this debate. We would be in a position where donations made to a political party, which may or may not be a corporation, cannot be recovered either now or, the government is saying, ever. The point I am concerned about is Senator Abetz saying that it was not a case that should be progressed at all. 
What I said during the debate on the second reading amendment was that these amendments, including Senator Murray's amendments, are complex and should be subject to proper scrutiny. They should be sent to an appropriate committee. I nominated the joint parliamentary committee as an appropriate committee, because it has the expertise to examine the bill and the amendments and to deal with and decide on how the principle can be progressed to ensure that donations made to political parties, where the company has subsequently been wound up or liquidated, can be recovered under certain circumstances. My understanding of what Senator Abetz was saying was that it could not go to the CEA; it would have to go to Corporations Law—I am open for correction—and if it went to the Corporations Law it could not be amended while we are here because it would have to go through a particular course that he outlined. What I did not quite hear was whether Senator Abetz meant `not ever'—in other words, that Senator Brown's amendment was an issue that the government was never alive to, did not want to consider and rejected outright. Senator Brown's concept is that there may be certain circumstances where moneys can be recovered, and from our perspective there are.
In addition, when you look at which vehicle might be appropriate—and this is why I tend to favour the Commonwealth Electoral Act as the vehicle—the vehicle which deals with political parties is the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Corporations Law might in a subsidiary way deal with political parties should they be corporations, but if they were not-for-profit associations or they utilised some other form of identity then the Corporations Law may not apply. So the principle may not be able to be progressed there. But as I understand it, Senator Brown's amendment seems to, at least in principle, capture all political parties that work under the process and that receive, or might be the beneficiary of, a donation from a corporation.
The other area which did concern me somewhat was when the government—and perhaps some light may be shed on this— went to section 588FE and section 588FB of the Corporations Act. Senator Brown's amendment has picked a year as being a relevant period. As I understood it, your argument was that in some cases it might be six months, two years or even 10 years and that, therefore, the Corporations Law was tougher, if I can use that word, in some respects because people might be excused, or the provisions may not go back far enough to pick up what the principle is, which is as we talked about—it is arguable in certain circumstances that it might be recoverable.
What troubled me most was whether you have in fact given us a good expose of the Corporations Law but not the principle itself. What the Corporations Law talks about is voidable transactions: whether a donation or some benefit to a political party, which may be a corporation, is a voidable transaction—I am not sure whether you expanded on that sufficiently to persuade me—which then goes back to the inconsistency I talked about. So I do not know whether there is in fact any inconsistency. The second part of that of course is whether it is an uncommercial transaction. I do not have the whole Corporations Law before me, but perhaps you could help me with whether or not an uncommercial transaction could also include a benefit or a gift or a donation to a political party. I am open on that, but I do not know whether I can be persuaded. 
—It depends on the circumstance.
—I will—and it is quite unparliamentary—take that interjection. Senator Abetz says that it may very well depend on the circumstance. That is why I favour the amendment going to the Commonwealth area dealing with electoral matters and political parties. I think it becomes clearer as to what the intention and the direction of the amendment are, rather than trying to enforce quite a commercial examination upon a political party at the time the donation was made from the company to a political party. You would then have to look at it to say whether or not, as it states in subsection 3, `it is an insolvent transaction, and also an uncommercial transaction'. So there have to be two live issues: an insolvent transaction and an uncommercial transaction. I do not know whether the Corporations Law in fact picks that up as clearly as Senator Brown's amendment may.
Of course, when you go to the 10-year rule, there are a number of circumstances that have to be met. I think it is a little unfair to draw a direct comparison between the Corporations Law and Senator Brown's amendment by simply using time limits and saying that it would be far better to stay with the Corporations Law because there is a 10-year period. There are three bridges that have to be crossed for a transaction to be voidable:
(a)	it is an insolvent transaction of the company; and
(b)	the company became a party to the transaction for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of defeating, delaying, or interfering with, the rights of any or all of its creditors on a winding up of the company; and—
so these are company specific matters—
(c)	the transaction was entered into, or an act done was for the purpose of giving effect to the transaction, during the 10 years ...
As I understand it, there are certain conditions that have to be met if the transaction is voidable—if—and these are highlighted in (a), (b) and (c). We are not talking about a company in the sense that this is a company that has given a donation to a political party. At that point in time you have to examine what was in the minds of the parties and try to then determine whether it can fit within those circumstances. I suggest it may be very difficult to do that, whereas Senator Brown's amendment seems at least to encapsulate the principle.
That long, unfortunately convoluted argument is why I then would say what I put to you during the second reading debate: that is why it should go to a committee to be explored. Given that we have also gone through quite a complex argument in itself, the worry I then have is whether or not we are simply making policy decisions on the run—and I think that was a matter I raised during the second reading debate—if we are going to go through and use this committee stage to argue quite complex amendments. There have already been arguments from the government in explanation to Senator Brown on complex legal issues about what the Corporations Law might or might not mean and unfortunately from my also entering into the debate and asking what it might or might not be. It then struck me that what we are actually doing is entertaining quite a legal argument without—I am quite happy to say—my having the necessary qualifications to do so. On that basis, it is much better for the matter to go to a committee where you have the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-08-27,"—I think Senator Abetz appreciates that I was in the chair when we wound up the second reading stage of this bill, so many of my views have not been put forward—although generally they raise many concerns consistent with those raised by a number of my colleagues. I am concerned about how this committee stage discussion is occurring. Senator Ludwig, for instance, has highlighted a number of questions in the consideration of Senator Brown's amendment. Whilst it is clear that there is a solid argument for why these matters need to be addressed by an appropriate committee, an earlier vote seems to indicate that that is not a viable option, so we do need to use this committee stage to process some of these issues. I am concerned that, while a number of significant issues are being raised by colleagues such as Senator Ludwig, at this stage there is no response from the government and nothing is coming into the debate which provides us with the detail we need to make a proper, informed decision. As has already been indicated by a few senators from this side, we clearly support the principle of what Senator Brown is proposing in his amendment but we have very clear concerns about consistency with the Corporations Law. 
We have concerns about a number of other issues as well. Whilst Senator Abetz quips across the chamber every now and then— and it is really nothing more than a quip—I see no genuine dialogue addressing the many serious questions that Senator Ludwig has raised. I am not going to repeat those questions—Senator Abetz has raised many times his concern about the amount of time that might be involved in dealing with this debate—but the point is that those questions have been raised. I am likely to have further questions following a response to Senator Ludwig's questions to the government; it is difficult to move this debate forward until at least his preliminary questions are addressed. It is not surprising that Senator Brown is not in a position to deal with some of these issues—but the government, which has been the main advocate of the argument that this does not need to go to a committee, should be willing and able to address legitimate questions here and now. If you are running the argument that this does not need to go to a committee then answer the questions that are being put forward, and give the committee stage of the Senate discussion a response to those serious issues.
Some of the other issues in the amendment that I think it important to address are similar to some of the areas that Senator Ludwig has already canvassed. How do we differentiate between a payment that is a donation and some other payment? Why have we chosen the amount of $1,000? Should we be looking at more appropriate figures? What would be the administrative arrangements to successfully retrieve amounts of $1,000, and is it even worth it in the circumstances? The Labor Party's intention has been quite clear here in supporting this move in principle; that is supported also by our behaviour. If, for instance, the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party can demonstrate that in the case of a $10,000 donation from HIH, what is the appropriate mechanism to achieve this principle? Whilst I do not want to denigrate my colleague from the Greens, I do not necessarily accept that the proposal put forward in this amendment is the best way of achieving that end. Again, what concerns me quite considerably is that the government is not responding to the questions that are being raised in this discussion. I look forward to Senator Abetz responding to Senator Ludwig's questions. Then there might well be further questions.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-08-27,"—For the assistance of honourable senators—especially Senator Collins, who I do not think was here—I in fact dealt earlier with some of the difficulties in the current Greens and Democrats amendments that we are dealing with. The amendments are not government sponsored, so do not ask me to justify why the figure of $1,000 has been chosen; ask the absent Senator Brown. In relation to the application of the law, I think I have been addressing issues in a fairly nonpartisan way for all of this afternoon—might I say in nice contrast to what occurred yesterday. I am trying to keep the tone like that, Senator Collins, and I trust you will try to keep the tone like that as well for the rest of this evening.
The point that I was making in relation to the Greens amendment was that in fact it would be softer on companies making donations than the application of the Corporations Law. I am sorry, Senator Collins, if you did not hear my analysis as to the reasons why. With respect, I do not intend to repeat all of those arguments. Suffice to say that, under section 588FE, subsection (5), of the Corporations Law—although it is hard to envisage a circumstance—there is the possibility that a circumstance might arise where the transaction is deemed voidable, and the reach back would be 10 years.
Senator Brown's amendment seeks to have a clawback of 12 months only in relation to political donations. When legislation is inconsistent, I submit that what usually occurs is that the latter legislation is deemed to prevail over the former. The regime that Senator Brown is proposing will, in fact, be weaker than the provisions of the current Corporations Law. We as a government voted against sending the bill to a committee because the government sponsored bill had already been to a committee about 12 months ago. There was a lot of discussion on it in that committee, albeit only four people put in a submission in relation to the bill. But, that aside, the Greens have now moved an amendment in relation to a different aspect. 
—In my earlier contribution, Senator Collins—and if you had been here you would have heard it—I suggested that it might be appropriate for that proposal to be sent to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for detailed consideration. It could consider, for example, the matter that you raised: why have a threshold of $1,000 when there is no such limit in relation to the Corporations Act for clawback? I think these are matters for the absent Senator Brown. He is the sponsor of this amendment, but he is not here. As a result, it is difficult for you—and I accept that—to get answers, but it is not a government sponsored amendment. We have indicated that we are opposing it. If you want more information about it to convince you to vote for it, I suggest you ask the sponsor of the amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-08-27,"—Senator Brown is not here, but following Senator Moore's first speech he did introduce the issue of Telstra. I was delighted to see all parties concerned affirm the freedom of speech which we should have when we need to discuss these matters. I think that is very important. On a second point, I have a sneaking suspicion—and maybe it is very unfair of me—that Labor might be stretching this debate out. I would like to suggest that, if Labor want to stretch it out, perhaps we at least deal with this amendment, and they can stretch it out on the next amendment. In that way we can make some progress.
The issues that I have concerning Senator Brown's amendment as put to us really boil down to two things. Before I go on, I must say that I am very pleased that both the opposition and the government have accepted the principle and recognised that, in relation to issues of insolvency, the restoration of money which has not been properly gained is a valid issue and should be dealt with under the law.
—I don't think the government have.
—The government have. They can speak for themselves, but if I understood them correctly—they can correct me if I am wrong—they have said that, in terms of the Corporations Law, they believe that the issue of donations should be addressed in normal insolvency and liquidator processes. It is not the opposition's business, I know, to give them any credit, but it is my business to give you both credit, and I do, and I thank you for your position.
Returning to Senator Brown's amendment, I remain with just two problems. I do not see a proper link between the political donation and the insolvency in the standards that apply in insolvency law traditionally through the Corporations Law and other bankruptcy provisions. The donation can have been made at any point in time up to one year before winding up. It does not need to have led the company into insolvency or to have been made while the company was insolvent, such as in section 588FC. It strikes me, in the way that I read this amendment, that the two parts to the transaction are not well connected when you look at insolvency law.
The other major issue which concerns me is that it appears there is no protection for a party that receives the money in good faith, such as the provision which is in section 588FG of the Corporations Act. I really do not want to see a political party or candidate who received the money in good faith having to pay it back. I do not think the protective provisions which exist within the Corporations Law are within Senator Brown's amendment. Those are the two issues that remain of concern to me. ",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-08-27,"—I will say something germane to the comments that Senator Murray has made. I take his point. We are departing from the Corporations Law here because we are dealing with electoral law. The Corporations Act does not specifically deal with donations to political parties; the Electoral Act does. The Corporations Act might not be left to arbitrate on return of donations. In certain circumstances the Electoral Act is the best place to do that, and that is why this amendment is to the Electoral Act. It is not going to fail the notice of any liquidator, if a company goes bust, that this section is in the Electoral Act. Certainly, it is not going to fail the attention of any liquidator, if a company which has made a donation to a political party goes bust, that they might follow that up. There is going to be provision under this Greens amendment to have the donation, if it was made within 12 months of the insolvency, returned to help cushion the blow on the people who lose out when a corporation goes bust. I agree with the contributors who have expressed concern about the fact that the Corporations Act itself might need looking at. Certainly we need to look at who gets what when a corporation goes bust and in what order. I think the big players do have too much opportunity, banks included, to get there first and the small shareholders lose out. That is something we should be looking at.
Senator Abetz said—this is not germane to my amendment, but it is to Senator Murray's, which follows—that the Senate ought not be making amendments to the Corporations Act without the states first being consulted. Well, that is the job of the government. If we were to take that at face value, Senator Abetz would be saying to the Senate that the Senate may not amend the Corporations Act because it does not have a mechanism for consulting with the states.
—Exactly: that is an irrelevance. The Senate does have the ability to amend the Corporations Act, just as the Senate was absolutely essential to the passage of that act. If a change comes through it is up to the government—and it can do that at its leisure when the House of Representatives is considering the amendment from the Senate—to consult with the states and territories on the matter. So there we have it. I not only hear but also agree with those who have said that there are some imperfections in this amendment, but the point is that it is less perfect not to have the amendment. Now is the time to move this amendment and now is the time to have it, and I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-08-27,"—I thank Senator Brown for that clarification of some of those issues. I had not quite got to the point that I was getting to when I was last on my feet. I think you may have clarified this by interjection, Senator Abetz, but one of the points on which I would like clarification from the government relates to Senator Brown's amendment. I have some questions for Senator Brown in relation to his amendment as well, but I want first to explore the answers you gave to Senator Brown specifically in relation to the Corporations Law. I need to clarify some of those matters as to whether the position you put to Senator Brown was both right and appropriate. That raised, as I said, the third issue about the appropriateness of having this legal debate in committee, which then raised the fourth issue, which was my starting position yesterday, as to whether or not this matter would be better dealt with in its entirety by the mechanism of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.
One of the issues on which I think the government has been fundamentally mistaken in this argument is that corporations, as Senator Faulkner highlighted, are profit driven—they have a profit motive; at least there are not many that do not, and none I can think of offhand—whereas political parties fit a completely different mould. Political parties have social responsibilities and social interests and are, as I understand it, not for profit. They also have goals and objectives which differ quite substantially from those of corporations and put them apart from corporations—so much so that I think it is inappropriate to deal with political parties under the Corporations Law as you have outlined. It would be far better—and that was the suggestion I put—if they were dealt with in the Commonwealth laws dealing with electoral matters, where most of the other issues relating to political parties, elections and all of those matters are dealt with. 
Senator Abetz, I am unresolved as to whether or not you clarified if you were arguing from a government perspective that it was inappropriate to move Senator Brown's amendment and more appropriate for the principle to be embodied in the Corporations Law. As I understand your interjection—but not the submission that you made, so I seek to get that clarified—the principle that has been put by Senator Brown is a principle that this government agrees with and intends to progress. If Senator Brown's amendment is not successful—I think Senator Faulkner has indicated that the Labor Party support it in principle, so I would expect it to be successful, but there are a number of matters that might dissuade us from finding favour with it at the conclusion of this debate—will the government still be of the view that the Corporations Law, with the appropriate consultative mechanisms having been gone through, is a matter that needs attention? That is the issue I raised with you which I thought deserved an answer.
The other area is that you again raised an old memory about rules of statutory interpretation. We are not necessarily talking about a later amendment to the same act— where, as I recollect, a later amendment would be likely to be the one chosen by the courts. We are talking about two distinct acts, and that is why I say that this amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act would stand. You would, as I understand it, look at the objects and purposes of the act—you would provide a purposive approach to the interpretation of that act with that amendment and come to a conclusion as to how the courts would deal with it. On the other hand, with the Corporations Law you have a different object—a different scheme. Section 588FE of the act highlights it in subsection (5) where it talks about `voidable transactions'. It is about companies transacting with companies, companies with individuals or companies with directors or those associated with a company as a corporate entity; it is not talking about what political parties are. That is the point I made earlier.
It then goes on to embody what we are talking about: protecting the rights of shareholders, protecting the rights of those people who would derive an income—that is, franked dividends or dividends—from companies. Part of it is about defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of any or all of its creditors. Companies have creditors, they have shareholders, and it is about ensuring that there is equity and fairness. The Corporations Law ensures that those sorts of things are put in place.
But what we need to look at is not that issue, and that is what concerns me the most. What we are looking at in a political party is not something that might be regarded as having a shareholder or, in this instance, a case of defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of any or all of the creditors. I do not know whether a creditor, a beneficiary, a political party would actually fall into the same clutch. I think they are entirely different from that. That was the point in your response that I was trying to highlight.
Senator Abetz, I understand clearly that it was not a case of me asking you questions about Senator Brown's amendment. I was trying to clarify your responses to Senator Brown's amendment. Your responses gave me sufficient concern that I needed to rise to my feet and explore them with you. But, in so doing, as I have said a number of times, it worries me when we explore them like that, because it would be far better to have the bill with those amendments—and Senator Murray seems to have left the chamber and does not want to listen to the debate—go to a committee, not the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services but the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which is the appropriate committee for this. In addition, one of the matters raised by Senator Murray—and, unfortunately, he is not here—that concerned me was that this may be drawing it out. I might remind him that we only recently started debating this section. Senator Faulkner has spoken on it. I have spoken on it twice now, both times to get clarification. 
—Madam Chair, I rise on a point of order: the senator is misleading the Senate. He knows perfectly well there is a television outside. I am listening to his voice, and I am enjoying every word that he is saying. 
 (Senator Knowles)—There is no point of order, but I think Senator Murray has made his point quite well.
—One of the difficulties I have is that we do not have another monitor to see who is out there. We have not got that interactive technology. In fact, Senator Alston, in moving towards high-definition television, has failed at the gate in providing interactive television. It may, at some future date, be incorporated in this chamber so that I could tell who is out there. In any event, I do take the point and apologise. I am not intending to mislead the Senate.
If Senator Murray is still listening—I have to be careful how I say this; you can sound a little bit silly talking to someone who is not listening—one of my concerns, and I think an important matter that deserves attention, which is why I was exploring it so deeply with you, Senator Abetz, is that $800,000 has gone from HIH to a political party. That is the principle that does concern me. It is serious. There is $800,000 that has disappeared out of the hands of either the liquidator or the shareholders of the corporation. That is why the principle put forward by Senator Faulkner deserves consideration and why Senator Brown's motion deserves consideration. It is clear from Senator Brown's motion that the principle is there.
Senator Abetz, one of the issues—and I was going to go to Senator Brown's motion—that you raised was whether or not the $1,000 was appropriate and, if it fell below that, whether it would come under the Corporations Law or whether it would be a matter that may not be worth pursuing. Of course, these are value judgments that I do not intend to make in respect of Senator Brown's motion. But it might be helpful if he would clarify his view about the limit and also about whether a donation is a gift or whether it can be construed as a company making a benefit to a political party, to ensure that it does encapsulate all of those matters. That is why, in answer to Senator Brown—perhaps I could use the word in a nice phrase—you did attack the amendment on some of those grounds that it might then fail or that it might not be so relevant or that it might be best not progressed. Of course, the other area includes whether or not it is a political party or a state branch of a political party. Coming from an industrial relations background, there has been, may I say, enormous argument about what is—
—That is code for `trade union', is it?
—I am happy to say `union'. I did not come from a `trade union'. There is a distinction.
—You are going to lose me at this point, Senator Abetz. I did want to get this out before I expire and have to then get to my feet again.
—I hope you do not expire, Senator.
—No, I shall not. I have another flu tablet that I can take. I am trying to ascertain whether the state branch is a state entity, a federal entity or a branch of the federal entity; there are three entities that it can be. One of the issues was which of those three entities the state branch encapsulated, because there can be a distinction.
Then there is the reason for the winding up of the company—in other words, was the company wound up in insolvency or wound up by the courts on other grounds? From Senator Brown's perspective, is it an automatic thing? Should it happen as a consequence of a company being wound up, because a company might be wound up for valid reasons in terms of insolvency? For instance, there might be a parent company with a subsidiary, the purpose of the subsidiary has been done and the company or the parent company has moved on, and the subsidiary or the management company can no longer do its job so it is wound up. That happens in businesses where you might have a management company looking after a particular asset and the management company then loses the contract; the management company then has nothing to manage and moves on to something else. 
That was an area I wanted to explore with Senator Brown. In doing so, I wanted to come back to whether or not you agree, Senator Abetz, that something in the order of an $800,000 donation to a political party is something that this government is concerned about and whether, in truth, you can identify a difference between a corporation and a political party. I think the argument that the government has run, that the Corporations Law picks it up in total, is not right. I think it has missed the point of being able to differentiate between the two.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-08-27,"—What we are witnessing is a quite shameless filibuster, and a few smiles on the other side indicate that. In relation to political parties being different from corporations, the answer is yes of course they are. But we are dealing with what should happen with moneys paid over by a corporation. Moneys paid by a corporation should be dealt with under the Corporations Law. If the argument is that if it is paid to a political party it should be under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, does that mean that next time we have a tertiary education bill before the parliament we ought to have a similar provision? As I understand it, one of the companies that has gone into liquidation made a substantial donation to Monash University, and allegedly somebody got an honorary doctorate in return—but that is a side issue. Does that therefore mean that, because Monash University is not-for-profit, like a political party, as Senator Ludwig indicated, next time we have a tertiary education bill before the Senate we will amend it in similar terms?
I also understand—and I have to be careful because I know Senator Alston is a very keen supporter of the Collingwood Football Club—that one of the companies that has gone into liquidation in recent times made a substantial donation to the Collingwood Football Club, also a not-for-profit organisation. As a result, does that mean that the next time we have legislation dealing with sports matters we ought to insert a specific provision into that legislation to deal with the possibility of a corporation giving money to a sporting organisation such as a football club?
When you start extending the argument put forward in support of the amendment, you can see how hollow and shallow it is. This issue is about Corporations Law and donations being made by corporations not only to political parties but also to football clubs, to universities—and so the list can go on. The place for dealing with these sorts of donations is clearly in the Corporations Act. That is where it is at the moment and where it ought to be, with a lot stronger and stricter provision than that being envisaged by those supporting this amendment, which was made on the run. It was suggested that there be a claw-back period of three years, then a claw-back period of one year. We have now had to change the wording from `donation' to `gift', and that in itself is another issue—that is, the definition of `gift' in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Act.
What we have just witnessed has been a shameless filibuster. Given that it costs the Australian taxpayers $10,000 per hour to run this Senate, I would invite honourable senators opposite to search their consciences and ask themselves whether it is a reasonable expenditure of taxpayers' funds to have thrown up all these speakers for what is a very concise bill.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-08-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I wish to take note of the annual report from the Western Australian Fisheries Joint Authority, 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, section 70 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991. In doing so I would like to quote from page 9 of the report, which says:
This study also indicated that although reported domestic catches of blacktip sharks are below the sustainable yield estimate, catch per unit effort is declining. It is suggested that either there is a large unreported catch of these sharks ... 
And it goes on to talk about the state of our fisheries. Recently, I was involved in a number of discussions with representatives from the WA fishing industry. In fact, a group of us from Labor spent a day being briefed on all elements of the WA fishing industry— prawning, long-line tuna fishing and the like. As we came to learn, the industry is a vital part of the Western Australian economy and it contributes enormously to our export income. As I mentioned in my first speech in this place, I believe that industries such as aquaculture and fishing are increasingly important as renewable resources that are not subject to the climate variations that affect so many other agricultural enterprises. The important word in all of that is `renewable'.
The report tabled today illustrates that there is a risk to the blacktip shark fishery in Western Australia. This corresponds with the information that was provided to us by the representatives from the WA fishing industry. The threat to that industry is easily identified as one of illegal fishing. Illegal fishing puts Australian jobs and Australian exports at risk. Anyone that comes from my state—and I note that you do, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles—will be well aware of the impact that any threat to that industry would have on our economy.
What is the government's policy response to this threat to the industry? If the Australian government happens to catch an illegal fishing vessel, the vessel is seized and a blow is struck for the hardworking Australians that work in the industry. But representatives of the fishing industry told us, when we met with them last month, that the government does not actually destroy the vessel. We had the supposed pleasure of inspecting a couple of the seized vessels. In this day of user-pays taken to the extreme, the government puts the seized vessel up for sale by tender. Representatives of the Western Australian fishing industry tell me that there is now little impediment to prevent the illegal fishermen from buying back their own vessels. The Minister for Forestry and Conservation's press release of 31 July this year said:
... conditions will be placed on the sale to avoid the boats returning to the illegal fishing trade.
But what conditions? In that press release the minister went on to say:
The tender process may result in the boats being sold for scrap, or as going concerns ...
The minister concedes that they could be sold as going concerns. He says that, somehow or other, we will prevent them being used in the illegal fishing industry again but does not outline the process. We on this side want to protect our fisheries, so we have supported the government's moves to patrol them and to seize illegal boats. It was pleasing to note that this year's budget allocated $16.3 million over four years just to keep going with those patrols.
What happens is that we patrol out there, we try and protect the jobs of hardworking Australians, but then, if we catch the illegal fishermen, we give them a legal slap on the wrist—that is, we fine them, and the fine is not commensurate to the profits that they make. We then sell them their boats back— or we cannot guarantee that we will not. Maybe we should focus on trying to avoid them returning to their illegal trade. We are now not sure how we can do this, because the government still has not released any details of the tender process. This is user-pays taken to its illogical conclusion. The answer from the WA fishing industry people I met with was quite simple: destroy the seized vessels. After all, that is what the government does with the people-smuggling vessels that are seized in this country.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-08-27,"—In relation to this report on the Western Australian Fisheries Joint Authority, it is interesting to note that the authority was established under the provisions of what is now the Fisheries Management Act 1991—an act of the federal parliament—and what was the Western Australian Fisheries Act 1905, which has since been replaced by the Fish Resources Management Act 1994 of the Western Australian parliament. The Fisheries Management Act, which was enacted by the Hawke Labor government in 1991, created a new architecture for fisheries management in the 1990s—an architecture that remains essentially intact. 
The Hawke government introduced the legislation following the most exhaustive review of fisheries management in Australia since the 1950s. That review established three major objectives: to ensure that exploitation of fisheries resources is sustainable, to enable commercial fishing operations to be as economically efficient as possible and to create conditions where fishers are able to earn significant profits from which to make a payment to the community for the right to exploit a public resource. These objectives informed the Fisheries Management Act and supporting legislation, and these objectives are sound, but, 13 years on, new challenges have arisen and the fishing and aquaculture industries have grown. Additionally, the community's environmental expectations have grown over the past decade. It is time to look at the industry again and build a policy platform for the future. The reason for this is that Australia needs a comprehensive review of existing opportunities and challenges in fisheries policy.
In June 2000, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced a Commonwealth fisheries review and promised a final statement in mid-2001. It is now more than two years since the review was announced and 12 months beyond the minister's announced deadline. Many industry members have participated in consultations over the past two years, but the government's review process has stalled. I welcome the recent indication from the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Senator Ian Macdonald, that he has some interest in completing the review. This is welcome news but comes after a loss of much confidence in the government's review process. Responsibility for this rests with neither Senator Ian Macdonald nor his underperforming predecessor, Mr Wilson Tuckey; rather, responsibility rests with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Warren Truss.
Mr Truss has always been at best reluctant about the fisheries portfolio. Whereas some ministers in this government are competent at hiding their incompetence, Mr Truss lets it all hang out. Last week, Mr Truss issued a media release where he proudly described one of his `virtual' performances. It related to a visit, via video link, to a National Party stand at the Ag-Quip field day. It is a shame the fishing industry does not get the same access to the minister as National Party branch members do. At least the Nationals do not discriminate on these matters: appointments to the sham Telstra inquiry were made on the same basis. It will come as no surprise to senators that Mr Truss takes pride in his virtual performance. He gave a virtual performance on US beef quotas that just about brought the industry to its knees. His virtual performance on sugar has seen the government's response to the Hildebrand report delayed and the future of the industry threatened.
But I digress. In the area of fisheries, Mr Truss has spectacularly failed to deliver leadership in policy development and administration. In respect of this annual report, it is no surprise that the authority did not meet during its reporting period. Despite the stated enthusiasm of Senator Ian Macdonald for his new responsibilities, it is regrettable that the fishing industry and Australian fisheries lack a committed minister at cabinet level, because fishing and agriculture are amongst our most valuable rural industries. They contribute more than $2.5 billion each year to Australia's gross domestic product and generate annual export income of $2.2 billion. There are probably further things that I could say, but I propose to continue my comments in relation to the Queensland Fisheries Joint Authority Report.
—Senator O'Brien, you need to seek leave to continue your remarks.
—I do not want to continue on this document; I am going to speak on the next document.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2002-08-27,"—I rise to inform the Senate that I will soon be resigning as a senator for Queensland. As you will appreciate, Mr President, I will do so with mixed emotions. After a career in surgery, I became a senator on 1 July 1990 and have spent the last 12 years enjoying to the full the life of a senator. Yet, despite the attractive enticement to continue, I feel it is time to move on. The privilege of being a parliamentarian is one which I have taken seriously. My 5½ years in opposition were not wasted. I played a major part in two groundbreaking Senate inquiries—into breast cancer screening and treatment and into the tobacco industry—and was the initiator of my most enduring memorial to date, the limitation on sitting hours in the Senate. I also helped to develop my party's health policy and the Lyons Forum. The five years I spent as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs were the most fascinating years of my life. It gave me an unparalleled opportunity to change the direction of policy from paternalism to the encouragement of self-sufficiency, and I believe we are now firmly on this path. Separatism, as promoted by those who wish to live off the cause rather than for it, has no place in a modern, democratic, vibrant multicultural Australia. There could be no more practical reconciliation than the fact that two-thirds of Indigenous people in cities are living with non-Indigenous partners. We are now celebrating integration.
To my colleagues on both sides of the chamber, I bid you farewell. Your friendship and camaraderie have sustained me on many occasions. I know I have made friends on all sides. It may be invidious to single out individuals, but I would especially like to pay tribute to our leader, Robert Hill, and the Leader of the Opposition, John Faulkner. Rob Hill has been a friend for over 20 years, and he gives true meaning to the word `equanimity'. John Faulkner is a worthy adversary, but I am one of the few that can attest that he has a heart. I will never forget his kindness when he gave me a condolence card signed by his Labor colleagues on the death of my daughter, Maryann, five years ago. 
I pay tribute also to the wonderful democracy we have in Australia. We have no secrets. The gleeful media pounce on every nuance, stomp all over everybody, including each other, build people up and then cut them down. Party rooms leak and stories are invented, denied, then confirmed, but through it all democracy flourishes. I love Australia. I firmly believe in the commonsense and good judgment of the Australian people. This good judgment saw the return of John Howard as Prime Minister. In a small way, I feel that I was able to contribute to his victory by serving as Queensland Liberal Party president in the lead-up to the last election. History will record him as one of the great prime ministers of this country and I will always remember his unyielding support and outstanding leadership. It has been a privilege to serve in his government and I value his friendship.
There are many others that I wish to thank for a wonderful 12 years: my friends on both sides of the chamber and the House; the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans; the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch; the Clerk Assistant; the Black Rod; the attendants; the security officers; and the drivers for their unfailing courtesy and assistance. My previous ministerial staff, in particular Greg Hunting and Helen McLauchlin, were outstanding. Additionally, Diane Young, Leonie Stewart, Jill Lacey and Vivienne Johnson have been tremendous; I could not have wished for better. Ian Loudon and his staff in the Department of Administrative Services in Brisbane have always been helpful. I thank the Queensland division of the Liberal Party for selecting me and I thank the people of Queensland for their vote. I have done my best to represent them. I have no illusions; my personal vote was 0.1 per cent of a quota—98 per cent marked the Liberal Party box.
Finally, I pay tribute to my wife, Jan, who has given me unconditional love and support. Without her, none of this would have been possible. My nine children have at times looked at me askance, but their support, too, has been unwavering. Elizabeth, Nicholas, Samantha, Maryrose, Catriona, Annabel, Wilhelmine, Thomas and John are fine people, as are my sons-in-law Mark, Robert and Peter, my soon to be sons-in-law Patrick and Richard, and my daughter-in-law, Naomi. For the sake of brevity I will not name all of my grandchildren. 
Mr President, I cannot end my final contribution without paying tribute to my now-deceased parents and grandparents. My four grandparents were born in Ireland, as was my father, who came to Australia as a young man and went to Home Hill in North Queensland, where I was born. Having this heritage, you will not be surprised that I leave you with an Irish blessing:
May the road rise to meet you
May the wind be always at your back
May the sun shine warm upon your face,
The rains fall soft upon your fields
And until we meet again
May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Herron, Senator the Hon. John: Resignation</title>",Adjournment,16,1
