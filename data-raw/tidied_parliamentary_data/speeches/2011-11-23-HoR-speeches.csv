Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (09:01):  Mr Speaker, I move that so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Flinders from moving the following motion forthwith:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Honourable Member for Flinders from moving the following motion forthwith:


That this House calls on the Government to:


(1) immediately release the GTEM carbon tax model;


(2) release the assumptions underpinning it; and


(3) redo the modelling before Parliament rises so as to reflect the real world given that:


(a) the International environment is radically different from that claimed by the ALP. In particular the Canadian Foreign Minister and the United States leadership have made it clear that neither country will be adopting a carbon tax prior to 2015-16;


(b) it now appears there will be no binding global treaty until 2020;


(c) reports have shown the European ETS has had almost zero impact on the environment, but at a cost of up to $287bn Australian dollars;


(d) the Government’s assumption that “the modelling assumes comparable carbon pricing in other major economies from 2015-16” has collapsed; and


(e) the consequence will be Australians paying the highest carbon tax in the world for no environmental benefit while also sending $3.5bn offshore to foreign carbon traders.


On the day of the latest secret—




The SPEAKER:
  The member for Flinders will resume his seat.



Mr Hunt interjecting—

  The member for Flinders can speak into the ether. The microphone is off, and any words after I asked him to sit down are not recorded.

The SPEAKER
 (09:29):  For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 124th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly to Panama and bilateral visit to Brazil of 4 to 23 April 2011. In tabling the report, I indicate that this was yet another hardworking and informative delegation. Time does not permit me to provide you with a detailed overview of the delegation's contribution to the 124th IPU Assembly. I commend to honourable members the preface of the report, which outlines the highlights of the delegation's work.


Australia's delegations to assemblies of the Inter-Parliamentary Union have established a reputation for making a significant contribution to the IPU through their hard work, often behind the scenes, to facilitate dialogue and broker agreements across a wide range of global issues. The high regard in which Australia is held within the IPU is reflected in the invitation for an Australian representative to serve for the first time as a member of the Advisory Group to the IPU Committee on United Nations Affairs. The member for Holt, Anthony Byrne, was appointed to the advisory committee and represented Australia at the advisory committee's deliberations in Panama.


Australia served in key roles on two drafting committees: the member for Lyons, Dick Adams, was appointed chair of the drafting committee of the Standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade, and demonstrated Australia's leadership credentials by steering that committee through 128 amendments to a unanimous resolution in record time. I was appointed rapporteur of the drafting committee for the emergency item titled 'Strengthening democratic reform in emerging democracies including North Africa and the Middle East'. That resolution was also adopted unanimously by the assembly.


The bilateral visit to Brazil prior to the IPU assembly was highly educative. The commonalities between our two countries are many, and are underscored by a warm and positive bilateral relationship. Every member of the delegation came away from the visit with a strong appreciation of the tremendous opportunities for Australian business in Brazil across a range of sectors including resources, clean energy, infrastructure, education and the organisation of major sporting events. The clear message was that Australia must continue to strive to improve the shared understanding between us so that we can realise the full potential of these opportunities.


Similarly, Australia has much to gain by continuing to develop the positive relationship it shares with Panama. Ambassador Katrina Cooper must be congratulated for seizing the opportunity of the IPU assembly in Panama to announce the appointment of Australia's first Honorary Consul to Panama, Mr Ricardo Alberto Martinelli. Mr Martinelli embodies the key to strengthening the Panama-Australia relationship. He has studied and travelled in Australia and his firsthand appreciation of Australia and Australians will make him a very effective honorary consul for Australia. In addition, he is the son of Panama's President, Ricardo Martinelli.


I would like to thank the many people who contributed to the success of the delegation's visits. Foremost amongst these were Ambassador Brett Hackett and DFAT staff in Brazil, including in Brasilia and Sao Paulo, and Ambassador Katrina Cooper and her staff who came down to Panama from Mexico City, who put together outstanding programs and provided practical support to the delegation.


On behalf of the delegation I thank Mr Eric van der Wal, the delegation's foreign affairs adviser at the IPU assembly in Panama, for his advice and professional support at this and previous IPU assemblies. I also thank the Delegation Secretary, Ms Jeannette Radcliffe, for her assistance and support to the delegation. And I thank my adviser, Debra Biggs, for her support to me personally.


In closing, I congratulate my fellow delegates for their hard work and good humour throughout this highly successful series of visits. Particular mention must be made of my deputy on this and previous delegations, Senator Judith Troeth, who has recently retired. I take this opportunity to acknowledge her significant contribution to the work of the IPU over successive assemblies.


I thank the House for its attention and I commend the report to the House.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (09:35):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Road transport accounts for over 1.7 per cent of Australia's total GDP and employs over 246,000 Australians.


Australia's freight task has increased at an annual rate of 5.6 per cent and is forecast to continue growing.


Given the vast distances of this nation, the government knows that a safe and productive transport sector is in the interests of all Australians.


The economic importance of transport is one side of the story.


Sadly, there is another side.


Each day four people are killed and another 80 are seriously injured on our roads, on average.


Last year, 1,368 Australians lost their lives on our roads.


A further 30,000 were hospitalised.


The statistics for truck driving are particularly grave.


It is the Australian industry with the highest incidence of fatal injuries, with 25 deaths per 100,000 workers in 2008-09.


That is 10 times higher than the average for all industries.


The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics has calculated that the cost to the Australian economy of this is $2.7 billion a year.


While the economic cost is important it is the human cost that really counts.


Very few Australians have not been affected by the loss of a loved family member, a work mate or a friend.


The effect is devastating: too many lives cut short too young.


The government is committed to doing all that is necessary to ensure that our truck drivers, whether they be an employee or a self employed owner-driver, have a safe and fair workplace, while sustaining the long-term viability of the road transport industry. The government recognises the important role of small businesses, particularly owner drivers in the road transport industry. 


They provide flexibility for businesses to meet demand for the delivery of goods, particularly in rural and regional areas—small businesses make up around 60 per cent of the road transport industry, yet they make up far less of the income earned in that industry. 


Almost 30 per cent of owner drivers are paid below the award rate and many are unable to recover the cost of operating their vehicle.


In 2008, the National Transport Commission's review into remuneration and safety in the Australian heavy vehicle industry found that:


…commercial arrangements between an array of parties to the transport of freight, including load owners/clients and receivers, consignors and brokers, freight forwarders, large and small fleets as well as owner/drivers have a significant influence on safety. 


Drivers are at the bottom of the contracting chain and have little commercial ability to demand rates which would enable them to perform their work safely and legally. 


In this market, owner drivers are often forced to accept work at the going rate or have no work at all.


Not only is remuneration for owner drivers low, working hours are long. 


There are other issues that affect the payment systems for owner drivers and employee drivers and impact the productivity of the industry.


Unpaid queuing time was highlighted as a major issue in the transport industry during fatigue-related reforms and consultation for Safe Rates, Safe Roads Directions Paper.


According to the National Road Transport Operators Association, distribution centres regularly require drivers to wait up to 10 hours before loading or unloading. 


Drivers are not paid for this waiting time and cannot claim the waiting time as an official rest break, which impacts on both income and fatigue management. 


The loss of ten hours' driving time is an incentive to make up for lost time, by driving additional hours, speeding or contravening mandatory fatigue management systems.


Any improvements that can be made to these practices will bring about positive change for the road transport industry and will provide incentives for transport companies and warehouses to increase efficiency by minimising waiting times. 


To date, a national approach to safety issues that address pay as well as pay-related conditions in the industry, particularly for owner drivers, has not been taken.


The bill being introduced today reflects the government's commitment to taking the necessary next steps in addressing the underlying economic factors which create an incentive for, or encourage, unsafe on-road practices. 


The measures being introduced will ensure pay and pay related conditions encourage drivers to drive safely, manage their hours and maintain their vehicles. 


This will benefit the industry and it will benefit the wider community.


The bill seeks to reduce the number of road transport fatalities and injuries. This is important for truck drivers and their families, but it is also important for industry and it is important for all who use our roads in the community. 


Improved conditions, including work-life balance and other health benefits for truck drivers and their families will also contribute to a safer industry. 


The bill will reinforce and lock in the benefits of previous reforms, including those achieved by both industry and governments, whilst complementing the role of the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. 


It is another important step in removing economic incentives for unsafe behaviour.


The government recognises that owner drivers have chosen to be independent contractors and operate as small businesses. 


The bill establishes a system that will assist road transport industry small businesses, while ensuring that owner drivers maintain their status as independent contractors.


This legislation will play an important role in removing the incentives for employee and owner drivers to drive in ways that increase the risk of deaths and injuries on the road 


The safety of truck drivers and the community is paramount.




Key elements of the bill



The bill being introduced today will establish a new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, whose objects are to promote safety and fairness in the road transport industry. 


The bill complements existing federal legislation such as the Fair Work Act 2009 and the Independent Contractors Act 2006; current state-based schemes dealing with owner driver contracts; and the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator laws.


The principal objects of the bill recognise the government's intention to provide a framework that promotes a safe industry by:


Ensuring that drivers in the road transport industry do not have pay and pay-related incentives and pressures to work in an unsafe manner. This includes unsafe work practices such as speeding and working excessive hours.


Ensuring that road transport drivers are paid for their work, including loading or unloading their vehicles or waiting for someone else to load or unload their vehicle.


Developing and applying reasonable and enforceable standards throughout the road transport industry supply chain to ensure the safety of road transport drivers.


Ensuring that hirers of drivers and participants in the supply chain take responsibility for implementing and maintaining those standards.


The bill empowers the tribunal to inquire into sectors, issues and practices within the road transport industry and, where appropriate, determine mandatory minimum rates of pay and related conditions for employed and self-employed drivers. 


The tribunal will be able to concurrently consider matters, for example safety issues that impact on both employee and owner drivers, such as addressing waiting times.


These determinations, to be known as Road Safety Remuneration Orders, will be in addition to any existing rights employed drivers have under industrial instruments and owner drivers have under their contracts for services. 


The tribunal's approach will be evidence-based and research-focused. 


With this approach, the tribunal will have regard to issues such as: 


the need to apply fair, reasonable and enforceable standards in the road transport industry to ensure the safety and fair treatment of road transport drivers;


the likely impact of any order on the viability of businesses involved in the road transport industry;


the special circumstances of areas that are particularly reliant on the road transport industry, such as rural, regional and other isolated areas;


the likely impact of any order on the national economy and on the movement of freight across the nation;


the need to minimise the compliance burden on the road transport industry.


The tribunal will also be empowered to grant 'safe remuneration approvals' in relation to the remuneration and remuneration-related conditions contained in a road transport collective agreement between a hirer and all self-employed drivers with whom the hirer contracts.


The tribunal will be empowered to resolve disputes between drivers, their hirers or employers and participants in the road transport industry supply chain about remuneration and related conditions in so far as they provide incentives to work in an unsafe manner. 


The tribunal will deal with a dispute as it considers appropriate, including by:


mediation or conciliation;


making a recommendation or expressing an opinion; or


arbitration with the consent of the parties.


Fair Work Australia will be assisting the tribunal with dual appointments, ensuring a mixture of Fair Work Australia members and expert members with qualifications relevant to the road transport industry. 


The tribunal secretariat will be provided by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia.


The bill also establishes a compliance regime for the enforcement of orders made by the tribunal, safe remuneration approvals and any orders arising out of a dispute. 


These compliance functions will be performed by the Fair Work Ombudsman. 


In addition, the Fair Work Ombudsman will provide education, assistance and advice to owner drivers, employees and the industry.




Conclusion



This bill is the government's response to the report of the National Transport Commission that I commissioned when I became the transport minister, but it is also in response to numerous reports over many years, including the Burning the midnight oil report, which was done by the House of Representatives committee, chaired by the member for Hinkler, who is in the chamber today. This has been an issue which has been talked about for a long time, but not acted upon until today.


While transport safety outcomes have improved over the years, there are still an unacceptably high number of truck accidents and deaths.


Without further action, the number of accidents will remain unacceptably high, impacting truck drivers, their industry and the wider community. 


Lasting reform is necessary. 


I pay tribute to all those who have worked so hard, including the members of the Transport Workers Union, the members of industry, including industry leaders such as Lindsay Fox, who have placed on the record for so many years the need to get a comprehensive plan to address these issues.


This reform is necessary and it must be directed at addressing the specific problems of the industry. 


This bill does just this.


I commend this bill to the House.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (12:55):  I move:


That the amendment be agreed to.


The purpose of this amendment is to amend the commencement provision of the bill to commence proposed sections 1 to 3 and schedule 1 part 2 on royal assent and the remainder of schedule 1 on earlier of proclamation or six months. Commencing schedule 1 part 2 on royal assent will extend the operation of transport security programs for regulated air cargo agents. This means that transport security programs due to expire before 31 December 2012 will be taken to be in force until 31 December 2012 unless the TSP is either revised or cancelled at an earlier date.


This item will allow industry to adjust to new measures to help secure Australia's air cargo supply chain that were announced on 9 February 2010, thereby minimising the administrative burden on industry during the transition to the new air cargo security framework. Delaying the commencement of the other parts of schedule 1 will provide more time for consultation with industry about consequential regulations that will implement changes to the air cargo security framework contained in the bill. This will also prevent a period where the act and regulations may not align and provide certainty to the air cargo and aviation industries about security arrangements over the busy Christmas period. I commend the bill as amended to the House.

Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (13:45):  We all come to this place as representatives of a constituency around Australia. We are so often the public face of our electorates in this place and also in many parts of Australia. The media spotlight is on us but, I have to say, we are only ever as good as the people we surround ourselves with, including our own staff.


Today I want to pay a personal tribute to a former staffer of mine who passed away on Sunday. Melissa McKerihan joined my staff when John Howard was elected Prime Minister. She was my media adviser during the very early days when I was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. She was always dealing with issues from the veterans community, from members on both sides of the House and from around Australia. She was a very calm person, a wonderful person and a wonderful staffer to have.


I know that sometimes in this place we do not always record our gratitude for the wonderful staff that we have and for the people that we have behind us. Melissa was one of those people that I had behind me for so long. She had a melanoma removed from the back of her leg but, tragically, it caught up with her. Melissa at only 41 leaves a loving husband, David; two children, Hamish and Lucas; and of course her loving father, Daryl.


I say in this place, Melissa, on behalf of all the staffers—I have received a lot of messages and emails—that we are feeling for your family that you leave behind. Our sympathies go to your family on your tragic passing so early in life.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:27):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah from moving immediately:


That this House censures the Prime Minister for the deceptive, dysfunctional and directionless government she leads which doesn't trust the people, doesn't consult the people but which always consults Bob Brown and the Greens and is now headed for a crisis mini budget.


This year Bob Brown did the deciding and the Prime Minister delivered what he wanted. Bob Brown wanted a carbon tax, so the Prime Minister broke her solemn promise to the Australian people and hit families with the world's biggest carbon tax. Bob Brown wanted a dirty deal in the dead of night on the mining tax, so what did this Prime Minister do—the Prime Minister that has just, shamefully, scurried out of this chamber? She delivered.


And after deciding on the East Timor solution, the Manus Island solution and then the failed Malaysia people swap, what did this Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister who does not have the courage and the principle to face up to this parliament today—what did she do? She gave Bob Brown what he wanted all along: onshore processing.


This is a Prime Minister who claims that this has been the year of decision and delivery. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This has been the year of backflips and broken promises. There is the carbon tax based on a lie. There is the mining tax based on a secret deal. There is the border protection policy in an absolute shambles as the boats just keep coming day in, day out.


This is a government which illustrated in this parliament last night the totally chaotic and shambolic process that is the Gillard way of government, and that is why standing orders must be suspended. The mining tax was based on a secret deal done with the three big miners. Then more deals were cut with the various Independents. Then there was a second secret deal, done in the dead of night last night with the people who really pull the strings in this government. The Treasurer, who is sitting there at the ministerial table now, said that this is a deal which will stand the test of time. This deal did not last until breakfast time this morning. It has been changed five times and will be changed again and again as this panicked government goes to its crisis mini-budget next week.


This is a mining tax. It is a bad tax from a bad government. It is a secret tax from a bad government which is run not by its own backbench but, fundamentally, by the real Prime Minister of this country: Bob Brown. This deal was done without any knowledge of the cabinet, without any knowledge of the ministers, without any knowledge even of the Independents—but they can speak for themselves. I say to the minister at the table: if the Independents knew anything about the deal that had been cut with the Greens, why don't they tell us what they knew? Oh, no. It was not ministers. It was not the caucus. It was not the cabinet. It was not even the Independents. No, it was just two people who knew what was really going on in this parliament last night. It is this Prime Minister and the person who pulls the strings in this government: Bob Brown.


Everything about this mining tax is bad. The first version of the mining tax would have killed the mining boom stone dead. This is the industry which saved this country from a recession, and what is the reward that this government gives this vital industry which has saved Australia from a recession, this vital industry which is essential to the prosperity which every family in this country needs and cherishes? Their reward is a great big new tax that will cost jobs and cost investment. The first version of the mining tax would have killed the goose that laid the golden egg for Australia. The second version, cobbled together in secret with three big miners who had a gun to their heads from a government which practises payback, is a version that will punish the entrepreneurial local companies that this country will rely on if the mining industry is to expand in the years ahead.


This is a government which just does not get it when it comes to the prosperity of our country. This is a government which is consistent only in its desperate scramble to survive. The carbon tax was the greatest example of deception from this government. We have a Prime Minister who said one thing to win votes before an election and did the opposite to stay in office after the election, but what was done last night was all of a piece with the carbon tax. Like the carbon tax, it was another special deal done with the Greens and the Australian parliament and the Australian people were the last people to know. We all know that the Greens hate the mining tax. We all know that the Greens are fundamentally opposed to a modern economy which depends upon mining and resources in this country for the prosperity which each Australian needs.


This is a bad tax from a bad government which just does not get the essence of a modern economy. This government does not understand that you cannot have a society—you cannot have a community—without an economy to sustain it. You cannot have a functioning economy without profitable businesses, and profitable businesses cannot be taxed as soon as they start succeeding. What this government does not understand is that the last thing you should do if you want to improve the economy of this country is penalise success. You do not penalise success if you want to improve our economy. You do not give an uncovenanted advantage to this country's competitors. Above all else, you do not speed up the slow lane of our economy by slowing down the fast lane. This is what this government fundamentally does not understand.


This government thinks that somehow you can build prosperity with new taxes. No country ever got rich by increasing taxation. No country ever built a strong economy by clobbering itself with tax after tax after tax. It is typical of this government that it cannot even get it right. It is hitting our economy with two big new taxes and in the process is opening up a $10 billion budget black hole. More taxes, even more spending, even more borrowing—that is the Labor way, and that is the way to disaster for our country.


Every time the Prime Minister got up in question time today, every time the Prime Minister got up in question time yesterday, every minister who gets up—and let me let you in on a little secret, Mr Speaker: when the minister gets up in a few moments time, he will say, 'This is an opposition that says no to everything.' I looked at the paper yesterday, and there it is:


The Sydney Morning Heraldproudly says no.


No to fear.


No to favours.


No to pulling punches.


…   …   …


No one person's influence.


…   …   …


No to agendas.



Well, I am like that—I say no to Bob Brown's influence and no to the Green agenda. I have to say I am quite happy to say no to what is destroying the prosperity of this country and I am happy to be on— (Time expired)

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (14:37):  I second the motion. I am glad the Treasurer is staying here for this debate because I think every comedian that cracks a joke should be entitled to hear whether or not the audience laughs. When the Treasurer said a little earlier today that this is a tax that will withstand the test of time, we all had a giggle. When the mining tax was originally announced it was not five months before they had to negotiate a new secret agreement with BHP, Rio and Xstrata. It did not withstand the test of time.


Then, of course, after the election there was a transitional working group, and it was revealed that the royalties were going to have to be refunded in full out of a secret deal. So the new mining tax did not withstand the test of time. Then, of course, the draft of the legislation came out, and that changed again before the legislation was introduced. That did not withstand the test of time. Then a deal was done with the members for Lyne and New England, and the tax did not withstand the test of time. A separate deal was done with the member for Denison, and the tax did not withstand the test of time. Now, a $140 million deal has been done with the member for Melbourne, and the tax did not withstand the test of time.


After all of those compromises, totalling in excess of $13½ billion in deals, arrangements and secret negotiations, this Treasurer has the audacity to say: 'We are in it forever. This is a tax that will withstand the test of time.' I read the member for Melbourne's comments from last night very carefully. He said:


I'm very pleased that we have reached agreement with the government on a set of arrangements that will allow us to support the passage of the mining tax through the House of Representatives tonight ….


We will be reserving our position in the Senate. 


So the tax that is meant to withstand the test of time is not going to make it from the House of Reps to the Senate. They have spent $140 million buying off the member for Melbourne and they are going to have to spend more money with the Greens in the Senate. What a joke. This government has seen more deals than a Las Vegas croupier. This is the way they are behaving. They do deals. They do whatever it takes.


We had to drag the Labor Party to the table to reveal the overnight deal. They were not going to reveal the deal because the Greens in here—and it is light Green in here and dark Green in the Senate—said they had entered into a secret negotiation with the government and could not reveal the details. One of the reasons for that is that it was the Treasurer who said that the interest withholding tax on financial institutions was being introduced by the government so that major banks would have access to cheaper funding so they could offer cheaper loans to Australian households and businesses. The government expects this reform will allow such bank branches to continue their active lending to Australian businesses, including infrastructure investors, at even more competitive interest rates.


The Treasurer said that the deal with the Greens—the light Greens—to get the of the mining tax passed through this place was at a cost to lower interest rates, in his view. He sent out the Assistant Treasurer to give the bad news, to say that this is the way they are going to pay for the Greens deal to get it through the House of Representatives. So we have good cop here, bad cop there, but the police commissioner in the Senate. The police commissioner is calling the shots in the Senate—the guy that is wagging the dog. It comes back to the fundamental point: the Greens are asking for more.


We know the Greens set budget policy, because on fringe benefits tax they came up with a $970 million change to fringe benefits on cars. Now I can reveal to the House that there is a report from the Treasury that states that Senator Brown has requested costings on increasing petrol prices by CPI, amounting to over $4 billion. The last time we saw this costing by the Greens from the Treasury, it came through in budget policy. Now we know that the Greens have requested from the Treasury costings on increasing the cost of petrol for everyday Australians with a higher excise. Stop wagging the dog. Get rid of the Greens— (Time expired)

He is saying that his very first commitment, if he is elected to office, is to give a tax break to 30 of the wealthiest companies in this country—people who are having superprofits. These people are not only making these profits but saying they are prepared to pay the tax. They should pay the tax. We on this side of the chamber say yes to the minerals resource rent tax. The Australian public say yes to the minerals rent tax. The big miners say yes to the MRRT. The only people in Australia who say no are those opposite.



Mr John Cobb interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  And last night they said it 32 times.


But there is something that is very interesting. As everyone would know, there was no gagging of the debate last night. Everyone had an opportunity to make a contribution, but there is one person who did not make a contribution to the debate on the minerals resource rent tax—and that is the Leader of the Opposition.


He could not get to his feet: not yesterday, not the day before, not when we introduced the legislation. Not one word during the debate did he have to make, yet he says this is the most important issue facing Australia. He could not be bothered getting to his feet. He slept through the economic stimulus plan vote and last night had to have a person either side of him to nudge him and wake him up during the divisions. You had the Chief Opposition Whip on one side and the Manager of Opposition Business on the other nudging him every 10 minutes to get him to wake up, having slept through the economic stimulus plan.


But of course he has got form because he could not be bothered speaking on the minerals resource rent tax legislation. When the carbon price came to a vote in the Senate—remember the other big piece of legislation—he was on a plane—

Mr ALBANESE:
  to Europe where he told them that the Australian economy led by this Prime Minister and this Treasurer was the envy of the industrialised world. That is what he had to say overseas, and it stands in stark contrast to his behaviour in this House.


The fact is that this Leader of the Opposition is hoping to survive and get out of this place because he is looking forward to Christmas. He is hoping that Santa brings him a policy because what happened late yesterday in his own caucus room is that, one by one, they stood up and spoke about the National Party tail wagging the Liberal Party dog. They spoke about the pathetic failure of modern liberalism under this leader. Robert Menzies, the founder of the Liberal Party, had this to say:


In other words, on far too many questions we have found our role to be simply that of the man who says 'No.'


A visionary was Robert Menzies: 67 years ago he picked this bloke, and this is what he also said about this bloke:


There is no room in Australia for a party of reaction. There is no useful place for a policy of negation.


That is what Robert Menzies said about this person who has led the coalition of yesterday into the 'noalition' of today—the 'noalition' who have just one policy to every issue: no, no, no, no, no. We heard it 32 times last night, and so desperate were they that we had the unprecedented action from the opposition of moving divisions and having counts on third readings of legislation. That is how strong they were in their opposition to big miners being taxed. That is how strong they were in making sure that they go to the next election. They are going to say to the people who have had the income tax-free threshold lifted from $6,000 to $18,000 that they are going to bring it back in. They are going to put a million people back into the income tax system, the lowest paid Australians in this country. Why? So that BHP, Rio Tinto and the big miners who say they can pay more will get a tax cut. What a disgrace, and that is on top of the fact that they are going to increase company tax for Australia's 2.7 million small businesses. That is the policy that they have.


Last night we saw the farce of them having a bit of a focus group—and maybe it came through: maybe they are being a little bit too negative. 'Maybe we need to have a bit of a nuance.' So we saw the little nuance with regard to superannuation. They did not trust the shadow finance minister, so he was out of the loop.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:27):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah from moving immediately:


That this House censures the Prime Minister for the deceptive, dysfunctional and directionless government she leads which doesn't trust the people, doesn't consult the people but which always consults Bob Brown and the Greens and is now headed for a crisis mini budget.


This year Bob Brown did the deciding and the Prime Minister delivered what he wanted. Bob Brown wanted a carbon tax, so the Prime Minister broke her solemn promise to the Australian people and hit families with the world's biggest carbon tax. Bob Brown wanted a dirty deal in the dead of night on the mining tax, so what did this Prime Minister do—the Prime Minister that has just, shamefully, scurried out of this chamber? She delivered.


And after deciding on the East Timor solution, the Manus Island solution and then the failed Malaysia people swap, what did this Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister who does not have the courage and the principle to face up to this parliament today—what did she do? She gave Bob Brown what he wanted all along: onshore processing.


This is a Prime Minister who claims that this has been the year of decision and delivery. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This has been the year of backflips and broken promises. There is the carbon tax based on a lie. There is the mining tax based on a secret deal. There is the border protection policy in an absolute shambles as the boats just keep coming day in, day out.


This is a government which illustrated in this parliament last night the totally chaotic and shambolic process that is the Gillard way of government, and that is why standing orders must be suspended. The mining tax was based on a secret deal done with the three big miners. Then more deals were cut with the various Independents. Then there was a second secret deal, done in the dead of night last night with the people who really pull the strings in this government. The Treasurer, who is sitting there at the ministerial table now, said that this is a deal which will stand the test of time. This deal did not last until breakfast time this morning. It has been changed five times and will be changed again and again as this panicked government goes to its crisis mini-budget next week.


This is a mining tax. It is a bad tax from a bad government. It is a secret tax from a bad government which is run not by its own backbench but, fundamentally, by the real Prime Minister of this country: Bob Brown. This deal was done without any knowledge of the cabinet, without any knowledge of the ministers, without any knowledge even of the Independents—but they can speak for themselves. I say to the minister at the table: if the Independents knew anything about the deal that had been cut with the Greens, why don't they tell us what they knew? Oh, no. It was not ministers. It was not the caucus. It was not the cabinet. It was not even the Independents. No, it was just two people who knew what was really going on in this parliament last night. It is this Prime Minister and the person who pulls the strings in this government: Bob Brown.


Everything about this mining tax is bad. The first version of the mining tax would have killed the mining boom stone dead. This is the industry which saved this country from a recession, and what is the reward that this government gives this vital industry which has saved Australia from a recession, this vital industry which is essential to the prosperity which every family in this country needs and cherishes? Their reward is a great big new tax that will cost jobs and cost investment. The first version of the mining tax would have killed the goose that laid the golden egg for Australia. The second version, cobbled together in secret with three big miners who had a gun to their heads from a government which practises payback, is a version that will punish the entrepreneurial local companies that this country will rely on if the mining industry is to expand in the years ahead.


This is a government which just does not get it when it comes to the prosperity of our country. This is a government which is consistent only in its desperate scramble to survive. The carbon tax was the greatest example of deception from this government. We have a Prime Minister who said one thing to win votes before an election and did the opposite to stay in office after the election, but what was done last night was all of a piece with the carbon tax. Like the carbon tax, it was another special deal done with the Greens and the Australian parliament and the Australian people were the last people to know. We all know that the Greens hate the mining tax. We all know that the Greens are fundamentally opposed to a modern economy which depends upon mining and resources in this country for the prosperity which each Australian needs.


This is a bad tax from a bad government which just does not get the essence of a modern economy. This government does not understand that you cannot have a society—you cannot have a community—without an economy to sustain it. You cannot have a functioning economy without profitable businesses, and profitable businesses cannot be taxed as soon as they start succeeding. What this government does not understand is that the last thing you should do if you want to improve the economy of this country is penalise success. You do not penalise success if you want to improve our economy. You do not give an uncovenanted advantage to this country's competitors. Above all else, you do not speed up the slow lane of our economy by slowing down the fast lane. This is what this government fundamentally does not understand.


This government thinks that somehow you can build prosperity with new taxes. No country ever got rich by increasing taxation. No country ever built a strong economy by clobbering itself with tax after tax after tax. It is typical of this government that it cannot even get it right. It is hitting our economy with two big new taxes and in the process is opening up a $10 billion budget black hole. More taxes, even more spending, even more borrowing—that is the Labor way, and that is the way to disaster for our country.


Every time the Prime Minister got up in question time today, every time the Prime Minister got up in question time yesterday, every minister who gets up—and let me let you in on a little secret, Mr Speaker: when the minister gets up in a few moments time, he will say, 'This is an opposition that says no to everything.' I looked at the paper yesterday, and there it is:


The Sydney Morning Heraldproudly says no.


No to fear.


No to favours.


No to pulling punches.


…   …   …


No one person's influence.


…   …   …


No to agendas.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (14:37):  I second the motion. I am glad the Treasurer is staying here for this debate because I think every comedian that cracks a joke should be entitled to hear whether or not the audience laughs. When the Treasurer said a little earlier today that this is a tax that will withstand the test of time, we all had a giggle. When the mining tax was originally announced it was not five months before they had to negotiate a new secret agreement with BHP, Rio and Xstrata. It did not withstand the test of time.


Then, of course, after the election there was a transitional working group, and it was revealed that the royalties were going to have to be refunded in full out of a secret deal. So the new mining tax did not withstand the test of time. Then, of course, the draft of the legislation came out, and that changed again before the legislation was introduced. That did not withstand the test of time. Then a deal was done with the members for Lyne and New England, and the tax did not withstand the test of time. A separate deal was done with the member for Denison, and the tax did not withstand the test of time. Now, a $140 million deal has been done with the member for Melbourne, and the tax did not withstand the test of time.


After all of those compromises, totalling in excess of $13½ billion in deals, arrangements and secret negotiations, this Treasurer has the audacity to say: 'We are in it forever. This is a tax that will withstand the test of time.' I read the member for Melbourne's comments from last night very carefully. He said:


I'm very pleased that we have reached agreement with the government on a set of arrangements that will allow us to support the passage of the mining tax through the House of Representatives tonight ….


We will be reserving our position in the Senate. 


So the tax that is meant to withstand the test of time is not going to make it from the House of Reps to the Senate. They have spent $140 million buying off the member for Melbourne and they are going to have to spend more money with the Greens in the Senate. What a joke. This government has seen more deals than a Las Vegas croupier. This is the way they are behaving. They do deals. They do whatever it takes.


We had to drag the Labor Party to the table to reveal the overnight deal. They were not going to reveal the deal because the Greens in here—and it is light Green in here and dark Green in the Senate—said they had entered into a secret negotiation with the government and could not reveal the details.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (15:07):  The topic today is very important: the impact of increased taxes on small business. I remind the chamber of a great quote from a great leader, Winston Churchill, who said, 'For a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket trying to lift himself up by the handle.' That is the logic we have got from this government. They think that more taxes will somehow generate greater prosperity and greater small business opportunities in this country. What are the small business community asking themselves? They are asking: when will this government stop kicking small business? When will the Greens and the government alliance crossbenchers stop holding down small businesses or steadfastly looking the other way while the Gillard government gives them another kick?


We saw it last night and we got a taste of it today during question time. The Gillard government want you to believe that it is taxing big miners to share prosperity with small businesses across Australia, but they will not tell you how it was the coalition parties that last night stood up against a 25 per cent tax hike for 400,000 of Australia's smallest businesses. Last night the government moved, under the veil of the mining tax package, that it would abolish the entrepreneurs tax offset, which is a modest 25 per cent rebate for our 400,000 smallest businesses, who maximise its benefit at $50,000 of income, and it is tapered out at $75,000. So now 400,000 of our smallest businesses, which are not earning more than $75,000, are going to face a tax increase of up to 25 per cent. Who stood up for them in this chamber? The Liberal and National parties. I give credit to some of the crossbenchers who understand that small business matters, but you need to do more than just talk about it. You cannot talk a good game. It is what you do about it that counts.


After I did a doorstop interview highlighting this attack and tax hike on Australia's smallest businesses, the member for New England was asked about this. He was asked about my observation about the tax hike that was passed last night. Do you know what he said? He said he did not know. He had no knowledge that this tax hike was part of the package of bills last night. He had no understanding, because of the sugar-coated briefings the Gillard government provides the crossbenchers—the self-serving nonsense that carves out all the bitter things that are part of this government's agenda. He was not aware that embedded in the legislation was a tax hike for probably 1,600 or 1,700 small businesses in the member for New England's electorate. He said he was not aware of it. How could he not be aware of it? When you look at the Tax Laws Amendment (Stronger, Fairer, Simpler and Other Measures) Bill 2011, you can see that schedule 1 says it abolishes the entrepreneurs tax offset. We have raised this point over and over again in this parliament, highlighting the impact on the smallest businesses in Australia, but the member for New England said he did not know about it. You would think this article from Monday entitled 'Small business tax bomb' would be a bit of a hint. Do you reckon that would set off an 'aha' that something is going on? Apparently not.


Last night the member for New England and some of his government alliance crossbench colleagues voted with Labor to impose a tax hike of 25 per cent on Australia's smallest businesses—and that is spreading the benefits of the mining boom! It has been revealed over and over that the big miners are not likely to pay any of this mining resource rent tax increase for at least the forward estimates period. They will not be suffering. No wonder they do not think it is a bad deal. They will be immune from it because of the carve-outs and the negotiations between the Prime Minister and the mining companies that were too smart by half for this government. They will not be affected by it, but 400,000 of our smallest businesses—those microbusinesses, those women returning to the workforce, those home based businesses and those independent retailers just trying to make a go of it in a very difficult economic climate—will be copping it. They will be copping an increase of up to 25 per cent in their tax liability.


What is the government's explanation? They can go out and buy a car and get accelerated depreciation. As Barbara Gabogreca from Home Based Business Australia said, how many of these microbusinesses have a lazy $30,000 to buy a new ute? Buy a new ute, spend $30,000 of your scarce cash, and you might get about $1,800 back as a cash-flow benefit, but not in the year you spend it. You may get it in October the following year. What kind of cash-flow advantage is that? Small business is saying that that is the kind of help they can really do without—spend a lot to get a little back and then get a tax hike on the way through.


But it gets worse. That is just tax increase No. 1 that is harming small business. If you look further in the package last night, you will see the superannuation guarantee increase. There was a three per cent increase in superannuation guarantee contributions. We rightly opposed that, recognising that is a three per cent increase in payroll costs for our smallest businesses at a time when they are doing it very tough and when trading conditions are very punishing for that community. We make the point over and over again that the Henry tax review said you could achieve adequacy in retirement incomes not by increasing the employer contributions but by looking at the way ingoings and earnings are taxed. It is legitimate for the coalition to look at that research. But the government said, 'Employers can pay that.' Then they walk around this country with the great big Labor line, 'The mining tax will pay for it.' I have a message for the government and Labor MPs: employer funded superannuation is paid by employers. It is not paid by the mining tax; employers pay it. In a press conference today they perpetuated this line. Did you see the press conference? The Prime Minister and the Assistant Treasurer were trying to explain what was going on. The Prime Minister was asked:


You've talked about how the mining tax pays for tax issues that the government has, but who pays for the move from 9 to 12%? The 3% is paid for by employers, isn't it, or are employees forgoing wages and saving them?


Ms Gillard said, 'I'll turn to the Assistant Treasurer.' I will take a step back. The Assistant Treasurer said:


When the conservatives say that increasing superannuation from 9 to 12% over the next seven years is a cost on employers they are lying.


That is what the Assistant Treasurer said in a press conference today. The coalition parties highlighted the simple, indisputable fact that employer superannuation contributions are paid for by employers, yet the Assistant Treasurer ran around saying that when making that simple, factual, uncontested statement we are lying. We know where the nonsense is coming from. We know where the Labor line is coming from. He went on to say:


Increasing superannuation is not a cost in terms of employers because what happens is that it is offset against real wage increases.


I wonder whether the union movement is aware of that. I wonder whether the working men and women of Australia are aware that they are going to have a reduction in their take-home pay because of some arrangement about superannuation. The truth is there is no such arrangement. There is no such accord where there is a trade-off between wage increases and superannuation contributions. There is nothing of the sort. It is completely false and entirely calculated for the Assistant Treasurer to be making these statements. I say to every small business: the next time your payroll costs go up because you are paying more superannuation contributions, just think about the Assistant Treasurer. He said that you are not really paying it after all. What is it—funny money? That is the way the government goes about running the budget in this country.


But it gets worse. It is bad enough that 400,000 of Australia's smallest businesses are getting up to a 25 per cent increase in their tax and are being told that they should suck that up on the basis of 'spend a lot to get a little bit back' for some of the write-off arrangements and bring-forward benefits they were going to get anyway. They are then told that they have increasing payroll contributions for superannuation, though they are not paying that either. Somehow the tooth fairy is paying for that. The government have been spending too much time with the Greens, haven't they? That is the only explanation as to what is going on here. This kind of funny-money logic is quite remarkable.


But dig a bit deeper and go to the great big carbon tax. Colleagues, remember how there was not a dime of compensation for the small business community? Remember how, with all the carve-outs and all the compensation arrangements, small business was told to suck it up, pass it onto customers, and look after themselves as best they could? What happened during those chilly years when the government was going around telling everybody, 'The carbon tax won't hurt that much; you'll get compensated but it won't hurt that much'? This was at a time when its modelling was proved to be completely unreliable. It was understating the impact on electricity by about 60 per cent and it could not even credit some of the herculean assumptions that the world was going to come on board and that America was going to do all sorts of things. There would be a feverish market of carbon credits that would make everything so cheap you would barely notice it.


We then had the Prime Minister at a press conference in Brisbane saying that there would be a tough carbon cop on the beat. Remember that? That would be the ACCC. That tough carbon cop is going to make sure prices to consumers would not increase by more than one per cent. Is there any evidence to back up that claim? None. The macro-economic modelling is wrong but the government has not even bothered to do an analysis of the actual carbon tax impact on individual goods and services. The Prime Minister claimed that this tough carbon cop would be on the beat and that consumers could rest assured that this painful carbon tax change would only hurt a little.


Well, it got worse last week. The ACCC released the guidelines that it, as the tough carbon cop, would be implementing. Nowhere in the guidelines does it mention anything about one per cent. There is no basis for it. The Prime Minister, in a self-serving exercise, made that up. It says that you can have a pre-Christmas sale but be very careful if you are going to have a pre-carbon-tax sale, because the ACCC might come and crack down on you. What kind of logic is that? The Prime Minister has gone out and verballed the small business community. They are terrified that this enormous tax is going to impact on their viability. Survey after survey shows that it will cost jobs, it will undermine profitability in small business, it will see people who are working have fewer hours and it will place those on the border in a very perilous state as they compete with overseas competitors who do not have a carbon tax.


According to the Prime Minister at the press conference, small businesses doing the right thing will not be putting up prices by any more than one per cent, even though there is no evidence to back that up. There is no basis in law for the role she was attributing to the ACCC. Then the ACCC said, 'Whatever statements you make, make sure you can back them up.' That is fair enough. Do you know why? Because, if you cannot back them up, you are at risk of being charged with false and misleading conduct, so it is important to back up those points. But when I look at the Prime Minister's statement, 'Businesses overwhelmingly will do the right thing and the only costs they will pass through is the less than one per cent cost of us putting a price on carbon,' we know there is no analysis to back that up. That is a prime ministerial declaration of a self-serving purpose designed to muzzle and intimidate small businesses to not pass on the true cost of the carbon tax impacts.


Then it gets worse. It is a $1.1 million fine. We cannot have pre-carbon-tax sales; otherwise you risk offending. I have a theory. When it comes to false and misleading representations about the carbon tax, I think I know who the first candidate could be for an investigation. I think it might be the Prime Minister making these claims about the role of the ACCC, unfounded in law and with no factual basis about the price impact on the costs of goods and services. If you are not happy enough with that, if that is a little too sophisticated, go back prior to the election: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Remember that? Remember when the Prime Minister assured people of that? So, when I look at the ACCC guidelines, acquaint myself and reassure the small business community that the government has no idea what the impact of the carbon tax will be but they are entitled to pass on the cost increases that they incur where they can substantiate them, I know who the prime candidate for an investigation into false and misleading representations about the carbon tax should be. That would be our Prime Minister.


These are three taxes hurting small businesses right across the country. This is why 300,000 jobs are being lost in small business. This is why there are 22,000 fewer small businesses. This is why the former small business minister has been shunted off to be the trade minister or is away from the small businesses that were so inflamed by his non-performance, and he has been replaced with the Marcel Marceau of the frontbench. Does anybody know who the Gillard government's small business minister is?



Opposition members:  No. Who is it?




Mr BILLSON:
  He does not upset anybody because no-one knows who he is. But it underlines the point that, when decisions need to be made about the interests of small business—



Opposition members:  Who is it? Tell us.




Mr BILLSON:
  No, no—it would be more publicity than Senator Sherry has had all year. I remind this parliament that the Gillard government appointed Senator Sherry as the small business minister but he is not even in cabinet. So, when the big decisions are made and choices are evaluated about the impact of government policy on small business, who is there representing them? Nobody. I must say it is reflected in every decision they have made. When you get to ask what the Labor Party is doing for small business, it does not take long to come up with an answer. When you hear Senator Sherry and the Gillard government talking about how good they are for small business, I go back to that great philosopher, John McEnroe, who said after a bad line call at Wimbledon, 'You can't be serious.'

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (15:22):  I must say that at a personal level I enjoy reasonable relations with the member for Dunkley, but listening to his speech I did feel we had entered the twilight zone of politics. There are opposition members saying, 'Oh, my goodness, we'll all be ruined; the government doesn't like small business.' Weren't they here last night, when they saw some of the good changes which we have introduced to assist small business? I am fortunate to have the opportunity to go through some of the accomplishments and plans the government has to keep assisting small business, because this government understands that small business is all about people. We can respect the aspiration to be your own boss and we also understand the importance of simplicity and trying to cut red tape. For parents who have to do the paperwork on a Sunday instead of spending time with their family, that is time that can never be replaced. This is a government who understands the value and the contribution of small business to our nation. We understand the legitimate aspiration of people to accomplish more and to be their own boss.


That is why we are simplifying the tax system. We can talk about a range of those measures, but I thought I would roll off a lazy eight ways we are doing it for the benefit of the member for Dunkley. First of all—in no particular order and courtesy of what we did last night—members who voted for the minerals resource rent tax have supported an instant asset write-off, so when you need to buy that valuable refrigerator or that photocopier or that capital item, courtesy of the Gillard government, between our Clean Energy Future package and the mining tax package, the instant asset write-off will rise from $1,000 to $6½ thousand. This is real money. This government understands not the twilight zone of the opposition, but the real world. That is real money that is going to materially assist 2.7 million small businesses. 


What I do not understand is why the opposition, whenever they have a chance to back the little guy over the big guy, they always pick the big guy. What is it that makes Rio Tinto, Anglo American and BHP Billiton household names in the battling Frankston suburbs which the member for Dunkley represents? Why is it that he would vote to give $11 billion back to the richest companies in the world but not provide a $6½ thousand instant asset write-off for small business. The mind boggles, but of course in the twilight zone of the opposition, anything goes.


I promised to report on several other features of what we are doing for small business, again in no particular order. Just yesterday we released a discussion paper about how we have improved the operation of trusts in Australia—660,000 of them. The only contribution I have seen from the opposition on the question of trusts came from the member for North Sydney, the current shadow Treasurer, who had a thought bubble and said we should tax trusts the same as corporations. But don't worry: the red danger warning light went off in the opposition leader's office. They said, 'The member for North Sydney is on the loose; he's speaking first, thinking second.' Within a number of hours he had hauled down his colours and said, 'I'm very sorry, I was misquoted'—even though we all had a written copy of what he said.


There is another benefit in what we have been doing for small business. We are also changing the way the pay-as-you-go instalments operate so that small business can receive the benefit of $700 million in cash flow benefit in the 2011-12 financial year. I must also address the member for Dunkley's discussion about the entrepreneurs tax offset. The member for Dunkley is crying crocodile tears, I am afraid to report to the House, because while he quite rightly identifies that we have scrapped the entrepreneurs tax offset, which is worth $365 million over the forwards—schedule 1—we have in fact provided $2.6 billion in additional tax assistance and write-offs for small business. It does not take a Rhodes scholar to work out that when you are giving $2.6 billion to small business and you deduct the cost of the entrepreneurs tax offset of $365 million, you are still $2.3-plus billion ahead of the game.


There is another benefit in the Clean Energy Future package. We have not added any red tape to the lives of small business with that. On motor vehicles we are proposing a $5,000 instant asset write-off per vehicle. If you are a tradesperson and you buy a $33,000-plus ute you will be able to get back $1,275 in tax from that purchase. That is real money; that will assist with three weeks of shopping for a family of four. Real money.


What I do not understand is why the opposition wants to give money back to the very richest companies in Australia and not give a fair share to the whole Australian economy? Small businesses pay their taxes. They have helped pay for the roads, the education and the health care of the people of Australia, why shouldn't they and all Australians get a dividend from the richest companies making superprofits? I know that some opposite shake their heads: how can one be mean to their large, vested-interest allies? It is not us. We just want a fair share for all Australians of the mining boom. 


It is very clear that we are pro-business. We are improving and reforming the future of financial advice,. We have been assisting small business with our reforms to flood insurance, for instance. We are continuing to see how we can work with the retail industry to help it through very difficult times. There are very many areas we are working at. I understand the opposition's role is to be negative and say no, and even the normally avuncular member for Dunkley seems to have been infected with a little bit of the contagion of his boss's negativity. 


Let us go to one of the most significant things that happened last night. We passed a bill in the House of Representatives which will increase compulsory superannuation over the next seven years from nine to 12 per cent. That is a matter of history. People in 10 or 20 years will say, 'Wasn't it far-sighted of a government to get on with increasing the compulsory savings of Australia?' I know that people do not mind, because those opposite get 15 per cent super or defined benefit plans, so they are very happy to take super and their boss, the people who pay them, are the taxpayers of Australia. They do not refund their super. They are happy to pocket it. Always back the horse called self-interest when it comes to the opposition. That is fair enough; it is a legitimate condition, and I support the condition.



Mr Billson interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I hear the member for Dunkley; he is obviously busily trying to remake his case. I can hear he has some concerns now through his interjections. But the reason why we are increasing super from nine to 12 per cent is that there are no free lunches when it comes to growing older.


It is a great thing that Australians are growing older—it certainly beats the alternative—but, having said that, we have to pay the bills. We can pay through the aged-care pension and lift taxes for that, but the pack of negative Twilight Zone dwellers opposite would say they do not want to do that. So how will we afford our retirement? It is okay for some of the lads and ladies opposite in the lap of luxury. They have their defined benefits, but how will the other Australians afford their retirement? It is true: do not take a condition which you are not willing to give to other people.


When we look at what the government has done with the mining tax, we have ensured that, if we are increasing super from nine to 12 per cent, the concessional tax benefit afforded to Australians as a result of the income which would previously have been taxed at a higher marginal rate is now taxed at only 15 per cent. That is what happens when you increase the amount of income which is concessionally taxed as opposed to taxing it at the marginal rates of taxation. That has to be paid for by someone.


What is interesting is that the opposition have had more positions on superannuation than are in the Kama Sutra. Initially, in 1995, the member for Warringah and current Leader of the Opposition said superannuation was a con job. More recently, the shadow Treasurer said, 'No way are we going to keep any of the things which the mining tax money is being spent on, because we are going to give the mining tax back to the big end of town.' If that is your value base, fair enough—it is an honestly held position to give it back to the richest. Their shadow Assistant Treasurer, a person who I think is of some capacity, then said at a lunch for business leaders: 'We're going to wind back the 12 per cent to nine per cent. If those scurrilous socialists across the aisle'—I do not think he said 'scurrilous socialists', although he might have thought it, but I am not a mind-reader. At the end of October or the beginning of November, he said: 'We will put our hand in the retirement savings pocket of every Australian and we will reduce super from 12 per cent to nine per cent.'


Even some supporters of the Liberal party were sufficiently aghast at the Twilight Zone analysis that the Sydney Morning Herald broke the story about what he had said. Then again there were those famous red lights which go off when an opposition coalition frontbencher says something random, planned and unsupported, and there was a meeting of the leadership of the coalition. When I say 'a meeting of the leadership', that was minus Andrew Robb, the shadow finance minister, as people could not find his phone number. The opposition said: 'We don't like nine to 12 per cent, but if it gets up we're going to keep it.'


Last Friday the Leader of the Opposition, to ingratiate himself with a group of people in the financial services sector, said, 'We're going to abstain on the vote; we're not even going to vote against it.' And we know what happened last night. They got their latest position out of the manual of backflips and they said, 'We're going to vote against it.' Last night they not only voted against increasing compulsory super from nine to 12 per cent; they actually voted against abolishing age discrimination. They voted against the idea that people over 70—



Mr Ian Macfarlane interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Look at it: the honourable member said we stole their idea. Not only did we not steal it but, if you have such a good idea, why is it that you have a good idea until it comes to voting on it and then you drop it? What do you stand for? You cannot be half-pregnant in this life. You either believe something or you do not. They voted against abolishing discrimination against people over the age of 70. This government had said: if you are over 70 and working, we want you to get super. I think that is a good idea. Certainly 53,000 people currently working will not be unhappy with that. We proposed that 8.4 million people should have their superannuation increased through modest increments over the next seven years to 12 per cent.


We also have proposed and voted up in the House of Reps—when I say 'we', I mean the majority of people in parliament and not the coalition, because they are always last to anything—that Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year, of whom we estimate that there are 3.6 million, will no longer have to pay 15 per cent tax on superannuation. Unlike people who earn more than $37,000 a year, their actual rate of taxation is either 15 per cent or zero. That will mean that quite a sizeable number of low-income Australians, people who work hard to earn their income but get a low income, are paying the same rate of tax on their super as they pay on the income they earn. One of the important features of superannuation in Australia is that if it is going to be compulsory it should be concessional. We propose that for 3.6 million Australians it should be compulsory, but we respect that it should be concessional. We are abolishing the tax they pay.


The opposition voted against it—mind you, half of them were asleep, although not everyone, but they were more nodding than awake. I accept that some of them might not have realised what they were doing, but there is a question for the opposition leader to answer. I know he does not like doing the tough interviews on television and the big press conferences where the gallery might ask him hard questions, but there is a rule ultimately in politics as there is in life: you can run but you cannot hide. In the court of national opinion you need to make it very clear, Mr Abbott: do you support 3.6 million—




Mr Ian Macfarlane:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask the Assistant Treasurer to address members by their proper titles.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The member for Groom is perfectly correct and the Assistant Treasurer will observe the standing orders.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I ask the member for Warringah, the current holder of the Leader of the Opposition job, this: the government has supported legislation in the House of Representatives which will abolish the concessional tax paid by 3.6 million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year, so will the Leader of the Opposition—not that he ever hangs around—do the same thing? That promise is worth $1.8 billion over the forwards. Therefore the opposition have two choices: (1) they can say they do not like the mining tax—and they have said that, but they will keep this promise and they will find the money elsewhere; (2) they can say they are not going to keep this promise. They would then reimpose a tax on 3.6 million Australians who currently, under our proposal, will no longer have to pay concessional tax on their superannuation. 


As they say on the game show, it is deal or no deal, member for Warringah and Leader of the Opposition. You can run but you cannot hide. We want to support small business and we want to support all Australians by sharing a fair share of the mining superprofits of the largest companies in Australia using non-renewable resources throughout Australia. Will you give the lowest paid Australians the tax cut in superannuation as this government is doing, or will you refuse to do it and demand that the money come back and instead give it to a few of the richest companies in the world? It would be better if it clarified your position today. (Time expired)

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2011-11-23,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (15:37):  I am pleased to speak on this most relevant and timely matter of public importance and support the comments from my good friend the member for Dunkley, who exposed the deception and fraud of this government and how it has misled small business again and again and again.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The honourable member will withdraw the word 'fraud'.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I withdraw that word. The impact of Labor's increased taxes on small business is a testimony to this government's anti-small-business agenda and this regime's four-year shameful history of waste, incompetence and deception. When we go back to 2007, when Labor first came to power, they offered so many promises about assisting small business. But, four years later, let us have a look at the results of their unprecedented attack on the small business sector.


Under this Labor regime, 300,000 small business jobs have been lost and Labor's policies have also resulted in more than 20,000 fewer small businesses now contributing to our economy. Twenty thousand have disappeared. What an appalling and shameful record! As for this government, this Prime Minister and this Treasurer, the only successful policy they seem to have in the small business sector is making small business smaller. What an absolute disgrace! Yesterday we had the Prime Minister and this government pretending to be friends of small business. What a sham! We even had the Treasurer quoting Menzies, reminding the House that it is the Liberal Party that is the party that stands for the strivers, the planners and the ambitious small businesses. Yesterday, we had more quotes of Menzies from the Treasurer—and I just hope he will do more of these, because he would do well to learn from one of the greatest leaders in our country's history. I wonder what quotes a future Treasurer might recall of this Prime Minister 40 years from now. Perhaps it will be, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government that I lead', or maybe even better, 'The Labor Party is the party of truth-telling.' They will be the butt of jokes.


This government, a government where small business does not even have a voice at the cabinet table, will long be remembered for their policies, which have already destroyed 300,000 small business jobs and destroyed the hopes and dreams of over 20,000 small businesses. But, while this is their shameful record to date, what is the rest of the small business community experiencing currently—the ones that have survived? Just have a look at the most recent Sensis small business survey. It shows the profitability of the small business sector has hit an incredible 18-year low—that's right, an 18-year low. And the report records that small business confidence has collapsed to just 15 per cent, one of the worst results in the report's history. Growth in small business capital expenditure has fallen again sharply, to the lowest levels ever recorded by the index, and the proportion of small businesses exporting has also fallen. And there has been an almost 50 per cent increase in the numbers of small business owners that intend to either sell or close their business. They have seen the writing on the wall under this government. They simply want to get out while they can with a shirt on their back.


We also have the latest ACCI small business survey, which has found that small business trading conditions and confidence have continued to collapse under this government and their policies with all indicators—including expected economic performance, sales revenue, employment and investment in plant and equipment—in substantial decline for the small business.


These are the sobering facts, and this is exactly the feedback that I am getting from 11,258 small businesses located in my electorate of Hughes, 97 per cent of which are truly small, family-owned businesses. The many small businesses I talk to are telling me that business conditions under this Labor government are the worst in living memory. That is the shameful record of this government to date. But the future only gets worse.


Back in 2007, the so-called 'party of truth-telling' promised that a Labor government would ease the regulatory burden on small business, and the member for Griffith stated that this was 'eating away at the entrepreneurial spirit' of the nation. But what is the record four years later? After piling new tax upon new tax and new regulation upon new regulation, a recent World Bank analysis of small business regulation has shown that Australia has gone backwards on almost every measure, with the exception of one category, the category of dealing with construction permits. We are now ranked a lowly 42nd. Who is above us? We are actually one place behind Greece, which came in 41st.


Then we have small business carrying the burden of this government's reckless spending and putting upward pressure on interest rates. We have had the Treasurer farcically standing on the floor of this parliament talking about 'fiscal discipline'. This is the same Treasurer that has turned a $40 billion net surplus into a $100 billion-plus net deficit, which is only putting upward pressure on interest rates. It is the small business sector that carries the burden more than any other sector because of these increased interest rates. It has now been weeks since the Reserve Bank dropped interest rates by 0.25 per cent, but many small businesses out there today are still waiting for that cut to be passed on to them. That is where small business stands today under this Labor government.


And what of the future? Until the rotting carcass of this deceptive, dysfunctional and directionless government is finally dispatched to the annals of history by the voters, small business will continue to suffer. This shameful track record that I have noted comes even before small business is smashed by the insanity of the world's biggest carbon tax, a tax that the Prime Minister and Treasurer of this country promised solemnly they would not introduce. This tax is built on deception upon deception. Not being satisfied with the deception of the Prime Minister telling small business that there would be no tax under the government that she leads, the deception has continued with the latest falsehood from the government with their claim that 'small business will not be required to pay a carbon price'. But this Labor-Greens carbon tax will simply cascade through the supply chain, compounding at each stage and leaving Australia's two million small businesses and family enterprises to foot the bill with higher costs. Many small businesses already suffering the worst trading conditions in living memory have little capacity to absorb these increases. They will be caught in a vice, squeezed between spiralling costs on one hand and caught with their customers having less money in their pockets to spend on the other, all the while dark economic clouds gathering on the international horizon. This is a recipe for disaster.


Then we have the government's plan to use the ACCC storm-troopers to silence small business by threatening to go after any small business that dares inform consumers about price increases due to the carbon tax. The threat of using the ACCC as an attack dog to prosecute small business owners who dare talk about the carbon tax is a disgrace. Small businesses face increases in electricity and will be forced to put many prices up where they can, yet they have a government that has misled them about this tax, has misled them about the effects of this tax and that is now threatening to prosecute small businesses for misleading and deceptive conduct if they merely talk about the tax.


Mr Deputy Speaker, you would think that the party that claims to be the party of truth telling would be telling the whole truth because silence by leaving out a material fact to create a false impression is nothing other than a deception. What we saw yesterday and last night during the debate on the mining tax was nothing other than a deception and a falsehood.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Hughes will not use the word 'deception'. He should withdraw that word.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. Buried in the mining tax was the Labor government's plans to increase taxes by 25 per cent for the 400,000 smallest businesses by removing the entrepreneurial tax offset. Not one single speaker from the government side even bothered to mention the fact that these bills contain a plan to rip $180 million off our most vulnerable small businesses. Either they did not read the legislation or they were deliberately deceptive.


Small businesses are in a perilous state in our nation. They are faced with a carbon tax. They are faced with the impost of the mining tax. We need clear policy from this government. Small businesses are suffering more than they ever have. They are facing high interest rates. We need a change of government. We need a change of policy. (Time expired)

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (15:47):  I love hearing conservatives parade their friendship of small business. I love how they pretend that they are such great friends of small business. It always reminds me of that great quote from George W Bush when he lambasted the French for not having a word for 'entrepreneur'. They always make out they are the best mate of small business, but whenever they are called upon to make a decision in favour of small business, to do something when they are positioned between big business and small business, guess where they go—always for the big interest, never for the small.


Let us go through a litany of key decisions where the opposition when in government was asked to support small business but was nowhere to be seen—MIA. When the GST came in, these people who lecture us about cutting red tape, cutting bureaucracy, consigned all these small businesses to business activity statements—the thing that drives small business nuts. Small businesses still complain about it when I talk with them in the electorate of Chifley.


The member for Hughes went on with his celebrated term 'ACCC storm-troopers'. He talked about how the ACCC was being given powers to clamp down on prices and gouging that might occur with the introduction of the carbon price. Guess what! Just take the time to review recent history. Go and look at the new tax system and see what happened at the time the GST was introduced. The ACCC was given powers to clamp down on businesses that were attempting to rip off the public and to ensure that the GST was passed through fairly. Your side of politics started it, my friend. Your side of politics did it. It was the right thing to do then just as it is the right thing to do now.


Peter Costello, the former member for Higgins, was given recommendation after recommendation on what he should do to improve the Trade Practices Act, on what should be done to protect small business from things like predatory pricing and things like creeping acquisition.



Mr Craig Kelly interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Hughes has had an opportunity to contribute. He will be somewhat more restrained.




Mr HUSIC:
  The former Treasurer was given heaps of opportunity to stand up for small business that was being squeezed by creeping acquisition. It was being squeezed by big businesses pricing deliberately in a way to squeeze out small business. Did you ever stand up for small businesses and make TPA reform a priority? No, it took this government to do it. I am proud that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer was heavily involved in the formation of the Australian consumer law, the successor law to the TPA. I am proud of the fact that this government has been involved in championing small business in this way.


The member for Dunkley reached into the MPI vending machine and it was his turn today to get an MPI and talk about small business. The parliamentary secretary and I had to listen to him going on about IP Australia, about patents and about businesses being squeezed by multinationals on patents. Again, this matter has been hanging around for years. Those opposite had a chance to strengthen this and to give teeth to IP Australia. Did they do anything? No, not a zip. In the last month or so we have had the changes to the business names registration act, a great move to ensure that wherever you set up a small business in this country you do not have to wade through paperwork that might be different from state to state, with registration fees that might differ from state to state. We gave strength to the process by including ASIC as the watchdog. We have done all that. It is cooperative federalism at work, and we did it. They never did, but we did—it was done in the last month. And last night we introduced a massive shot in the arm for small business: a $6,500 instant asset tax write-off. That was delivered by a Labor government. It was never, ever given by them and was voted against by them.


They are chopping and changing on policy, one minute saying that they will oppose, for example, the superannuation changes that we have put in, then in the next minute supporting them, and then last night opposing them again. How can small business have any confidence in the member for Dunkley? The member for Dunkley was going around telling us that the world would end because of these changes to superannuation and saying that small business would suffer. Then all of a sudden, without any consultation, the Leader of the Opposition supports the changes to superannuation. What a voice for small business in the frontbench of the opposition when he cannot win on it.




Mr Bradbury:
  He wasn't on the phone call either.




Mr HUSIC:
  Yes, he wasn't on the phone call; thank you to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer for pointing that out. Again, what a great friend to small business, not even listened to by the Leader of the Opposition, and then they jump and dart round saying what they will do for small business.


They are talking down the super reform. We are creating a pool of funds in the national interest: $500 billion of investment funds that will help the economy, help us grow and help business. We have done that. Superannuation is the big reform to help the economy, but it is opposed by them. Yet again, it is Labor having to step up and provide that.




Mr McCormack:
  You're the government!




Mr HUSIC:
  Absolutely we are the government, and we use our time well in helping small business. You talk, we act. We make the decisions. We act. We help out. You sit and oppose. This is an opposition that does not know what it is going to do. For example, when we were putting through the reforms on climate change, and they had a chance to support us on the Steel Transformation Plan Bill, they said, 'We're not going to support that bill because we don't support anything in what the government is doing on climate change.' They then said, 'We don't support the mining tax,' but they managed to find support for superannuation. They leave steelworkers and the steel sector hanging , but when for their own interest they have to support something they are out there doing it. No consistency, no idea, no policy, an absolute sham—they are unable on the big issues that confront this country to get their act together to work out how they are voting. And they are led by a man who did his best Captain Snooze impersonation last night: there on the front bench asleep when the big decisions are being made.



Government members interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  That is right. He is either asleep in here or he is sleeping off a bender from being in the members dining room while we are deciding what to do to save the nation as a result of the global financial crisis. We are doing a great job, because he will trawl around every place he can—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  You don't like it, do you? You can't sit there in silence. Listen, the heat's going to get up a little bit more! What I love is they will go anywhere here and sap confidence out of the local economy by telling everyone how bad things, then the minute that the Leader of the Opposition can get himself on a plane overseas, where no-one is watching, he tells the rest of the world how great Australia is.



Ms Rowland interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  Exactly, he will not tell everyone how well we are doing here, but he will do it over there. When it comes to the big decisions to be made, we make them and then he goes and claims credit. He does not stand up for the decisions here. He does not do the right things.




Ms Rowland:
  Captain Snooze!




Mr HUSIC:
  Captain Snooze will go home to the motherland and tell them how great we are. It is an embarrassment, and do you know what? You can just tell the tide is rising.




Ms Rowland:
  The member for Higgins is onto it!




Mr HUSIC:
  Wow, the member for Higgins! I will give her credit. The member for Higgins is able to do something that their frontbench cannot. The member for Goldstein cannot when he has been overruled on key issues, and he is the shadow finance minister. He cannot do it, but the member for Higgins—wow! She is making it happen. They know they are in trouble. They do not have the ticker. They do not have the brains. They do not have the wherewithal. (Time expired)

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2011-11-23,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (15:58):  I rise today to talk about the difficulties facing small business in this world of increasing taxes that we live in today and to support the members for Dunkley and Hughes. Business is drowning in taxes and bureaucratic red tape. Small businesses have to contend with a lot of issues, but taxes are the forefront in terms of their survival. I refer to federal, state and local taxes. They all add to the bottom line, or detract from it, whatever the case may be, and in the last few years they have been detracting from the bottom line. Small businesses have to contend with corporate tax, land taxes, removal of the ETO, carbon cops and the ACCC, workers compensation, vehicle registration increases, workplace health and safety costs, rates, water and electricity and gas charges, insurance, payroll tax and any of the fees imposed by the federal and state governments, when they should be concentrating on market pressures, which is what being in business is all about. The types of businesses that will be slugged by a carbon tax are huge, especially in country areas. Labour costs are increasing, and small business is crying out under the weight of these taxes.


Let us go back to the start and talk about corporate tax. Not all small businesses are companies. Only one-third of businesses work under a company structure. Two-thirds work as mums and dads under their own trading name and that is about it, so they will not get a tax deduction from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. With the businesses that do work under a company structure, if they have $100,000 net profit they will save $1,000. What a deal! That will soon be swallowed up in other charges, I can tell you that.


Land tax is another issue. If you have a piece of land and the government decides to buy, rebuild or sell land adjoining your property and puts a lot of costs into that property, suddenly the value of your land goes up alongside your neighbour's land and you do not make an extra dollar but you pay land tax. This is an injustice. The removal of the enterprise tax offset has been spoken about by the members for Dunkley and Hughes, but it is a fact that this government will reap $180 million from small business.



An opposition member:  That's a shame.




Mr O'DOWD:
  That is a shame. We do not know how this carbon cop in the ACCC is going to work; but, if they are going to impose legislation where a small business cannot put their prices above one per cent, what are we doing to small business? Do we want them to survive or do we not? I would like the government to explain how that is going to work and what power these carbon cops are going to have. As we stand now, union officials, workplace health and safety, carbon cops and every other cop can just walk into your business and walk straight over the top of you even though you own your own business. You do not own your own business. You have no control over who comes into your—



An opposition member:  Red tape.




Mr O'DOWD:
  Yes. Workers compensation is always on the increase. I can tell you something about workers compensation. It is normally about three or four per cent; but, if you have an accident on your site, they will retrieve whatever money they spent paying the employee until you come back to that three or four per cent. But they do not give you a credit if you do not have an accident. I have been in business for 30 years. I have had one accident—and I am still paying dearly for that—but there is no credit for the other 29 years that never had an accident.


Vehicle registration is another sad story for all small business, especially truck owners. Take a B-double cattle transporting vehicle. These are real stories I tell here today. This happened at a place called Rolleston in my electorate. The whole town was flooded. They had water on the four roads going into Rolleston. He could not move his truck on the main roads for six months. He could not move his truck on the internal roads in the properties for nine months. But his registration for that vehicle was $26,000. He did not make one cent for nine months. This is what small business has to put up with.


The people in my electorate, where roads are very ordinary to say the least, have to pay a luxury tax on vehicles that are over about $69,000. They need a vehicle worth probably $80,000—for example, a Toyota LandCruiser—to get around these roads because a lesser vehicle will just fall to pieces, and yet they are hit with a luxury tax. This is not right.


Workplace health and safety have costs. This issue hits at the heart of small business. We tend to have to follow big business. As we go on, big business in the mines and in other areas of big industry around my area have a driver and a passenger in a ute. This is because, when that ute stops, they do not rely on the handbrake anymore. One person has to get out and chock the wheels. This is what is going on. This falls into a category that rubs off on small business. I witnessed myself at a hotel in Emerald that was on perfectly flat ground a car where all four wheels were chocked. So much for our handbrake system!


Rates are continuing to rise. There are not many council rates that go under CPI. Most of them are over CPI. This again reflects on the bottom line. We do not have to talk too much about water charges, electricity, gas, insurance—we know they go up every year. You can count on it. Payroll tax is a great incentive for business: if you go over a certain figure, you have to pay payroll tax. Superannuation of nine to 12 per cent comes directly out of the bottom line.


I think the Assistant Treasurer should concentrate more on a proper return from our superannuation funds. We all know that superannuation funds over the last 10 years have returned less than five per cent. For the last three years it has probably been a minus figure.



An opposition member:  You get more in a bank account—or at the racecourse!




Mr O'DOWD:
  You do get more in a bank account and at the racecourse. Fees imposed by the federal government add to inflation. It is not small businesses putting their prices up; it is the government charges that create inflation, which then adds to the cost of the article and a lower bottom line for small business. I was in the hotel game. Since getting out of the hotel game hotels have been hit with a fee of around $15,000 in Queensland for no reason. A small hotel in a place like Walloon pays $15,000. So does the Hilton in Brisbane. How can that be?




Mr Ewen Jones:
  The state government needs the money—that's the reason.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The member for Herbert does not appear to be in his seat.




Mr O'DOWD:
  And there is the red tape—you have to supply statistical information to governments and, if you do not fill out the statistics when they want you to, they will ring you up and do you over.




Mr Truss:
  Be unkind.




Mr O'DOWD:
  Yes, very unkind. We have to return respectability and cut out the red tape for small business. If we want them to survive we have to set the right parameters and then let them get on with doing the business they do best. If someone wants to do the paperwork and deal with the red tape, let the bureaucrats do it.

"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (16:08):  I rise today in the House to speak to the motion on the impact of increased taxes on small business. The Gillard Labor government understands the important contribution small businesses make to national prosperity and to supporting jobs. Small business owners take a risk in undertaking new ventures on their own. They work hard to achieve commercial success and deserve support for their entrepreneurship, which contributes so much to the economy and provides so many jobs for Australians. Federal Labor is committed to supporting Australia's small businesses as the global economy recovers so that they can grow to their full potential and continue their immense contribution to Australian prosperity and job creation.


Last night was a big moment in Australian history. The MRRT is a great big win for small business. The government will support Australian jobs and use the mining tax to give a tax cut to every Australian small business. This will help keep unemployment low and ensure more Australians are coming home with a pay cheque every week. I am sure this move will be welcomed by the business community and by those looking for work. I look forward to talking to local businesses in my electorate about this. This builds on the Gillard Labor government's record of creating 750,000 new jobs, low unemployment, and sound financial management.


Our tax package, funded by the proceeds of the MRRT, will give small businesses tax relief, a cash-flow boost and a strong incentive to invest in productive assets and grow jobs. From 1 July next year, small businesses will be able to claim an instant write-off of assets valued up to $6,500, boosting cash flow and removing the need to apply different depreciation schedules. The instant asset write-off is not a cap; it applies to each asset a business buys that is under $6,500.


As a big supporter of small business, I welcome the Gillard Labor government's plan to offer a big tax cut to every small business. We are giving a big tax cut to 2.7 million small businesses—many of them struggling in our patchwork economy. The government recognises the important contribution small businesses make to national prosperity and to creating jobs—and these tax cuts will help them continue to grow and prosper.


Yet those on the other side of the chamber last night voted to rip out major tax relief for 2.7 million Australian small businesses. Mining profits have increased more than 260 per cent over the past decade. BHP's latest annual profit of around $23 billion is almost four times the profit of the country's former highest earners, the banks. We are giving a business tax cut to all Australian businesses, including those that are not in the mining boom fast lane. That will help keep unemployment low, which means more Australians coming home with a pay cheque to look after their families. Every cent raised through the MRRT will be returned to business and the community through tax cuts. This is an important point that often has been lost in the heat of this debate. This is an unprecedented support package proposed by the Labor government that, if the opposition really cared about small business, they would have supported last night instead of sleeping through the whole debate.


This package comes on top of the government's other measure to allow small businesses to write off the first $5,000 on any new motor vehicle purchased from 1 July next year. This landmark tax break will have a significant impact on the cash flow of many thousands of small businesses. It will help many of them to invest in new equipment, which will help improve productivity and provide a boost to the national economy. The new arrangements will also reduce red tape for small businesses, as they will not have to deal with as many depreciation schedules or track the depreciation on so many assets.


Small businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy, providing jobs and adding to our national prosperity. Federal Labor has implemented a number of policies to help Australia's small businesses prosper. We invested $42 million in small business advice and support through small business advisory services located in suburban, rural and regional Australia. We simplified the BAS, business activity statement, and other reporting requirements for small business by implementing standard business reporting for around 70 per cent of small businesses. We created a superannuation clearing house so small businesses can pay their employees' superannuation contributions electronically to Medicare, which distributes the money to employees' chosen super funds free of charge. We helped small businesses go online by providing $14 million to 47 successful applicants to improve their e-commerce capabilities, enabling them to take up the new opportunities offered by the National Broadband Network. We established a permanent voice for small business in the ACCC, through the appointment of a new Small Business Commissioner. The Australian economy continues to outperform other advanced economies. Despite the impact of natural disasters, our economic fundamentals remain strong and our outlook is bright. The government has a clear plan to maximise the opportunities of an economy in transition.


Small businesses make a significant contribution to the Australian economy, accounting for almost half of industry employment and contributing over a third of industry value in 2009-10. We are working with them to support jobs. Small businesses are often the first to feel the effects of an economic downturn and the last to emerge. Federal Labor recognised that helping small business through the global recession was critical to the economy.


An important measure was support for local tradies and the small businesses that supply them, through the Gillard Labor government's Nation Building-Economic Stimulus Plan, for work on schools, housing, roads and local infrastructure projects. Yet those opposite turn up to the openings but vote against these jobs. They did not support business when they really needed it.


The marginal rate of tax was 67c when I started work and it is now 45c. The fact is: no-one likes paying tax, but we need revenue for services. The Liberals, when they were in power, were the highest-taxing government in Australia's history.


We are working hard on freeing up small business owners' time to allow them to get on with the job and making it easier to deal with government. With 2.4 million small businesses operating in Australia, the Gillard Labor government recognises that small business is the backbone of the Australian economy. 


Federal Labor will continue to support small business owners to ensure their entrepreneurship continues to contribute to national prosperity and job creation. That is why we have released a tax plan for our future, which will provide tax breaks and reduce red tape for all small businesses. The MRRT is a great opportunity for this country, and those opposite are on the wrong side of history.


Labor is keeping the economy strong and building a great economic future for all Australians. Only Labor has a plan to keep the whole economy strong—not just the mining sector—a modern economy ready for the future that will create new jobs and new opportunities with no person and no place left behind.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (16:17):  Like most members on this side of the House, I understand the value of small business. Ninety-seven per cent of the businesses in my electorate of Fowler qualify as small businesses—that is, 10,500 businesses. In the past a lot of these people would have been bricklayers, electricians—a whole host of things. They are required to register their business in order to maintain their employment but, nevertheless, small business and independent contractors are one of the fastest areas of growth, particularly in south-west Sydney where I come from. 


One and a half thousand of these small businesses are truck drivers. They are independent contractors, owner drivers. They have set up their businesses. They have gone out like other businesspeople and borrowed capital to set up a business. I do not know if it has caught you by surprise, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, but it has taken a long drawn-out campaign by the Transport Workers Union and other people such as Lindsay Fox to draw attention to this particular category of small business.


I, together with other members in this place, sometimes go and visit the various truck stops we have in our electorates. I have got one down the road called Uncle Leo's. I go in there and have a cup of coffee and a sandwich with the fellas as they are negotiating a truckload of fuel to get themselves home to Queensland. They will go home to Queensland with a truckload of fuel. They are compromising everything: time and themselves with regard to their logbooks and other things. They are trying to make a quid out of their business. That is why people enter into businesses in the first place. 


To date we have seen people's reluctance to grasp the significance of fair rates in the transport industry. These fair rates are not meant to apply to someone who is a day worker working for a trucking organisation; these are for the operators of small businesses.


This significant initiative was introduced by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport today in the second reading of the road safety bill. It is designed to give these people a fighting chance at their business, to make sure they are paid fair rates. Compromise is occurring, which is affecting safety. About 250 deaths occur on the road each year involving heavy vehicles. An accident involving a heavy vehicle normally would have very significant consequences for not simply the drivers of those vehicles but also other road users.


Compromises are being made—compromises in respect of safety; compromises in respect of work practices; and compromises in respect to hours—and I have personally witnessed people negotiating a truckload of fuel to travel from Liverpool back to the Gold Coast, and that would be the cost of freight. If you want to divide up what the cost of freight is, I think it would be pretty cheap by the end of that run.


The other major thing that these truck drivers running their businesses complain bitterly to me about—I know they are not in the aviation industry—is the slot times they are given for arriving to unload their vehicles, and that time can change. They can sit around for anything up to 10 or 14 hours waiting for their slot time, so they become a mobile storage unit. They are out there with their 16-wheelers, with their refrigerated units keeping food cold, and all the rest of it, and they are not getting paid for that. They are given their slot time to arrive. If anything, we are taking an enormous step just in that alone in respect to small business. 


I know that is not the tenor of this debate, which is focusing on what is occurring in the mining industry. Although I have a connection with mining, I am at a loss over this, as are most people in my electorate who do not have any connections with mining. I have had sons do very well out of working in the mining industry. A lot of young people have seen mining as not a bad way of life: getting involved, generating a lot of income over a short time and then going into another business. That is what my son did.




Mr Dutton:
  They can pay more tax.




Mr HAYES:
  What has occurred—the member for Dickson probably agrees with this because I know his electorate well—is we have negotiated with the biggest miners in the country. They have agreed on what the figure should be. They have agreed that they need to make a greater contribution to this country. We are talking about companies that make an after-tax profit of $75 million. We are not talking about someone who has the backside falling out of their pants, struggling to get down their shovel blade down a hole to dig a little deeper. We are talking to people who are making a $75 million after-tax profit. They are the ones who are going to be required to pay. That money will give us the ability to make adjustments to help small business.


I said that 95 per cent of businesses in my electorate are small businesses. Those people can buy a vehicle, whether it is a Commodore or Ford or some other type of vehicle, and apply to have the instant asset write-off of $6,000. We have to contrast that with what the opposition did in government. They had 12 years to look at this.


I was in small business when John Howard promised to cut small business red tape by 50 per cent in the first term of his government. Instead, what did the coalition do? They saddled businesses—



Ms Brodtmann interjecting—




Mr HAYES:
  particularly small businesses—you are right, the member for Canberra—with GST. They certainly saddled it with a greater amount of red tape. I know the amount of work I had to do to find my way through a complex BAS. That is what they delivered to small business. They made it infinitely more difficult for small business to operate in that environment. It took Labor to make and deliver on commitments to small business. As I said at the outset, we know that the fastest growing area in our economy is small business and much of that is independent contractors. They are electricians, plumbers and bricklayers who now require an ABN to get onto various job sites—particularly in Sydney. They had to have an ABN, they had to become a small business, and that is how they got treated. Anyway, these businesses got on and I know many of them have employed apprentices locally. These businesses now have the opportunity to go out there and get that ute. They now have the opportunity to start to expand their business.


The mining tax is going to help facilitate the rise of superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is a great dream for anybody in the workforce. I know that not many of those opposite necessarily reflect people in the workforce but we here do. We understand what it is for working people to have a sound retirement income at the end of their working lives. Moving superannuation to 12 per cent is a true Labor objective, one that we should be proud of delivering. But it does not just come, we have to make things work.


I understand it is difficult for those opposite. I understand that even as late as yesterday they were conflicted on this as part of their party room was going to support the superannuation rise. All except Andrew Robb, at least, were going to support this. They said they were going to support superannuation but they were going to oppose the mining tax. But when the legislation came here last night, I thought at best they would abstain from voting. They could not work it out. We had the Leader of the Opposition sleeping in the front row, being nudged in the ribs. We had the shadow Treasurer sitting at the table, not sure what call make. Then we had the member for Mackellar call for a division and they all voted no to superannuation. I do not know how they are going to explain that in their next round of newsletters. They opposed working Australians getting a genuine Labor objective of an adjustment to 12 per cent superannuation. (Time expired)

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:27):  How refreshing. We have one member over there, the member for Fowler, who is an ex-businessperson. It is very refreshing to see. I wish more of his colleagues understood small business. 



Government members interjecting—




Ms GAMBARO:
  No, they have two. We can count with our hands how many former small business people are on the opposite side, whereas over here we really understand what small business is about. If you have ever run a small business, which I have done in my career, you will know the government has created three taxes and increased many others. What have they done in the last few months? They have brought in a flood tax, a flood levy which will affect businesses, they have brought in a carbon tax and they have brought in a mining resource rent tax. When they are in trouble, the first thing they do is tax small business. They have their heart on their sleeve about how they are for small business and how they care about small business, but all they do is tax them to death. 


Let us talk about some of these particular taxes. I am glad that the member for Fowler talked earlier about when the GST came in. One of the things that the then government did with that tax was to consult widely. I know because I was sitting on the government side of the House when it happened. We consulted widely. We funded organisations and chambers of commerce to fully inform the business community and to provide them with all the information they possibly could. Anyone running a small business knows that the last thing you do when you are in government is to put another tax on them, particularly in the economic climate that we have at the moment. I was running a retail business up until a year and a half ago, when I came back into the parliament. Can I tell you some of the things that happened in my very humble business. I was a humble fishmonger, running a humble fishmonger's business. Can I tell you what your state colleagues did to my humble business: they put up my electricity by 50 per cent. Electricity went up 50 per cent in one quarter. That is after the land tax went up, and I could go on and on and on.



Government members interjecting—




Ms GAMBARO:
  When I stand here and listen to the members opposite, they somehow say—and they are disingenuous in this when they say it—that small businesses do not have to pay for the super; they link it to the mining resource tax. Can I tell you that businesses pay for superannuation. I used to do the wages and I know how that works: businesses pay for superannuation. Let us put that on the table: businesses pay for superannuation. To say that businesses will not have to pay for superannuation is an absolute fallacy. With the company tax rate that is going to be reduced—they played that out—let me just put that on the table as well: most of the businesses in Australia are not incorporated, and they will not even receive the one per cent. All those opposite are doing is taxing business more and more and adding to the difficulty of running a small business.


It is absolutely extraordinary when I listen to the people opposite. They have absolutely no idea of what is involved in running a small business. The members' contributions last night were outstanding to listen to—all this will do is increase and cause an impost to small business. When I listen to some of the members opposite talking about their consultation process, the consultations that have occurred have just been absolutely appalling. They talked to three large miners and did very little about consulting with the other members of the mining sector. They should stand condemned for their lack of consultation.


They have no idea how to run a small business; all they are doing is taxing small business out of existence. It is already a tough time at the moment. Most businesses are doing it tough. I visited a local newsagent in a neighbourhood that I did not think would have difficulty, but they are doing it tough everywhere and they are all complaining about the economic conditions. All those opposite are doing is making it harder and harder for small businesses to survive.

Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm) (16:32):  On behalf of the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests I present the Draft code of conduct for members of parliament: discussion paper, November 2011.


Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.




Ms BURKE:
  by leave—Consideration of a possible code of conduct for federal parliamentarians is not new. As noted in the discussion paper I have presented, such considerations go back as far as 1975. Since then the issue has emerged at various times but has not been brought to fruition. Most recently, the agreements for parliamentary reform that were negotiated as part of the process for formation of minority government in the 43rd Parliament made provision for the implementation of a code of conduct for federal parliamentarians. The agreements also referred to the appointment of a Parliamentary Integrity Commissioner to uphold the code.


In November 2010, the House referred an inquiry into this matter to the committee. While the committee has taken evidence from Australian and international parliamentarians who have experience with codes of conduct —and I want to thank the many people who made themselves available for this important work—it has decided not to reach a concluded view on the merits of adopting a code of conduct, and it now presents its work on the inquiry as a discussion paper. The discussion paper addresses the terms of reference and includes a consideration of the various aspects of such a code. I do not propose to canvass all those aspects, but I would strongly suggest—and actually urge—that all members read this discussion paper to better inform themselves on the issues to do with the code of conduct. Many members of the public are under codes, and it is probably time that parliamentarians gave serious consideration to adopting what has been outlined in the discussion paper.


The only two matters I would refer to relate to the preferred view of the committee if a code of conduct is to proceed. First, the committee considers that it would be preferable for any code of conduct to be broad in nature and to reflect key principles and values as a guide to conduct, rather than being a detailed, prescriptive code. The committee has included a draft paper of possible codes in the discussion paper. Second, the committee considers that it would be preferable for any code of conduct to be adopted by resolution of the House rather than by statute. We do strongly recommend this if it were to come to pass. There was very strong evidence from both the United Kingdom House of Commons and the Canadian House of Commons that a code should be adopted by resolution. A statutory code would open up the interpretation of members' conduct to be subject to scrutiny in the courts. The committee considers it essential that the House itself retains control over its own affairs, including the conduct of its members.


With these comments, I commend the discussion paper for the consideration of members. I thank all the privileges committee members who have been involved in this discussion. We have had some full and frank discussions and I really do thank them for their input. I also would really like to thank particularly David Elder, Claressa Surtees and Laura Gillies for their phenomenal work in establishing this discussion paper. I would ask everyone to give it due consideration. I thank the House.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr RUDD
 (Griffith—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (16:36):  by leave—In July this year I addressed the House on Australia's new aid policy, and our efforts to position Australia as a leading, effective global aid donor. At the time, I promised to regularly update the House on the implementation of the new policy which has aid effectiveness at its core. At the end of this year's parliamentary session, it is timely that I do so today. Next week, I will attend the Global Forum on Aid Effectiveness in South Korea which will review overall effectiveness criteria for the world's total annual aid allocations to the poorest members of the international community.




Purpose of our aid policy



Australia's aid program is an integral part of our broader foreign and security policy objectives. These are to:


maintain our national security;


build our national prosperity; and


act as a good international citizen in building a stable and just international rules based order. Within this framework, the fundamental purpose of Australian aid is to help people overcome poverty. This also serves Australia's national interests by promoting stability and prosperity in our region and beyond. We want to be judged not by how much we spend but by what results we produce—the number of lives we save, the number of children we educate, the number of people we lift out of poverty.




Why we give aid



We give aid because it is a natural expression of Australian values. As a decent people, we believe in a fair go for all. As a people, therefore, we find it unacceptable that, as of today:


1.4 billion people live in extreme poverty;


seven million children die every year from preventable causes; and


67 million children, including 35 million girls, do not receive basic primary level education, not even a day of it.


Poverty, left unaddressed, also causes instability. Of Australia's 24 nearest neighbours, 22 are developing countries. We have a significant national interest in reducing poverty and promoting prosperity and stability in our region and beyond.


Effective aid delivery acts against political and religious radicalisation. It is therefore capable of reducing dangerous, irregular people movements around the world. It is also a powerful weapon against the causes of terrorism.


Effective aid, by building prosperity, also in time builds global trade, which also helps Australian trade and therefore generates jobs. Take for example Malaysia. Malaysia was once a recipient of Australian aid. Malaysia is now Australia's 10th largest trading partner. Therefore, our aid policy is both a reflection of our interests and our values.




Responding to global challenges



Eradicating poverty is therefore not just the right thing to do—it is the smart thing to do. The global community committed, at the turn of the millennium, to lift one billion people out of poverty. We agreed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as the way to measure our progress. This has been a bipartisan commitment in Australia since 2000.


The truth is globally not all pledges that have been made and not all goals that have been agreed upon have been achieved. There have been successes in some areas. We are reducing poverty. School enrolments are rising. But we are struggling in other areas—regrettably on maternal health and child nutrition. The global community can, and must, do more to achieve the goals we have set ourselves. The lives of millions hang in the balance.


Yet what we see around the world is many donor countries cutting back on their aid delivery because of the ongoing flow-on effects of the global financial crisis. And—tragically—these cuts are taking place at the very time when the crisis itself has increased global need in the poorest countries. One exception is the United Kingdom where the Conservative government has committed to reaching 0.7 per cent of gross national income in 2013. Despite considerable budgetary pressure in the UK, its aid is already at 0.56 per cent of GNI—well above Australia's. The reason for this is that the UK government have recognised overseas aid as fundamental to their national interest. As my counterpart Andrew Mitchell says, 'It's not aid from Britain; it's aid for Britain.' I agree with him entirely.




What Australia is doing



When we came to government Australia's aid program was 0.28 per cent of GNI—one of the lowest levels in the OECD. Prior to the 2007 election, as Leader of the Opposition, I committed the Australian Labor Party in government to increase ODA to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2015-16. We currently stand at approximately 0.35 per cent of GNI. This still places us in the bottom third of OECD countries. But when we reach 0.5 per cent, we will be around the average of OECD countries. This is a goal which the opposition has subsequently formally adopted. As the Leader of the Opposition stated in a speech on 21 June 2010: 


I want to make it very clear that the goal of 0.5 per cent of national income in overseas development aid is a bipartisan one.


I further thank my counterpart, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, for her strong personal leadership within the coalition where we have seen occasional attempts to break from this bipartisan position.


The government's new aid policy, An Effective Aid Program for Australia: Making a Real Difference—Delivering Real Results, launched in July 2011, commits us to deliver real and measureable results. The independent review found we had an aid program that, against any international benchmarks, was a good program but one that still could be made better. The new aid policy outlines how our future efforts will be focused on five strategic goals.


The first goal is to save lives—for example, our support to immunising children through the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. Under the coalition government, Australia's support for GAVI in 2006 and 2007 paid for approximately 500,000 children to have vaccinations against diseases such as hepatitis B, yellow fever, meningitis and pneumonia. Building on this, the Labor government supported the immunisation of a further 1.1 million children by the end of 2010. Between 2011 and 2015 Australia alone will support the full immunisation of 7.7 million children around the world—that is, one-third of the Australian population.


Our second strategic goal is the promotion of opportunities for all—through, for example, Australia's recent commitment to the Global Partnership for Education, which will result in over two million more children enrolled and completing school. Again this is a significant, measurable change in the life prospects of young children. Strategic goal No. 3 is supporting sustainable economic development, such as helping improve employment and social protection programs, so that the poorest and most vulnerable receive the support they need—for example, in Indonesia and the Philippines benefiting 107.5 million people by 2015.


Strategic goal No. 4 is effective governance, human rights and law enforcement—for example, by providing counselling and support services to 3,734 women in Fiji subjected to violence over 2009-10 through the Fiji Women's Crisis Centre. That is good work again for Australia to be engaged in. Strategic goal No. 5 is preparing for and responding to disasters and humanitarian crises—such as our recent response to the humanitarian crisis in Libya and the ongoing drought in the Horn of Africa, where Australia, as one of the largest bilateral donors, is working with others to provide food to nearly eight million people affected by drought.


We have also committed to delivering aid efficiently and effectively. As the Brookings Institution has recently confirmed, Australia's aid administration costs are around one-third of a number of comparable donors. That is, our admin costs in the delivery of the aid portfolio programs on the ground, the actual running costs, are one-third that of other comparable donors. This is a very good achievement.


AusAID has a zero tolerance policy on fraud. The potential loss from fraud in 2010-11 is estimated to represent just 0.028 per cent of money appropriated to AusAID last financial year. As I have said elsewhere before, this is considerably lower than that which can be attributed at Centrelink. We will also continue to strengthen the overall accountability of Australia's aid program with the implementation of a rolling four-year cabinet review of the program's overall performance against stated objectives. Nonetheless, we believe there is still more to be done in boosting transparency and accountability for Australia's aid budget.


In July I also stated that the government would further enhance transparency. The government wants Australians to know how their tax dollars are making a real difference in the lives of people in developing countries. That is why today I am launching the new Transparency Charter. As part of this charter, AusAID has today published detailed, current information about what the aid program is delivering in Vanuatu and the Philippines. We will be making available similar information for major partner countries by early next year. Information on all programs will be in this format by the end of 2012. This is a major step forward in making it transparent to the Australian public how their dollars are being spent per program, per country, across the world.


Second, AusAID will routinely publish its internal audit reports as these audits are completed. Starting today, AusAID has published on its website internal administrative audits from four major bilateral country programs—Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, Fiji and Kiribati.


Third, AusAID is making available today strategic direction documents which outline how the aid program will work towards the five strategic goals set out in the new aid policy. These cover practical details of the sectors in which we will work, the challenges we face and what measures of success we will use. We intend to be up front with the Australian community about what has gone right, what might have gone wrong in individual programs and what needs to be improved. And we will welcome feedback from the Australian public.


I believe this is critical to building long-term consensus about an expanding Australian aid budget into the future, and to absolutely be in a position to assure the Australian public that their hard earned taxpayer dollars are being properly invested and delivering real and measurable results. I welcome this transparency initiative.




Progress in Implementation



We are progressing the 38 recommendations agreed or agreed in principle as part of the Independent Review of Aid Effectiveness. Of those 38 recommendations, 26 have already been implemented. One is being further considered by government. Implementation of 11 recommendations is progressing. This includes, for example, harnessing the power and innovation of Australian business. To this end, in June 2012, AusAID will hold its first annual consultative forum with Australian business. The 2011 Australian of the Year, Simon McKeon, as well as representatives from peak business groups and civil society, are helping us prepare for the forum. Its purpose is to consider how AusAID partners with the Australian business community better in delivering critical programs—for example, in such areas as microfinance.


To reiterate, Australia's aid program is a solid investment. We are achieving results. Our results and our returns are measurable. Over the last four years, Australia has:


In Oruzgan province in Afghanistan, provided basic health and hygiene education to more than 7,900 primary school kids, 34 per cent of whom are girls.


In East Timor, contributed to over 149,000 people gaining access to new and improved water systems.


Worked with the government of Papua New Guinea to maintain 2,000 kilometres of roads allowing rural populations to access basic health and education services.


In Vietnam, provided 83 per cent of its rural population with access to clean water and 58 per cent with access to hygienic latrines by the end of 2011.


I am proud to say that Australia is on track to meet the 0.5 per cent bipartisan commitment by 2015. With this investment, we will continue to build on the gains we have made in reducing poverty and furthering Australia's national interest. As I stated earlier, it is not just the right thing to do—it is the smart thing too. It is consistent with Australia's values. It is consistent with Australia's interests.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to speak for 13 minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr RUDD:
  I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 13 minutes.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2011-11-23,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:50):  At the last election the coalition announced a policy to hold an independent review into Australia's foreign aid program with a view to improving its effectiveness, to ensuring its sustainability and to addressing a number of serious problems. We had become concerned about ongoing reports of waste, mismanagement, extravagant salaries for consultants and questionable priorities in the application of the aid budget. The use of highly paid consultants had led political leaders of other countries to raise their concerns with us and one had, in fact, dubbed it 'boomerang aid' in that the benefits were largely returned to Australia by the consultancies.


Over several years, in fact, I had asked the leaders of nations in receipt of Australian aid about their impressions of its effectiveness and its delivery. While greatly appreciative of Australian support, the vast majority also raised a number of concerns including: an over-reliance on highly paid consultants; the production of elaborate and expensive feasibility studies that did not then translate into an actual project; well-meaning although naive people working to deliver the aid; a rapid turnover of staff that prevented the building and maintenance of long-term relationships; overly bureaucratic approaches that hampered effectiveness; and the aid effort spread too thinly across too many sectors.


The Australian National Audit Office reported on the foreign aid program in November 2009 and raised concerns about the heavy reliance on technical assistance which often involved highly paid consultants to provide advice and support in recipient countries. The ANAO report found almost double the proportion of the Australian aid budget was spent on consultants compared with the OECD average. It also raised concerns about the ability of AusAID to effectively manage large increases in the aid budget. That is why it was coalition policy to hold an independent inquiry into the aid budget and that is why the coalition supported the adoption by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in late 2010 of our policy to hold a review into the aid program. The report from that review was released in July this year and the review noted problems that if they were not addressed would become more serious as: 


Australia's aid operation, already under strain, comes under the increased pressure of ramping up over the next five years to achieve the target of 0.5 per cent of Gross National Income. They range from lack of a unified sense of strategic purpose across government through the need to reform the government's budget processes to the dangers of fragmentation and stretching the program too thin to the need for greater public involvement and transparency.


I do pay credit to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for taking steps to improve the program. In May 2010, the minister announced a review of technical advisers, which recommended a reduction in these positions. Further to that review, the minister also took steps to reduce the remuneration packages by imposing caps on salaries and allowances. These are important steps.


Australians are generous people and often donate large sums of money to assist those in need not only here but overseas. Millions of dollars are donated annually to various charities, including those to support disadvantaged people, medical research, communities affected by natural disaster and much more. Australians are very generous supporters of developing nations, both personally and as taxpayers through our foreign aid program. One of the key questions often asked of organisations that collect and manage funds is about the amount of money that actually gets through to those in need. Those donating money do not want an unreasonable proportion of their funds spent on administration or on things that do not deliver tangible benefits. 


I have long argued that Australia's foreign aid program must be carefully targeted to ensure that it does not damage local economies and that it does not lead to dependency but rather to self-sufficiency. The aid budget should be focused on helping people in developing nations achieve long-term and sustainable self-sufficiency. That said, the challenges in many developing countries are huge and support must be ongoing if genuine change is to be achieved. Aid for Trade, for example, is not just a concept; it can be a reality. During a recent visit to Papua New Guinea, I visited a small business in Port Moresby that used a grant from the Enterprise Challenge Fund, established by the Howard government in 2007, to purchase food processing equipment from India and set up a spice and oils export business. It supports hundreds of growers and their families and the local community. This is just one example of how an innovative approach to the provision of foreign aid can support economic development that benefits people in those countries.


Providing access to capital is ultimately a job for the private sector, but our aid program can fill a gap as the business sector in a particular country matures. Other avenues outside government channels such as churches, local community groups and non-government organisations must also be leveraged. The challenge, as the foreign minister said, is not just to spend more money but to spend it effectively. In order to achieve greater effectiveness and efficiency in our aid program there is a real need for innovative thinking, creative ideas and an openness to new approaches. This can mean building on current practices by doing the same things differently, as well as initiating and implementing entirely new approaches by doing different things. Health and medical services in developing countries, as an example, can often be difficult to deliver because of poor infrastructure and support services, particularly in remote locations. The scale of providing health services in Papua New Guinea, for example, is evidenced by the fact that it is reported that only 33 dentists are located in a nation of more than six million people, a nation that is the largest recipient of Australian aid. 


An example of an innovative and effective initiative in Papua New Guinea, not funded by AusAID, is the Youth with a Mission medical ship based out of Townsville. The model of a floating, self-contained vessel overcomes many of the traditional challenges of delivering services into remote areas, including issues relating to staff security and the accommodation of medical support. The ship is largely staffed by volunteers and operates with the support of private donations. It has sailed to 16 remote villages located in the gulf province and the volunteers have provided more than 15,000 instances of care and support during the past two years. This has included more than 2,000 dental treatments, over 1,500 services relating to eyesight, including cataract surgery, and more than 1,600 general medical treatments and thousands of educational and health support services. The overwhelming success of this vessel has led to plans for the current ship to be replaced with a much larger one from about 2015. A larger vessel would not only provide the capability for many more medical services but also mean it would be available for disaster relief in a region where cyclones and earthquakes have caused significant damage and loss of life in the past. It is a faith based organisation and it is seeking funding support from the federal government for the first time and the coalition is giving in-principle support to the proposal.


Another innovative approach in the delivery of educational services into Africa has been developed by Korean electronics company Samsung, which has built a prototype classroom out of a 12-metre shipping container. It is equipped with laptops, an electronic whiteboard, video cameras and other electronic teaching aids. Importantly, the self-contained classroom operates 100 per cent on solar power and can be delivered on the back of a truck to remote locations far from any electricity grid. The company has a goal of improving the lives of five million people in Africa by 2015. 


These are just some of the hundreds of examples from around the world of organisations and individuals taking an innovative approach to the challenge of development assistance. With the ever-changing nature of the world, underpinned by technological and other developments, those who manage the delivery of Australia's aid program must remain alert to opportunities to embrace greater innovation, new ways of thinking and new approaches.


The independent review commissioned by the government produced a commendable report that included 39 recommendations for reform. I note from the foreign minister's speech that the government is progressing 38 recommendations. This is a pointed omission and of great concern. The government's response to the review seems to ignore, arguably, the most important recommendation, the 39th, which states 'the scale up of the aid program to 0.5 per cent of GNI should be subject to the progressive achievement of predetermined hurdles'. Yet the minister appears to have ignored that recommendation in his speech today. More specifically, the independent review warned that forecast increases in the aid budget are 'steep and challenging' and that strict annual performance benchmarks must be passed before AusAID receives funding increases. The report said:


It is sensible to recognise that the upward trajectory to 0.5 per cent of GNI is steep and challenging. It makes sense that budget appropriations each year be contingent on things going to plan and existing monies being spent effectively … failure to achieve a hurdle, or to fully achieve it, must have consequences. For example, the government could reduce the rate of increase or withhold all or part of the funding unless and until the hurdle is achieved.


At the time of the release of the report earlier this year I called on the foreign minister to detail the nature of the performance benchmarks that AusAID will be required to meet, how it will be measured against those benchmarks and the consequences of failure to meet its performance targets.


The ongoing failure of the minister, with the greatest respect, to respond to this clear recommendation raises questions about the government's commitment to ensuring the highest possible standards for our foreign aid program. I again request that the minister make a formal response to this recommendation, No. 39, and establish performance benchmarks for AusAID. The forecast increases in the aid budget can only be sustained if the public are convinced their funds are being used effectively, and the imposition of performance benchmarks is the most appropriate means of achieving higher levels of accountability and public consensus, according to the independent review.


My concern is that critics of the foreign aid program will use this failure as evidence of acquiescence to the problems, including endemic waste and mismanagement within the program. I note that the recommendation requiring that the major focus of the foreign aid budget remain on areas of Australia's national interest, primarily in our region, is consistent with longstanding coalition policy. Again, this raises an issue of concern about the aid program in that the government has directed a greater proportion of the funding away from our region. The coalition is concerned that the aid budget is being distorted to support the minister's personal campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council.


While there is great need in Africa and Central and South America, for there is assuredly poverty, the coalition believes that expanding into these regions at such a rapid rate risks spreading our effort too thinly. There are huge challenges in the Pacific and in Asia, where billions of people live in poverty. Many Pacific nations rank poorly on the United Nations human development index, and certainly lower than the vast majority of nations in Central and South America.


The World Bank reports that in 2009 total foreign aid flows into various regions on a per capita basis were: US$53.50, Sub-Saharan Africa; US$41.70, Middle East and North Africa; US$20.10, Europe and Central Asia; US$15.80, Latin America and Caribbean; US$9.40, South Asia; but—note this—US$5.30, East Asia and the Pacific—our region, our sphere of responsibility, the area where we can make the biggest difference. Nations with a historic responsibility for various regions are providing significant resources. It is clear that Asia and the Pacific need the clear attention of nations, including Australia, given the significantly lower flows of foreign aid per person.


I pay credit to the foreign minister for taking concerns about the aid program seriously and for taking steps to reduce waste, and for adopting coalition policy by instituting the Independent Review of Aid Effectiveness. However, I urge him to adopt all the recommendations of that review so that public confidence in the large aid program can be maintained. (Time expired)

For teenage parents who live in one of the 10 identified areas of disadvantage, there will be a 3½-year trial starting on 1 January 2012, requiring those who receive parenting payments to develop and sign an Employment Pathway Plan. There will be a separate three-year trial commencing on 1 July 2012, requiring certain jobless family members who are receiving parenting payment to develop and sign an Employment Pathway Plan.


The government announced the introduction of these participation pilots for teenage parents in the 2011-12 budget and it is believed that this measure will cost in the order of $47.1 million and will be rolled out across 10 areas of high disadvantage. These areas include: Playford in South Australia; Hume and Shepparton in Victoria; Burnie in Tasmania; Bankstown, Wyong and Shellharbour in New South Wales; Rockhampton and Logan in Queensland; and Kwinana in Western Australia.


As the federal member for Solomon, I am disappointed that the Northern Territory has been overlooked. Yet again, the Northern Territory is not getting the attention it deserves and, quite frankly, I am sick and tired of the government treating the Northern Territory with contempt. Statistics from the Parliamentary Library show birth rates to teenagers in the Northern Territory are consistently higher than the national average. Fertility rates for Territory teenage girls are also among the highest in the country. This concerns me, because teenage pregnancies are usually associated with many social issues, such as higher rates of debt and lower educational levels. Being a parent can make it harder to get a job or find a job. The difficulty of juggling being a parent with school, work and family can also be a strain. Often getting child care can be difficult too because of the expense involved. These factors can often lead to parents feeling inadequate, lonely and not part of a family. 


Smoking, drinking and drug use are also big factors and can also break down the relationship between the young mother and her own parents. One Australian study claims that, while 49 per cent of pregnant teenagers were living with their parents before pregnancy, only 30 per cent lived at home during the pregnancy. Stress and the realisation of becoming a young parent also cause problems and sometimes result in unwanted children and broken families. In some cases, too, the grandparents are forced to care for the children, and, with no government assistance in place to support this, how will they be supported?


Currently there are more than 11,000 teenage parents in Australia. According to the ABS, the age-specific fertility rate of women aged 15 to 19 years in the Northern Territory in 2010 was 48.1 per cent. The national average that same year was 15.5 per cent. Indigenous teenagers also have a fertility rate twice that of all teenage women in the Northern Territory. This is of great concern because, without the opportunity to complete their education, these teenagers may become trapped in a cycle of welfare dependency and could disadvantage not only themselves but also their children. Therefore, births to Indigenous teenagers in remote and disadvantaged areas of the Territory are of great concern. According to ABS statistics, for Indigenous women in 2004 the teenage fertility rate of 71 babies per 1,000 women was more than four times the fertility rate of all teenage women—16 babies. 


Because we have a much younger population than any other population in Australia, this is an ongoing challenge. Coupled with the life expectancy gap, we need to acknowledge child health and youth services in rural and remote areas of the NT to deal with sexually active teenagers. This bill will require teenage parents to enter into an Employment Pathways Plan with Centrelink once their youngest child turns six months. The aim is to re-engage them with study as early as possible to prevent their long-term disadvantage. Once their youngest child turns six months old, they will be required to attend a Centrelink appointment and will need to enter into a plan to see them resume study and develop a plan for healthy early development and education outcomes for their child.


Education and health are extremely important to me in Solomon. In fact, recently I was fortunate enough to meet members of the Top End girls academy. The girls academy initiative was created with the aim of improving educational, personal and employment outcomes for Indigenous secondary school females. The program provides a strong community with supportive programs so that all members work towards completion of year 12, employment or further education. This is one such initiative that is proving successful for young Territory women. 


Ultimately, for this pilot to succeed there needs to be a focus on workforce participation and an enforcement of the obligations of the job seeker. Yet the only penalties that apply are when a job seeker fails to meet with Centrelink without a reasonable excuse. Whilst the legislation does require parents to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan to outline their employment, training and education and health outcomes for their child, there will be no requirement for them to comply with this plan and it will not be compulsory for them to commit to looking for or accepting employment or undertaking further study. Therefore, our amendment will seek to require compliance with the undertakings given in the employment pathway plan. Failure to adhere to these commitments would result in a suspension of payment. As with the teenage pilot, the jobless families trial was a commitment made in the 2011-12 budget.


The jobless families trial program targets parenting payment recipients who have been on income support for more than two years or those who are under 23 years of age, not working or studying and have a youngest child under six years of age. According to 2011 ABS statistics, more than 530,000 Australian children under 15 live with parents who do not work. Again, this can lead to serious disadvantage for the child and may ingrain a sense of welfare dependency. This also puts added pressure on housing affordability and the Northern Territory is already in the midst of a housing shortage.


Too many young families are struggling to find affordable homes and accommodation in my electorate. As a result, they are being forced to leave the Territory and seek more affordable options interstate. This is why the government should make use of the 200-plus vacant RAAF base houses sitting in Eaton rotting away. Instead, the Gillard Labor government ignores the will of the parliament. It should make these houses available to Territorians and it should do it now. Having an extra 200-plus houses available in the market would alleviate some of the pressure on young families in my electorate. Defence people assure me that they would love the opportunity to live in those houses. Unfortunately, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Snowdon, did not do what he previously agreed and that was to offer those houses to Defence families. I understand he is no longer the minister responsible for that, but I am hoping the new minister responsible will honour the will of the parliament and make those houses available.


While the Northern Territory has relatively low unemployment levels, ABS statistics reveal there are currently around 96,000 jobless couples with children as well as 210,000 single parents out of work across the nation. Indigenous children are most at risk, with more than 40 per cent living in jobless families—nearly three times the rate of other children. Parliamentary Library statistics show that the Northern Territory has the lowest rate of student participation in schooling of all states and territories. These rates are also lower for Indigenous students and students in remote and very remote areas. School attendance is closely linked to socioeconomic status, locality, Indigenous status and literacy and numeracy attainment.


The coalition supports attempts to have parents re-engage with the workforce early; however, this bill does not require parents to adhere to the commitments they make in their employment pathway plan. The coalition has concerns that this bill seeks to remove the provision for the secretary to intervene in exceptional circumstances, and that is why we will move amendmentsto this bill in the Senate.


Ultimately, the intention of these pilots is to increase engagement with education and employment opportunities, preventing future intergenerational unemployment and potential lifelong disadvantage. The coalition welcomes the intent of these pilots to encourage engagement; however, there are still some concerns. Whilst we acknowledge there are parents whose children are under six years of age and, as such, they should not be forced to look for a job, there should still be a recognised compliance regime. If they commit to further studies or to look for employment then they should be required to comply with these undertakings. As already indicated, the coalition supports the bill; however, we will be moving some amendments.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:18):  In 1981 a young woman found that she was pregnant at 16. After confirming the pregnancy and breaking the news to her mum, she attended school until the baby was nearly due. Although her mother was supportive and encouraged her to go back to school, the young woman decided it was too hard to commence year 12 with a young infant. Having already completed her year 11 studies, she eventually enrolled in a TAFE course and began a diploma in child care, part time. Now 45, with two children, she has a successful career in the early childhood sector running childcare centres in Melbourne. She also helps pregnant women who are not so lucky, in particular teenage mothers. Her daughter, now 29, is married with two children of her own. This story was told anonymously online by the woman herself to encourage teenage mothers never to give up. It shows why attaining year 12 or its equivalent is so important for teenage parents.


The number of teenage mothers in Australia has dropped significantly over recent decades. The most recent ABS data shows just four per cent of births were to teen mothers. But the outcomes of this small group are still worrying. In the 2006 census only 17 per cent of teenage mothers completed year 12. Over 1,500 females aged 15 to 19 years were not gaining the level of education that is increasingly essential for the demands of a 21st century workforce.


In June of this year the National Centre for Vocational Education Research released a report titled From education to employment: how long does it take? The centre found that young people who do not finish year 12 take significantly longer to move into employment. The prime factor influencing the speed at which a young person obtains work after they leave the education sector was their level of education. The report also found strong gender differences. For men, those with a degree obtained work five times faster than those who did not complete year 12. For women, those with a degree obtained work eight times faster. The unequivocal message from this report is that education is vital. For a young person entering the labour market, higher levels of education lead to better wages and to getting a job faster. In a worrying statistic, about one-quarter of the young people sampled with less than a year 12 education had not obtained any work by the end of the observation period. This is a serious warning for the long-term prospects of younger Australians who do not have year 12 or its equivalent. This prognosis for the career development and income levels of those young people is grim. This bill heeds that warning and puts in place a program for teenage parents to work towards attaining year 12 or its equivalent. From 1 January 2012, teenage parents in 10 disadvantaged locations with a youngest child under six who receive parenting payment and have not completed year 12 or an equivalent qualification will be required to attend Centrelink to develop a participation plan. Under the teenage parents trial, participants will be required to undertake compulsory activities from when their child is one year old. This will give them time to settle into life with a new baby; but, equally important, they will be able to develop a plan towards gaining a good education.


Education is the best antipoverty vaccine we have yet invented. It provides the foundations from which a young person can build a life of their choosing from the career opportunities and skills development that it brings. This government gets it. We understand that education is good social policy, that unemployment is the best predictor of disadvantage and that having the skills for the jobs of the future is essential to staying out of poverty. Although it was based on children and families in the United Kingdom, a recent Four Corners program made this point. It showed the human face, the cost and devastating impact of poverty on children.


One story was of Sam, who is 11 years old and lives in Leicester with his dad and older sister. Sam's dad is unemployed and struggles with finding enough money to buy food or to operate the electricity. Their income is £70 to £80 a week, which is barely enough to buy them the basics. Often the electricity and gas run out, leaving them cold and miserable. Sam has problems with bullying and suffers from low self-esteem. He has to be careful about what he says to other students for fear he will be judged and ridiculed. As Sam said, 'People don't like you if you're poor.'


This bill puts supports in place to cut the cycle of unemployment and poverty through education. I am sure that no-one in this place wants to see any child suffer, like Sam, the indignity of poverty. A great education in Australia can see a child from Cape York go to university, become a leader in her community and eventually become Young Australian of the Year. A great education means that a child from Ilfracombe can become the first female member of the Queensland bar and our first female Governor-General. This national parliament is itself a showcase of the opportunities that education provides to children from all corners of the nation. So many members of this House acknowledged in their first speeches that they would not be here today were it not for a great education.


The Brotherhood of St Laurence tells the story of another Sam. Forty years old, Sam has been working with the local council's road services department for the past 18 months. Now Sam's life is settled, he has safe, stable accommodation and is working towards future employment goals—but it has not always been that way. In 2009 Sam was living in a rooming house where violence was commonplace and the environment unsanitary. Through the Centre for Work and Learning at the Brotherhood of St Laurence, he was chosen to join a pre-employment training program. Sam successfully completed the training and was picked up as a trainee street cleaner with the local council. Having a steady income and taking control of his finances meant that Sam was finally able to renew his drivers licence. After he completed his traineeship he was linked to a recruitment agency used by the local council, and now enjoys a regular job. 'I really want to use my brain,' says Sam, when he is asked about his plans to work with youth and when he talks about becoming a teacher.


The other part of this bill focuses on families at risk of long-term unemployment. The aim of the jobless families trial is to break cycles of unemployment. For parents with children under school age, they will be required to develop a plan for re-entering the workforce once their youngest child starts school. Their Employment Pathway Plan can also include activities focusing on the health, wellbeing and education of their children. Because this government gets it, we are making sure children in families of risk are 'school ready' to make the most of their educational opportunities.


On a definition of poverty as households with less than 50 per cent of the median income, the OECD Family Database finds that 14 per cent of Australian children live in poverty. That is too many. This is why we are taking action with this bill and trialling these programs to support those at risk of long periods of unemployment and its lasting effects.


Recently the Economist magazine reported on the impact of unemployment in Western nations. Noting the scale of joblessness in the West, it pointed out that if all unemployed people lived in one country, it would have a population similar to that of Spain. By comparison, Australia's economy and our low levels of unemployment are the envy of other Western nations. We still have our own areas of stubbornly high unemployment, those pockets of disadvantage and of generational cycles of joblessness. For those Australians caught in those cycles of unemployment and disadvantage, or at risk of falling into those cycles, the human cost is all too real. Joblessness can lead to increases in depression, divorce, substance abuse, family breakdown and life's other troubles.


A 2007 study, 'Unemployment and Psychological Well-being', by Nick Carroll of the ANU, found that the adverse effects of unemployment on life satisfaction was large and significant. Not having a job was a much better predictor of having low life satisfaction than simply having a low income. Past unemployment also had a similar adverse effect, suggesting that unemployment had left long-term scars.


Internationally, there is substantial joblessness around the world, and we know that the longer a young person spends being unemployed, the greater that scarring effect is. In the United States, the average period of joblessness is now up to 40 weeks—an increase from only 17 weeks four years ago. In Italy, a person who is unemployed has, on average, been jobless for more than a year. The more detached people become from the workforce, the more their skills atrophy, the more their self-esteem drops, making it harder to re-enter the labour force, particularly a labour force that is moving on. That leaves countries with lower growth rates, putting strains on public finances and on the social fabric. 


It is a grim picture, but it is important to understand the full impact that long-term unemployment has on individuals, communities and nations. That is why education is so important to prepare and equip people for the workforce of tomorrow, to safeguard them against the detrimental effects of unemployment. I know the power of education and the dignity of work have been at the heart of the agenda of the Rudd and Gillard governments. This is one of the reasons that I ran for parliament and it is central to what we on this side of the House believe in. There are still too many Australians who live in circumstances of entrenched disadvantage. Too many Australian children are in families where their parents and grandparents have not known regular employment. They deserve to know the dignity of work, and they can benefit from the habits that arise from growing up in a household where an alarm clock goes off in the morning and someone goes off to a dignified job.


As the Prime Minister said in her address to the Sydney Institute earlier this year:


The party I lead is—politically, spiritually, even literally—the party of work … the party of opportunity not exclusion.


Welfare reform and workforce participation is where progressive policy and Labor values come together.


Not everyone can make it on their own. Sometimes the odds are stacked against people. We on this side of the House are committed to putting the odds back in their favour. This bill harnesses the transformative power of education to provide opportunities for some our most disadvantaged communities. This is what a government should do and this is what this Labor government is doing.


Recently the Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures showing that in June this year there were 96,000 jobless couple families and 210,000 jobless single parent families. Of these single parent families looking for work, 23 per cent had been jobless for more than a year. For those teenage parents and families experiencing long-term unemployment in Playford, Hume, Shepparton, Burnie, Bankstown, Wyong and the other trial regions, this government knows that in this place we have a responsibility to ensure that they are part of Australia's productivity, our economic fabric and our social wellbeing now and into the future. I commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:31):  In may this year the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer of Australia delivered his fourth budget, and as a part of that budget he announced a $4 billion investment in skills development over the forward estimates. He did that because our government understands that over the next three years there is going to be an escalating demand for skilled workers as our economy continues to grow. At the same time, we realise that we have an obligation as a Labor government to ensure that we do not leave anybody behind as the economy and the demand for skilled workers grow.


At any point in time there are over 11,000 teenage parents on parenting payments in Australia. More than 90 per cent of these do not have a year 12 or equivalent education. In my own electorate I see this all too often. There are suburbs where we have intergenerational unemployment where nobody within the household or family has completed a year 12 or equivalent education. This devastating combination of low education attainment and parenting responsibilities at a young age contributes to long-term unemployment and welfare dependency.


There are no easy answers in responding to this challenge, but one thing we do know is that we do not do any favours to anyone if we do not tell them the truth, and the truth, quite simply, is that there is a direct link between your educational attainment—whether you have finished high school or not—and your chances of being unemployed in your twenties and thirties. That is why this government's approach involves a combination of intensive assistance and stronger reciprocal obligations, taking a local approach to finding solutions to work and education retention.


As a government with Labor values of fairness and equity at our heart, our ministers have set about working on a range of policies to give effect to a strong social inclusion agenda. In a broad range of policy areas across many portfolios measures dealing with mental health, disability services, pension reforms, boosts to superannuation savings, paid parental leave, early childhood education, better access to university courses for low-socioeconomic students, social housing initiatives, the Closing the Gap program, our multicultural program, not to mention the Fair Work Act, our support for the equal pay case and many other measures, the measures in this bill form a part of that overall social inclusion agenda. They are core Labor values.


The bill before the House today implements the teen parents trial measure that was announced in the May budget as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package and is yet another important plank in the social inclusion agenda. Teen parents in 10 sites around Australia will be provided with intensive support and assistance to boost their education, job readiness and family wellbeing. I am very pleased, given the observations I have made about some of the areas within my electorate which are very similar to areas within your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, that the Shellharbour Local Government Area, a part of my electorate, has been selected as one of the 10 trial sites for the teen parent initiative. These 10 sites were chosen because they are currently areas of higher-than-average social disadvantage. Shellharbour has a higher-than-average number of people receiving income support, a higher-than-national-average number of teenage parents and lower-than-national-average levels of educational attainment for these groups.


The measures in this bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to provide a clear legislative basis to implement the compulsory requirements for parents on parenting payments who are in the trials to attend Centrelink appointments for the purpose of discussing and entering into an employment pathway plan. For teenage parents there will be a 3½-year trial commencing on 1 January next year that will apply to teen parents with a youngest child under six years of age who are receiving a parenting payment, who are 19 years of age or under, who have not completed year 12 or equivalent and who reside in one of the 10 locations that I have already identified. Once the youngest child turns one they will be required to attend Centrelink to discuss and develop a participation plan that focuses on their education completion and early health and education outcomes for their child. They will also need to agree to comply with the plan, which will be supported by a range of extra services in those locations.


The jobless family measures will consist of a three-year trial commencing on 1 July 2012 that will apply to parenting payment recipients with a youngest child under six years of age who have been on income support for two years or more or who are under 23 years of age and are not working and/or studying and who reside in one of the 10 locations that I have already mentioned. Parents will be required to attend interviews and workshops with Centrelink, where they will develop a plan that focuses on job preparation for themselves and, again, early health and education outcomes for their child.


The amendments in this bill broaden participation requirements and compliance sanctions to parenting payment recipients with children under six who are part of the teenage parent or jobless families trials operating in 10 disadvantaged locations. The provisions in this bill will not apply to parenting payment recipients who are not part of these trials.


I am pleased to take this opportunity to note some of the developments in my own electorate in preparation for these trials. Last month I had the pleasure of welcoming the Minister for Human Services, Tanya Plibersek, to my electorate to announce that Barnardos Australia, who currently operate some successful programs on behalf of the department in Warrawong, will receive over half a million dollars in additional funding over three years to expand the highly effective Communities for Children service in the Shellharbour local government area.


I was delighted to join staff from Barnardos Australia, parents and kids at a local play group, in Hegarty Park in Albion Park, which is funded through the Communities for Children program, to share this news and discuss the program with some of the participants. On that day I had many conversations with young teen parents, many of whom are participating in one of the innovative programs run by Barnardos Australia called Talking Realities. In this program young teen mums are trained up to become mentors. They go into schools and talk to young women and men about the realities of being a teenage mum. They also have one-on-one discussions with young women who have fallen pregnant about the things that they can anticipate as their pregnancy develops and in the early years after their child is born. It is an important initiative which is about transferring life knowledge and real skills and providing mentorship and support to these young women, many of whom do not get the same sort of mentorship or support from either their school or their family.


The new funding will focus on services that support teenage parents and jobless families who are part of the teen parents trial in Shellharbour. Barnardos Australia is working with local parents to build their parenting skills and to improve children's health and early learning outcomes. Communities for Children services in other areas have helped to change the lives of parents and children—with marked improvements in children's language skills, with parents getting support to find work and with mothers getting more involved in their local community. There is no doubt that the Shellharbour community will benefit from the boost to family and children's services, as well as this new and novel approach to delivering welfare services. It is quite simply a great initiative.


The expanded program will allow Barnardos to continue the great work that they are already doing supporting families in our community. Barnardos have delivered, through eight community partners, services and programs including food and nutrition, play activities such as circus skills, parenting support services and information DVDs, as well as a community garden.


Over the past six months, these local based initiatives have provided support to over 300 people, including 23 young parents and 600 children and young people, to help builder stronger and healthier relationships while improving parenting practices and increasing children's wellbeing. They add to and help provide additional support to the requirements and reciprocal obligations contained within the legislation before the House.


While our economy is strong, we know that some areas are falling behind the rest of the country. We know that, within these areas, there are specific groups of disadvantage and that teen parents are one of these groups. High unemployment rates, low educational attainment, welfare dependency and families at risk are the characteristics of social disadvantage in our community. If you are born into disadvantage, it is tough to break out of it and to find the support and assistance tailored to your own situation and personal circumstances that will provide the hand up to help you develop and reach your potential. When you meet and talk to these young mums you understand that inside each and every one of them there is potential. We cannot give up on these people. More importantly, we cannot allow our society to give up on their children and continue the cycle of disadvantage.


Australia's remarkable economic strength and the current mining boom have afforded this country and this government the opportunity to deal with some tough issues like these pockets of social disadvantage. Labor's approach, the Labor way, is to ensure that the mining boom provides benefits for all Australians. We do not want to leave anyone behind as we reap the benefits of our good fortune from our wealth of natural resources. That is why it is vitally important that we take the opportunity in our current economic circumstances to find new ways to break the cycle of welfare dependence.


Labor's aim is to ensure that our children are not growing up in families where no parent or grandparent has ever known work, where there is no memory of a working family member within those households. We want to create a culture of work, of life fulfilment and of economic and social participation, with the benefits that flow from this. Australia has an unacceptably high number of jobless families. While Australia has relatively high workforce participation rates and low levels of unemployment, by international standards the number of jobless families is still too high. There are currently over 250,000 families with dependent children in which neither parent is working. Over half of these families have been experiencing ongoing unemployment for three years or more.


Employment is the surest path out of poverty for every member of a family. That is because kids who grow up in jobless families are more likely to be unemployed as adults. The place-based programs which are a part of this legislation take advantage of local expertise and conditions rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all model. The place-based approach uses the wisdom and strengths of local communities and allows us to target government efforts towards intergenerational challenges such as low educational attainment, welfare dependency and unemployment.


I know that within my community, which has suffered many challenges over the last 12 months, there still exists a passion to address the issue of intergenerational unemployment and break the nexus between low educational attainment, people falling pregnant too young and having children, and dropping out of school and not completing their high school certificates. If we are able to break this nexus and re-engage these young people with education and with the workforce, we give these young families the opportunity to enjoy and connect themselves to the great opportunities that this country has to offer to everyone. I commend the legislation to the House. It is great Labor legislation. It is the sort of initiative that people expect Labor governments to undertake when we are in power.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-11-23,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:44):  When it comes to this bill the Greens support the aim but not the approach. Accordingly, we oppose this bill and believe that it is unnecessary, ineffective, and further stigmatises young parents. It is clearly the case that nonattendance is a barrier to education and work, but we do not believe that the punitive compliance measures proposed in the bill will be effective in achieving its stated aims. It is not clear if there will be adequate protection for young parents and whether Centerlink staff will receive training on engaging with young parents.


This bill looks like many of the Welfare to Work reforms that were a hallmark of the Howard era where increasingly punitive measures were put in place. Unfortunately, the government appears to be continuing this legacy in part. The Greens opposed these Welfare to Work measures when they were proposed by the Howard government and we oppose them now.


Removing income support is not the way to encourage young parents to work. We must remove the barriers rather than seek to punish. We do not want to make life harder for people on pensions and allowances—many of them are already doing it tough. My electorate has more public housing dwellings than any other electorate in the country, and there are a very high proportion of people who are on pensions and allowances. 


Although my electorate is not directly touched by the measures that have been announced in this bill, the picture that my electorate paints and that I have from engaging with the kinds of people who are referred to in this bill is that many of them are doing it tough. Many of them want to improve their situation but they face significant barriers. 


It is pretty difficult, if you are a parent or a single parent of a young child, to not only look after them but try and find your way back into the workforce or education and training. What is needed is support, not the threat of a bigger stick. In other measures that have been outlined by the government elsewhere, the Greens believe that the eligibility criteria for the disability support pension, the failure to index thresholds and the failure to index supplements have negative effects.


The measures proposed by the government would, we are concerned, create even greater inequity for those on income support in Australia. There is already inequity in the levels of income support that we provide people, given the difference between pensions and allowances; however, this bill will make the inequality worse by imposing additional requirements on these very young and very vulnerable parents.


The measures proposed are disproportionate, given that only 2.5 percent of parenting payment recipients are teenagers, which equates to approximately 11,000 out of 446,000 recipients nationally. This approach is not the best way to deal with such a small and often disempowered group.


The impact of this approach on teenage parents is of particular concern. These parents are some of the most vulnerable people in our society. This approach will not help them to make their lives better but may jeopardise their welfare and that of their children.


The measures in this bill assume that parents will have secure housing arrangements and enough money for the basic necessities of life if their income is suspended. Realistically, education can only be undertaken once these basic needs are met. The Welfare Rights Network and ACOSS also expressed this view, saying:


An initiative designed to support young parents should not involve any risk of increasing levels of poverty or children being left without access to food, essential health care and shelter.


In the context of an inquiry earlier into another of the government's bills that would have had the effect of suspending or potentially cancelling payments if someone failed to attend a meeting, one of the things that became crystal clear is that neither the department nor any of the people working in the field could tell us why people were missing meetings: whether it was because they did not understand the requirements of the system, poor public transport or family needs. No-one could tell us and, before we start wielding a big stick at some of the most vulnerable parents in our community, we should first be asking: do we know why these people are missing appointments; why there is nonattendance; and what we can do to support them?


There is significant anecdotal evidence and evidence from those who work in the field that many find this system bewildering. Since the privatisation of the Job Network system, who can blame them? It often involves appointments with many different sets of people, and we are talking about people who often have low levels of education. It may well be that people do not attend these things because they do not realise that they have to or other things crop up.


One would think that, before bringing out the big stick, first of all you would try to find out and understand why people are missing appointments and why there is nonattendance and then work out what could be done to assist them. There is no need for the stick until we have tried those other measures.


What should be done instead? We must, as I have been saying, offer support, not sanctions: support in getting an education; support in learning life skills; and support in finding employment. Any measures to achieve these aims must be compatible with the child-rearing responsibilities of the people involved. These people are some of the most disenfranchised in the country. They need encouragement and incentives to assist them to re-engage with the system which will facilitate education and meaningful employment. We must cultivate young people's confidence and skills. Case management and tailored engagement participation plans can help achieve these aims, but only if they are done in a sensitive and supportive way. We need to invest further in good case management, which can be effective in helping to improve social outcomes. The Greens do not believe that spending more money on punitive compliance measures is the answer. We need to help young families by removing barriers to their participation, not erecting more. They need things like better access to child care, better access to public transport and classes that address the day-to-day difficulties these young people are facing.


All of these intersect in my electorate of Melbourne with its high amount of public housing dwellings. There are childcare centres attached to neighbourhood houses that up until this year—with the assistance of Take a Break program funding—have run very successful occasional successful child care for many women of the kind this bill might address. These women are looking for ways to improve their education, perhaps improve their English and ultimately re-enter the workforce. Up until now, a young woman has been able to pop her kid off at the occasional childcare centres at neighbourhood houses for a couple of hours while she does a certificate II in child care or other courses or goes to a Centrelink appointment. Those are exactly the kinds of things that are being envisaged by this bill.


What is happening? Many of these centres are having to shut their doors to occasional child care from the start of next year because the sources of funding have dried up as the federal government and state government in Victoria are engaged in a stand-off. The women will no longer have access to affordable and cheap occasional child care. They will not have somewhere to drop their kids off while they engage in courses. One can see how the cycle of punishment continues if we remove the kinds of supports that are necessary and adopt a punitive approach instead of a supportive approach.


I have always been a big believer in the principle that you do not improve people's situation in life by taking their rights away. Unfortunately, that seems to be an approach that has underpinned legislation from governments on both sides of the House over recent years. We see it again with this legislation. We do not need this legislation. We do need more resources for engaging with families and young parents and we must empower them to take control of their own lives.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-11-23,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (17:55):  I rise to add my support to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011. This bill introduces amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 with the aim of helping teenage parents and jobless families in particular. It identifies some 10 disadvantaged locations across Australia where trials will be undertaken to see how teenagers or families without work can be assisted and supported into a new experience of jobs and, in the case of the teenagers, year 12 equivalent and ongoing education.


One of the 10 disadvantaged locations chosen is in my electorate of Murray in my Goulburn Valley communities. There we have a number of teenage parents and parents who have been jobless into the second and third—and in one case the fourth—generation. It is very difficult for a family or a young teenage parent to break the cycle of poverty, social isolation and disadvantage when she has a very difficult time raising children and when she may only be 14 or 15 years old. Gaining work in small or larger communities is not a case of what you can do but who you know. A lot of the employment that is available, particularly in regional centres, is advertised by word of mouth, by networks of friends and by family members. If you have been unemployed for generations in your family, you simply do not have those networks where the job in the shop or hospitality or the apprenticeship in the trade is made known to you.


So it is very important that we look at different ways to engage these young parents who have not achieved year 12. They need to be given a fresh start in life and new ways to deal with all of the challenges that they will face, first as parents but then as people who should be supported to become independent in their lives. When I was Minister for Workforce Participation, the coalition introduced a new measure for parenting payments that required those whose youngest child had reached six to look for a job of at least 15 hours per week. We were aware that, in requiring changes for these parents, we had to make sure they had access to child care, that they were not going to have to travel too far to get work and that they were skilled in the area of work they were attempting to break into. There is a whole lot of special challenges for families where parents may never have worked and have no role models of people who were in employment before.


One of the issues that we confront in the Goulburn Valley is the fact that standard Australian English is not necessarily spoken in all of our families. In our Indigenous families, Aboriginal English is commonly spoken and this language is not readily accepted in some places of employment. We have a lot of non-English-speaking background families as well who came as migrants a generation before or who have come more recently as refugees. Those families, especially the teenage mothers of young children, need special language skills support. 


I am very concerned that in the pilot to be undertaken in my electorate we encourage the participants to not see themselves as targeted and stigmatised as failures and therefore as special cases for potential punishment, because if their new requirements are not met their income support payments will be suspended. We want them to understand that this is an opportunity of a lifetime—that they are going to be given, hopefully, additional support to identify where their key life interests are; and, in the case of teenage parents, that they are able to go back to a form of education that fits their family responsibilities, given the age of their children and their own personal circumstances in terms of where they live, whether they are mobile and whether they can get to a TAFE or a community learning centre. We want to make sure that these young teenagers embrace this program and do not think they are being pursued but step forward and say, 'This is an opportunity.'




Mr Katter:
  It's very naive, what you're saying. You know it's not going to happen like that.




Dr STONE:
  Well, I have a great deal of experience in this area, and I have to say that there are two ways this program or trial can go. The way I support it going, and hope it will go, is for our young teenage parents to see this as an opportunity.


As I mentioned before, there can be a lot of detrimental outcomes when young teenage mothers follow in their own mothers' footsteps and have two or three children by the time they are in their early 20s but have never completed their formal secondary education. We know that those mothers with young children are more likely to never have secure housing; often, their own children become teenage parents; they often suffer more mental and physical health issues and problems during their life; and they are also more likely to be subject to domestic and other types of violence. This is just not acceptable in a country like Australia.


So I am very supportive of the Centrelink and other non-government organisations personnel who are gearing up for this trial in the Goulburn Valley. We have had a number of meetings, and I have attended as many of those as I could or my staff have attended those meetings. We have questioned our policy developers about the details of these programs. We have asked about the extent to which our young parents will be talked into doing things like financial literacy and management, and how they will be supported in their childcare needs. We have a major problem with the lack of child care in our part of the world and we have no public transport, virtually, in most of our area, so we have to make sure that we are not putting impossible demands in front of these young parents.


We are also very concerned that the fathers of the children be engaged in these targeted programs. Quite often, the father is overlooked; it is the teenage mother with young children who is the focus of this attention. Clearly, it is the young mother who suffers the most substantial disadvantage in finishing her education and gaining work when she has those parenting responsibilities, often alone. But we need to also understand that there are many young men who are the fathers of these children who are equally disadvantaged, who have had no experience of work and who do often also want to participate as parents. They would like to be able to contribute to their children's upkeep and even, ultimately, have a long and stable relationship with the mother of their children, based on shared accommodation and a career that they can build, sometimes in small business together.


So there are a lot of potential benefits in this program. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from programs that are already in progress in other parts of the country. It will be very important that those who are a part of these trials are not stigmatised or labelled in the community as the absolute failures, or come under threat of having their welfare suspended or quarantined so that they are looked upon as 'the unlucky few'. We would like to think that the people participating will be regarded as the fortunate few who are going to be given a better chance in life.


There are an extraordinary number of teenage parents: some 11,000 are on parenting payments around Australia. Ninety per cent of these parents do not have year 12 education, which is a pretty sad indictment of our education system. It also reflects on our younger people's understanding of contraception, family planning and managing their own lives. But we know that, of those on parenting payments, there are a very significant number who struggle to find long-term employment and whose families have not had employment for generations. So, for both elements of this program—the teenage parents and the parents on parenting payments—we hope that this trial will give us new strategies and that any difficulties along the way will be quickly sorted. In my community, I commend the schools, the TAFEs and the community education centres, and I hope that those who have already stepped forward will go on to have cooperative relationships. There will be a lot of communication and sharing of information.


Obviously, the program is not targeting Indigenous parents, but we do have a big Indigenous community in my area. We want to make sure that any lessons from the early welfare-quarantining and welfare-managing programs are learned and are translated, in this case, into Victoria and Southern Australia.


I certainly wish the young families well who will be participants in this pilot in the Goulburn Valley, one of the 10 places that will be selected around Australia. I hope this family participation measures bill will be a huge step forward in removing intergenerational disadvantage, which dogs some parts of Australia more than others but has been with us in most communities for the last 200 years. I think it would be a very sad day if we walked away from our young teenage parents, if we said, 'Well, that's just their bad luck and if they've got any gumption they'll somehow pull themselves up.' It is an extraordinarily difficult task that they face in their young lives when they have one or two children, no job, very difficult or poor accommodation and very little transport and when there is often a great deal of stigma attached to their circumstances.


I mentioned at the beginning the business of language support and learning. I think that is a critical part of this program. I am also most concerned that these young people have literacy and numeracy training and skills support. Even though they may have attained year 10 or 11 education, often their literacy and numeracy are not adequate for them to be able to engage in any sort of work that requires the most basic of reading and writing skills and general skills.


Accompanying this program, I hope we do things as basic as helping young people get their drivers licences and making sure that they get birth certificates, because many of our teenage parents, particularly our young Indigenous parents, do not have any papers that identify where they were born, as found on birth certificates. They are an essential part of Australian codification in terms of gaining bank loans or identification for licence or passport purposes. So supporting them in gaining a birth certificate is an important thing for a lot of these young parents. I want to assure this government that although I am an opposition member I will be doing all I can for the teenagers and those on parenting payments in my community to see that this pilot works. I will be in constant communication with the Centrelink office and those in FaHCSIA who are evolving this policy and I will share with them my observations of the special advantages or difficulties that the program is encountering. Let us hope that this helps usher in a new era for some families who for generations have done it very tough.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2011-11-23,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (18:08):  I have very great respect for the minister who brought forward the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011, but I do not have respect for the people who proposed it to him and I do not have respect for the government for carrying it forward. I am very surprised at my own strength of feeling against this bill. 


I have some pet hates. One of them is people who tell other people what to do and who love to have power and control over them. My experience of one of the most dreadful shames of our nation is what I call 'child thieving'. We stood up and had the hypocrisy in this place to apologise for the stolen children. According to the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald they are being stolen in New South Wales at three times the rate that they were stolen in the period of the stolen children. That is rate, not absolute numbers. The absolute numbers are appalling. Similarly, in Queensland, which is reputed to be worse, they have hidden the figures. We cannot find the figures in Queensland of how many children are being stolen. 


When I was a state member, I saw numerous cases of people whom I would describe as being sick and drunk with power. If ever I have seen a bill that will deliver power to the middle-class self-opinionated know-all university class this is it! And I do not speak owing anything to anyone. I was president of my faculty at the university, I was president of my college, I was president of the combined colleges council and I served on the students union for three years, so I would hardly suffer an inferiority complex in that area. But having had that confidence and having had the great privilege, I suppose, of an education of that quality, let me relate to you a case that I had.


This mother classically fits this mould. She had a child in her teens, at 16 or 17. She was not a perfect mother—she was far from being a perfect mother—but she was a mother. She loved her child and her child loved her. When she fell into the hands of a social worker in Charters Towers, the social worker decided that she had mental problems and committed her to a mental institution. The terror that is out there for ordinary people. It always amazes me, this place, that I do not hear members of parliament tell these stories—don't you have any human stories that happen to you?


Let me return to the story of this poor woman. She was committed to a mental institution—they have leery names for them these days—and her little child was taken off her. Unfortunately for the social workers, the report was left—and I got hold of it. It said that the child was unhappy in the presence of the officers of the department. She was dragged away from her mother, crying her eyes out and screaming. And her mother was crying her eyes out and screaming whilst the child was dragged out by two police, who absolutely hated doing the job. They were really nice fellows. The social workers said they were doing the right thing. 'It's tough but we have to do this job.' If ever I have seen the thought police in operation it is those people, those social workers; they just love their power—sick and drunk with power.


God is good, because even though this woman had a nut case for a psychiatrist, he went on holidays and a lady psychiatrist was put in charge. She wrote: 'This woman is not now nor ever will be mentally unstable or in need of incarceration in an institution, now or in the future.' It was a scathing indictment of the psychologist, the social workers and the psychiatrist. That being the case, I immediately proceeded to go after the social workers involved in this shocking case.


The child's report said that in the presence of the social workers, the officers of the department, the child spontaneously burst out crying and hid under the bed. She got into the foster parents' bed and clung to the woman who was her foster mother for the time being. They said this was aberrant behaviour. Someone takes you—drags you—kicking and screaming away from your mother, who is bawling her eyes out and being held back by the police, and then you are sensitive towards the social worker. You are telling us in this place that these poor little mothers are going to be placed under the control of these people!


I will go on. The chief psychologist of North Queensland is a very wealthy fellow and a fellow I had very great respect for when he worked in children's services. He is one of the most excellent officers I ever worked with as a member of parliament. I rang him up concerning the woman in charge. I had said to her, 'I want the child returned to the mother,' and she said, 'No, we have to do assessments.' I said: 'There are no assessments. The child was taken because the mother was mentally unstable. It has now been determined, absolutely, that she is not mentally unstable and the social worker who deemed her to be mentally unstable has been sacked. You bundled her off as fast as you could get her out of the place. I know who was sick. It was the social worker who was sick. That is who was sick.' So I rang this psychologist, the most eminent psychologist in North Queensland at that time. I told him that the head of the department, when I started speaking to her on the telephone and said the daughter had to be returned, hyperventilated—she could not tolerate anyone standing up to her—and had to leave the telephone. I told the young bloke who came on the phone that I wanted her back on the telephone. He said, 'I think she's a bit sick.' I will tell you how sick she was. What she did next week was return the child to the father, which was an option that was available to her, just to prove that she had the power: 'The mother does not have the power, I have the power. No member of parliament will tell me what to do. I will return the child to the father!'


What has happened to that mother, we do not know. What has happened to that child, we do not know. But we know very much what the psychologist told me. He said that head of the children's services area, which was operating in this case, 'is clinically sick'. I do not know the term he used, but he used technical terms. He said, 'I'll tell you her symptoms.' He told me her symptoms, and I said, 'You're dead right, she is definitely sick.'


From my experience, particularly in the field of Indigenous affairs, where I was minister for the best part of a decade, I found that when people have absolute power it corrupts them absolutely. We had a case which is very much a matter of public record in Queensland. Pattie O'Shane said there were only two ministers in Queensland history. That was effectively correct. There were two heads of the department and both were there for 44 years. I will not go into the running of the department. Suffice it to say that the struggles between me and the forces in that department are the subject of two books that are on the reading list at the university.


When I was a young man, most people of reasonable intelligence read the book 1984 and learnt about Big Brother. This book is about a society in which we are all controlled. There are very few people's names that have become part of the language. 'Darwinian' is a word that has become part of our language and, along with the spectre of Big Brother in George Orwell's book, 'Orwellian' has also become part of the lexicon of our language. Big Brother said: 'We will look after you. We will see that you are fed and clothed. We will do these things for you.'


I must relate the story of a meeting I had the very great honour of attending. At this meeting Percy Neal, the chair at Yarrabah Shire Council, said to the minister—and I am not here to denigrate people so I will not mention the minister's name—'Minister, you're familiar with the term ""addiction""?' She said yes. He said, 'You would know then that the way you cure an addiction is to first admit it to it.' She said, 'Yes, of course, Percy.' She is a very well spoken woman and a very impressive woman. He said: 'Well, you see, you have an addiction. That addiction is that we blackfellas cannot look after ourselves, that we need you whitefellas to look after us. That is your addiction. You just cannot get it out of your heads that we can look after our own affairs.' And there are a lot of people in this parliament today who cannot get it out of their heads that we had to rescue that little woman, that child—that waif, trash or whatever term you might like to apply to her; you might say she is an unfortunate. Those are the sorts of terms you will use when you talk about this. But really, at the end of the day, you are now controlling that young woman's life. And it might surprise you or jade your middle- or upper-class values—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
) (18:19):  No, no, no, no, no. I do not have those prejudices so please do not direct those comments at me.




Mr KATTER:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would never in a million years consider you to be part of it.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I know, but just generalise it please.




Mr KATTER:
  Those people who have those attitudes shall now control the power to take away a child from a young mother. To you, they may be terrible mothers. To you, you may have to rescue the children. That was what was said in the old days of the stolen children. They said constantly that we had to rescue the children from people and the very unacceptable way in which they were living. But I know one of these young mothers—I went out with the daughter for a tiny little while. She pulled herself up and became a fully qualified and fully trained nurse and the director of nursing in a hospital. She became a leading member in the community and married the local dentist. She was tremendously successful. But you would have placed that mother under some sort of tutelage—and I use that word with aforethought.


One of my good friends was brought up by a teenage mother, and I am sure she would have been under this tutelage. He is one of the finest men I know. His son is a doctor. He has been a great leader. He has been a foreman with the main roads department. He is a great success story. There was another case from my home town. There was a little girl who could not have possibly have had a worse upbringing. But she is a very successful mother and has a very successful family. She loved her mother, even though her mother was not a good mother. Her son played football with my son. I think in six years they did not lose a game by less than 40 points. A brilliant footballer! He is a trained electrician now with a number of kids and a very happy family. So what you might see as a woman who needs to be controlled by a social worker, some of us would see as a little hero.



Sadly, the statistics in this country show that in 10 years, when I, the first of the baby boomers, die, there will be more deaths than births in this country. Why are women not having children in this country? It is because, as my daughters have said to me, if you are a mother and you want to stay at home and look after your kids, you are regarded as a second-class citizen. You really are socially ostracised and isolated. I am proud to say that most of my daughters have become stay-at-home mothers in spite of that and in spite of the fact that they were all on very big incomes. They were very successful people and they had to sacrifice a lot of income to take that decision. In the short time left to me, I cannot help but say that there are very strong racial overtones in this bill. Putting on my blackfella hat rather than my whitefella hat, I say that I resent very, very strongly the implications of this legislation. There will be very great sorrow and pain for the little mothers, who have been great heroes as far as I am concerned but who have committed the simple sin of wanting to have a child and be a mother. For that they will be punished by being put under the control of the social workers, whose tender mercies I have outlined here tonight. They are just some of the many things that are in the files in my office. (Time expired)

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (18:23):  It is always refreshing as a member in this House to come in and hear a member speak with the sort of passion that the previous speaker spoke with. You can see that the member for Kennedy cares desperately for the young women in his electorate and that he is committed to ensuring that kids are able to stay with their mums, have a family around them and not be penalised in any way. I do not see racial overtones in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011, and I would never adopt an approach which was all about using a stick and making life hard either for single parents or for people who are long-term unemployed. I do not believe that the best results are achieved by a 'stick' approach; I believe that you need to have an approach whereby you take people with you, and I can stand in this place and support this legislation.


The part of Shortland electorate that falls within the administration of Wyong Shire Council will be affected by this legislation. On first reading the legislation, I had a very similar reaction to those of the previous speaker and the member for Melbourne. But, after I looked at the details and attended some of the information sessions that were provided in my local area, I became quite excited about some of the advantages and benefits that the legislation will offer young people who are single parents and who are disadvantaged by their circumstances.


This legislation will put in place programs that will empower young people and put them in a situation where they can get the education and assistance they need. I understand the previous speaker's concerns, but there will be so many benefits associated with these programs. I commend this legislation to the House.

 (Farrer) (18:27):  by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) together as circulated in my name:


(1) Schedule 1, item 8, page 3 (line 28) to page 4 (line 12), omit the item.


(2) Schedule 1, item 9, page 4 (lines 13 to 32), omit the item.


The coalition's position is that while we support this bill and recognise that it does introduce an element of mutual obligation for the two cohorts of job seekers which it seeks to target—teenage parents and jobless families—it does not quite go far enough. We need a system that has enough clout to promote compliance, and it is for this reason that the coalition moves these amendments.


The amendments seek to ensure that, where a parent is in receipt of parenting payment and this payment was made on the basis of their eligibility for parenting payment yet they have failed to adhere to an employment pathways plan, there should be a realistic penalty. With rights come responsibilities, and we have to make this clear. We need the capacity, where there is a blatant and deliberate disregard for a job seeker's obligations, to impose a meaningful penalty. Our amendments seek to reinforce the importance of compliance in a manner which will encourage appropriate behaviour.


We certainly recognise that these are vulnerable families and that there are vulnerable children involved, and the coalition is comfortable that the necessary safeguards are in place to ensure that the welfare of children and vulnerable families will be looked after. At the same time, we do need an, if you like, reserve power to enforce compliance and to explain to those involved in the trials, particularly the jobless families, 'This is serious business—we expect you to turn up, we expect you to enter into an undertaking and we expect you to follow through to the best of your ability even while we recognise the difficult circumstances that you face.' I commend the amendments to the House.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (18:29):  The government will not be supporting the opposition amendments. We believe this bill already strikes the right balance between creating opportunities for teen parents and jobless families to access services that will assist them to finish their education and enter the workforce and requiring responsibility through the threat of income support suspension.


Anything further than the proposed bill before the House, we believe, would be too harsh. The government also opposes the amendments because formal interviews with teen parents will occur only every six months and therefore a penalty amount might become very large over a period of time. Teen parents are already a vulnerable customer group and already have complex and multiple barriers, such as the risk of homelessness, few life skills and small resources to draw upon in many instances.


The purpose of the trial is to provide assistance and support to families, not to further entrench them in financial difficulties. It is important to note that these arrangements are a trial and that most of the teen parents in the trial will not have had any requirement to do the activities before now. In addition, it is important to note that not all teen parents will be in the trial so that imposing a threat of debt on some parents but not others does not raise equity concerns. For those reasons we continue to commend the bill to the House and oppose the opposition's amendments.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2011-11-23,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (17:07):  I rise to speak up on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011. The purpose of the bill is to address two areas of concern: teenage families and jobless families. For teenage parents who live in one of the 10 identified areas of disadvantage, there will be a 3½-year trial starting on 1 January 2012, requiring those who receive parenting payments to develop and sign an Employment Pathway Plan. There will be a separate three-year trial commencing on 1 July 2012, requiring certain jobless family members who are receiving parenting payment to develop and sign an Employment Pathway Plan.


The government announced the introduction of these participation pilots for teenage parents in the 2011-12 budget and it is believed that this measure will cost in the order of $47.1 million and will be rolled out across 10 areas of high disadvantage. These areas include: Playford in South Australia; Hume and Shepparton in Victoria; Burnie in Tasmania; Bankstown, Wyong and Shellharbour in New South Wales; Rockhampton and Logan in Queensland; and Kwinana in Western Australia.


As the federal member for Solomon, I am disappointed that the Northern Territory has been overlooked. Yet again, the Northern Territory is not getting the attention it deserves and, quite frankly, I am sick and tired of the government treating the Northern Territory with contempt. Statistics from the Parliamentary Library show birth rates to teenagers in the Northern Territory are consistently higher than the national average. Fertility rates for Territory teenage girls are also among the highest in the country. This concerns me, because teenage pregnancies are usually associated with many social issues, such as higher rates of debt and lower educational levels. Being a parent can make it harder to get a job or find a job. The difficulty of juggling being a parent with school, work and family can also be a strain. Often getting child care can be difficult too because of the expense involved. These factors can often lead to parents feeling inadequate, lonely and not part of a family. 


Smoking, drinking and drug use are also big factors and can also break down the relationship between the young mother and her own parents. One Australian study claims that, while 49 per cent of pregnant teenagers were living with their parents before pregnancy, only 30 per cent lived at home during the pregnancy. Stress and the realisation of becoming a young parent also cause problems and sometimes result in unwanted children and broken families. In some cases, too, the grandparents are forced to care for the children, and, with no government assistance in place to support this, how will they be supported?


Currently there are more than 11,000 teenage parents in Australia. According to the ABS, the age-specific fertility rate of women aged 15 to 19 years in the Northern Territory in 2010 was 48.1 per cent. The national average that same year was 15.5 per cent. Indigenous teenagers also have a fertility rate twice that of all teenage women in the Northern Territory. This is of great concern because, without the opportunity to complete their education, these teenagers may become trapped in a cycle of welfare dependency and could disadvantage not only themselves but also their children. Therefore, births to Indigenous teenagers in remote and disadvantaged areas of the Territory are of great concern. According to ABS statistics, for Indigenous women in 2004 the teenage fertility rate of 71 babies per 1,000 women was more than four times the fertility rate of all teenage women—16 babies. 


Because we have a much younger population than any other population in Australia, this is an ongoing challenge. Coupled with the life expectancy gap, we need to acknowledge child health and youth services in rural and remote areas of the NT to deal with sexually active teenagers. This bill will require teenage parents to enter into an Employment Pathways Plan with Centrelink once their youngest child turns six months. The aim is to re-engage them with study as early as possible to prevent their long-term disadvantage. Once their youngest child turns six months old, they will be required to attend a Centrelink appointment and will need to enter into a plan to see them resume study and develop a plan for healthy early development and education outcomes for their child.


Education and health are extremely important to me in Solomon. In fact, recently I was fortunate enough to meet members of the Top End girls academy. The girls academy initiative was created with the aim of improving educational, personal and employment outcomes for Indigenous secondary school females. The program provides a strong community with supportive programs so that all members work towards completion of year 12, employment or further education. This is one such initiative that is proving successful for young Territory women. 


Ultimately, for this pilot to succeed there needs to be a focus on workforce participation and an enforcement of the obligations of the job seeker. Yet the only penalties that apply are when a job seeker fails to meet with Centrelink without a reasonable excuse. Whilst the legislation does require parents to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan to outline their employment, training and education and health outcomes for their child, there will be no requirement for them to comply with this plan and it will not be compulsory for them to commit to looking for or accepting employment or undertaking further study. Therefore, our amendment will seek to require compliance with the undertakings given in the employment pathway plan. Failure to adhere to these commitments would result in a suspension of payment. As with the teenage pilot, the jobless families trial was a commitment made in the 2011-12 budget.


The jobless families trial program targets parenting payment recipients who have been on income support for more than two years or those who are under 23 years of age, not working or studying and have a youngest child under six years of age. According to 2011 ABS statistics, more than 530,000 Australian children under 15 live with parents who do not work. Again, this can lead to serious disadvantage for the child and may ingrain a sense of welfare dependency. This also puts added pressure on housing affordability and the Northern Territory is already in the midst of a housing shortage.


Too many young families are struggling to find affordable homes and accommodation in my electorate. As a result, they are being forced to leave the Territory and seek more affordable options interstate. This is why the government should make use of the 200-plus vacant RAAF base houses sitting in Eaton rotting away. Instead, the Gillard Labor government ignores the will of the parliament. It should make these houses available to Territorians and it should do it now. Having an extra 200-plus houses available in the market would alleviate some of the pressure on young families in my electorate. Defence people assure me that they would love the opportunity to live in those houses. Unfortunately, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Snowdon, did not do what he previously agreed and that was to offer those houses to Defence families. I understand he is no longer the minister responsible for that, but I am hoping the new minister responsible will honour the will of the parliament and make those houses available.


While the Northern Territory has relatively low unemployment levels, ABS statistics reveal there are currently around 96,000 jobless couples with children as well as 210,000 single parents out of work across the nation. Indigenous children are most at risk, with more than 40 per cent living in jobless families—nearly three times the rate of other children. Parliamentary Library statistics show that the Northern Territory has the lowest rate of student participation in schooling of all states and territories. These rates are also lower for Indigenous students and students in remote and very remote areas. School attendance is closely linked to socioeconomic status, locality, Indigenous status and literacy and numeracy attainment.


The coalition supports attempts to have parents re-engage with the workforce early; however, this bill does not require parents to adhere to the commitments they make in their employment pathway plan. The coalition has concerns that this bill seeks to remove the provision for the secretary to intervene in exceptional circumstances, and that is why we will move amendmentsto this bill in the Senate.


Ultimately, the intention of these pilots is to increase engagement with education and employment opportunities, preventing future intergenerational unemployment and potential lifelong disadvantage. The coalition welcomes the intent of these pilots to encourage engagement; however, there are still some concerns. Whilst we acknowledge there are parents whose children are under six years of age and, as such, they should not be forced to look for a job, there should still be a recognised compliance regime. If they commit to further studies or to look for employment then they should be required to comply with these undertakings. As already indicated, the coalition supports the bill; however, we will be moving some amendments.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:18):  In 1981 a young woman found that she was pregnant at 16. After confirming the pregnancy and breaking the news to her mum, she attended school until the baby was nearly due. Although her mother was supportive and encouraged her to go back to school, the young woman decided it was too hard to commence year 12 with a young infant. Having already completed her year 11 studies, she eventually enrolled in a TAFE course and began a diploma in child care, part time. Now 45, with two children, she has a successful career in the early childhood sector running childcare centres in Melbourne. She also helps pregnant women who are not so lucky, in particular teenage mothers. Her daughter, now 29, is married with two children of her own. This story was told anonymously online by the woman herself to encourage teenage mothers never to give up. It shows why attaining year 12 or its equivalent is so important for teenage parents.


The number of teenage mothers in Australia has dropped significantly over recent decades. The most recent ABS data shows just four per cent of births were to teen mothers. But the outcomes of this small group are still worrying. In the 2006 census only 17 per cent of teenage mothers completed year 12. Over 1,500 females aged 15 to 19 years were not gaining the level of education that is increasingly essential for the demands of a 21st century workforce.


In June of this year the National Centre for Vocational Education Research released a report titled From education to employment: how long does it take? The centre found that young people who do not finish year 12 take significantly longer to move into employment. The prime factor influencing the speed at which a young person obtains work after they leave the education sector was their level of education. The report also found strong gender differences. For men, those with a degree obtained work five times faster than those who did not complete year 12. For women, those with a degree obtained work eight times faster. The unequivocal message from this report is that education is vital. For a young person entering the labour market, higher levels of education lead to better wages and to getting a job faster. In a worrying statistic, about one-quarter of the young people sampled with less than a year 12 education had not obtained any work by the end of the observation period. This is a serious warning for the long-term prospects of younger Australians who do not have year 12 or its equivalent. This prognosis for the career development and income levels of those young people is grim. This bill heeds that warning and puts in place a program for teenage parents to work towards attaining year 12 or its equivalent. From 1 January 2012, teenage parents in 10 disadvantaged locations with a youngest child under six who receive parenting payment and have not completed year 12 or an equivalent qualification will be required to attend Centrelink to develop a participation plan. Under the teenage parents trial, participants will be required to undertake compulsory activities from when their child is one year old. This will give them time to settle into life with a new baby; but, equally important, they will be able to develop a plan towards gaining a good education.


Education is the best antipoverty vaccine we have yet invented. It provides the foundations from which a young person can build a life of their choosing from the career opportunities and skills development that it brings. This government gets it. We understand that education is good social policy, that unemployment is the best predictor of disadvantage and that having the skills for the jobs of the future is essential to staying out of poverty. Although it was based on children and families in the United Kingdom, a recent Four Corners program made this point. It showed the human face, the cost and devastating impact of poverty on children.


One story was of Sam, who is 11 years old and lives in Leicester with his dad and older sister. Sam's dad is unemployed and struggles with finding enough money to buy food or to operate the electricity. Their income is £70 to £80 a week, which is barely enough to buy them the basics. Often the electricity and gas run out, leaving them cold and miserable. Sam has problems with bullying and suffers from low self-esteem. He has to be careful about what he says to other students for fear he will be judged and ridiculed. As Sam said, 'People don't like you if you're poor.'


This bill puts supports in place to cut the cycle of unemployment and poverty through education. I am sure that no-one in this place wants to see any child suffer, like Sam, the indignity of poverty. A great education in Australia can see a child from Cape York go to university, become a leader in her community and eventually become Young Australian of the Year. A great education means that a child from Ilfracombe can become the first female member of the Queensland bar and our first female Governor-General. This national parliament is itself a showcase of the opportunities that education provides to children from all corners of the nation. So many members of this House acknowledged in their first speeches that they would not be here today were it not for a great education.


The Brotherhood of St Laurence tells the story of another Sam. Forty years old, Sam has been working with the local council's road services department for the past 18 months. Now Sam's life is settled, he has safe, stable accommodation and is working towards future employment goals—but it has not always been that way. In 2009 Sam was living in a rooming house where violence was commonplace and the environment unsanitary. Through the Centre for Work and Learning at the Brotherhood of St Laurence, he was chosen to join a pre-employment training program. Sam successfully completed the training and was picked up as a trainee street cleaner with the local council. Having a steady income and taking control of his finances meant that Sam was finally able to renew his drivers licence. After he completed his traineeship he was linked to a recruitment agency used by the local council, and now enjoys a regular job. 'I really want to use my brain,' says Sam, when he is asked about his plans to work with youth and when he talks about becoming a teacher.


The other part of this bill focuses on families at risk of long-term unemployment. The aim of the jobless families trial is to break cycles of unemployment. For parents with children under school age, they will be required to develop a plan for re-entering the workforce once their youngest child starts school. Their Employment Pathway Plan can also include activities focusing on the health, wellbeing and education of their children. Because this government gets it, we are making sure children in families of risk are 'school ready' to make the most of their educational opportunities.


On a definition of poverty as households with less than 50 per cent of the median income, the OECD Family Database finds that 14 per cent of Australian children live in poverty. That is too many. This is why we are taking action with this bill and trialling these programs to support those at risk of long periods of unemployment and its lasting effects.


Recently the Economist magazine reported on the impact of unemployment in Western nations. Noting the scale of joblessness in the West, it pointed out that if all unemployed people lived in one country, it would have a population similar to that of Spain. By comparison, Australia's economy and our low levels of unemployment are the envy of other Western nations. We still have our own areas of stubbornly high unemployment, those pockets of disadvantage and of generational cycles of joblessness. For those Australians caught in those cycles of unemployment and disadvantage, or at risk of falling into those cycles, the human cost is all too real. Joblessness can lead to increases in depression, divorce, substance abuse, family breakdown and life's other troubles.


A 2007 study, 'Unemployment and Psychological Well-being', by Nick Carroll of the ANU, found that the adverse effects of unemployment on life satisfaction was large and significant. Not having a job was a much better predictor of having low life satisfaction than simply having a low income. Past unemployment also had a similar adverse effect, suggesting that unemployment had left long-term scars.


Internationally, there is substantial joblessness around the world, and we know that the longer a young person spends being unemployed, the greater that scarring effect is. In the United States, the average period of joblessness is now up to 40 weeks—an increase from only 17 weeks four years ago. In Italy, a person who is unemployed has, on average, been jobless for more than a year. The more detached people become from the workforce, the more their skills atrophy, the more their self-esteem drops, making it harder to re-enter the labour force, particularly a labour force that is moving on. That leaves countries with lower growth rates, putting strains on public finances and on the social fabric. 


It is a grim picture, but it is important to understand the full impact that long-term unemployment has on individuals, communities and nations. That is why education is so important to prepare and equip people for the workforce of tomorrow, to safeguard them against the detrimental effects of unemployment. I know the power of education and the dignity of work have been at the heart of the agenda of the Rudd and Gillard governments. This is one of the reasons that I ran for parliament and it is central to what we on this side of the House believe in. There are still too many Australians who live in circumstances of entrenched disadvantage. Too many Australian children are in families where their parents and grandparents have not known regular employment. They deserve to know the dignity of work, and they can benefit from the habits that arise from growing up in a household where an alarm clock goes off in the morning and someone goes off to a dignified job.


As the Prime Minister said in her address to the Sydney Institute earlier this year:


The party I lead is—politically, spiritually, even literally—the party of work … the party of opportunity not exclusion.


Welfare reform and workforce participation is where progressive policy and Labor values come together.


Not everyone can make it on their own. Sometimes the odds are stacked against people. We on this side of the House are committed to putting the odds back in their favour. This bill harnesses the transformative power of education to provide opportunities for some our most disadvantaged communities. This is what a government should do and this is what this Labor government is doing.


Recently the Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures showing that in June this year there were 96,000 jobless couple families and 210,000 jobless single parent families. Of these single parent families looking for work, 23 per cent had been jobless for more than a year. For those teenage parents and families experiencing long-term unemployment in Playford, Hume, Shepparton, Burnie, Bankstown, Wyong and the other trial regions, this government knows that in this place we have a responsibility to ensure that they are part of Australia's productivity, our economic fabric and our social wellbeing now and into the future. I commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:31):  In may this year the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer of Australia delivered his fourth budget, and as a part of that budget he announced a $4 billion investment in skills development over the forward estimates. He did that because our government understands that over the next three years there is going to be an escalating demand for skilled workers as our economy continues to grow. At the same time, we realise that we have an obligation as a Labor government to ensure that we do not leave anybody behind as the economy and the demand for skilled workers grow.


At any point in time there are over 11,000 teenage parents on parenting payments in Australia. More than 90 per cent of these do not have a year 12 or equivalent education. In my own electorate I see this all too often. There are suburbs where we have intergenerational unemployment where nobody within the household or family has completed a year 12 or equivalent education. This devastating combination of low education attainment and parenting responsibilities at a young age contributes to long-term unemployment and welfare dependency.


There are no easy answers in responding to this challenge, but one thing we do know is that we do not do any favours to anyone if we do not tell them the truth, and the truth, quite simply, is that there is a direct link between your educational attainment—whether you have finished high school or not—and your chances of being unemployed in your twenties and thirties. That is why this government's approach involves a combination of intensive assistance and stronger reciprocal obligations, taking a local approach to finding solutions to work and education retention.


As a government with Labor values of fairness and equity at our heart, our ministers have set about working on a range of policies to give effect to a strong social inclusion agenda. In a broad range of policy areas across many portfolios measures dealing with mental health, disability services, pension reforms, boosts to superannuation savings, paid parental leave, early childhood education, better access to university courses for low-socioeconomic students, social housing initiatives, the Closing the Gap program, our multicultural program, not to mention the Fair Work Act, our support for the equal pay case and many other measures, the measures in this bill form a part of that overall social inclusion agenda. They are core Labor values.


The bill before the House today implements the teen parents trial measure that was announced in the May budget as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package and is yet another important plank in the social inclusion agenda. Teen parents in 10 sites around Australia will be provided with intensive support and assistance to boost their education, job readiness and family wellbeing. I am very pleased, given the observations I have made about some of the areas within my electorate which are very similar to areas within your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, that the Shellharbour Local Government Area, a part of my electorate, has been selected as one of the 10 trial sites for the teen parent initiative. These 10 sites were chosen because they are currently areas of higher-than-average social disadvantage. Shellharbour has a higher-than-average number of people receiving income support, a higher-than-national-average number of teenage parents and lower-than-national-average levels of educational attainment for these groups.


The measures in this bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to provide a clear legislative basis to implement the compulsory requirements for parents on parenting payments who are in the trials to attend Centrelink appointments for the purpose of discussing and entering into an employment pathway plan. For teenage parents there will be a 3½-year trial commencing on 1 January next year that will apply to teen parents with a youngest child under six years of age who are receiving a parenting payment, who are 19 years of age or under, who have not completed year 12 or equivalent and who reside in one of the 10 locations that I have already identified. Once the youngest child turns one they will be required to attend Centrelink to discuss and develop a participation plan that focuses on their education completion and early health and education outcomes for their child. They will also need to agree to comply with the plan, which will be supported by a range of extra services in those locations.


The jobless family measures will consist of a three-year trial commencing on 1 July 2012 that will apply to parenting payment recipients with a youngest child under six years of age who have been on income support for two years or more or who are under 23 years of age and are not working and/or studying and who reside in one of the 10 locations that I have already mentioned. Parents will be required to attend interviews and workshops with Centrelink, where they will develop a plan that focuses on job preparation for themselves and, again, early health and education outcomes for their child.


The amendments in this bill broaden participation requirements and compliance sanctions to parenting payment recipients with children under six who are part of the teenage parent or jobless families trials operating in 10 disadvantaged locations. The provisions in this bill will not apply to parenting payment recipients who are not part of these trials.


I am pleased to take this opportunity to note some of the developments in my own electorate in preparation for these trials. Last month I had the pleasure of welcoming the Minister for Human Services, Tanya Plibersek, to my electorate to announce that Barnardos Australia, who currently operate some successful programs on behalf of the department in Warrawong, will receive over half a million dollars in additional funding over three years to expand the highly effective Communities for Children service in the Shellharbour local government area.


I was delighted to join staff from Barnardos Australia, parents and kids at a local play group, in Hegarty Park in Albion Park, which is funded through the Communities for Children program, to share this news and discuss the program with some of the participants. On that day I had many conversations with young teen parents, many of whom are participating in one of the innovative programs run by Barnardos Australia called Talking Realities. In this program young teen mums are trained up to become mentors. They go into schools and talk to young women and men about the realities of being a teenage mum. They also have one-on-one discussions with young women who have fallen pregnant about the things that they can anticipate as their pregnancy develops and in the early years after their child is born. It is an important initiative which is about transferring life knowledge and real skills and providing mentorship and support to these young women, many of whom do not get the same sort of mentorship or support from either their school or their family.


The new funding will focus on services that support teenage parents and jobless families who are part of the teen parents trial in Shellharbour. Barnardos Australia is working with local parents to build their parenting skills and to improve children's health and early learning outcomes. Communities for Children services in other areas have helped to change the lives of parents and children—with marked improvements in children's language skills, with parents getting support to find work and with mothers getting more involved in their local community. There is no doubt that the Shellharbour community will benefit from the boost to family and children's services, as well as this new and novel approach to delivering welfare services. It is quite simply a great initiative.


The expanded program will allow Barnardos to continue the great work that they are already doing supporting families in our community. Barnardos have delivered, through eight community partners, services and programs including food and nutrition, play activities such as circus skills, parenting support services and information DVDs, as well as a community garden.


Over the past six months, these local based initiatives have provided support to over 300 people, including 23 young parents and 600 children and young people, to help builder stronger and healthier relationships while improving parenting practices and increasing children's wellbeing. They add to and help provide additional support to the requirements and reciprocal obligations contained within the legislation before the House.


While our economy is strong, we know that some areas are falling behind the rest of the country. We know that, within these areas, there are specific groups of disadvantage and that teen parents are one of these groups. High unemployment rates, low educational attainment, welfare dependency and families at risk are the characteristics of social disadvantage in our community. If you are born into disadvantage, it is tough to break out of it and to find the support and assistance tailored to your own situation and personal circumstances that will provide the hand up to help you develop and reach your potential. When you meet and talk to these young mums you understand that inside each and every one of them there is potential. We cannot give up on these people. More importantly, we cannot allow our society to give up on their children and continue the cycle of disadvantage.


Australia's remarkable economic strength and the current mining boom have afforded this country and this government the opportunity to deal with some tough issues like these pockets of social disadvantage. Labor's approach, the Labor way, is to ensure that the mining boom provides benefits for all Australians. We do not want to leave anyone behind as we reap the benefits of our good fortune from our wealth of natural resources. That is why it is vitally important that we take the opportunity in our current economic circumstances to find new ways to break the cycle of welfare dependence.


Labor's aim is to ensure that our children are not growing up in families where no parent or grandparent has ever known work, where there is no memory of a working family member within those households. We want to create a culture of work, of life fulfilment and of economic and social participation, with the benefits that flow from this. Australia has an unacceptably high number of jobless families. While Australia has relatively high workforce participation rates and low levels of unemployment, by international standards the number of jobless families is still too high. There are currently over 250,000 families with dependent children in which neither parent is working. Over half of these families have been experiencing ongoing unemployment for three years or more.


Employment is the surest path out of poverty for every member of a family. That is because kids who grow up in jobless families are more likely to be unemployed as adults. The place-based programs which are a part of this legislation take advantage of local expertise and conditions rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all model. The place-based approach uses the wisdom and strengths of local communities and allows us to target government efforts towards intergenerational challenges such as low educational attainment, welfare dependency and unemployment.


I know that within my community, which has suffered many challenges over the last 12 months, there still exists a passion to address the issue of intergenerational unemployment and break the nexus between low educational attainment, people falling pregnant too young and having children, and dropping out of school and not completing their high school certificates. If we are able to break this nexus and re-engage these young people with education and with the workforce, we give these young families the opportunity to enjoy and connect themselves to the great opportunities that this country has to offer to everyone. I commend the legislation to the House. It is great Labor legislation. It is the sort of initiative that people expect Labor governments to undertake when we are in power.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-11-23,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:44):  When it comes to this bill the Greens support the aim but not the approach. Accordingly, we oppose this bill and believe that it is unnecessary, ineffective, and further stigmatises young parents. It is clearly the case that nonattendance is a barrier to education and work, but we do not believe that the punitive compliance measures proposed in the bill will be effective in achieving its stated aims. It is not clear if there will be adequate protection for young parents and whether Centerlink staff will receive training on engaging with young parents.


This bill looks like many of the Welfare to Work reforms that were a hallmark of the Howard era where increasingly punitive measures were put in place. Unfortunately, the government appears to be continuing this legacy in part. The Greens opposed these Welfare to Work measures when they were proposed by the Howard government and we oppose them now.


Removing income support is not the way to encourage young parents to work. We must remove the barriers rather than seek to punish. We do not want to make life harder for people on pensions and allowances—many of them are already doing it tough. My electorate has more public housing dwellings than any other electorate in the country, and there are a very high proportion of people who are on pensions and allowances. 


Although my electorate is not directly touched by the measures that have been announced in this bill, the picture that my electorate paints and that I have from engaging with the kinds of people who are referred to in this bill is that many of them are doing it tough. Many of them want to improve their situation but they face significant barriers. 


It is pretty difficult, if you are a parent or a single parent of a young child, to not only look after them but try and find your way back into the workforce or education and training. What is needed is support, not the threat of a bigger stick. In other measures that have been outlined by the government elsewhere, the Greens believe that the eligibility criteria for the disability support pension, the failure to index thresholds and the failure to index supplements have negative effects.


The measures proposed by the government would, we are concerned, create even greater inequity for those on income support in Australia. There is already inequity in the levels of income support that we provide people, given the difference between pensions and allowances; however, this bill will make the inequality worse by imposing additional requirements on these very young and very vulnerable parents.


The measures proposed are disproportionate, given that only 2.5 percent of parenting payment recipients are teenagers, which equates to approximately 11,000 out of 446,000 recipients nationally. This approach is not the best way to deal with such a small and often disempowered group.


The impact of this approach on teenage parents is of particular concern. These parents are some of the most vulnerable people in our society. This approach will not help them to make their lives better but may jeopardise their welfare and that of their children.


The measures in this bill assume that parents will have secure housing arrangements and enough money for the basic necessities of life if their income is suspended. Realistically, education can only be undertaken once these basic needs are met. The Welfare Rights Network and ACOSS also expressed this view, saying:


An initiative designed to support young parents should not involve any risk of increasing levels of poverty or children being left without access to food, essential health care and shelter.


In the context of an inquiry earlier into another of the government's bills that would have had the effect of suspending or potentially cancelling payments if someone failed to attend a meeting, one of the things that became crystal clear is that neither the department nor any of the people working in the field could tell us why people were missing meetings: whether it was because they did not understand the requirements of the system, poor public transport or family needs. No-one could tell us and, before we start wielding a big stick at some of the most vulnerable parents in our community, we should first be asking: do we know why these people are missing appointments; why there is nonattendance; and what we can do to support them?


There is significant anecdotal evidence and evidence from those who work in the field that many find this system bewildering. Since the privatisation of the Job Network system, who can blame them? It often involves appointments with many different sets of people, and we are talking about people who often have low levels of education. It may well be that people do not attend these things because they do not realise that they have to or other things crop up.


One would think that, before bringing out the big stick, first of all you would try to find out and understand why people are missing appointments and why there is nonattendance and then work out what could be done to assist them. There is no need for the stick until we have tried those other measures.


What should be done instead? We must, as I have been saying, offer support, not sanctions: support in getting an education; support in learning life skills; and support in finding employment. Any measures to achieve these aims must be compatible with the child-rearing responsibilities of the people involved. These people are some of the most disenfranchised in the country. They need encouragement and incentives to assist them to re-engage with the system which will facilitate education and meaningful employment. We must cultivate young people's confidence and skills. Case management and tailored engagement participation plans can help achieve these aims, but only if they are done in a sensitive and supportive way. We need to invest further in good case management, which can be effective in helping to improve social outcomes. The Greens do not believe that spending more money on punitive compliance measures is the answer. We need to help young families by removing barriers to their participation, not erecting more. They need things like better access to child care, better access to public transport and classes that address the day-to-day difficulties these young people are facing.


All of these intersect in my electorate of Melbourne with its high amount of public housing dwellings. There are childcare centres attached to neighbourhood houses that up until this year—with the assistance of Take a Break program funding—have run very successful occasional successful child care for many women of the kind this bill might address. These women are looking for ways to improve their education, perhaps improve their English and ultimately re-enter the workforce. Up until now, a young woman has been able to pop her kid off at the occasional childcare centres at neighbourhood houses for a couple of hours while she does a certificate II in child care or other courses or goes to a Centrelink appointment. Those are exactly the kinds of things that are being envisaged by this bill.


What is happening? Many of these centres are having to shut their doors to occasional child care from the start of next year because the sources of funding have dried up as the federal government and state government in Victoria are engaged in a stand-off. The women will no longer have access to affordable and cheap occasional child care. They will not have somewhere to drop their kids off while they engage in courses. One can see how the cycle of punishment continues if we remove the kinds of supports that are necessary and adopt a punitive approach instead of a supportive approach.


I have always been a big believer in the principle that you do not improve people's situation in life by taking their rights away. Unfortunately, that seems to be an approach that has underpinned legislation from governments on both sides of the House over recent years. We see it again with this legislation. We do not need this legislation. We do need more resources for engaging with families and young parents and we must empower them to take control of their own lives.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (17:55):  I rise to add my support to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011. This bill introduces amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 with the aim of helping teenage parents and jobless families in particular. It identifies some 10 disadvantaged locations across Australia where trials will be undertaken to see how teenagers or families without work can be assisted and supported into a new experience of jobs and, in the case of the teenagers, year 12 equivalent and ongoing education.


One of the 10 disadvantaged locations chosen is in my electorate of Murray in my Goulburn Valley communities. There we have a number of teenage parents and parents who have been jobless into the second and third—and in one case the fourth—generation. It is very difficult for a family or a young teenage parent to break the cycle of poverty, social isolation and disadvantage when she has a very difficult time raising children and when she may only be 14 or 15 years old. Gaining work in small or larger communities is not a case of what you can do but who you know. A lot of the employment that is available, particularly in regional centres, is advertised by word of mouth, by networks of friends and by family members. If you have been unemployed for generations in your family, you simply do not have those networks where the job in the shop or hospitality or the apprenticeship in the trade is made known to you.


So it is very important that we look at different ways to engage these young parents who have not achieved year 12. They need to be given a fresh start in life and new ways to deal with all of the challenges that they will face, first as parents but then as people who should be supported to become independent in their lives. When I was Minister for Workforce Participation, the coalition introduced a new measure for parenting payments that required those whose youngest child had reached six to look for a job of at least 15 hours per week. We were aware that, in requiring changes for these parents, we had to make sure they had access to child care, that they were not going to have to travel too far to get work and that they were skilled in the area of work they were attempting to break into. There is a whole lot of special challenges for families where parents may never have worked and have no role models of people who were in employment before.


One of the issues that we confront in the Goulburn Valley is the fact that standard Australian English is not necessarily spoken in all of our families. In our Indigenous families, Aboriginal English is commonly spoken and this language is not readily accepted in some places of employment. We have a lot of non-English-speaking background families as well who came as migrants a generation before or who have come more recently as refugees. Those families, especially the teenage mothers of young children, need special language skills support. 


I am very concerned that in the pilot to be undertaken in my electorate we encourage the participants to not see themselves as targeted and stigmatised as failures and therefore as special cases for potential punishment, because if their new requirements are not met their income support payments will be suspended. We want them to understand that this is an opportunity of a lifetime—that they are going to be given, hopefully, additional support to identify where their key life interests are; and, in the case of teenage parents, that they are able to go back to a form of education that fits their family responsibilities, given the age of their children and their own personal circumstances in terms of where they live, whether they are mobile and whether they can get to a TAFE or a community learning centre. We want to make sure that these young teenagers embrace this program and do not think they are being pursued but step forward and say, 'This is an opportunity.'




Mr Katter:
  It's very naive, what you're saying. You know it's not going to happen like that.




Dr STONE:
  Well, I have a great deal of experience in this area, and I have to say that there are two ways this program or trial can go. The way I support it going, and hope it will go, is for our young teenage parents to see this as an opportunity.


As I mentioned before, there can be a lot of detrimental outcomes when young teenage mothers follow in their own mothers' footsteps and have two or three children by the time they are in their early 20s but have never completed their formal secondary education. We know that those mothers with young children are more likely to never have secure housing; often, their own children become teenage parents; they often suffer more mental and physical health issues and problems during their life; and they are also more likely to be subject to domestic and other types of violence. This is just not acceptable in a country like Australia.


So I am very supportive of the Centrelink and other non-government organisations personnel who are gearing up for this trial in the Goulburn Valley. We have had a number of meetings, and I have attended as many of those as I could or my staff have attended those meetings. We have questioned our policy developers about the details of these programs. We have asked about the extent to which our young parents will be talked into doing things like financial literacy and management, and how they will be supported in their childcare needs. We have a major problem with the lack of child care in our part of the world and we have no public transport, virtually, in most of our area, so we have to make sure that we are not putting impossible demands in front of these young parents.


We are also very concerned that the fathers of the children be engaged in these targeted programs. Quite often, the father is overlooked; it is the teenage mother with young children who is the focus of this attention. Clearly, it is the young mother who suffers the most substantial disadvantage in finishing her education and gaining work when she has those parenting responsibilities, often alone. But we need to also understand that there are many young men who are the fathers of these children who are equally disadvantaged, who have had no experience of work and who do often also want to participate as parents. They would like to be able to contribute to their children's upkeep and even, ultimately, have a long and stable relationship with the mother of their children, based on shared accommodation and a career that they can build, sometimes in small business together.


So there are a lot of potential benefits in this program. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from programs that are already in progress in other parts of the country. It will be very important that those who are a part of these trials are not stigmatised or labelled in the community as the absolute failures, or come under threat of having their welfare suspended or quarantined so that they are looked upon as 'the unlucky few'. We would like to think that the people participating will be regarded as the fortunate few who are going to be given a better chance in life.


There are an extraordinary number of teenage parents: some 11,000 are on parenting payments around Australia. Ninety per cent of these parents do not have year 12 education, which is a pretty sad indictment of our education system. It also reflects on our younger people's understanding of contraception, family planning and managing their own lives. But we know that, of those on parenting payments, there are a very significant number who struggle to find long-term employment and whose families have not had employment for generations. So, for both elements of this program—the teenage parents and the parents on parenting payments—we hope that this trial will give us new strategies and that any difficulties along the way will be quickly sorted. In my community, I commend the schools, the TAFEs and the community education centres, and I hope that those who have already stepped forward will go on to have cooperative relationships. There will be a lot of communication and sharing of information.


Obviously, the program is not targeting Indigenous parents, but we do have a big Indigenous community in my area. We want to make sure that any lessons from the early welfare-quarantining and welfare-managing programs are learned and are translated, in this case, into Victoria and Southern Australia.


I certainly wish the young families well who will be participants in this pilot in the Goulburn Valley, one of the 10 places that will be selected around Australia. I hope this family participation measures bill will be a huge step forward in removing intergenerational disadvantage, which dogs some parts of Australia more than others but has been with us in most communities for the last 200 years. I think it would be a very sad day if we walked away from our young teenage parents, if we said, 'Well, that's just their bad luck and if they've got any gumption they'll somehow pull themselves up.' It is an extraordinarily difficult task that they face in their young lives when they have one or two children, no job, very difficult or poor accommodation and very little transport and when there is often a great deal of stigma attached to their circumstances.


I mentioned at the beginning the business of language support and learning. I think that is a critical part of this program. I am also most concerned that these young people have literacy and numeracy training and skills support. Even though they may have attained year 10 or 11 education, often their literacy and numeracy are not adequate for them to be able to engage in any sort of work that requires the most basic of reading and writing skills and general skills.


Accompanying this program, I hope we do things as basic as helping young people get their drivers licences and making sure that they get birth certificates, because many of our teenage parents, particularly our young Indigenous parents, do not have any papers that identify where they were born, as found on birth certificates. They are an essential part of Australian codification in terms of gaining bank loans or identification for licence or passport purposes. So supporting them in gaining a birth certificate is an important thing for a lot of these young parents. I want to assure this government that although I am an opposition member I will be doing all I can for the teenagers and those on parenting payments in my community to see that this pilot works. I will be in constant communication with the Centrelink office and those in FaHCSIA who are evolving this policy and I will share with them my observations of the special advantages or difficulties that the program is encountering. Let us hope that this helps usher in a new era for some families who for generations have done it very tough.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2011-11-23,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (18:08):  I have very great respect for the minister who brought forward the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011, but I do not have respect for the people who proposed it to him and I do not have respect for the government for carrying it forward. I am very surprised at my own strength of feeling against this bill. 


I have some pet hates. One of them is people who tell other people what to do and who love to have power and control over them. My experience of one of the most dreadful shames of our nation is what I call 'child thieving'. We stood up and had the hypocrisy in this place to apologise for the stolen children. According to the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald they are being stolen in New South Wales at three times the rate that they were stolen in the period of the stolen children. That is rate, not absolute numbers. The absolute numbers are appalling. Similarly, in Queensland, which is reputed to be worse, they have hidden the figures. We cannot find the figures in Queensland of how many children are being stolen. 


When I was a state member, I saw numerous cases of people whom I would describe as being sick and drunk with power. If ever I have seen a bill that will deliver power to the middle-class self-opinionated know-all university class this is it! And I do not speak owing anything to anyone. I was president of my faculty at the university, I was president of my college, I was president of the combined colleges council and I served on the students union for three years, so I would hardly suffer an inferiority complex in that area. But having had that confidence and having had the great privilege, I suppose, of an education of that quality, let me relate to you a case that I had.


This mother classically fits this mould. She had a child in her teens, at 16 or 17. She was not a perfect mother—she was far from being a perfect mother—but she was a mother. She loved her child and her child loved her. When she fell into the hands of a social worker in Charters Towers, the social worker decided that she had mental problems and committed her to a mental institution. The terror that is out there for ordinary people. It always amazes me, this place, that I do not hear members of parliament tell these stories—don't you have any human stories that happen to you?


Let me return to the story of this poor woman. She was committed to a mental institution—they have leery names for them these days—and her little child was taken off her. Unfortunately for the social workers, the report was left—and I got hold of it. It said that the child was unhappy in the presence of the officers of the department. She was dragged away from her mother, crying her eyes out and screaming. And her mother was crying her eyes out and screaming whilst the child was dragged out by two police, who absolutely hated doing the job. They were really nice fellows. The social workers said they were doing the right thing. 'It's tough but we have to do this job.' If ever I have seen the thought police in operation it is those people, those social workers; they just love their power—sick and drunk with power.


God is good, because even though this woman had a nut case for a psychiatrist, he went on holidays and a lady psychiatrist was put in charge. She wrote: 'This woman is not now nor ever will be mentally unstable or in need of incarceration in an institution, now or in the future.' It was a scathing indictment of the psychologist, the social workers and the psychiatrist. That being the case, I immediately proceeded to go after the social workers involved in this shocking case.


The child's report said that in the presence of the social workers, the officers of the department, the child spontaneously burst out crying and hid under the bed. She got into the foster parents' bed and clung to the woman who was her foster mother for the time being. They said this was aberrant behaviour. Someone takes you—drags you—kicking and screaming away from your mother, who is bawling her eyes out and being held back by the police, and then you are sensitive towards the social worker. You are telling us in this place that these poor little mothers are going to be placed under the control of these people!


I will go on. The chief psychologist of North Queensland is a very wealthy fellow and a fellow I had very great respect for when he worked in children's services. He is one of the most excellent officers I ever worked with as a member of parliament. I rang him up concerning the woman in charge. I had said to her, 'I want the child returned to the mother,' and she said, 'No, we have to do assessments.' I said: 'There are no assessments. The child was taken because the mother was mentally unstable. It has now been determined, absolutely, that she is not mentally unstable and the social worker who deemed her to be mentally unstable has been sacked. You bundled her off as fast as you could get her out of the place. I know who was sick. It was the social worker who was sick. That is who was sick.' So I rang this psychologist, the most eminent psychologist in North Queensland at that time. I told him that the head of the department, when I started speaking to her on the telephone and said the daughter had to be returned, hyperventilated—she could not tolerate anyone standing up to her—and had to leave the telephone. I told the young bloke who came on the phone that I wanted her back on the telephone. He said, 'I think she's a bit sick.' I will tell you how sick she was. What she did next week was return the child to the father, which was an option that was available to her, just to prove that she had the power: 'The mother does not have the power, I have the power. No member of parliament will tell me what to do. I will return the child to the father!'


What has happened to that mother, we do not know. What has happened to that child, we do not know. But we know very much what the psychologist told me. He said that head of the children's services area, which was operating in this case, 'is clinically sick'. I do not know the term he used, but he used technical terms. He said, 'I'll tell you her symptoms.' He told me her symptoms, and I said, 'You're dead right, she is definitely sick.'


From my experience, particularly in the field of Indigenous affairs, where I was minister for the best part of a decade, I found that when people have absolute power it corrupts them absolutely. We had a case which is very much a matter of public record in Queensland. Pattie O'Shane said there were only two ministers in Queensland history. That was effectively correct. There were two heads of the department and both were there for 44 years. I will not go into the running of the department. Suffice it to say that the struggles between me and the forces in that department are the subject of two books that are on the reading list at the university.


When I was a young man, most people of reasonable intelligence read the book 1984 and learnt about Big Brother. This book is about a society in which we are all controlled. There are very few people's names that have become part of the language. 'Darwinian' is a word that has become part of our language and, along with the spectre of Big Brother in George Orwell's book, 'Orwellian' has also become part of the lexicon of our language. Big Brother said: 'We will look after you. We will see that you are fed and clothed. We will do these things for you.'


I must relate the story of a meeting I had the very great honour of attending. At this meeting Percy Neal, the chair at Yarrabah Shire Council, said to the minister—and I am not here to denigrate people so I will not mention the minister's name—'Minister, you're familiar with the term ""addiction""?' She said yes. He said, 'You would know then that the way you cure an addiction is to first admit it to it.' She said, 'Yes, of course, Percy.' She is a very well spoken woman and a very impressive woman. He said: 'Well, you see, you have an addiction. That addiction is that we blackfellas cannot look after ourselves, that we need you whitefellas to look after us. That is your addiction. You just cannot get it out of your heads that we can look after our own affairs.' And there are a lot of people in this parliament today who cannot get it out of their heads that we had to rescue that little woman, that child—that waif, trash or whatever term you might like to apply to her; you might say she is an unfortunate. Those are the sorts of terms you will use when you talk about this. But really, at the end of the day, you are now controlling that young woman's life. And it might surprise you or jade your middle- or upper-class values—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
) (18:19):  No, no, no, no, no. I do not have those prejudices so please do not direct those comments at me.




Mr KATTER:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would never in a million years consider you to be part of it.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I know, but just generalise it please.




Mr KATTER:
  Those people who have those attitudes shall now control the power to take away a child from a young mother. To you, they may be terrible mothers. To you, you may have to rescue the children. That was what was said in the old days of the stolen children. They said constantly that we had to rescue the children from people and the very unacceptable way in which they were living. But I know one of these young mothers—I went out with the daughter for a tiny little while. She pulled herself up and became a fully qualified and fully trained nurse and the director of nursing in a hospital. She became a leading member in the community and married the local dentist. She was tremendously successful. But you would have placed that mother under some sort of tutelage—and I use that word with aforethought.


One of my good friends was brought up by a teenage mother, and I am sure she would have been under this tutelage. He is one of the finest men I know. His son is a doctor. He has been a great leader. He has been a foreman with the main roads department. He is a great success story. There was another case from my home town. There was a little girl who could not have possibly have had a worse upbringing. But she is a very successful mother and has a very successful family. She loved her mother, even though her mother was not a good mother. Her son played football with my son. I think in six years they did not lose a game by less than 40 points. A brilliant footballer! He is a trained electrician now with a number of kids and a very happy family. So what you might see as a woman who needs to be controlled by a social worker, some of us would see as a little hero.



Sadly, the statistics in this country show that in 10 years, when I, the first of the baby boomers, die, there will be more deaths than births in this country. Why are women not having children in this country? It is because, as my daughters have said to me, if you are a mother and you want to stay at home and look after your kids, you are regarded as a second-class citizen. You really are socially ostracised and isolated. I am proud to say that most of my daughters have become stay-at-home mothers in spite of that and in spite of the fact that they were all on very big incomes. They were very successful people and they had to sacrifice a lot of income to take that decision. In the short time left to me, I cannot help but say that there are very strong racial overtones in this bill. Putting on my blackfella hat rather than my whitefella hat, I say that I resent very, very strongly the implications of this legislation. There will be very great sorrow and pain for the little mothers, who have been great heroes as far as I am concerned but who have committed the simple sin of wanting to have a child and be a mother. For that they will be punished by being put under the control of the social workers, whose tender mercies I have outlined here tonight. They are just some of the many things that are in the files in my office. (Time expired)

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (18:23):  It is always refreshing as a member in this House to come in and hear a member speak with the sort of passion that the previous speaker spoke with. You can see that the member for Kennedy cares desperately for the young women in his electorate and that he is committed to ensuring that kids are able to stay with their mums, have a family around them and not be penalised in any way. I do not see racial overtones in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011, and I would never adopt an approach which was all about using a stick and making life hard either for single parents or for people who are long-term unemployed. I do not believe that the best results are achieved by a 'stick' approach; I believe that you need to have an approach whereby you take people with you, and I can stand in this place and support this legislation.


The part of Shortland electorate that falls within the administration of Wyong Shire Council will be affected by this legislation. On first reading the legislation, I had a very similar reaction to those of the previous speaker and the member for Melbourne. But, after I looked at the details and attended some of the information sessions that were provided in my local area, I became quite excited about some of the advantages and benefits that the legislation will offer young people who are single parents and who are disadvantaged by their circumstances.


This legislation will put in place programs that will empower young people and put them in a situation where they can get the education and assistance they need. I understand the previous speaker's concerns, but there will be so many benefits associated with these programs. I commend this legislation to the House.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (19:00):  I rise to table a petition that clearly resonates deeply within the Australian community. This is evident by the number of signatures that we received—over 37,374—with thousands more still coming in, which will be presented next year. Lawn bowls plays a vital role in the community, especially in our rural communities. It allows people of all ages to remain active in both a social and competitive environment. A healthy body and mind lead to a healthy life.


It should be noted that lawn bowls does not appeal just to senior members of our community. A Sunday afternoon at the local lawn bowls club is fast becoming a social and cultural norm for generation X and Y. Since the advent of the Active After-school Communities program under the coalition government and sports minister Senator the Hon. Rod Kemp, the passion for lawn bowls has also been ignited in many schoolchildren.


Lawn bowls is not only one of the highest participation sports in the country, with over 800,000 people participating each year, but also one of the most viewed sports. The Moama International Tri Series on 28 May 2011 was viewed by around 500,000 people nationally. More than 200,000 people view bowls each week on the ABC. These viewer numbers do not warrant its cancellation after 30 years of very solid results. In my view the ABC's decision to cancel bowls runs contrary to its obligations under the charter.


Two months ago, as a director of Bowls Australia, I helped launch this important petition to get bowls back on the ABC at my local club, the Malvern Bowling Club, with my friend and colleague the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, shadow minister for seniors, and also with the Chairman of Bowls Australia, Joe Aarons OAM, and CEO Neil Dalrymple. We were joined by Commonwealth bronze medal champion Barrie Lester, who, at age 29, recounted to us the story of how his interest in the sport of lawn bowls was born out of watching it on the ABC. This is just further evidence of the importance of broadcasting lawn bowls on free-to-air TV if we want to encourage the next generation of champions in this country.


Before I hand over to my colleague Bronwyn Bishop to speak about the importance of the ABC charter, I present these 37,374 signatures in this petition to the House.




The petition read as follows—



To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives


This petition of Australian citizens draws the attention of the House to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's decision to cancel its broadcasting of lawn bowls on free-to-air television.


The ABC has a Charter set out in section 6 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 that states it should broadcast programs that contribute to a sense of national identity and inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community and further requires it to provide a balance between wide appeal and specialised broadcasting programs.


Lawn bowls is one of the highest participation sports in Australia with around 800,000 people playing lawn bowls each year.


66% of participants in the sport are over the age of 60 but it appeals across generations with many younger people participating socially in the sport, as well as children participating through structured programs such as the Australian Sports Commission's Active After Schools Program.


Bowling clubs are an important part of the Australian community, particularly in rural and regional Australia.


Over 300,000 people nationally on average view the bowls broadcast each week, increasing to just under 500,000 people for major tournaments.


The broadcast of lawn bowls on free-to-air TV not only provides a service to existing members but promotes and profiles lawn bowls to prospective participants.


We ask that the House support the immediate reinstatement of lawn bowls on the ABC.

"Scott, Bruce, MP",Nats,2011-11-23,"



Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (09:32):  I rise to discuss the reluctance of Labor, whether state or federal, to invest in regional Queensland ahead of one of the biggest resource booms that Queensland and our nation have ever seen. The Surat and Galilee basins, both within the boundaries of Maranoa, are a significant boost to the economy and we will potentially see a massive boost in population growth. A Deloitte Access Economics report, the 2020 growth outlook study into the state's minerals and energy sector, reveals that the Surat basin—that is, Dalby, Miles, Chinchilla, Roma and Wandoan—will need some 5,500 new resource sector workers by 2020, not to mention the population boost that will be necessary to staff the supporting industries. Also, forward projections found that the figure of 5,500 would at least triple when support workers are counted, and 55 per cent of the workforce is expected to comprise non-resident workers. That brings in the question of fly in, fly out workers.


What have the state and federal Labor governments done to prepare for this growth? With more than half the workforce expected to live outside of the resource communities, how will people be encouraged to relocate to the region? Where is the investment in the liveability of our region to attract young families into the community so that they can have the same support that you would expect in the capital cities—or indeed on the Sunshine Coast, where you live, Mr Deputy Speaker?


Our roads are in a terrible state of repair. We are still waiting for the second range crossing to be constructed, and yet every day the volume of traffic is increasing exponentially to bring in the materials to build the mining infrastructure. But we are not seeing the other elements being developed: the liveability of our communities and the road infrastructure.


Where is the investment in the community services? In the Galilee Basin, for instance, Barcaldine does not have a day care centre, which is essential if young families are going to be attracted to a community. As we know, both parents these days are more likely to work. So if they cannot have these facilities in their communities the young families leave the west—and yet this is where the great wealth of our community is being generated.



Speaking with local medical centres it is easy to see how the growth in the resources sector is impacting on our health services. In fact, some people in parts of the Maranoa electorate have a rate of preventable mortality of 1.8 to two times the norm. This figure is from a recent study. That is an appalling situation because of the lack of access to these services. I have heard reports recently from medical centres in Dalby that new patients are waiting up to eight weeks to see a doctor. This has serious flow-on effects, because new patients presenting with urgent medical problems have to be seen by doctors at the hospital where services are already stretched. It is time that the Labor government invested money from royalties in the resource sector in the liveability of our communities.(Time expired)

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:04):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 supports a package of related bills already passed by the Parliament. The package comprises the Business Names Registration Bill 2011, the Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011 and the Business Names Registration (Fees) Bill 2011. This package of legislation which was passed by the Parliament on 13 October 2011, along with subordinate legislation, will create a National Business Names Registration System.


The Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 will clarify the application of the consequential amendments to other Commonwealth Acts that were included in the Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011. The Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011 has been drafted such that currently both the transitional and most of the consequential amendments commence on the same day, prior to the commencement of the National Business Names Registration System. However the policy intention is for most of the consequential amendments to commence on the day that the national system commences. This bill clarifies that the consequential amendments to most other Commonwealth Acts will not apply until the national Business Names Registration System commences.


Currently businesses need to register their names in each state and territory in which they trade. The proposed national registration system to be administered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission will mean businesses will pay one fee to register nationally, using an online application process. An entity carrying on a business in Australia using a name other than its own will be required to register with ASIC. This will enable the identification of the entity behind the business name. The Commonwealth has no power to regulate all business names registrations in Australia therefore the establishment of a national Business Names Registration System and the legislation which underpins it relies on a referral of constitutional powers from the states to the Commonwealth. The states therefore must enact referral legislation to give effect to the national registration system. The Commonwealth legislation is drafted in such a way that the national system cannot commence if any state does not refer or adopt the legislation. Two states, Tasmania and New South Wales, have already enacted their referral legislation. Queensland has also passed its referral legislation. The new national registration system will commence after all states refer business names powers to the Commonwealth or adopt the Commonwealth legislation. It is envisaged that states will have completed this process by March 2012 and the national registration system will commence by the end of May 2012. It is important that the Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill is enacted before the end of March 2012 to ensure a smooth transition to the new system can be achieved. Full details are contained in the explanatory memoranda.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (10:08):  Thank you to my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary for an absolutely compelling case as to why the parliament should support this bill. There is nothing worse than consequential provisions that kick in before the consequence to which they relate has actually been achieved. The bill has identified a changeover date when a number of Commonwealth laws dealing with the tax system, the ANL Act, the Bank Integration Act, the Corporations Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act, Financial Transaction Reports Corporations Act, the Defence Service Home Act, Olympic Insignia Protection Act, Wine Australia Corporation Act and the Qantas Sale Act. There is no point in having all of those provisions activated prior to the national registration system actually commencing. We were alerted to this issue and had some good discussions with the responsible minister to not impede the passage of the legislation through both houses of parliament with the understanding that this amending provision would be coming through. The coalition is very supportive of this bill. It tidies up a technicality that needs to be tidied up so there is synchronicity with the changeover—that the changeover date sees the national business name system activated and then all of these other changes are brought into effect to coincide with that date. This whole idea about national business names registration is something the coalition supports. When we were talking about the substantive bill I pointed to the work that was instigated back in 2006-07 by the then coalition government and it is good to see that things are being moved along by the current government.


I will briefly touch on a couple of other points I raised in my contribution. I would put this under the watching brief that the coalition has on the implementation of the national business names system. There were a couple of issues that we know—



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  Thank you. Government Whip?




Mr Husic:
  Yes.




Mr BILLSON:
  I want to get the title right; I do not want to be discourteous. Thank you, Government Whip, for that encouragement. There are a couple of things that I think all stakeholders in this process were interested in, including the merging of state based business names registration into a national system. I am sure the parliamentary secretary would be aware of the potential for overlap there and the bill provides for geographical identifiers to be attached to names after that transition so that no one is disadvantaged. There is also some work to be done on a determination about certain names that would not be permissible and how potential conflicts or near-identical names would be handled. That work is ongoing but it certainly is an area that all stakeholders are interested in and will keep a watching brief on.


The other things I touched on briefly were the interplay between this system, domain names and trademarks, and how having some synchronisation with those various intellectual property and commercial identifier systems with the business names was a smart move. We hope that goes well. I know a number of us would like the domain name system to go back the other way and check with business names, to reduce the risk of ambush marketing but we have not quite got to that point yet because there are a whole lot of interjurisdictional issues there that I am sure the parliament will need to turn its mind to down the track, when it becomes more of a commercial concern.


I also touched on the issue of the ABN. You would be aware from your extensive parliamentary career, Deputy Speaker Slipper, that the ABN is not required by all persons involved in carrying out commerce in Australia. Certain thresholds for turnover and the nature of the business were factors that decided whether or not you needed an ABN. That was thought to be appropriate at the time but under the business names national framework an ABN is essential, otherwise you cannot get a business name. So whereas once microbusinesses might not have needed an ABN now they will need to, as not having an ABN will inhibit someone getting a registered business name and, under this law, to trade without a registered name is a strict liability offence. So now, all of a sudden, the ABN becomes a fundamental issue. 


I am alerted to ongoing concerns about the government's hostile disposition towards independent contractors. We have seen a number of examples where the government is making it quite difficult for independent contractors to carry out their legitimate contribution to our economy. In fact, there was another episode earlier this morning with the abolition of the entrepreneur tax offset. One of the spurious rationales given for that was that it would help delineate between independent contractors and traditional employees. They question implied is: why should an independent contractor, a self-employed person, get that very modest tax incentive whereas an employee may not? The answer is: the employee can go to the employer and talk about how things are going and not be completely consumed by the success, fate or otherwise of the enterprise within which they carry out their work. For an independent contractor, a self-employed person, that is their worry, directly. They are the ones who sit up at night wondering when the revenue is going to come in. 


There was a modest incentive of a 25 per cent tax offset for small businesses—whatever their structure—for income levels up to $50,000 and then that 25 per cent tapered down to nothing at $75,000. Again, the rationale, as spurious as it is, was that this somehow clouded the issue. This is part of a coordinated and calculated campaign to make independent contractors feel as if they are some blight on our economy, that self-employment is somehow an illegitimate way of pursuing a livelihood. I stand steadfastly opposed to that assertion that keeps rearing its head through the Gillard Labor government. A hope at some point the Labor Party takes account of the Prime Minister's Chifley address where she talked about the ambitions of working men and women and how being your own boss and starting your own business was a legitimate ambition for working men and women—a motive, an inspiration I can well relate to and my community can well relate to. It would be nice to see some policy consequence to those fine words, because to this point we have not seen that.


In closing, I did touch on the interplay between some intellectual property issues—the trademark registration process and business names—and I alluded to a local business person caught in a David and Goliath sort of arm wrestle with a global company who has decided that the business name they have been operating under for some years—Global Gas, which deals with issues of measurement and verification of energy and gas, is somehow infringing against Global GAP. The irony is that 'GAP' as near as it is—yes, it is three letters and two of them happen to be 'G' and 'A', and there is a difference at the end—but the 'GAP' is actually an acronym for an agricultural certification known as 'good agricultural practice'. 


This operation is born out of Europe. It was previously known as Europe GAP. It started in 1997 and was designed to give retailers confidence that food that was being purchased was being farmed and processed in a way that minimised detrimental environmental impact. Good stuff—no problem with that. But to then say that Global GAP, being a private sector body that sets voluntary standards for the certification of production processes of agriculture, including aquaculture, for products around the world to help consumers and retailers somehow is being infringed upon by a Mornington Peninsula-based company dealing with the measurement of gas is, I find, quite offensive. 


What has been brought to this task and what is yet another example of the David and Goliath battle that so many small businesses face is that they have been slapped with a good, weighty volume as to why they are offending the intellectual property rights of an agricultural certification outfit in Europe which has no crossover in terms of markets, no risk of confusion. In fact, 'Gas' is a proper noun and GAP in this context is an acronym. It is really quite spurious. A multinational is slapping down a small business and using their commercial weight and the legal tools to the disadvantage of that small business that has a legitimate right to access the name that they have been trading under for many years.


Here is an example of where intellectual property intersects with business names, and I touched earlier on the domain name area. I am pleased that this national business registration process has an eye to those issues—although, if you feel you are being infringed upon, it is still up to you to fight the good fight and find all the lawyers and the cash. And you are still potentially vulnerable to this kind of quite predatory behaviour of frightening a small business out of a legitimate name that they have every right to use for some spurious argument that was presented in a nice, meaty folder by a very, very reputable law firm. But the money you spend does not equate with the strength of your argument. I hope Mr Sokol gets a fair go, as IP Australia considers this issue. I urge them to consider this application on its merits. The two business names at question present some superficial similarities, but that does not amount to a risk of confusion, commercial detriment or an infringement on intellectual property, as the enterprises, industries, markets, customers and services provided are distinctly different. Gee, I hope Global Gas gets a fair go. The coalition supports these amendments and hopes the national business name registration system rolls out quite well.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (10:19):  If will start with a startling claim: I often enjoy listening to the speeches from the member for Dunkley. I would enjoy them more if they had some connection to reality. We did have a number of spurious claims that were being made in that contribution, which started well and then just diverted into a direct lift out of 'Conspiracy News dotcom', making all sorts of suggestions about whether or not we had taken a position that was opposed to the role of independent contractors in the small-business sector. For a lot of these small businesses it has been liberating to be able to have the opportunity to set their own businesses up and control the way they operate in our modern economy. We have been strong supporters of providing the means and the wherewithal for independent contractors to exist. These contractors had a hard enough time—given that those opposite, when in government, refused to provide the proper and adequate support to the Trade Practices Act in dealing with a range of different issues, from creeping acquisitions through to predatory pricing. Predatory pricing in particular is of deep concern to small business but was not acted upon by the other side.


They talk about support for small business but they introduced the GST. This is something that even today causes small businesses to scratch their heads in frustration—MYOB, putting in the BAS statements and the red tape that comes with it. That was brought upon them by that side of politics, which claims it has the interests of small business at heart. They talk about IP issues, for example. I actually agree with the member for Dunkley. I think IP issues are a big way multinationals try to stifle the creativity of small Australian firms. It is a serious issue, but it is not something that has cropped up overnight. 


In fact, I recall that a small business in New South Wales, my home state, was being pursued by a US firm over, of all things, a claim to patent the name 'Ugg Boot', which we are all familiar with; we know it is an Australian icon, and it has taken off, particularly in the US. This firm had attempted to muscle out a New South Wales business by using the patent system or the trading system to force them out of using the name. This occurred during the period of the Howard government in which representations had been made to IP Australia to move quickly on this and deal with it. They had the power to fix this, but they did not. Again, they failed to stand up for small business, which they claim is their bread-and-butter constituency. They failed to stand up for them on trade practices, they failed to stand up for them on red tape and they failed to stand up for them on trademarks and patents.


This week we have seen, as a result of late consideration by the parliament—into about three o'clock this morning—11 bills passed to give effect to the minerals resource rent tax. This will provide 2.7 million businesses with a huge shot in the arm—a $6,500 instant tax write-off. A few weeks ago I conducted 10 mobile offices in my electorate of Chifley. I went out and took the opportunity to speak to small businesses, to ask them how they were going and what they were facing. And they were interested to know what was being done for them. It is with huge pride that I can say that, as a result of a significant reform in the form of the minerals resource rent tax, the wealth under the ground that is owned by Australians is going to be shared above ground. These arrangements not only will mean a great deal to the other side of the country but will also benefit businesses across the eastern seaboard and across all parts of this country. It is a big deal.


For example, a cafe owner told me that when his refrigerated sandwich bar broke down he was faced with a choice: either find $5,000 out of his own funds or try to claim it from insurance. The prospect of increased premiums was something he did not cherish, and he had to pay out of his own funds to deal with that repair. These are the types of things small businesses will be able to get assistance with from 1 July next year as a result of the deliberations of the parliament last night and the moves made by this government to ensure that the benefits of the mining boom spread.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Perhaps I could draw to the attention of the Government Whip that we are not debating the bills that were voted on earlier this morning. We are in fact debating the Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011.




Mr HUSIC:
  We were not, actually.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Consequential amendments.




Mr HUSIC:
  At any rate, I certainly accept what has been said. I am proud of the things we have done for small business, and this reform, Mr Deputy Speaker, is another element of that reform process. We have a multiplicity of registration systems within this country and we are trying to ensure that there is a uniform system in place. I am particularly pleased about the involvement of ASIC and having registration and oversight through ASIC. That is an important measure that gives a great degree of confidence to small business.


I referred earlier to independent contractors and small businesses that set up, particularly in this day and age where there is a lot more freedom for people to do that. Importantly, as a result of what we are doing in another reform, the National Broadband Network, people will be able to trade in other parts of the country and the world more easily, but they will not want to wade through the red tape of business registration. We have made that uniform.


I certainly commend the states that have worked with the federal government. As the parliamentary secretary indicated earlier, there needs to be a referral process. These powers do not exist themselves in the hands of the federal government so it did require cooperative federalism to ensure that, as the parliamentary secretary said in his second reading speech, by May next year this system will take effect.


The amendments before the House will ensure that, as a result of the broader legislation which gives effect to these reforms and which was passed in October this year, when the system does kick in things will be harmonised and start at the same time. It is a common-sense proposition that, if you trade in this country, particularly with the ability to trade across borders and being able to reach out and collaborate with people in different parts of the country, you should not have to wade through paperwork in order to set up your business elsewhere. I am sure that small businesses will welcome the fact that they will be able to set up small business concerns and know that in one part of the country the process will be the same as exists in the other parts.


Tasmania and New South Wales have already signed up and other states will be ready to sign up by March. By May this system will kick in and will provide tangible benefits to small business. It is a demonstration of how cooperative federalism can deliver in a significant way for the economy. I commend this very sensible set of amendments and the overall reform. If you will excuse my enthusiasm, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think a lot of good things are being done for small business in this country by this government. This is another step along that path and I certainly commend the legislation to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:28):  It is a great pleasure to speak again on this bill, with the amendments included. As a former small business owner of 10 years I know the benefits and joys of being in business, but I also know that it can be onerous at times, particularly with red tape and regulation. Prior to this bill being introduced, each state and territory had a different requirement for businesses to register. In this era of federalism, under a national system in Australia, it is completely ludicrous that any business, particularly small and micro businesses, should have to incur the cost of registering their business name in each state and territory, particularly given that the costs vary in each state and territory. The cost in Canberra was, I think, $130 to get my business registered for five years or something, and in Victoria it was $70 for three years. It is not just the difference in the cost between the states and territories; it is also the difference in the time span in terms of how long you have the business registration name. The difficulty with that too is that you have to be constantly aware of when these things expire as well as try to find this extra money—another imposition on business. As my colleague has mentioned, this government has done a great deal for small business and this is another way of harmonising and reducing the burden of red tape for small business. I do commend the government for introducing a range of measures to harmonise the management of businesses in Australia, and this is one of them.


The purpose of this bill is to clarify that the consequential amendments to other Commonwealth acts made under the Business Names Registration Bill will not apply until the National Business Names Registration System commences. The legislation was drafted so that most of the consequential amendments will commence on the same day prior to the commencement of the National Business Names Registration System. The policy intention is for most of the consequential amendments to commence on the day that the national system commences, with the transitional provisions commencing earlier. The consequential amendments are to a number of other Commonwealth acts that commence around two months before the commencement of the National Business Names Registration System. Given that these amendments give effect to activities under the national system, it would be impractical for them to commence before the system actually begins.


The application bill has been drafted as a separate bill dealing with the application of provisions rather than attempting to amend the commencement table in the transitional bill. The new application provisions are set out in a separate piece of legislation rather than in the transitional bill itself. They do not directly amend the text of the transitional bill but just clarify when and how certain provisions in that bill will apply. 


We as a government are very keen to ensure that businesses—small businesses, micro businesses—can succeed. We have introduced a range of measures that will reduce company tax and provide small businesses with instant asset write-offs and improve the amount that they can actually write off over a tax year. This is just another measure that will reduce regulation and red tape for businesses. It will make it easier for Australians to succeed in business, to manage their business, to administer their business and, hopefully, to increase their productivity and the success of their business. I commend this bill. It is in the tradition of Labor reform in the small business sector and the micro business sector. As I said, having had my own small business, it can become pretty tiresome filling out endless forms, and having to do it in each state and territory in order to run a business across the nation—to trade in different parts of the nation—is completely ludicrous. I welcome this bill and the amendments to it.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:33):  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those members who have contributed to the debate, particularly those who are still in the chamber—the member for Chifley and also the member for Canberra. I note that the House always welcomes the opportunity to hear from the member for Canberra because she is someone who not only has a strong commitment to small business but also brings to this debate the insights that one would expect from someone who has run and owned her own small business. This comes through in the quality of the insights that she is always able to provide.


This bill supports a package of three bills, already passed by the parliament, which establish a National Business Names Registration System. The bill makes some small technical changes concerning the application of consequential amendments to 10 Commonwealth acts. However, it is part of a much larger initiative being implemented under the Council of Australian Governments seamless national economy reform agenda.


Fragmented and inconsistent regulation across Australia makes it harder to do business and adds to the compliance burden for business. The existing approach to registering business names reflects this. A National Business Names Registration System will make a practical difference for businesses right around Australia. 


Businesses using a trading name and operating across state and territory boundaries will no longer have to register a business name in every state and territory they operate in. Businesses operating in only one state or territory will also benefit, with a three-year registration fee of around $70, compared to fees of $160 for a new registration in New South Wales and $255.60 in Queensland. All businesses using a trading name will also benefit from the streamlined online business name application process, which will make applying for a business name a faster and easier process.


Combined with related initiatives such as the Australian Business Licence Information Service and the Australian business account, the National Business Names Registration System is estimated to provide benefits of $1.5 billion over eight years to business, government and consumers. The Australian Business Licence Information Service, a new whole-of-government online service, will deliver information about licences, registrations, permits and assistance to business from all levels of government. Such customised information about regulatory requirements will simplify the process of starting a business and save existing businesses valuable time. The Australian business account will be an online account for managing ongoing business interactions with all levels of government. The account will help businesses take control of their regulatory activities online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and save time through prefilling and submitting forms online where available. Businesses will be able to access key registrations, monitor their compliance requirements and subscribe to regulatory change notifications, business development opportunities and other important information.


The states must enact referral legislation to give effect to the national business names registration system, and so far referral legislation has been passed by the parliaments of Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland. Legislation is also currently before the Victorian parliament, with South Australia and Western Australia set to introduce legislation shortly.


All jurisdictions have worked hard to deliver a national business names registration system, and the Australian government would like to take this opportunity to thank state and territory governments and their officials for their commitment to this important reform. Depending on the passage of referral legislation through remaining state parliaments, the national system will start at the end of May 2012. Once it is operational, I know businesses across Australia will appreciate the time and money saved by this important reform.


I thank members of the contributions they have made to this debate on the Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 and I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:04):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 supports a package of related bills already passed by the Parliament. The package comprises the Business Names Registration Bill 2011, the Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011 and the Business Names Registration (Fees) Bill 2011. This package of legislation which was passed by the Parliament on 13 October 2011, along with subordinate legislation, will create a National Business Names Registration System.


The Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 will clarify the application of the consequential amendments to other Commonwealth Acts that were included in the Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011. The Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011 has been drafted such that currently both the transitional and most of the consequential amendments commence on the same day, prior to the commencement of the National Business Names Registration System. However the policy intention is for most of the consequential amendments to commence on the day that the national system commences. This bill clarifies that the consequential amendments to most other Commonwealth Acts will not apply until the national Business Names Registration System commences.


Currently businesses need to register their names in each state and territory in which they trade. The proposed national registration system to be administered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission will mean businesses will pay one fee to register nationally, using an online application process. An entity carrying on a business in Australia using a name other than its own will be required to register with ASIC. This will enable the identification of the entity behind the business name. The Commonwealth has no power to regulate all business names registrations in Australia therefore the establishment of a national Business Names Registration System and the legislation which underpins it relies on a referral of constitutional powers from the states to the Commonwealth. The states therefore must enact referral legislation to give effect to the national registration system. The Commonwealth legislation is drafted in such a way that the national system cannot commence if any state does not refer or adopt the legislation. Two states, Tasmania and New South Wales, have already enacted their referral legislation. Queensland has also passed its referral legislation. The new national registration system will commence after all states refer business names powers to the Commonwealth or adopt the Commonwealth legislation. It is envisaged that states will have completed this process by March 2012 and the national registration system will commence by the end of May 2012. It is important that the Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill is enacted before the end of March 2012 to ensure a smooth transition to the new system can be achieved. Full details are contained in the explanatory memoranda.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (10:08):  Thank you to my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary for an absolutely compelling case as to why the parliament should support this bill. There is nothing worse than consequential provisions that kick in before the consequence to which they relate has actually been achieved. The bill has identified a changeover date when a number of Commonwealth laws dealing with the tax system, the ANL Act, the Bank Integration Act, the Corporations Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act, Financial Transaction Reports Corporations Act, the Defence Service Home Act, Olympic Insignia Protection Act, Wine Australia Corporation Act and the Qantas Sale Act. There is no point in having all of those provisions activated prior to the national registration system actually commencing.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (10:19):  If will start with a startling claim: I often enjoy listening to the speeches from the member for Dunkley. I would enjoy them more if they had some connection to reality. We did have a number of spurious claims that were being made in that contribution, which started well and then just diverted into a direct lift out of 'Conspiracy News dotcom', making all sorts of suggestions about whether or not we had taken a position that was opposed to the role of independent contractors in the small-business sector. For a lot of these small businesses it has been liberating to be able to have the opportunity to set their own businesses up and control the way they operate in our modern economy. We have been strong supporters of providing the means and the wherewithal for independent contractors to exist. These contractors had a hard enough time—given that those opposite, when in government, refused to provide the proper and adequate support to the Trade Practices Act in dealing with a range of different issues, from creeping acquisitions through to predatory pricing. Predatory pricing in particular is of deep concern to small business but was not acted upon by the other side.


They talk about support for small business but they introduced the GST. This is something that even today causes small businesses to scratch their heads in frustration—MYOB, putting in the BAS statements and the red tape that comes with it. That was brought upon them by that side of politics, which claims it has the interests of small business at heart. They talk about IP issues, for example. I actually agree with the member for Dunkley. I think IP issues are a big way multinationals try to stifle the creativity of small Australian firms. It is a serious issue, but it is not something that has cropped up overnight. 


In fact, I recall that a small business in New South Wales, my home state, was being pursued by a US firm over, of all things, a claim to patent the name 'Ugg Boot', which we are all familiar with; we know it is an Australian icon, and it has taken off, particularly in the US. This firm had attempted to muscle out a New South Wales business by using the patent system or the trading system to force them out of using the name. This occurred during the period of the Howard government in which representations had been made to IP Australia to move quickly on this and deal with it. They had the power to fix this, but they did not. Again, they failed to stand up for small business, which they claim is their bread-and-butter constituency. They failed to stand up for them on trade practices, they failed to stand up for them on red tape and they failed to stand up for them on trademarks and patents.


This week we have seen, as a result of late consideration by the parliament—into about three o'clock this morning—11 bills passed to give effect to the minerals resource rent tax. This will provide 2.7 million businesses with a huge shot in the arm—a $6,500 instant tax write-off. A few weeks ago I conducted 10 mobile offices in my electorate of Chifley. I went out and took the opportunity to speak to small businesses, to ask them how they were going and what they were facing. And they were interested to know what was being done for them. It is with huge pride that I can say that, as a result of a significant reform in the form of the minerals resource rent tax, the wealth under the ground that is owned by Australians is going to be shared above ground. These arrangements not only will mean a great deal to the other side of the country but will also benefit businesses across the eastern seaboard and across all parts of this country. It is a big deal.


For example, a cafe owner told me that when his refrigerated sandwich bar broke down he was faced with a choice: either find $5,000 out of his own funds or try to claim it from insurance. The prospect of increased premiums was something he did not cherish, and he had to pay out of his own funds to deal with that repair. These are the types of things small businesses will be able to get assistance with from 1 July next year as a result of the deliberations of the parliament last night and the moves made by this government to ensure that the benefits of the mining boom spread.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Perhaps I could draw to the attention of the Government Whip that we are not debating the bills that were voted on earlier this morning. We are in fact debating the Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011.




Mr HUSIC:
  We were not, actually.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Consequential amendments.




Mr HUSIC:
  At any rate, I certainly accept what has been said. I am proud of the things we have done for small business, and this reform, Mr Deputy Speaker, is another element of that reform process. We have a multiplicity of registration systems within this country and we are trying to ensure that there is a uniform system in place. I am particularly pleased about the involvement of ASIC and having registration and oversight through ASIC. That is an important measure that gives a great degree of confidence to small business.


I referred earlier to independent contractors and small businesses that set up, particularly in this day and age where there is a lot more freedom for people to do that. Importantly, as a result of what we are doing in another reform, the National Broadband Network, people will be able to trade in other parts of the country and the world more easily, but they will not want to wade through the red tape of business registration. We have made that uniform.


I certainly commend the states that have worked with the federal government. As the parliamentary secretary indicated earlier, there needs to be a referral process. These powers do not exist themselves in the hands of the federal government so it did require cooperative federalism to ensure that, as the parliamentary secretary said in his second reading speech, by May next year this system will take effect.


The amendments before the House will ensure that, as a result of the broader legislation which gives effect to these reforms and which was passed in October this year, when the system does kick in things will be harmonised and start at the same time. It is a common-sense proposition that, if you trade in this country, particularly with the ability to trade across borders and being able to reach out and collaborate with people in different parts of the country, you should not have to wade through paperwork in order to set up your business elsewhere. I am sure that small businesses will welcome the fact that they will be able to set up small business concerns and know that in one part of the country the process will be the same as exists in the other parts.


Tasmania and New South Wales have already signed up and other states will be ready to sign up by March. By May this system will kick in and will provide tangible benefits to small business. It is a demonstration of how cooperative federalism can deliver in a significant way for the economy. I commend this very sensible set of amendments and the overall reform. If you will excuse my enthusiasm, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think a lot of good things are being done for small business in this country by this government. This is another step along that path and I certainly commend the legislation to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:28):  It is a great pleasure to speak again on this bill, with the amendments included. As a former small business owner of 10 years I know the benefits and joys of being in business, but I also know that it can be onerous at times, particularly with red tape and regulation. Prior to this bill being introduced, each state and territory had a different requirement for businesses to register. In this era of federalism, under a national system in Australia, it is completely ludicrous that any business, particularly small and micro businesses, should have to incur the cost of registering their business name in each state and territory, particularly given that the costs vary in each state and territory. The cost in Canberra was, I think, $130 to get my business registered for five years or something, and in Victoria it was $70 for three years. It is not just the difference in the cost between the states and territories; it is also the difference in the time span in terms of how long you have the business registration name. The difficulty with that too is that you have to be constantly aware of when these things expire as well as try to find this extra money—another imposition on business. As my colleague has mentioned, this government has done a great deal for small business and this is another way of harmonising and reducing the burden of red tape for small business. I do commend the government for introducing a range of measures to harmonise the management of businesses in Australia, and this is one of them.


The purpose of this bill is to clarify that the consequential amendments to other Commonwealth acts made under the Business Names Registration Bill will not apply until the National Business Names Registration System commences. The legislation was drafted so that most of the consequential amendments will commence on the same day prior to the commencement of the National Business Names Registration System. The policy intention is for most of the consequential amendments to commence on the day that the national system commences, with the transitional provisions commencing earlier. The consequential amendments are to a number of other Commonwealth acts that commence around two months before the commencement of the National Business Names Registration System. Given that these amendments give effect to activities under the national system, it would be impractical for them to commence before the system actually begins.


The application bill has been drafted as a separate bill dealing with the application of provisions rather than attempting to amend the commencement table in the transitional bill. The new application provisions are set out in a separate piece of legislation rather than in the transitional bill itself. They do not directly amend the text of the transitional bill but just clarify when and how certain provisions in that bill will apply. 


We as a government are very keen to ensure that businesses—small businesses, micro businesses—can succeed. We have introduced a range of measures that will reduce company tax and provide small businesses with instant asset write-offs and improve the amount that they can actually write off over a tax year. This is just another measure that will reduce regulation and red tape for businesses. It will make it easier for Australians to succeed in business, to manage their business, to administer their business and, hopefully, to increase their productivity and the success of their business. I commend this bill. It is in the tradition of Labor reform in the small business sector and the micro business sector. As I said, having had my own small business, it can become pretty tiresome filling out endless forms, and having to do it in each state and territory in order to run a business across the nation—to trade in different parts of the nation—is completely ludicrous. I welcome this bill and the amendments to it.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:33):  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those members who have contributed to the debate, particularly those who are still in the chamber—the member for Chifley and also the member for Canberra. I note that the House always welcomes the opportunity to hear from the member for Canberra because she is someone who not only has a strong commitment to small business but also brings to this debate the insights that one would expect from someone who has run and owned her own small business. This comes through in the quality of the insights that she is always able to provide.


This bill supports a package of three bills, already passed by the parliament, which establish a National Business Names Registration System. The bill makes some small technical changes concerning the application of consequential amendments to 10 Commonwealth acts. However, it is part of a much larger initiative being implemented under the Council of Australian Governments seamless national economy reform agenda.


Fragmented and inconsistent regulation across Australia makes it harder to do business and adds to the compliance burden for business. The existing approach to registering business names reflects this. A National Business Names Registration System will make a practical difference for businesses right around Australia. 


Businesses using a trading name and operating across state and territory boundaries will no longer have to register a business name in every state and territory they operate in. Businesses operating in only one state or territory will also benefit, with a three-year registration fee of around $70, compared to fees of $160 for a new registration in New South Wales and $255.60 in Queensland. All businesses using a trading name will also benefit from the streamlined online business name application process, which will make applying for a business name a faster and easier process.


Combined with related initiatives such as the Australian Business Licence Information Service and the Australian business account, the National Business Names Registration System is estimated to provide benefits of $1.5 billion over eight years to business, government and consumers. The Australian Business Licence Information Service, a new whole-of-government online service, will deliver information about licences, registrations, permits and assistance to business from all levels of government. Such customised information about regulatory requirements will simplify the process of starting a business and save existing businesses valuable time. The Australian business account will be an online account for managing ongoing business interactions with all levels of government. The account will help businesses take control of their regulatory activities online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and save time through prefilling and submitting forms online where available. Businesses will be able to access key registrations, monitor their compliance requirements and subscribe to regulatory change notifications, business development opportunities and other important information.


The states must enact referral legislation to give effect to the national business names registration system, and so far referral legislation has been passed by the parliaments of Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland. Legislation is also currently before the Victorian parliament, with South Australia and Western Australia set to introduce legislation shortly.


All jurisdictions have worked hard to deliver a national business names registration system, and the Australian government would like to take this opportunity to thank state and territory governments and their officials for their commitment to this important reform. Depending on the passage of referral legislation through remaining state parliaments, the national system will start at the end of May 2012. Once it is operational, I know businesses across Australia will appreciate the time and money saved by this important reform.


I thank members of the contributions they have made to this debate on the Business Names Registration (Application of Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 and I commend the bill to the House.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (10:39):  I welcome the opportunity today to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity report, Inquiry into integrity testing. I note that other members of the committee are also present, so I will not take too much time today. With my background—a couple of years in the Federal Police and, after that, in the military police—matters to do with law enforcement have always been of great interest to me. When I look back on my time in the Federal Police in particular I can say that I certainly never saw any form of corruption. There was a time when I was working briefly in the AFP drug squad in Sydney when there were comments made about making sure that desks were cleared when particular officers of the New South Police were coming into the building for a meeting, so I suspect that there were issues with corruption in New South Wales, particularly at that point in time—this was in 1986 and 1987. But in my time in the Australian Federal Police I never saw any problems. Even to this day, when you look at the law enforcement organisations within the Commonwealth—and I refer to the AFP, the Australian Crime Commission and Customs—there is reason for all of us to have great confidence in the professionalism and standards in all cases in those organisations.


That is not to say that we should not be prepared. That is where we are at with regards to the matter of integrity testing. I will take one definition of 'integrity testing' from the report, the one from the Attorney-General's Department:


... integrity testing refers to the act of covertly placing an officer in a simulated situation designed to test whether they will respond in a manner that is illegal, unethical or otherwise in contravention of the required standard of integrity. The test must provide the subject with an equal opportunity to pass or fail the test. Depending on its severity, the consequences of failing integrity tests can include disciplinary action, termination of employment or criminal charges.


Integrity testing has a fairly brief history, first occurring, according to information received, in the 1970s in the New York Police Department.


In the submissions and evidence, there was a bit of a tendency for the focus to be on some very low-level aspects of integrity testing. The classic scenario—and I will apply this to the ACT, although obviously, as I said before, I have complete confidence in the AFP and the ACT branch of the AFP—is that of a lost wallet being handed in to a particular officer and checking to see whether that officer follows correct procedures. That was a classic integrity test—the baseline integrity test. But it was my view, and the committee truly embraced this as we moved through, that in the Commonwealth environment there is access to information that can be of great value through these law enforcement agencies—the AFP, the Crime Commission and Customs. This might be information about criminal matters or a range of other things. Criminal organisations such as bikie gangs would see great value in trying to subvert an officer of the crown within one of these agencies to try and acquire information from them. It is particularly in the area of information security that integrity testing is going to be required in the future. Any person who has the opportunity to access information should have their integrity tested.


When I was in the Australian Federal Police working in Western Australia a number of officers of the WA police came to grief, you might say, professionally because they would use the police computer system to access the licence information of ordinary members of the public. This was very low-level stuff. As I heard it and as it was reported at the time, it sometimes involved looking up the address of an attractive driver who had been pulled over. Nevertheless, there were very poor standards there. That is the thin end of the wedge in terms of information control and integrity and the need for measures to be in place to assess the risks and to assess individuals. I am sure that others will speak this morning as well on the difference between targeted and random integrity testing. As a committee, we were very fond of the notion of targeted integrity testing, which is when there is reason to look at a person's behaviour and to place in front of them opportunities to make a positive or a negative decision. Targeted integrity testing is certainly what the committee is most keen on. Recommendation 3, in fact, is that integrity testing needs to be available to those agencies that come under ACLEI's responsibility—the AFP, the Crime Commission and Customs. Those organisations need to have access to integrity testing.


I have spoken a little bit about the report. I would like to finish by reiterating that I have great confidence in the professional standards of the AFP, the Crime Commission and Customs and in the ability of ACLEI to control and to be appropriately involved in integrity testing on behalf of and together with those agencies. I do not think that we have a significant problem in this country. But the reality is that, where there is information about crimes, drugs, the government and defence contracts there will always be the opportunity for someone to make money by acquiring it. People will always try to reach out to officers of the Commonwealth to try to subvert them and get them to acquire information for them. That is why we need to have these integrity testing measures in place to make sure that action can be taken when there is suspicion. I endorse the report. The members of the committee have gotten it right with this most excellent report.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (10:47):  Most members of this place are aware that before coming here I spent many years representing police officers within various Australian police jurisdictions. One of the things that I know is that police and law enforcement officers take the issues of integrity and honesty very seriously. I acknowledge that the member for Cowan was a police officer with both the Australian Federal Police and the military police. As he said, there have been issues in various police jurisdictions. Some of those issues were particularly brought to light by a New South Wales inquiry of 1987 that I remember very well, the Wood royal commission. That went out and used various measures in pursuing its investigations into corruption within the New South Wales Police Force.


History is often rewritten a little. In terms of that measure of corruption, it was largely contained in that particular instance to essentially one command that was operating at that stage in and about Kings Cross. That gave rise to various things, including the current popularity of the term 'underbelly'. Having worked for a long time with police officers and having grown up in a police family, I know the mindset of the police. I have interviewed police on many occasions, including police giving evidence in witness boxes. I have many times put the question directly to them as to why they chose to join the police force, knowing the rigours of the occupation and knowing all the restrictions that it puts on not only your professional but your private life. Invariably what comes back to me is that they chose to join the police to make a difference. It was the case then and in the very modern world now, when there is clearly a far more professional base to policing, it is the case too.


The other thing I would like to talk about is that the issue of organised crime was put on the agenda by the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, in 2008 in his National Security Statement. He elevated organised crime to be up there with terrorism. Organised crime, it was said at that stage, was costing this country between $10 billion and $15 billion a year and certainly was impacting very much on communities. Maybe some did not appreciate it because the effects do not necessarily directly impact on various members of the community, but nevertheless the community is footing the bill for those things. 




Sitting suspended from 10:51 to 10:56





Mr HAYES:
  As I was saying, the issue of serious and organised crime was put on the national agenda by the Prime Minister's National Security Statement in 2008. What followed from that? We took various measures—some people might refer to them as draconian measures—to fight terrorism, to ensure that the Australian people would be safe, as far as possible, from a terrorist act in this country impacting on our community. Organised crime was seen for the first time as an issue of national security, and various pieces of legislation were also developed to give enhanced powers to law enforcement.


Some of these matters have been on hand for some time, but we gave bodies such as the National Crime Authority, which subsequently became the Australian Crime Commission, extraordinary powers—the powers of a standing royal commission. I referred a little earlier to the Wood royal commission, which was a very powerful commission into policing in New South Wales. There have been many inquiries into other police agencies or law enforcement agencies, but what we established in this instance was the ability to use coercive powers to attack serious and organised crime. For the first time, you could be called before this organisation—the NCA, now the ACC—and questioned. Now there is no right to silence; trying to exercise that would simply see you incarcerated until you decided to cooperate. Some would refer to these powers as draconian; many lawyers do. But they were made to give law enforcement the ability to actually fight serious and organised crime. And it is not just the Australian Crime Commission; it is the Australian Federal Police as well, and Customs.


What goes with these increases in power is the need for us to ensure that power is not being abused, and that, as far as possible, we can assure the Australian public that these agencies are free from corruption. To that end, we established the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which oversees the Australian Crime Commission and its activities, as well as, more recently, the Australian Federal Police and the activities of Australian Customs and border control. These are areas where we do need to ensure that the powers are not being abused. Where we have increased officers' powers we must ensure they are being used as intended—to protect our community.


I know the notion of integrity testing is challenging for some. But, having been around police circles for a long while, I know that whether it is specifically referred to or not it is certain that most police internal standards agencies—whether by design or by the way they construe their operations—would certainly be out there to weed out what they might refer to as 'bad apples' in their organisation. That has probably gone on for a long time. Many of these activities may have been considered illegal in themselves. For instance, setting an officer up by constructing a situation which could invoke an illegal activity such as taking of property might be construed by the courts as entrapment. Maybe in policing circles that might have been considered at one point in time as a fair effort to ensure the integrity of those officers who are operating within a particular command.


Various changes have been made, and certainly many of the state and territory jurisdictions have had integrity testing in operation now for some time, and that has been based on intelligence gathering. It has not been like the 'New York experience', as some have referred to it as, where these things occurred randomly—perhaps a wallet is dropped to see how an officer may react, et cetera. That is using a very crude example, I suppose. Most agencies have developed an ability to ensure, on the basis of intelligence, a mechanism to test officers' integrity by a specifically designed police operation. This is something that is relatively new for the Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to consider. As a consequence, we took evidence from each of the various policing agencies around the county to establish what was occurring—maybe not necessarily specifically provided for in various legislation but what was actually occurring in contemporary policing to ensure the integrity of police, and through that the community. The inquiry was initiated in July of last year. To that extent is was a relatively short inquiry, one which gave us the opportunity to take on board the evidence of the respective jurisdictions and those professional standards agencies within those jurisdictions with the responsibility of looking after professional standards within their commands.


The recommendations which have already been cited by the member for Fremantle when she delivered her report to parliament are not designed to be an impediment to policing; they are certainly designed to be a measure to ensure as far as possible that law enforcement, particularly under the Australian jurisdiction, that being the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and Customs agencies, are free from corrupt activity. We recommend in our report that this not be simply developed as a routine or ad hoc position to be adopted. It should be provided as a measure which is based on intelligence. Where police internal standards may suspect an officer then they will have the ability to construct a situation to test the integrity of an officer or group of officers. We have set guidelines for how that would occur. One of the things that we have required in respect of those integrity operations is that the Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity must be advised formally of the operation being considered and also the results of its deployment.


In this respect, we see the Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity being another check and balance, not only protecting the integrity of those organisations but ensuring that we operate integrity testing throughout those jurisdictions in a way that respects the intention of the provisions recommended to government. We also recommend that various pieces of legislation be amended to ensure that controlled operations can take place without jeopardising the legal status of officers, particularly those officers in the Professional Standards Command, who are undertaking these operations such that their activities do not constitute them committing an offence.


I would like to reiterate that this has all been developed with a view to ensuring the utmost integrity of our law enforcement agencies so we can assure the community that, as far as possible, the agencies will remain, as they are now, virtually corruption free. We will do everything that we can to support the work of police internal professional standards, which, by the way, also has a direct relationship, albeit at the moment not a formal relationship, with the Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity. Enhancing that can only be good for professional policing and can only be good for the community.


As I say, I have spent many years representing police in most Australian police jurisdictions. I know from my ongoing contact with them that they do not see this as an impediment to them and they certainly do not see this as a slight to the integrity of their members. They do see this as a further reinforcement that we are working to ensure the ongoing corruption-free nature of policing. After all, I do not see that we are going to be winding back police powers; if anything, it will be the opposite. In order to protect and enhance community safety, I am sure greater powers will be given to policing over time. Every time we do that, we must ensure the appropriate checks and balances are in place.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:08):  I take this brief opportunity to also speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity inquiry into integrity testing. Other speakers, I believe, have quite adequately covered the inquiry and the recommendations that came from it, but I will make some brief comments about it. I begin by saying that the committee inquired into the possible introduction of a law enforcement integrity testing framework at the Commonwealth level. It did so noting that similar processes were already available to state jurisdictions here in Australia, as well as in some of the overseas jurisdictions such as New York, London and Hong Kong. I would also say from the very outset that the report should not in any way be interpreted as a negative reflection on the professionalism and integrity of our law enforcement officers throughout the country.


The inquiry commenced, as the member for Fowler just pointed out, in July this year, although I understand some previous comments were made about integrity testing in a report of the committee in early 2010, but at that time I do not think the matter was proceeded with. I want to point out the terms of reference for the inquiry. The committee resolved to consider:


(a) the various integrity testing models, including the advantages and disadvantages of random and targeted integrity testing, effectiveness as a corruption deterrent, and possible entrapment issues; 


(b) the legislative and administrative framework required to underpin an integrity testing regime; 


(c) the Commonwealth agencies to whom an integrity testing regime could apply; 


(d) the potential role of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity in integrity testing; and


(e) any other relevant matters. 


All of those matters were adequately covered in the inquiry, even though it was a relatively short inquiry. It was interesting to hear the diverse views of the various agencies that made representations to the committee. It is certainly the case that there was no uniform view across all the agencies that made representations and who appeared as witnesses before the committee. I believe there was a majority view that integrity testing is something that should be considered at Commonwealth level, given that it already exists at state level.


The member for Fowler raised a couple of matters that I also want to discuss. He quite properly referred to the issue of entrapment, which is an issue that has been dealt with in the courts. Entrapment was a particular issue that caused concern to some of the people who made submissions to the committee. In the course of the integrity testing, if an activity is carried out that may be interpreted as entrapment, that would not only cause problems within the agency from where the particular officer came, but there is also the possibility that the process that was used to test the integrity of the person concerned could be challenged in court. As I said, that was a matter that was looked at by one of the courts at one point in time. I understand the concerns that have been raised with respect to this. However, it is one of the methods that is often used in integrity testing in other jurisdictions, and I believe that, if used in an appropriate way, it would perhaps enable the necessary authorities to carry out the testing that is required. 


One of the other concerns that was raised about integrity testing across jurisdictions is cost. It is a relevant factor and should be taken into account. However, given the importance of the work that is being proposed, I believe that the issue of cost should not be used as a reason to not go ahead with integrity testing. 


The last point I want to comment on is the one that I referred to in my opening remarks—that is, integrity testing is carried out in other jurisdictions even here in Australia but not at Commonwealth government level. I believe that there is no reason to argue that, if it applies in one jurisdiction, it should not apply in another. In fact, we have some Commonwealth government agencies that do some very important work. Within those agencies, the community has every right to feel absolutely confident that the work is being carried out in the most professional way and that the integrity of those officers is not in any way in question. Applying the integrity-testing framework to those jurisdictions, I believe, will provide the Australian community with that level of confidence. The suggestion and recommendation of the committee is that integrity testing commence within those agencies that come under the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity—and that would be a good way to get the process up and running.


I want to commend the other members of the committee that were part of the process that we are now reporting on. Regrettably, I was not able to get to many of the committee meetings. I commend in particular the chair of the committee, the member for Fremantle, who spoke on this matter in the House on Monday. I thank the staff who assisted the committee in its work and all of those agencies who made submissions to the committee and who gave evidence before the committee. I believe that anyone who heard their presentations would have very much appreciated the insight they brought to this process and, in all cases, the professionalism with which they approached the question that was before the committee. I commend the report to the House.

There was a time when I was working briefly in the AFP drug squad in Sydney when there were comments made about making sure that desks were cleared when particular officers of the New South Police were coming into the building for a meeting, so I suspect that there were issues with corruption in New South Wales, particularly at that point in time—this was in 1986 and 1987. But in my time in the Australian Federal Police I never saw any problems. Even to this day, when you look at the law enforcement organisations within the Commonwealth—and I refer to the AFP, the Australian Crime Commission and Customs—there is reason for all of us to have great confidence in the professionalism and standards in all cases in those organisations.


That is not to say that we should not be prepared. That is where we are at with regards to the matter of integrity testing. I will take one definition of 'integrity testing' from the report, the one from the Attorney-General's Department:


... integrity testing refers to the act of covertly placing an officer in a simulated situation designed to test whether they will respond in a manner that is illegal, unethical or otherwise in contravention of the required standard of integrity. The test must provide the subject with an equal opportunity to pass or fail the test. Depending on its severity, the consequences of failing integrity tests can include disciplinary action, termination of employment or criminal charges.


Integrity testing has a fairly brief history, first occurring, according to information received, in the 1970s in the New York Police Department.


In the submissions and evidence, there was a bit of a tendency for the focus to be on some very low-level aspects of integrity testing. The classic scenario—and I will apply this to the ACT, although obviously, as I said before, I have complete confidence in the AFP and the ACT branch of the AFP—is that of a lost wallet being handed in to a particular officer and checking to see whether that officer follows correct procedures. That was a classic integrity test—the baseline integrity test. But it was my view, and the committee truly embraced this as we moved through, that in the Commonwealth environment there is access to information that can be of great value through these law enforcement agencies—the AFP, the Crime Commission and Customs. This might be information about criminal matters or a range of other things. Criminal organisations such as bikie gangs would see great value in trying to subvert an officer of the crown within one of these agencies to try and acquire information from them. It is particularly in the area of information security that integrity testing is going to be required in the future. Any person who has the opportunity to access information should have their integrity tested.


When I was in the Australian Federal Police working in Western Australia a number of officers of the WA police came to grief, you might say, professionally because they would use the police computer system to access the licence information of ordinary members of the public. This was very low-level stuff. As I heard it and as it was reported at the time, it sometimes involved looking up the address of an attractive driver who had been pulled over. Nevertheless, there were very poor standards there. That is the thin end of the wedge in terms of information control and integrity and the need for measures to be in place to assess the risks and to assess individuals. I am sure that others will speak this morning as well on the difference between targeted and random integrity testing. As a committee, we were very fond of the notion of targeted integrity testing, which is when there is reason to look at a person's behaviour and to place in front of them opportunities to make a positive or a negative decision. Targeted integrity testing is certainly what the committee is most keen on. Recommendation 3, in fact, is that integrity testing needs to be available to those agencies that come under ACLEI's responsibility—the AFP, the Crime Commission and Customs. Those organisations need to have access to integrity testing.


I have spoken a little bit about the report. I would like to finish by reiterating that I have great confidence in the professional standards of the AFP, the Crime Commission and Customs and in the ability of ACLEI to control and to be appropriately involved in integrity testing on behalf of and together with those agencies. I do not think that we have a significant problem in this country. But the reality is that, where there is information about crimes, drugs, the government and defence contracts there will always be the opportunity for someone to make money by acquiring it. People will always try to reach out to officers of the Commonwealth to try to subvert them and get them to acquire information for them. That is why we need to have these integrity testing measures in place to make sure that action can be taken when there is suspicion. I endorse the report. The members of the committee have gotten it right with this most excellent report.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (10:47):  Most members of this place are aware that before coming here I spent many years representing police officers within various Australian police jurisdictions. One of the things that I know is that police and law enforcement officers take the issues of integrity and honesty very seriously. I acknowledge that the member for Cowan was a police officer with both the Australian Federal Police and the military police. As he said, there have been issues in various police jurisdictions. Some of those issues were particularly brought to light by a New South Wales inquiry of 1987 that I remember very well, the Wood royal commission. That went out and used various measures in pursuing its investigations into corruption within the New South Wales Police Force.


History is often rewritten a little. In terms of that measure of corruption, it was largely contained in that particular instance to essentially one command that was operating at that stage in and about Kings Cross. That gave rise to various things, including the current popularity of the term 'underbelly'. Having worked for a long time with police officers and having grown up in a police family, I know the mindset of the police. I have interviewed police on many occasions, including police giving evidence in witness boxes. I have many times put the question directly to them as to why they chose to join the police force, knowing the rigours of the occupation and knowing all the restrictions that it puts on not only your professional but your private life. Invariably what comes back to me is that they chose to join the police to make a difference. It was the case then and in the very modern world now, when there is clearly a far more professional base to policing, it is the case too.


The other thing I would like to talk about is that the issue of organised crime was put on the agenda by the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, in 2008 in his National Security Statement. He elevated organised crime to be up there with terrorism. Organised crime, it was said at that stage, was costing this country between $10 billion and $15 billion a year and certainly was impacting very much on communities. Maybe some did not appreciate it because the effects do not necessarily directly impact on various members of the community, but nevertheless the community is footing the bill for those things. 




Sitting suspended from 10:51 to 10:56





Mr HAYES:
  As I was saying, the issue of serious and organised crime was put on the national agenda by the Prime Minister's National Security Statement in 2008. What followed from that? We took various measures—some people might refer to them as draconian measures—to fight terrorism, to ensure that the Australian people would be safe, as far as possible, from a terrorist act in this country impacting on our community. Organised crime was seen for the first time as an issue of national security, and various pieces of legislation were also developed to give enhanced powers to law enforcement.


Some of these matters have been on hand for some time, but we gave bodies such as the National Crime Authority, which subsequently became the Australian Crime Commission, extraordinary powers—the powers of a standing royal commission. I referred a little earlier to the Wood royal commission, which was a very powerful commission into policing in New South Wales. There have been many inquiries into other police agencies or law enforcement agencies, but what we established in this instance was the ability to use coercive powers to attack serious and organised crime. For the first time, you could be called before this organisation—the NCA, now the ACC—and questioned. Now there is no right to silence; trying to exercise that would simply see you incarcerated until you decided to cooperate. Some would refer to these powers as draconian; many lawyers do. But they were made to give law enforcement the ability to actually fight serious and organised crime. And it is not just the Australian Crime Commission; it is the Australian Federal Police as well, and Customs.


What goes with these increases in power is the need for us to ensure that power is not being abused, and that, as far as possible, we can assure the Australian public that these agencies are free from corruption. To that end, we established the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which oversees the Australian Crime Commission and its activities, as well as, more recently, the Australian Federal Police and the activities of Australian Customs and border control. These are areas where we do need to ensure that the powers are not being abused. Where we have increased officers' powers we must ensure they are being used as intended—to protect our community.


I know the notion of integrity testing is challenging for some. But, having been around police circles for a long while, I know that whether it is specifically referred to or not it is certain that most police internal standards agencies—whether by design or by the way they construe their operations—would certainly be out there to weed out what they might refer to as 'bad apples' in their organisation. That has probably gone on for a long time. Many of these activities may have been considered illegal in themselves. For instance, setting an officer up by constructing a situation which could invoke an illegal activity such as taking of property might be construed by the courts as entrapment. Maybe in policing circles that might have been considered at one point in time as a fair effort to ensure the integrity of those officers who are operating within a particular command.


Various changes have been made, and certainly many of the state and territory jurisdictions have had integrity testing in operation now for some time, and that has been based on intelligence gathering. It has not been like the 'New York experience', as some have referred to it as, where these things occurred randomly—perhaps a wallet is dropped to see how an officer may react, et cetera. That is using a very crude example, I suppose. Most agencies have developed an ability to ensure, on the basis of intelligence, a mechanism to test officers' integrity by a specifically designed police operation. This is something that is relatively new for the Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to consider. As a consequence, we took evidence from each of the various policing agencies around the county to establish what was occurring—maybe not necessarily specifically provided for in various legislation but what was actually occurring in contemporary policing to ensure the integrity of police, and through that the community. The inquiry was initiated in July of last year. To that extent is was a relatively short inquiry, one which gave us the opportunity to take on board the evidence of the respective jurisdictions and those professional standards agencies within those jurisdictions with the responsibility of looking after professional standards within their commands.


The recommendations which have already been cited by the member for Fremantle when she delivered her report to parliament are not designed to be an impediment to policing; they are certainly designed to be a measure to ensure as far as possible that law enforcement, particularly under the Australian jurisdiction, that being the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and Customs agencies, are free from corrupt activity. We recommend in our report that this not be simply developed as a routine or ad hoc position to be adopted. It should be provided as a measure which is based on intelligence. Where police internal standards may suspect an officer then they will have the ability to construct a situation to test the integrity of an officer or group of officers. We have set guidelines for how that would occur. One of the things that we have required in respect of those integrity operations is that the Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity must be advised formally of the operation being considered and also the results of its deployment.


In this respect, we see the Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity being another check and balance, not only protecting the integrity of those organisations but ensuring that we operate integrity testing throughout those jurisdictions in a way that respects the intention of the provisions recommended to government. We also recommend that various pieces of legislation be amended to ensure that controlled operations can take place without jeopardising the legal status of officers, particularly those officers in the Professional Standards Command, who are undertaking these operations such that their activities do not constitute them committing an offence.


I would like to reiterate that this has all been developed with a view to ensuring the utmost integrity of our law enforcement agencies so we can assure the community that, as far as possible, the agencies will remain, as they are now, virtually corruption free. We will do everything that we can to support the work of police internal professional standards, which, by the way, also has a direct relationship, albeit at the moment not a formal relationship, with the Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity. Enhancing that can only be good for professional policing and can only be good for the community.


As I say, I have spent many years representing police in most Australian police jurisdictions. I know from my ongoing contact with them that they do not see this as an impediment to them and they certainly do not see this as a slight to the integrity of their members. They do see this as a further reinforcement that we are working to ensure the ongoing corruption-free nature of policing. After all, I do not see that we are going to be winding back police powers; if anything, it will be the opposite. In order to protect and enhance community safety, I am sure greater powers will be given to policing over time. Every time we do that, we must ensure the appropriate checks and balances are in place.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:08):  I take this brief opportunity to also speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity inquiry into integrity testing. Other speakers, I believe, have quite adequately covered the inquiry and the recommendations that came from it, but I will make some brief comments about it. I begin by saying that the committee inquired into the possible introduction of a law enforcement integrity testing framework at the Commonwealth level. It did so noting that similar processes were already available to state jurisdictions here in Australia, as well as in some of the overseas jurisdictions such as New York, London and Hong Kong. I would also say from the very outset that the report should not in any way be interpreted as a negative reflection on the professionalism and integrity of our law enforcement officers throughout the country.


The inquiry commenced, as the member for Fowler just pointed out, in July this year, although I understand some previous comments were made about integrity testing in a report of the committee in early 2010, but at that time I do not think the matter was proceeded with. I want to point out the terms of reference for the inquiry. The committee resolved to consider:


(a) the various integrity testing models, including the advantages and disadvantages of random and targeted integrity testing, effectiveness as a corruption deterrent, and possible entrapment issues; 


(b) the legislative and administrative framework required to underpin an integrity testing regime; 


(c) the Commonwealth agencies to whom an integrity testing regime could apply; 


(d) the potential role of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity in integrity testing; and


(e) any other relevant matters. 


All of those matters were adequately covered in the inquiry, even though it was a relatively short inquiry. It was interesting to hear the diverse views of the various agencies that made representations to the committee. It is certainly the case that there was no uniform view across all the agencies that made representations and who appeared as witnesses before the committee. I believe there was a majority view that integrity testing is something that should be considered at Commonwealth level, given that it already exists at state level.


The member for Fowler raised a couple of matters that I also want to discuss. He quite properly referred to the issue of entrapment, which is an issue that has been dealt with in the courts. Entrapment was a particular issue that caused concern to some of the people who made submissions to the committee. In the course of the integrity testing, if an activity is carried out that may be interpreted as entrapment, that would not only cause problems within the agency from where the particular officer came, but there is also the possibility that the process that was used to test the integrity of the person concerned could be challenged in court. As I said, that was a matter that was looked at by one of the courts at one point in time. I understand the concerns that have been raised with respect to this. However, it is one of the methods that is often used in integrity testing in other jurisdictions, and I believe that, if used in an appropriate way, it would perhaps enable the necessary authorities to carry out the testing that is required. 


One of the other concerns that was raised about integrity testing across jurisdictions is cost. It is a relevant factor and should be taken into account. However, given the importance of the work that is being proposed, I believe that the issue of cost should not be used as a reason to not go ahead with integrity testing. 


The last point I want to comment on is the one that I referred to in my opening remarks—that is, integrity testing is carried out in other jurisdictions even here in Australia but not at Commonwealth government level. I believe that there is no reason to argue that, if it applies in one jurisdiction, it should not apply in another. In fact, we have some Commonwealth government agencies that do some very important work. Within those agencies, the community has every right to feel absolutely confident that the work is being carried out in the most professional way and that the integrity of those officers is not in any way in question. Applying the integrity-testing framework to those jurisdictions, I believe, will provide the Australian community with that level of confidence. The suggestion and recommendation of the committee is that integrity testing commence within those agencies that come under the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity—and that would be a good way to get the process up and running.


I want to commend the other members of the committee that were part of the process that we are now reporting on. Regrettably, I was not able to get to many of the committee meetings. I commend in particular the chair of the committee, the member for Fremantle, who spoke on this matter in the House on Monday. I thank the staff who assisted the committee in its work and all of those agencies who made submissions to the committee and who gave evidence before the committee. I believe that anyone who heard their presentations would have very much appreciated the insight they brought to this process and, in all cases, the professionalism with which they approached the question that was before the committee. I commend the report to the House. 


Debate adjourned.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-11-23,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (12:18):  I want to take this opportunity to discuss the huge investment that has occurred in the Chifley electorate—and no doubt in electorates across the country—in the education area and in particular within primary schools. I am particularly proud—and I mentioned my support of this early on in the first speech that I made to the nation's parliament—of Building the Education Revolution, which was a key component of the government's economic stimulus plan. That involved 24,000 projects delivered over four years. It supported jobs in local communities such as mine and benefited about 9,000 schools Australia wide. Through the program, we invested $16.2 billion in schools across the country for minor infrastructure and refurbishment projects and for major new infrastructure projects in primary schools and to build new or refurbish science and language centres in secondary schools. It is something that I am particularly proud of.


In the last few weeks, I have been able to visit quite a number of schools. They include St John Vianney's Primary School at Doonside; Crawford Public School, also at Doonside; Walters Road Public School, Blacktown; Quakers Hill Public School; Marayong Heights Public School; and both St Patrick's Primary School and St Michael's Primary School—all in the electorate of Chifley. That has been in the last eight weeks. I estimate that within the Chifley electorate about $65 million has been invested in the improvement of schools in our area.


As I have previously informed the House, the Chifley electorate is a young electorate. About 30 per cent of the people who reside within the electorate of Chifley are under the age of 19. Education is a key, critical priority. Keeping students in school for longer, improving retention rates and helping build the personal bank of skills that young people in Chifley have are all absolutely important. I am also delighted to see the development of trade training centres. I had the great pleasure of visiting the Loyola Trade Training Centre, with principal Rob Laidler being able to take me on a tour of the facility, which provides automotive, electrical, hospital and hairdressing training among a range of different things for which apprenticeships will be provided to young people in the Mount Druitt area. It is something which I am especially delighted with, given the investment in their skills and the investment in the neighbourhoods in our area. This trade training centre will be officially opened next year. 


We have also had the Tyndale Trade Training Centre opened earlier in the year, the first one that was opened in the Chifley electorate and particularly focusing on hospitality training. I was especially pleased to be taken on a tour by principal Jack Joyce, someone who is a very enthusiastic, very committed and very capable administrator, someone who really drove that project. This will be followed up by trade training centres to be opened in Doonside and Evans, which will see a collaboration between those two schools. I was especially pleased to see what is going on there. In particular, at Doonside the metal manufacturing trade training centre will be a huge asset.


A lot of the schools have been present in our area for a significant period of time. Quakers Hill, in particular, have been there for nearly a hundred years and they are about to celebrate their centenary in about two years time. The schools do need renovations. Changing demands require new facilities. We have seen new classrooms, new halls and new equipment. This is investment, as I have described at the actual openings themselves, in our neighbourhoods, because the young people that are being trained in those facilities will go on to stay in our neighbourhoods and help our communities in years to come. Giving them quality facilities is an absolute priority, and I am very proud of that investment that we have made in their future. 


I do want to take the time to congratulate the principals, the teachers, the staff, the builders and the architects, who have all spent so much time on these projects and have invested so much effort to make sure they work. They have all said to us that they welcome the investment. Also, I extend my deepest gratitude to the teachers who dedicate so much of themselves to the future of young people in the Chifley electorate. They are an absolute credit to our community, and I thank them for everything that they have done. This program has been an outstanding success and has been welcomed across Chifley.
