"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-21,"—by leave—I think we had this discussion a little earlier in the second reading discussion. I move Democrats amendments (10) and (13) to (15) on sheet 2213:
(10)	Schedule 3, item 1, page 41 (lines 1 and 2), omit subsection 126E(4).
(13)	Schedule 3, item 62, page 89 (lines 4 and 5), omit subsection (2).
(14)	Schedule 3, item 97, page 104 (line 20), omit “(2) or”.
(15)	Schedule 3, item 118, page 114 (lines 12 to 15), omit subsections (9) and (10).
These three amendments all relate to taking out the strict liability offence, whilst retaining the offence itself. I think we have had enough discussion on the principles surrounding these matters. It is a question of judgment as to whether these should or should not be strict liability. We are of the opinion that they should not be.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-21,"—There was a party room meeting this morning of three-quarters of an hour and it had a very full agenda so, although I put it on the agenda, I regret we did not get to it. There were other matters, including Labor notices of motion, which were regarded as more urgent than yours, Senator Bolkus. The Democrats will continue to have a look at that and we will put it to our long party room meeting on Monday and Tuesday next week. Certainly, we will be able to advise you in time for the motion to be put next week.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-21,"—I move  government amendment No. 2 on sheet EZ226: 
(2)	Schedule 2, item 6, page 34 (after line 18), after section 243X, insert:
243XA  Guidelines for serving infringement notices
	(1)	The CEO must develop written guidelines in respect of the administration of this Division to which he or she must have regard when exercising powers under this Division.
	(2)	The guidelines are a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
This government amendment deals with the guidelines, which have been the subject of much discussion previously. Without going over it in too much detail, suffice to say that this came about as a result of a recommendation by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and of course one of the aspects of that is that this should be a disallowable instrument. I think that is desirable in the circumstances if we are to have these guidelines. I think that what the Senate committee had to say was worth while and the government is minded to take on board those comments. I commend this amendment to the Senate, one which I think allays the fears as expressed previously by others and which were expressed during yesterday's debate. I will not go over that again.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1,speech

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-06-21,"—May I have a little dissertation on this? I think it is good to see that recommendations from the committees are being picked up. I said earlier—I do not know whether the minister was here when I was giving my speech in the second reading debate on this—that it is good to see that work done by the committees is gaining purchase and leading to the sort of amendment that has occurred here.
What I was talking about yesterday was the fact that the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, for which I have great affection, had made certain recommendations to the minister and that had been picked up and referred to in the second reading speech. I take this opportunity to bring to everybody's mind the work that the committees in this parliament do—particularly the Senate committees and the joint committees. I am not leaving aside the House of Representatives committees but I am not sure that they have as much impact as the Senate ones have. I think it is proper and right that the work of those committees—the committees in general—is recognised and that in this case the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has done work which has resulted in this amendment.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-21,"—Senator Murray, we have had the big debate about strict liability. I suppose the opposition partially won and also partially lost. Senator Murray, why have you chosen these three amendments? What distinguishes these, for instance, from others that the opposition is trying to remove from strict liability?",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-21,"—It is a legitimate question. As Senator Bolkus knows from the debate, we did try to plough through all the strict liability provisions in the bill. The first decision was easy, and that was that any ones which were simply a transfer from the existing legislation to the present legislation we thought we would support—even though, if you really want to dig through them, you might in fact want to reconsider some of those.
The second decision was much harder: where to find the balance of judgment that these matters either did or did not warrant strict liability provisions? Broadly speaking, we distinguished between those which we thought might be critical to community and revenue protection and those offences which we thought should not be the subject of strict liability. I thought, for instance, the discussion yesterday on the identity card issue was actually very helpful because, on the face of it, having strict liability for an identity card is really going over the top because that is just an administrative procedure. When you recognise that the identity card concerned, if left in the hands of a person who is no longer a member of Customs, could allow them—if they were an unscrupulous person—to enter premises and demand compliance with the very rigorous provisions of the Customs Act, you can see that it is dangerous to allow that to happen. In that instance, we thought the strict liability provision applied, and in that we differed with the opposition but we clearly understood each other's arguments.
With respect to your questions here, amendment No. 7, subsection 64AAA(9), refers to the reporting of stores and prohibited goods. Our view was that that was more of an administrative activity and did not need strict liability. Amendment No. 8 relates to parts of sections 99, 102, 113, 114B and 114D. Once again, we thought that those were areas where not dealing with goods in accordance with export, entry or removing of goods or areas of failing to communicate information systems, and so on, did not warrant it. It was a judgment we made. If you disagree, I would be interested to hear your reasons for disagreement. But if you do not, it was a judgment we made that it was not necessary in those areas.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I thought that was a grand invitation by Senator Murray and I would like to have a discussion about this because I am interested in why we should have strict liability offences. I am interested because, in a certain sense, I cannot work out in my mind why we should. Senator Murray said it was to protect the revenue. That was one reason. That would seem to promote the protection of the revenue above all other considerations. If we are going to say we should have strict liability offences because the issue involved is a very important one, then we get to the point where we say we ought to have strict liability when somebody assaults somebody else and it does not matter with what intent or it does not matter whether you are defending yourself—as long as you have assaulted somebody else, then you are liable because it is important to stop violence in the community. So it must be some reason other than that this is protecting the revenue. A lot of the taxation offences such as those that defraud the Australian Taxation Office are not strict liability offences, yet they go to protecting the revenue in a big way. So there must be some other reason. I think you have the ability, Senator Murray, to tell us.
—I will try. 
—Now.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-21,"—Senator Cooney is actually being very thoughtful on this. Personally, I think the issues he is raising are deserving of a references inquiry in due course because they attach themselves to fundamental issues of civil liberties, that is, of what rights attach in our society. We know that in law there has been established the three classes of liability: absolute, strict and fault liability. There seems universal acceptance that fault liability is perfectly all right as an offence. The queries are about the other two. 
I suspect that when Customs produces its guidelines in this area as a disallowable instrument, it may be a very helpful exercise. My feeling—and I am not as widely read across all the legislation that the Commonwealth indulges in as I might be—is that there are no criteria developed or established within the process of government surrounding these three liabilities and their application to legislation. Senator Cooney is using the opportunity of this bill to highlight the problem that we as legislators have to try to find our way to make these judgments on broad grounds of principle and applicability first and then relative to the specific circumstances second. 
In his heart—and he is a trained lawyer both in a practising sense and in a legislative sense—I know what he means: that should there be at any time provisions of strict liability or even of absolute liability, you then enter into a further debate, I think, about the nature of our judicial system and whether rights which attach to persons should also apply when those persons are acting on behalf of corporations. In other words, do those civil liberties, which we all accept in our individual and personal capacities as really fundamental to a civilised society, automatically translate into impersonal artificial entities—non-human entities such as corporations? The difficulty we have there, of course, is that people acting for corporations are individuals and we are caught in this bind as to whether it is a civil liberties matter or not.
The third aspect—and I am being quite philosophical here—relates to the fundamental basis of our legal system, the common law adversarial system, and the way in which charges and prosecutions are brought, the way in which defences are conducted and the way in which judges conduct themselves versus, say, the inquisitorial system such as is employed in Europe, where investigation, prosecution and defence are entirely different and operate to different rules of evidence and so on. Frankly, at the heart of your question, Senator Cooney, is the attention that needs to be paid in this country eventually to a charter of rights and to a review of the inadequacies of our judicial system. 
As an aside, I will tell the chamber that, at any one time in this country, we detain people without trial. In southern Africa, that was the most heinous of crimes of the South African apartheid regime. They detained people without trial. They defied habeas corpus. In this country, we think it is legal. We say, `We will put you in jail on remand.' The average term on remand is 10 months in Western Australia, and half the people who go on remand are found innocent. What is that but detention without trial of a person who is found not guilty? It is a process of law, and we understand that magistrates and judges have to take a view on whether letting that person be at liberty would be a threat to the society, and so on. We understand all that, but the net effect for the individual is grotesque.
Somebody who does not know Senator Cooney well would think that his was an innocent question, but at the heart of it is in fact a deep philosophical and legal concern, a deep area of need in our society to continually review and to evaluate issues of liberties, of rights, of responsibilities and whether our judicial system, our common law system, serves us as well as it might. For those who are interested in this topic, I recommend to them the committee of Wayne Martin QC and its review of the legal system in Western Australia, for instance, which in its pattern of recommendations—and there is a huge number—proposes a fundamental overturning of the system. I note Senator Coonan is in the chamber. She has a deep and intellectual interest in these areas as well. In fact, there are three lawyers. I am not sure whether you are a lawyer, Senator Bolkus.
—I am.
—So there are four lawyers. I am the only non-lawyer here. The fact is that, when we attend to the practicalities and so on of these bills, those of us with an interest and a passion in these matters know that behind our words there is much more. If you want to know, Senator Cooney, whether I am uncomfortable in having to make a decision on strict, or not strict, liability in matters where I am trying to weigh up what I concede might be critical to the community and/or revenue protection, from the perspective of government and the advisers who bring these things before us, yes, I am. I do not make those decisions lightly because I am aware that in somebody's hands, in some circumstance, that could be a very uncomfortable result. Every time we pass a law and say, `Yes, six months imprisonment,' or `So many penalty points', you have to know what a prison cell looks like and smells like and feels like, and what effect that door slamming shut has. Sometimes we forget all that. Yes, I am sensitive. Might I have made a mistake in some of these judgments? Yes, I might have, but I have come to a view on evaluation, and it is as honest a view as I can come to. So I have knocked off 10 strict liability provisions, some of them with the support of your party. Should there have been a couple more? Quite possibly. The government might argue that there should have been a couple less. It is just not an easy thing for me to deal with.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I thank Senator Murray for that. Senator Murray knows about apartheid and these systems. I know that he suffered under them. So I was very interested to hear his analysis of this. I think it is a proper analysis. I would have thought that the reason why we have strict liability in this instance is that Customs want to be able to get their work done expeditiously and to move people along in the way that Customs think they ought to move along. That is understandable, because Customs is a crucial instrument by which we gather money in the country and by which we protect our borders. The strict liability regime does bring problems. It means that people who are morally innocent are going to be punished for making false and misleading statements. People would say, `Yes, it is false and misleading, not in a gross and deep criminal sense but in having a document which itself is false and misleading. Whether that was intended or not does not matter. We need to have accurate documents.' That is all understandable, but it casts a shadow on people's reputations—although, I would have thought, not in a big way in this area. 
The second thing it does is that, where the department itself is able to issue notices for a penalty, it gives Customs a very big stick with which to beat citizens who are going about their work in reference to Customs matters. It is a big stick. I think the minister would agree that we give Customs a big stick, and therefore there must be some sort of check on the people in Customs to ensure that they act responsibly and that they do not use this big stick oppressively. We as a parliament have to ensure that that is done. The minister says that the way we are going to do that is to have guidelines and that they will come before the parliament and will be subject to disallowance. I think that does take it a fair way, but the problem you have got is that the guidelines do not get over the difficulty of people in Customs who may have a problem with Customs' approach, which to some extent may be sinister because it may be motivated not by a desire to get the machine working but by a desire to embarrass or to make things difficult for particular people it does not like. 
That is a problem that anybody who makes a decision faces. Even the best of our judges are affected by emotions, and whether they are good or bad judges is, to a large extent, measured by whether they can suppress those emotions. But here we have a system where we have people who are not judges but decision makers and who can inflict these penalties upon people by serving a notice without even having to prove that there was a guilty intention on the part of the person on whom they serve the notice. It is a scheme that can result in lots of injustices to people who otherwise are going about their work in a reasonable fashion. Just as people outside Customs may do the wrong thing, people inside Customs may also do the wrong thing, because we are all made up of the light and the dark, as has been said forever. There does not seem to me to be quite enough protection in this scheme to ensure that people in Customs act fairly.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-21,"—by leave—I move amendments Nos 13 to 16 and 1, 2 and R3 on sheet 2215 revised 2:

	(1)	After consulting widely with persons likely to be affected, the CEO must determine, and cause to be published in the Gazette:
	(a)	the information technology requirements that have to be met by persons who wish to communicate with Customs electronically; and

	(7)	Part 1 of Schedule 3 commences on the day after:
	(a)	the day, or the later of the days, on which the Minister causes to be laid before each House of the Parliament a certificate that the Chief Executive Officer has complied with subsection 126DA(1) of the Customs Act 1901; or
	(b)	the last day on which a notice could be given for the disallowance of the Chief Executive officer's determination under subsection 126DA(1) of the Customs Act 1901, or, if such a notice is given, the last day on which the determination could be disallowed by a House of the Parliament in which the notice has been given; or
	(c)	the last day on which a notice could be given for the disallowance of the business rules made under section 273EB of the Customs Act 1901, or, if such a notice is given, the last day on which the rules could be disallowed by a House of the Parliament in which the notice has been given; or
	(d)	the day on which a report is presented to the Senate by a Senate standing committee on the use of electronic communications systems by Customs and related issues;
whichever is the latest.
	(8)	If, on or after 1 October 2001, the Minister causes to be laid before each House of the Parliament a notice from the President of the Senate advising the Minister that the Senate has not, before that date, referred the use of electronic communications systems by Customs, and related issues, to a standing committee for inquiry and report, paragraph (7)(d) is to be disregarded.
These amendments go to the issue of the commencement date of provisions relating to the communications system. Amendment No. 16 separates the requirement on the CEO to maintain information systems with a requirement to determine communications standards and operation. The amendment redrafts subsections (2) and (3) of section 126D and reproduces them as proposed new section 126DA, adding the requirement that Customs consult widely with persons likely to be affected by Customs' communications standards and operations.
The proposed new 126DA then retains in exactly the same language the requirements that were in subsections (2) and (3) of section 126D, that the CEO must publish in the Gazette a notice setting out: firstly; information technology requirements that have to be met by persons who wish to communicate with Customs electronically; secondly, the action that a person has to take in order to verify the receipt of information communicated to Customs electronically; thirdly, IT requirements that have to met to satisfy a requirement that a person's signature be given to Customs in connection with information when the information is communicated electronically; and, fourthly, the IT requirements that have to be met to satisfy the requirement that a document be produced to Customs when the document is produced electronically.
Under proposed new section 126DA—and this is an important distinction from the previous one—all determinations will be disallowable instruments. We are doing that to ensure that there is real consultation between Customs and industry. That, we believe, is necessary, given that that there is disquiet in the industry about poor standards of consultation to date. The amendment will not put an onerous or unnecessary burden on Customs, but it will ensure that there is real knowledge in the community. Making the determinations disallowable instruments will also ensure that there is an opportunity for parliament to monitor the process and to ensure that any determinations by Customs are suitable and adequate.
Amendments Nos 1, 2 and R3 defer the date on which the provisions relating to Customs' communications systems will come into force; that is, part 1 of schedule 3. As the bill currently stands, they will come into force on a day to be fixed by proclamation, but no later than two years after assent. Our amendments will provide that part 1 of schedule 3 will commence on the day after whichever event occurs later, or whichever are the following events: firstly, the day or the latter of the days on which the minister tables the certificate that the CEO has complied with 126DA(1); secondly, the last day on which notice could be given for the disallowance of the CEO's determinations under section 126DA(1), or, if such notice is given, the last day on which the determination could be disallowed; or, thirdly, the last day on which the notice could be given for disallowance of the business rules made under section 273EB or, if such a notice is given, the last day on which the rules could be disallowed; or, finally, the day on which a report is presented to the Senate by a Senate committee on the use of electronic communications systems by Customs.
The purpose of these amendments is to remedy the current situation where, in respect of consultation and commencement of legislation, the cart is essentially before the horse—that is, the provisions relating to the communications systems may come into force before adequate consultation has occurred between Customs and industry. As the bill is currently drafted, the amendment will remedy that. Its effect will be that the legislation allowing Customs to replace Tradegate with another system will not come into force until the CEO has consulted with industry, given notice to the public and the parliament about the IT requirements that the CEO has decided upon once those consultations have occurred and the parliament has indeed had an opportunity to consider these requirements.
Our amendments will also prevent the provisions relating to communications systems from coming into force until a Senate committee has conducted and reported on the inquiry. That was part of the previous amendments, but we are not proceeding with that, given that the committee may not take place, depending on what the Democrats decide to do.
In respect of amendments Nos 14 and 15, currently part 1 and part VIA refer to maintenance of electronic communications systems by Customs. That presupposes that the current Tradegate systems will be replaced by a system run by Customs, which basically means run by its outsourcer EDS. Amending the heading to `Electronic communications systems' would mean that they could apply to any system managed or run by any organisation now or in the future. It is less restrictive, which is important, given the anticipated change to the Customs connect facility, and given that it may not go ahead or ultimately Customs may not be responsible for maintaining the communications systems. The last two amendments give us some flexibility in respect of that. I commend the amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-21,"—Let me elicit some further responses. The first three amendments, (1), (2) and (R3), would serve to hold up the implementation of the new bill. I should make it clear, Senator Bolkus, that whilst I am more than happy to put your reference for discussion in our party room—I cannot predict what will happen there—I will not recommend that anything in the bill be held up whilst the inquiry goes on. In other words, if the inquiry was ever to occur, I see it as not being attached to the bill. I am not sure that amendments (1) to (3) really work. I would appreciate the minister's views on those amendments, especially as they appear to be contingent on a third reading amendment which we would reject if it is moved today simply because we have not yet reviewed the matter in the party room. I would view it as an entirely distinct reference were it to occur. I would appreciate a reaction from the minister on that.
Amendments (13) to (16) seek to remove Customs from the title of the part, and to allow for systems such as Tradegate to continue. As I understand it, Tradegate can continue, except they will not continue with a monopoly. That is my reading of things. The amendments seek to remove the maintenance of information systems from the direct responsibility of Customs. I am not sure that that is wise. However, they do mandate consultation with industry in relation to the development of those information systems to be required by Customs under the bill. I see little wrong with that, provided, obviously, that whether somebody has been consulted or not is not justiciable, otherwise, what does that mean? There are many views on the adequacy of consultation processes. Unfortunately, some lobbyists think that if they do not get their way in consultation, they will claim that they have not been consulted. In other words, successful consultation is the only kind of consultation that is acceptable. Consultation from the point of view of government is a requirement. They listen to a broad range of people, groups and entities and then make a decision based on their view of the best interests of the community and the pursuit of government policy.
What concerns me here is whether there is a flavour that the consultation is required in a particular direction to satisfy particular lobbyists. It is no secret to anyone in the room that there have been strong lobbyists. If someone is earning $12 million out of the present system and they are going to face more competition for that $12 million, there are 12 million good reasons for muddying the issue and for claiming that they have not been sufficiently consulted. And why shouldn't they do that? It is in their best interests, quite rightly, to argue that way.
Referring specifically to Tradegate, I understand that they currently have a contract that earns $3.64 for every Customs entry made in Australia which is collected on their behalf by Customs. Connect.com, as the communications service provider to Tradegate, receive a lot of that money through their back-to-back contracts. Tradegate will not be killed off by the legislation, but they will cease to have what I understand are monopoly rights. Therefore, competition will increase. Importers and exporters who wish to communicate electronically with Customs will be able to do so. They will be able to bypass them and save money. Why should I, as a legislator, complain about that? I can understand why Tradegate and Connect.com might complain about it, but it is not my job to do that.
I think that Connect.com are right. They have a contractual relationship with Customs through Tradegate. That will be affected, but I do not think that it will be affected by this legislation in terms of the contract. Contracts have to run their full term and they are as laid out, with unaltered conditions. On the face of the amendments, and particularly amendment (16), the consultation requirements and the need for Customs to be explicit about what they are doing seem reasonable on the surface. However, I am aware of the undercurrents and some of the allegations that have been made. From the promoter of the amendments and from the government, and starting with the minister, I would like to hear the reactions to amendments (1) to (3) and then the reactions to (13) to (16).",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-21,"—I endorse the comments made by Senator Murray in relation to the choices available to people providing or accessing information from Customs and dealing with Customs electronically. We are proposing that the current arrangement, which is an exclusive arrangement with Tradegate, can provide more choice to the people who deal with Customs. That is a thoroughly desirable objective. People will still be able to use Tradegate if they want to. They can use other service providers or they can use the Internet. That is a very sensible proposal. I can confirm to Senator Murray that the existing contract with Tradegate will not be affected in any way, and quite appropriately so. However, for the future, there will be increased choice, which the opposition will not acknowledge, but which, of course, the industry does acknowledge.
The combined effect of opposition amendments (1) to (3) would delay the implementation of the bill. To put it simply, they are based on the premise that there will be the inquiry which the opposition is seeking. That would effectively delay the implementation of the bill, and we have heard repeatedly from industry that that is not what it wants in relation to this proposed legislation, which industry believes would be beneficial.
In relation to the subsequent amendments, Nos 13, 14, 15 and 16, from the opposition, we have a new proposed section 126DA. It is interesting to note that the opposition are endorsing to a great extent what the government already have in the bill by virtue of the provisions in 126D. The only real changes the opposition are making are in relation to the commencement of their proposed amendment and to the conclusion. That is in relation to their new 126DA. Proposed subsection (1) says:
After consulting widely with persons likely to be affected, the CEO must determine, and cause to be published in the Gazette ...
It goes on with a variety of things which are taken from the bill itself. The next point of contention is really proposed subsection (3), which states:
A determination under subsection (1) or (2) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
They are the two points of difference between the opposition and the government. The problem that the government have with the first point of difference is this: you have a provision that, after consulting widely, the CEO will do certain things. The question is: when will that be effected? What is wide consultation? That is really quite uncertain. It does not provide any certainty or for good administration. In fact, we have already had extensive consultation with Customs. This has been the subject of scrutiny, and I am referring specifically to the IT aspect. The Senate Standing Finance and Public Administration Committee looked at this question with respect to IT outsourcing. It was also looked at by the Senate Standing Legal and Constitutional Committee in its hearings on the bill.
The government is of the view that there have been extensive, independent inquiries in relation to this very issue and that to demand further wide consultation in an ambiguous sense is not good administration. But of course in proposed subsection (3), you do not see good administration at all, because you are saying that the CEO of Customs can make these determinations and then they are disallowable. If this were to be a template for all government departments and agencies, I think you would find a situation where quite technical detail—which is being promulgated in the Gazette, in any event—would then come under the scrutiny of the Senate and we could be tied up looking at and trawling through detail dealing with information technology requirements. Just to look at some of them in (1), we have:
 (a)	the information technology requirements that have to be met by persons who wish to communicate with Customs electronically; and
(b)	the action that a person has to take in order to verify the receipt of information communicated to Customs electronically; and
(c)	the information technology requirements that have to be met to satisfy a requirement that a person's signature be given to Customs in connection with information when the information is communicated electronically ...
Here we have the involvement of the Senate chamber in what are quite technical matters which touch on the running of communications with a government agency or department.
There are a variety of areas where that can be exhaustively examined, and I refer in the first instance to the Senate estimates process, where departments and government agencies are questioned at length in relation to IT requirements and communications generally. I refer in this instance to the scrutiny by the Senate Standing Finance and Public Administration Committee with respect to IT outsourcing, and I would say to the Senate that this is really overstepping the mark. We are proposing to open up the systems of communication with Customs. If any CEO of any agency or any secretary to any department has as a disallowable instrument any determinations made under (1) and (2), you are virtually going to have the running of these departments by the Senate. Quite properly, the parliament must have scrutiny of the administration and the executive. But it is entirely inappropriate under our system to have a hands-on running of the administration by the parliament. If it is going to be a template for the future for all public administration, any determination by that CEO will require hands-on involvement by this chamber in those administrative matters.
There are other areas where this can be examined at length and where, with this bill, this has been examined by other committees. But, if you have the determinations as a disallowable instrument, you take it one step further—that is, you bring the Senate into the running of the administration of government. The Senate should quite properly have scrutiny, and it does. We have seen with this bill that two Senate committees have made recommendations and the government have taken them on board. The Senate committee process is an excellent one, and this is not the first bill where I as a minister have taken on board the recommendations made by a Senate committee. But I am saying here that in the running of government, where you have a determination which is disallowable by this chamber, as mentioned in 126DA(3) by the opposition, it is going to lead to all sorts of problems. There are other fora where a decision of the CEO or secretary can be challenged and debated. I believe the consultation has been covered. It is too wide and uncertain and, to that extent, would again reduce the efficacy that is being proposed. We are providing more choice to those people who deal with Customs electronically. That is a fact, and the opposition cannot get away from it.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-21,"—Just to provide a bit of extra commentary, and I refer just to amendment (16) at this point, I have real concerns with the word `widely' because as I understand it there are 95,000 members of the industry, importers and exporters, and there are service providers and so on. It would be dreadful if someone were to claim that they were left out, because 2,000 out of 95,000 had been consulted with. Is that widely enough? As I am sure everyone in the chamber is, I am strongly supportive of consultation but it has to be reasonable, practical and possible. 
The second area I have major concern with is item (3). Item (3), as the minister correctly outlines, does put the Senate in the position not of being an accountability mechanism, which is the estimates process and so on, but of actually being a decision maker and acting in this sense as the executive, because it is the executive that must decide on systems. It is not in my view the proper role of the Senate to decide on the alternative systems for information technology that are appropriate for Customs. I think it is the role of the Senate to criticise the choice if they do not like the eventual choice, or the criteria or the tendering method or anything else, but we really cannot get down to the situation where we decide in a bill what kinds of tractors are used in road maintenance—or what computer systems, aeroplanes or anything else are used. I do not have a quarrel with the rest of (16), but I do have concerns with that word `widely', and I would not support item (3) on the grounds I have outlined.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I wonder if I can suggest a course of action for us to take at this stage. I did seek leave to have all the amendments debated and voted upon jointly. I wonder if I can further seek leave now to have all but amendment (16) treated in one basket, and, with respect to amendment (16), can I indicate that I wish to move that in an amended form by picking up the suggestions of Senator Murray and deleting the word `widely' and deleting subclause (3).
Leave granted.

But, as to the way to deal with it, I think it is more appropriate that you amend what is in the government's bill already because (15) takes out, as Senator Murray has correctly said, 126D. So if we put (15) and (16) to one side and we deal with all the rest as a whole, then the opposition can simply amend the current 126D—leave it as it is but make those amendments which Senator Bolkus is talking about. We can abandon (15) and (16) and have a new amendment which simply amends what is there, because (15) takes it out and (16) puts it back in a different form.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-21,"—I move Democrats amendment (12) on sheet 2213:
(12)	Schedule 3, item 38, page 65 (line 12), at the end of paragraph 71DF(b), add “or such other day of that month as is prescribed”.
This is the issue on which Senator Bolkus and I are in absolute agreement. The reporting systems that business have to endure from government should, wherever practical, be coincided. We know the difficulty is the ABS and their very strong advice to the Treasurer—and, through the Treasurer, to the minister who is his junior, too—as to how they feel about it. We would really prefer the date for BAS and the date for these reports to be coincided. However, in the time available to deal with this bill, that is not possible. This amendment does allow the minister to set another date in the month as the lodgment date for periodic declarations.
As mentioned in the Democrats earlier comments in our supplementary remarks to the committee report and my address in the second reading debate, we would like to see further investigation of the possible alignment of the reporting date for the BAS and Customs periodic declarations. A number of industry representatives have emphasised the benefits of such a proposal. The one thing I would like from the minister is an assurance that in looking at that issue the minister and the minister's department will not just go through the motions. Businesses have become exceptionally sensitive to and sensitive about the level of compliance and reporting they do, and I think this is a serious issue.
The minister in his second reading speech mentioned he would constitute a working group. I know that, if you came up with a positive recommendation, you would have a fight on your hands, probably, with the ABS and their supporters within the bureaucracy. They are the facts of the matter. I would like the minister to be able to indicate that he would certainly be a champion for coordinating these two, if it is at all possible, and not simply go through the motions to satisfy us in this debate.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-21,"—I do not know about being a champion, but certainly I will pursue this. I will reiterate what I said in the second reading speech: I have agreed to pursue the establishment of a working group involving industry and relevant government agencies, including the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in pursuit of a commitment to keep the regulations to a minimum. The working group will further explore the alignment of reporting obligations under the Customs Act and any other reporting obligations under other relevant Commonwealth legislation. The opportunity will then exist under the bill, as amended, for any outcome of the working group discussions to be captured in regulations and promulgated under the provision in question.
That comprehensively deals with the concern raised by Senator Murray. Certainly, as the minister, I will take a personal interest in this. Among the things that have been of concern to the government are compliance requirements and reporting. In the Prime Minister's statement, `More Time for Business', it has been a common thread that we want to have dealings between government and business made easier and not harder. Also with this bill we have the other requirements or IT aspects which comply with our online government policy. We want to provide more choice and make it easier to deal with government in an online fashion. The government has very much as its policy base a commitment to making it easier for business to deal with government. In this particular instance, I want to thank the Democrats for their constructive engagement with the government on this matter.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-06-21,"—Today the Senate is debating a bill that has been used as an instrument of deception by this government; namely, the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001. Last month, the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee reported on its inquiry into this bill. Labor senators provided a dissenting report to that inquiry, which set out our position in detail once again. This is the third occasion that a Senate committee has examined the appropriate response to interactive gambling in Australia. Still the government has failed to produce an effective or appropriate response to interactive gambling in this bill, even though it has amended the bill considerably in response to the Senate committee's findings.
The government's policy approach to interactive gambling is flawed. There are a number of reasons why the opposition considers the position taken in this bill to be totally inappropriate. Firstly, Australians will still be able to access Internet gambling services if this bill becomes law. Secondly, the easiest sites for Australians to access will be overseas sites, some of which are run by criminal and Mafia elements. It is nearly impossible to distinguish reputable sites from those of dubious probity. Thirdly, problem gamblers are likely to be the ones who will be desperate enough to circumvent restrictions on accessing Australian and foreign sites and will most likely fall prey to unscrupulous operators who will not limit expenditure. This bill could result in worse gambling problems for Australians than if they were able to access strictly regulated Australian sites. Fourthly, Australia is looking backwards while the rest of the world is looking forward. A number of countries are looking to adopt Australia's regulatory model for Internet gambling. 
Fifthly, it is hypocritical to allow Australian Internet gambling service providers to offer services overseas—with Australia receiving the revenue—while other countries will be left with the attendant social problems and no funds to deal with them. Sixthly, the bill will have a negative impact on Australian interactive gambling service providers. Their claims of being well regulated will not be credible if their own government will not allow its citizens to access their services. Finally, the bill still permits Australians access to Internet wagering, and wagering is hardly immune from gambling problems. Additionally, as identified in the Labor senators' minority report to the inquiry, there are a number of specific concerns with the drafting of certain provisions in the bill that render the bill's impact uncertain or unjust. The minister, however, has evinced an intention to amend the bill to address some of these deficiencies identified in the Senate report.
Turning to my first point, that Australians will still be able to access Internet gambling services if this bill becomes law, there are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the bill does not prohibit Australians from accessing IGSPs, whether they are foreign or Australian. Instead, it seeks to stop Australians from accessing the safest sites in the world but allows them to access the most dangerous sites. If Australians want to access the services of an Australian or foreign IGSP, they will still be able to, even if those IGSPs claim not to accept Australian customers. Australians can still access reputable Australian and foreign IGSPs that refuse to accept Australian customers by deceiving the IGSP. There are a number of ways of concealing their locations from IGSPs. This can be achieved, for example, by circumventing geolocation software or dialling through foreign Internet service providers so that foreign IGSPs identify them as being wherever the foreign Internet service provider is located. The section in the bill for providing interactive gambling services to Australians is not a very persuasive deterrent and is unlikely to be enforced. This would especially be the case if the government fails to provide additional funding for the already underresourced Australian Federal Police.
There are also significant numbers of disreputable foreign sites of dubious probity that Australians will be able to access. Some gamblers, particularly those susceptible to gambling problems, might favour those sites. This leads me to my second point, which is that the easiest sites for Australians to access will be overseas sites, some of which, as I said, are run by criminal and Mafia elements. It is nearly impossible to distinguish reputable sites from those of dubious probity. A ministerial media release on interactive gambling states that there are:
... very disturbing examples of how Internet gambling organisations actually feed the addictions of problem gamblers.
There are no examples of such unscrupulous behaviour by Australian gambling operators; rather, it is offshore operators at whose mercy the government plans to leave Australian gamblers who engage in such activity.
Last year there were approximately 800 unregulated offshore Internet casinos available worldwide, which cannot guarantee personal security or provide the safeguards Australian online operators have in place. That number has almost doubled to some 1,400 sites, with Australian sites comprising less than two per cent of the Internet gambling sites worldwide. It is very difficult to distinguish reputable sites from those that are not. Consequently, Australian gamblers will be at risk when this bill forces them to use offshore sites and prevents them from accessing the strictly regulated sites. This leads to my third point, which is that problem gamblers are likely to be the ones who are desperate enough to circumvent restrictions on accessing Australian and foreign sites and who will most likely fall prey to unscrupulous operators who will not limit expenditure. The bill could result in worse gambling problems for Australians than if they were able to access strictly regulated Australian sites.
The fourth issue I would like to address today is the failure of the government to properly tackle information technology issues. It seems that the government does not really care to get a hard handle on the complexity of many of these issues. It appears that the Australian government looks backward while the rest of the world moves forward. As I said, a number of countries are looking to adopt Australia's regulatory model for Internet gambling. The minister is in fact contradicting his own policy guidelines. In July 1997 the minister for communications announced the government's principles for a national approach to regulate the content of online services such as the Internet. Senator Alston took a very different approach from the one he is advocating in this debate. Senator Alston said:
Material accessed from on-line services should not be subject to a more onerous regulatory framework than “off-line” materials such as books, videos, films and computer games. As a guideline, what is protected behaviour “off-line” should be protected behaviour online. This framework balances the need to address community concerns in relation to content with the need to ensure that regulation does not inhibit industry growth and potential.
Senator Alston has certainly changed his tune since then. He now chooses to contradict his own policy guidelines. It is fair to conclude that Senator Alston is damaging Australia's international reputation and his actions are contrary to the best interests of Australia and the future of our IT industries. My next and fifth point is that it is hypocritical of the government to allow Australian Internet gambling service providers to offer services overseas, as Australia will receive the revenue while other countries will be left with any attendant social problems and no incoming revenue to deal with them.
My sixth point is that the bill will have a negative impact on the established and strictly regulated Australian IGSPs. Even though their existing customers are almost exclusively overseas, their claims of being well regulated will not be credible if their own government will not allow its citizens to access their services. My seventh point is that the amendments foreshadowed by the government will permit Australians access to Internet wagering. Wagering is hardly immune from causing gambling problems. In fact, it is extremely hypocritical for this government to exclude interactive wagering when wagering is as much a problem in terms of problem gambling as any other form of gambling. The amendment goes to show that the government is both hypocritical and duplicitous in its approach to this particular issue. This government's primary concern is not to protect problem gamblers. The government and this minister put particular interests first in this debate. This time they are protecting their colleagues in the wagering industry. One could say that this is hardly an effective way to create good public policy.
It is noteworthy that the government has selectively caved in to the intensive lobbying by the wagering industry. It is just further proof of the government's ad hoc approach to the formulation of policy. The government's selective approach is the reason why it cannot come up with a sensible, effective and long-term policy for interactive gambling that will minimise interactive gambling to the greatest extent possible. The most notable thing that this bill does is prevent Australians from accessing the world's best, safest and most consumer friendly interactive gambling sites: the Australian ones currently in existence.
Commenting on the bill, the minister stated that the government `only took wagering out under duress because of the necessity to do that to get it through the Senate'. One asks the obvious question: why would the minister take wagering out under duress? Doesn't the government have any consistent policies in this area that can be adhered to, where backflips are not the routine order of the day? After stating that wagering was taken out of the ban only `under duress' to get the bill through the Senate, the minister then said that he did not know how the final vote would play out in the Senate and that `you can never quite tell until you get in there'. So why did the minister take out wagering? He does not know how the final vote will play out in the Senate. Why would he take the bill beyond being ineffective—which, of course, it already is—to being the likely subject of ridicule? 
If you read today's press, it is already emerging that way. The minister said:
There's a huge difference between picking up your phone, putting on a few bets at the TAB, and sitting there with a remote control and clicking your head off until you've lost all of what you had, and more.
First of all, I would like to make the point that, if gamblers play on Australian Internet gambling sites they could not gamble away all of what they have and more because there are expenditure thresholds imposed. However, if this bill is introduced, Australian gamblers will be able to gamble away all they have and more on many offshore sites still available to them. Secondly, one asks the rhetorical question: what, Minister, is the difference between problem gambling amongst those who gamble on the races and those who gamble at casinos? The minister will be interested to be reminded that the Productivity Commission found that problem gamblers are almost 1½ times more likely to prefer gambling on racing to casino gambling. Wagering is not any safer than any other form of gambling. Wagering is not immune to the social effects of problem gambling. It is impossible to identify any sensible rationale for the government's exclusion of wagering from the bill.
The opposition have taken a very different approach to the issue of interactive gambling. Our primary concern is to ensure that problem gambling arising from interactive gambling is kept to an absolute minimum. We are concerned that the government's bill will not control or limit problem gambling in the online environment. Australian IGSPs are leading the world in terms of technology and services and they are subject to the world's strictest regulation by the states and territories. The opposition have concluded that the most effective way to manage interactive and Internet gambling is, overwhelmingly, to have state and territory cooperation in formulating and implementing a national regulatory regime. We support federal coordination of consistent state based regulatory regimes.
—Which would do what?
—It would limit gambling, it would limit access and it would impose regulation. 
—Very vague. You don't support this, Senator Bishop.
—It would achieve a particular purpose as to a ban that applies only in Australia and not to offshore sites, Senator Kemp. There is no evidence to support the government's conclusion that its ban will limit problem gambling. Indeed, a considerable number of submissions to the committee's inquiry suggested that the bill would exacerbate gambling problems arising from interactive gambling by depriving Australians of a strictly regulated service.
The opposition believes that it is not technically or practically feasible to ban interactive gambling. Ill-advised attempts to ban interactive gambling will fail and risk exacerbating a problem that can be avoided if an appropriate regulatory response is put in place now. This bill, if passed, would mislead the community, potentially creating a false sense of security by contending that Internet users would be safe from harmful interactive gambling sites. The opposition cannot support this bill when we know that there is a far more effective way to deal with this issue. It is not in the best interests of Australians that we support this bill. I now formally move the opposition's second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
			“but the Senate:
	(a)	condemns the Government for introducing an unworkable, internally inconsistent and hypocritical bill which:
	(i)	does not provide strong regulation of interactive gambling as the most practical and effective way of reducing social harm arising from gambling;
	(ii)	may exacerbate problem gambling in Australia by barring access to regulated on-line gambling services with in-built safeguards but allows access to unregulated offshore on-line gambling sites that do not offer consumer protection or probity;
	(iii)	does not extend current regulatory and consumer protection requirements applying to off-line and land-based casinos, clubs or wagering venues to on-line casinos and on-line wagering facilities;
	(iv)	damages Australia's international reputation for effective consumer protection laws and strong, workable gambling regulations;
	(v)	singles out one form of gambling in an attempt to create the impression of placating community concern about the adverse social consequences of gambling but does not address more prevalent forms of gambling in Australian society; and
	(vi)	is not technology neutral or technically feasible;
	(b)	calls on the Government to show national leadership on this issue by:
	(i)	addressing harm minimisation and consumer protection as well as criminal issues that may arise from on-line gambling;
	(ii)	ensuring a quality gambling product through financial probity checks on providers and their staff;
	(iii)	maintaining the integrity of games and the proper working of gaming equipment;
	(iv)	providing mechanisms to exclude those not eligible to gamble under Australian law;
	(v)	implementing problem gambling controls, such as exclusion from facilities, expenditure thresholds, no credit betting, and the regular provision of transaction records;
	(vi)	introducing measures to minimise any criminal activity linked to interactive gambling;
	(vii)	providing effective privacy protection for on-line gamblers;
	(viii)	containing social costs by ensuring that adequate ongoing funds are available to assist those with gambling problems;
	(ix)	addressing revenue issues that impact upon state government decisions relating to interactive gambling;
	(x)	establishing consistent standards for all interactive gambling operators;
	(xi)	examining international protocols with the aim of achieving multilateral agreements on sports betting and other forms of interactive gambling;
	(xii)	ensuring appropriate standards in advertising, in particular, to prevent advertising from targeting minors;
	(xiii)	investigating mechanisms to ensure that some of the benefits of on-line gambling accrue more directly to the local community;
	(xiv)	working with State and Territory governments to ensure that on-line and interactive gambling operators meet the highest standards of probity and auditing through licensing agreements;
	(xv)	seeking co-regulation of interactive gambling by establishing a national regulatory framework that provides consumer safeguards and industry Codes of Practice; and
	(xvi)	coordinating the development of a co-regulatory regime through the Ministerial Council comprising of relevant State and Federal Ministers”.
I would like to make some comments on paragraphs (i) through to (vii). Paragraph (i) condemns the government for failing to adopt the most practical and effective way of reducing social harm arising from gambling by not choosing to strictly regulate the domestic industry. 
Paragraph (ii) expresses the opposition's concern, which I discussed earlier, that the impact of this bill may exacerbate problem gambling in Australia by barring access to regulated online gambling services with in-built safeguards. The bill still allows access to unregulated offshore online gambling sites that do not offer consumer protection or probity, placing those most vulnerable to problem gambling at an alarmingly high risk.
Paragraph (iii) condemns the government for not extending current regulatory and consumer protection requirements applying to offline and land based casinos, clubs or wagering venues to online casinos and online wagering facilities. The opposition supports extension of offline regulatory requirements to online facilities to ensure the probity of operators and consumer protection. 
Paragraph (iv) expresses the opposition's concern that the bill damages Australia's international reputation for effective consumer protection laws and strong, workable gambling regulation. Australia, to date, has had a fine reputation internationally for its regulation of gambling. By failing to regulate the Australian industry, the Howard government is causing further damage to that reputation. The consequences of this damage will not be seen in the immediate future; however, the damage will be done if the bill is passed in its current form.
Paragraph (v) condemns the government for singling out one form of gambling in an attempt to placate community concern about the adverse social consequences of gambling. The government has singled out a form of gambling that has been around for some time now but has not revealed itself as a significant cause of gambling problems. The bill is indeed a cop-out, and the government is acting in this way to avoid addressing more prevalent forms of gambling in Australian society, which is the real issue that the community is concerned about.
Paragraph (vi) expresses the opposition's view that the bill is contrary to the best interests of the Australian Internet industry and the development of e-commerce in this country. Interactive gambling has distinct advantages to offer the Australian industry. As a consequence of the existing industry, Australia has acquired and retained technological expertise in our country. Excessive prohibition on the Internet creates an environment of mistrust and fear amongst consumers, inhibits development of an Australian industry and has a detrimental impact on the Australian economy.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2001-06-21,"—I want to begin by responding to the previous speaker. I believe that he made a very comprehensive analysis of the debate, but he did not answer the fundamental question. I hope that further in the debate we will get this answer from the opposition—that is, if you are going to say that it is impossible technologically to ban gambling, then why is it possible technologically to regulate it? 
The other problem, of course, is that regulation is in the hands of the states, and they have shown themselves to be singularly unable to maintain regulation once it is put in place. If we take the history of the last 30 years or even 50 years of regulation in this country, you will find that tough regulations put in place by the states inevitably are eroded over time. Constantly there is the problem that, where tough regulations are put in place at the opening of some gambling facility by the state, those regulations have been eroded. So what I look for in the debate from the opposition is some response to that part of the debate, because I think those are important questions. So I state those questions while at the same time complimenting Senator Bishop on his comprehensive overview of the debate. 
For most of the 212 years of European history in Australia, gambling has been part of that history, as have been concerns about problems associated with gambling. However, those voicing the concerns have been in the minority until quite recently. In recent surveys, a majority of Australians have indicated their opposition to the opening up of further outlets for gambling. The recent Productivity Commission survey found that 70 per cent of Australians believed that gambling did more harm than good and 92 per cent of those surveyed did not want to see the further expansion of gaming machines.
The main reason for this opposition has to do with the harm caused to individuals and families through gambling addiction. Australia has around 300,000 problem gamblers, if we add together the two categories that were part of the Productivity Commission report. Each problem gambler, I have been told—this comes from a number of different studies—affects, on average, between seven to 10 people. This includes wives, husbands, children, employees, employers, creditors and victims of crime. The Productivity Commission estimates that the cost of problem gambling could be as high as $5 billion per year. It covers such things as the costs of bankruptcies, suicide, loss of productivity, counselling services, divorce and legal costs.
I recommend that everyone interested in this particular issue should read the Productivity Commission report Australia's gambling industries, although it is quite a large read. The key findings present some very stark statistics on Australia's reliance on gambling, in terms of both its social effects and economic effects. The report states that gambling provides enjoyment to most Australians, over 80 per cent of whom gambled in the last year, spending about $11 billion. It states that 40 per cent gamble regularly and that gambling is a big and rapidly growing business in Australia, with the industry currently accounting for an estimated 1.5 per cent of GDP and employing over 100,000 people in more than 7,000 businesses throughout the country.
The other statistic which is very important in this debate is the increasing reliance of state governments on gambling revenue. The capture that reliance on gambling revenue initiates in terms of state governments' ability to regulate is another question which must be addressed in this debate. We ask state governments to regulate and at the same time those governments increasingly rely on gambling revenue. There seems to be a kind of a break in credibility in that proposition.
The statistics provided in relation to the problem are also alarming, with 2.1 per cent of the adult population estimated to have a severe or moderate gambling problem that requires some form of treatment. The report confirms that the prevalence of problem gambling is related to the degree of accessibility, particularly to gaming machines. While problem gamblers account for $3.5 billion in expenditure—that is, of direct gambling expenditure—annually and lose around $12,000 each annually, it is the social cost which is of greatest concern. One in 10 problem gamblers said they have contemplated suicide due to gambling. Nearly half of those in counselling reported losing time from work or study in the past year due to gambling. That also came from the Productivity Commission report.
As I said, there is a growing concern about the increasing dependence of state governments on gambling as a source of revenue. The percentage of gambling revenue as a proportion of general revenue of state governments has risen steadily in recent years. Along with this dependence has gone an increasing relaxation of the regulation of gambling facilities by state governments. No matter how carefully new forms of gambling have been regulated upon their introduction, the history of poker machines, the TAB and casinos shows that over time gambling regulation always gets watered down because governments are always looking for ways to increase their revenues. The other problem associated with state governments and the regulation of gambling was very ably illustrated, as I said last time I made a contribution to this debate, by the GOCORP scandal in Queensland, where the Treasurer awarded a licence to three Labor Party members. That is an indication of the problems we have when we ask state governments to regulate, and at the same time they are dependent upon gambling revenue.
Let me give you another example of gambling regulatory failure: the TAB. This was highlighted by Tim Costello and Royce Millar in their book Wanna bet? They said that, when the TAB started in the 1960s, regulations prohibited seating, promotions, drinks and aided broadcasts. It was intended to take illegal bookmaking off the streets and help reduce crime as well as provide an opportunity for state and territory governments to get their hands on tax revenue. When they first started, TABs looked like post offices and certainly were not near any pub or club. Costello in his book uses the term `slippage': once the TAB was legalised there was a sanitising effect and arguments soon arose that it should be allowed to advertise. But no-one questions this move. No-one seems to remember that the condition of making the TAB legal was that it could not be advertised. The current situation with TABs, in pubs in particular, is a far cry from the tight regulatory system established in the 1960s. State and territory governments have allowed this slippage because they have become addicted to gambling revenue and have allowed gambling facilities to become increasingly available over the last 50 years. One can predict that the same slippage will occur if the only regulation of online gambling is left with state governments.
Some social commentators have commented especially on the extension of gambling within Australian homes which would occur if the extension of online gambling goes ahead. Again in his book Wanna bet? Tim Costello points out that the demand to extend gambling facilities comes from the industry itself, not from public demand for more outlets. The potential of online gambling is enormous and raises again the problem created by accessibility. It has the potential to turn every home in Australia with a TV set or a computer into a virtual casino. The proposed legislation is the first time since the Second World War that I can find, in limited research, any Australian government proposing legislation to limit gambling rather than to extend gambling.
—It has been opposed by Labor.
—I might have some criticisms of the government's legislation, Senator Kemp, because it does not go far enough, but I commend the government because at least it has made a start.
—And condemn the Labor Party.
—I will get to that. Let me say in commending the government that the Democrats—
—All of them?
—Yes, I think I can speak for all the Democrats at this point. The Democrats will be looking for further action by the federal government in terms of problem gambling, particularly the gambling created by poker machines. I can say that on behalf of all of the Democrats, although most of my contribution is on my own behalf, I will admit.
—Did you run this speech past your leader?
—My leader does not agree with me. You know that already, Senator McGauran; I do not have to tell you that. It is important, as I have said, that this is the first time since the Second World War that any Australian government has proposed legislation that limits gambling.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—It is important, Senator Kemp and Senator Bishop, to underline this fact because the offer of the states to regulate online gambling is an offer to regulate the extension of gambling outlets. Let us underline that. It is not an offer to limit gambling, to wind back gambling outlets. It is an offer to regulate the extension of gambling in terms of online gambling. I think we need to note that. The only limits the states are proposing are limits on this extension because even they are not prepared to promote the unfettered opening up of online gambling at this stage. However, the history of state government regulation in Australia is a history of incremental increase in gambling through progressive watering down of the tougher regulations of 20 or 30 years ago.
Let me again commend the government on taking a first step. Senator Bishop has said that there is not enough being done to mitigate the effects of problem gambling, and I agree with him absolutely—not by any state government and not by the federal government. But again I think we should commend the federal government that they have taken first steps along this road. In particular, in responding during the last debate we had on the moratorium on Internet gambling, the federal government made a commitment to put funds towards research and also towards an education program warning Australians about the danger of the misuse of gambling. Let me commend the government that in the recent budget $10 million was allocated over four years.
What I would like to see the federal government also doing in terms of the mitigation of problem gambling is taking the lead in working with the states to increase funding for counselling and rehabilitation programs. There is a strong argument for allocating a percentage of gambling revenue to these programs. There is a direct correlation between the extension of gambling outlets and the increase in problem gambling. While commending the federal government on taking a first step, I think there are many other steps that need to be taken, and that can be taken, in terms of addressing the needs of problem gamblers.
In relation to this, let me briefly turn to the many phone calls and written communications I have had from a friend of mine, the Reverend John Tully, who runs—and has run for the last 15 years on the Gold Coast in Queensland—what is registered as the `New Life Ministry at Street Level Inc'. This is a service particularly directed at the counselling and rehabilitation of problem gamblers and gamblers addicted to many other substances, and so on. The work has grown because the problem has grown on the Gold Coast. He particularly underlines the need for rehabilitation and compensation for the victims of gambling, particularly those victims of crimes related to gambling. He says that both the cost of rehabilitation and the cost of compensation should be paid by the gambling industry itself—especially by casinos, because he is very aware of the operation of Jupiter's Casino on the Gold Coast. He says that it should be the industry rather the taxpayer who funds these kinds of compensation and rehabilitation programs. It should be by levy on the industry.
I am not sure what he means by that but my suggestion is that a percentage of state government revenue from gambling should be applied to these programs so that as the revenue increases so the percentage which goes towards the mitigation of problem gambling would also rise. This is the experience of one person who is directly involved in the programs to help problem gamblers and others and this is his suggestion, which I certainly would endorse very strongly.
I was going to quote from an article by the Reverend Tim Costello in the Age in April this year. He talked about `Gambling's great web of lies' and commended the Prime Minister and said that it `is right to try and ban Internet gambling'. I do not have time to put on the record all that he says but I commend that article to other senators.
Another article in the WeekendAustralian of 2 to 3 December 2000 reports a study which was done into gambling in just one town—Bendigo in Victoria. Some of the results of that study showed that in a population of 80,000 the money lost to gambling annually in that town is $32.35 million, or $404 dollars per person. The number of poker machines in Bendigo is 532 and more than 72 per cent of players earn less than $30,000 a year. That gives the lie to the idea that the gambling industry takes most of its money from high rollers. It does not. It takes most of its money from people on low incomes. Bendigo has almost 850 problem gamblers—in just one city in one state of Australia—and it has six full-time gambling counsellors. The net loss—and this is an economic study—to the region's economy is estimated to be $11.57 million a year, or 237 full-time jobs. While we talk about the size of the industry and the number of people it employs, one study of one town shows that there is actually a net loss in economic terms and a net loss of jobs due to gambling. I see that my time has expired, and no doubt the debate will continue in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-06-21,"—Australia is facing a crisis of problem gambling. The question is: what are we to do about it? What are our powers to do something about this tragedy that is affecting not only the problem gamblers but also their families, society and indeed the economy? The government in this legislation, the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001, is seeking to prevent the spread of gambling on the Internet. However, this bill does not do that because it does not ban the overseas operators. 
This legislation will, in fact, play into the hands of Internet gambling operators operating from overseas. These organisations are poised to take the commercial opportunity that this bill offers to them, because it bans access to Australian sites but it does not ban access to overseas sites.  Problem gamblers will have ease of access to those sites—no doubt about that. Anybody with any computer literacy at all, the minimum of computer literacy, can get onto overseas sites. 
Furthermore, many of the overseas gambling sites are linked to pornography operators. Even one of the `respectable' organisations, Ladbrokes, one of the largest gambling outfits in the world, has just done a deal, an agreement, with the Playboy empire to link their sites. I believe that these issues raise the question as to whether this legislation is counterproductive or supportable.
We have a very grave problem, a crisis, facing us in Australia. We have the highest number of poker machines per head than anywhere else in the world. In 1997-98, Australians gambled $95 billion and they lost $10.8 billion of that. Around 7,000 businesses provide gambling services, including 2,888 pubs, 2,408 clubs and 13 casinos. There are some 290,000 problem gamblers in Australia and 130,000 of those are severe problem gamblers. That number of 290,000 represents 2.1 per cent of Australian adults. One problem gambler, as Senator Woodley has pointed out, affects on average seven to nine other people. The term `problem gambling' is defined variously. One such definition is the situation where a person's gambling activity gives to rise to harm to the individual player and/or to his or her family and may extend to the community, and another definition is a chronic failure to resist gambling impulses.
Senator Woodley has mentioned the $5 billion cost per year. A big factor in the level of problem gambling is accessibility, especially to gaming machines, which has increased dramatically in Australia. Whereas a few years ago you had to go to New South Wales to put a bet on a pokie, now you only have to stroll down to the end of the road to the nearest pub. In my own state, the number of poker machines in pubs and clubs has grown by 45 per cent in the last 12 months. Australia wide, 15 per cent of gamblers are problem gamblers, and they spend $3.5 billion or one-third of the gambling market. Problem gamblers lose on average $12,000 a year compared with an average loss of $650 for other gamblers.  So we are faced with a huge crisis.
The Commonwealth government does not have the requisite power under the Constitution to regulate gambling as such. That is the responsibility of the states and territories. They need to address the problem of problem gamblers. While there are some attempts to limit access, such as a cap on the number of poker machines, there is still a lot to be done. But can we really trust the states and territories to be the gatekeepers, because the states and territories are addicted themselves to gambling? There has been significant growth in most states' revenue in the 1990s since the licensing of casinos and poker machines. Gambling tax revenue as a percentage of own tax revenue increased on average from 9.8 per cent in 1975 to 11.7 per cent in 1998. Western Australia's percentage actually dropped from 6.4 per cent to 5.7 per cent. Western Australia has only one poker machine venue. Victoria now leads all states with 15.2 per cent in 1998 and 17.5 per cent in 2001. Tasmania increased its revenue from six per cent to 10.3 per cent. The Tasmanian government revenue was $73.3 million last year—quite a lot less than other states. In Tasmania, gambling on poker machines has increased dramatically since 1997 when poker machines were first permitted outside the casinos. In Victoria, the state government derives 17.5 per cent of its revenue from taxes on gambling. Poker machines make up 65 per cent of the $1.6 billion derived from gambling in Victoria. In New South Wales, 10.2 per cent of the state's revenue comes from gambling taxes. In Western Australia, which has no poker machines outside the casino, it is six per cent. 
Based on the Productivity Commission's study, up to 42 per cent of state governments' pokie revenues comes from problem gambling. The Productivity Commission also found evidence of a concentration of gaming machines in areas of low socioeconomic status in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. This suggests that more residents in these areas are problem gamblers and the social cost is higher. There is need for urgent action by the states and territories to meet this crisis. They should directly reduce access to gambling. Is it too much to ask them to be the gatekeepers when they are the thieves? They are the ones who are addicted. They are the ones who are getting the money. Nevertheless, as Senator Woodley said, this is a matter of growing concern amongst the people of Australia and it could become a huge election question in the minds of a lot of voters.
I draw the attention of the Senate to the submissions made by the Fujitsu company and REGIS Controls on smartcard technology. Those submissions were made to the Senate Information Technologies Committee, and they are well worth considering. I suggest that the governments of the states and territories look at this technology to see what can be done with offline gambling. The system allows regulation of gambling on all forms of electronic gaming machines, EGMs, as well as Internet broadband and cable TV. The process was described in the following way. Around 90 per cent of poker machines in Australia are smartcard enabled but not activated. It is a relatively simple task to activate a smartcard reader. The personalised smartcard has 10 features which allow full regulation, including the proposed AUS model. The smartcard is programmed only to operate with cash, not a credit account. Smartcard has a built-in clock so that a player's limit can be recorded for a week, a month, a year and so on. Even if the player uses physical cash—that is, notes and coins—the smartcard still records the net loss incurred by the player. 
There is one limit per player for all venues and all electronic forms of gambling. A player's card can be banned through self-exclusion, court order or injunction. The security system is defence style encryption and prevents fraud and tampering. All the appropriate features of harm minimisation can be incorporated in the smartcard system, for example, compulsory breaks, limits on playing time and retention of a proportion of significant winnings. This can be customised for each state and territory if there are different harm minimisation features. The minimal failure rate of smartcards and the security system eliminates coin jams, machine malfunction, cash pilfering and the risk of serious crimes. The card can be used anonymously so that the venue does not know who the player is or the amount that they have spent. The card tracks losses per session, per week, per month, per year and displays this information when requested by the player. The card issue process would involve the player requesting a smartcard that is personalised. Most major poker machine venues issue a magnetic stripe card currently so that they can track the player. 
The card would be issued to a player based on a 100-point check as for a bank issued card. The player can load cash either directly from a deposit or current account, or via the use of physical cash. Lost cards can be replaced with the amount of e-cash restored. The card can be locked so that no-one else can use it. If venues want to offer a loyalty system, and most currently do, that can be provided via the card with bonus points stored on the card. The loyalty system would be entirely at the individual's discretion. Overseas visitors can be issued with a temporary card. Players cannot change their limit upward for a 12-month period, but they can reduce their limit at any given time. All cards and the operation of the system would be paid for by the gambling industry. In fact, the industry would save some tens of millions of dollars per annum in machine maintenance, pilfering and security costs. Card issuing and service centres could be located anywhere in regional Australia.
I took the time to place that on record so that the matter can be considered further not only by the states and territories but also by the Commonwealth. There needs to be a tightening of the regulations and the crisis of problem gambling needs to be addressed. The question that the government is faced with is: given that crisis in gambling, do we then extend access to gambling through the Internet? The clear answer is that we should not. As the bill stands, it does not ban gambling on overseas Internet sites. It does attempt to do so on Australian sites, but it does not do so on overseas sites. I intend to move amendments that will prevent gambling on overseas sites.
Just as Australia's Internet content regulations, although well intentioned, have been unable to effectively restrict access to overseas porn sites, so too will the complaints system proposed in the bill do next to nothing to restrict access to overseas gambling sites, despite the amendments that will come in about the arrest of international operators if they set foot on Australian soil, or the ban on advertising. As I have indicated, overseas sites are poised to take advantage of the legislation. Sportsbet.com have purchased a large operation in Vanuatu in anticipation of the commercial opportunity that will open up to overseas operators if this legislation is passed in its existing form. That happened just recently. There is considerable email spamming inviting users to casino sites linked to porn sites. Anyone with a hotmail address knows what I am talking about.
Our young people are prey to these highly unethical and undesirable tactics. They are being invited to what appear to be sites hosting harmless games, but then they are invited and enticed to enter linked porn sites. Every possible effort should be made to protect them. If access to non-Australian based interactive gambling services remains in the bill we will find that the new wave of problem gamblers in this country will be young people—the computer savvy people. Those young ones will make up the new generation of problem gamblers.
I have forwarded to all colleagues a list of amendments this morning, and I ask that colleagues look at them. I request that they be considered very thoroughly by colleagues. Unless the bill is amended, we will play into the hands of international Internet gambling sites. That relies on a number of powers, including the banking power. NOIE considered this matter, but its report largely restated the objections of  the banking industry—by the Australian Bankers Association. We should realise that if persons say, `This really is a bit over the top.' Just remember that the people who say that are the banking industry.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I rise to speak on the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001, noting that this is the second time that the government has brought before this parliament legislation relating to Internet gambling. The government's first attempt, the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000, sought to initiate a 12-month ban on the development of the interactive gambling industry in Australia by creating a new criminal offence that prohibited a person from providing an interactive service unless they were already providing such a service before the retrospective date of commencement, which of course was 19 May 2000. With that moratorium bill, the coalition decided not to legislate against existing interactive gambling operators, as, they said at the time, `this option could save significant consequences for the industry and industry employees' as well as impact on state and territory revenues. But the bill we are talking about today will do just that.
Let me begin by stating at the outset that this Interactive Gambling Bill 2001 is cynical legislation. It is cynical because the legislation will not work and, if the federal government was honest with itself and with the Australian public, it knows that it will not work. As the Labor Party said in its minority report to the inquiry into the Interactive Gambling Bill earlier this year:
The flaws in the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001 are so pervasive that not only will the Bill fail to achieve its stated objectives but it will most likely exacerbate the very harms that it seeks and professes to circumscribe.
The alternative approach advocated by the Labor Party is that of improved regulation. This view is consistent with that propounded by the Productivity Commission in its report into Australia's gambling industries. A total prohibition on Internet gambling is neither feasible nor desirable, and the cooperation of the states and territories is required to implement a national regulatory framework. The states and territories have indicated that they are more than happy to go along this route. We believe that a legal and regulated industry is the best harm minimisation policy.
This bill will not work. I have spoken to many people in the Territory, and here in Canberra, who have been lobbying about this bill and who are either involved in online gambling or involved in any way with the Internet. They have all said that this legislation is fundamentally flawed. It won't work. It will send Australian gamblers, as Senator Harradine said, to offshore, unregulated sites and, eventually maybe—possibly—to overseas regulated sites.
The Internet Industry Association has released an independent report from the Gartner consulting group into the government's online gambling bill. That report concludes that it is not technically feasible to stop Australians using offshore or local Internet casinos. In releasing the report, the Chief Executive of the Internet Industry Association, Mr Peter Coroneos, said:
The legislation is technically inept and has no real prospects of protecting those whom it claims to protect. From a technical viewpoint, the bill will damage industry participants who are forced to try to make it work while delivering no tangible benefit to end users.
He said that the Internet Industry Association believed that:
... it is so fundamentally flawed that no amount of amendment on the floor of the Senate can salvage it.
In the Internet Industry Association's news release of 15 June, the association states:
It is not an answer for government to say: `Well, the Internet is more accessible.' If that is so, why are they not banning phone betting? There is a phone in every home. They have the power to do this, but they choose not to.
Alan Pedley from WWWagering and Gaming Consultants has said, in relation to this bill and with regard to the Northern Territory:
The Northern Territory has currently healthy and very substantial future industries at stake.
He goes on to say that the proposed amendments will: 
... remove safeguards to control problematic gaming; remove safeguards to prohibit under age gaming; remove safeguards to protect gamblers privacy and fairness; will cost the Territory ... important e-commerce employment ... will cost the Territory ... important e-commerce investment ... and will cost the Territory ... important export revenue.
Alan Pedley goes on to say that he was responsible for the administration of technology based gambling regulation during the period when the Northern Territory established itself as the world's best practice jurisdiction.
The Australian Casino Association believes that, if the federal government goes ahead with this legislation, it will ban Australians from accessing Australian Internet gambling sites, but it will still permit Australian Internet gambling sites to access overseas markets and it will allow Australians to access overseas sites. The association states:
While the Association welcomes the fact that the Government will not ban Australian Internet gambling sites, including casino sites ... the Association is disappointed that the Government still refuses to understand that the only way that it will meet its objectives of dealing with the issue of problem gambling is through regulation at a national level.
Putting it simply, a ban will just not work.
Why are Australians being refused the opportunity to access Australian regulated sites but they can still access overseas sites that are not subject to the same high regulatory standards as are Australian regulated sites?
Even though this legislation is being referred to as a ban on online gambling, it is really not a ban as such. Under this so-called ban, Australians will continue to have access to almost every gambling site on the Internet. The only change is that Australians will be banned from using their own sites. Some 99.9 per cent of the 1,400 or so gambling sites on the Internet are based offshore. Access to those sites, under this bill, will not change. The only effect the bill will have is to force Australians to gamble offshore on those sites. The only sites Australians will not be able to access are the best regulated sites known internationally, and those that offer the world's best in harm minimisation.
On 7 July last year, Senator Richard Alston, the minister responsible for this legislation, announced that the government would conduct a study into the feasibility and consequences of banning Internet gambling. This inquiry was undertaken by the National Office for the Information Economy, which released its report in March of this year. I want to highlight two of the recommendations in the report. The report stated:
There are several technical methods that could potentially be used to implement a ban on interactive gambling based on Internet content control.
However, the report stated that `all of these methods can potentially degrade general Internet performance' and `none would be 100 per cent effective in preventing Australians' access to interactive gambling services'. The report also stated:
Economic modelling commissioned for the study indicates that a ban may have modest or small economic benefits for Australia in terms of restricting access to a harmful activity and possible aggregate benefits for State and Territory taxation revenue.
The report concluded:
The determined and skilled users can evade all of the technology options identified as being suitable for supporting a ban on interactive gambling.
The report also concluded:
Given the availability of these evasion options, a ban on interactive gambling will not be 100% effective.
Australia's regulated online gambling sites provide something that is not provided by the unregulated sites that Australian gamblers may be forced to use: protection from being ripped off on the Internet. A ban will drive Australian online gamblers to unregulated and potentially dubious sites that do not necessarily provide education, harm minimisation, betting limits or consumer protection. The unregulated sites cannot guarantee personal security or provide the safeguards that the Australian online operators currently practise.
In March this year, Senator Alston said the ban would be effective because people would not take the risk of gambling on an unregulated site offshore. However, a number of other countries are looking at approving Internet gaming, such as South Africa and several countries in Europe, including the UK. In the US, the Nevada state legislature has passed legislation that means that land based operators in Nevada will now focus on developing Internet casino sites. It means that consumers looking for regulated sites will soon find them offshore and will go there. Contrary to what the government is suggesting, this bill will do nothing to reduce problem gambling. It does nothing to control or limit problem gambling in the online environment, nor does it overcome any of the problems associated with interactive gambling. The evidence suggests that problem gambling in Australia is almost exclusively associated with land based gaming revenues.
The Australian Casino Association says that the legislation ignores the evidence. The Productivity Commission's report into Australia's gambling industries, which was released in November 1999, showed the expenditure shares for problem gamblers, and they were: gaming machines netted 42.3 per cent; wagering netted 33.1 per cent; scratchies netted 19.1 per cent; casino table games netted 10.7 per cent; lotteries netted 5.7 per cent; and other non-raffle games, of the type we are talking about, netted 25 per cent. Importantly, the association says that one-third of gaming machines are now in hotels and six per cent are in casinos. Given these findings, why are Internet casino operators being singled out for special attention under this bill, particularly when it is these operators which have sought and established the highest standards of player protection in the world?
The proposed amendments will still allow people to place bets on races, sporting contests and even casino games on the Internet. Regulation can be effective. As I have said, Labor supports the federal coordination of consistent state and territory based regulatory regimes. Effective regulation of interactive gambling is the only practical way of minimising social and criminal harm. The online gambling industry is currently subject to a high degree of regulation which is oversighted by state and territory governments. On a number of occasions, I have visited Lasseters Casino and its online gambling operations in Alice Springs. From what I have seen, under the strict regulatory framework, Australian licensed online gambling industries have already adopted stringent codes of practice that prohibit credit gaming. They allow members to preset betting limits and provide personal identification numbers to ensure that family members cannot access the gaming sites. They ensure the privacy and security of participants, and they issue winnings via non-negotiable cheques, not credit cards.
In today's papers we have a number of articles that criticise the government in relation to this legislation. The Australian today has an article entitled `Howard's net gambling ban is born to lose'. It says:
A sensible approach would have recognised that Internet gambling poses big social challenges and that these can best be met by co-operative regulation. Blanket bans on the Internet create more problems than they solve. Online technology offers much potential to identify and protect those at risk from gambling.
A Sydney Morning Herald article today says this bill is `a ban in name only'. It says:
Not only does it fail to stop Australians using them—
that is, faulty operations offshore—
but the money they spend on offshore casinos will not be subject to Australian taxes.
So it is revenue that this country loses.
In the final minutes of my speech, let me turn to the impact of the bill on the Northern Territory and what has been happening in the Northern Territory, particularly in the last week or so. Australia's only Internet casino at this stage is the site of Lasseters in Alice Springs. Last year it turned over $100 million. Lasseters have already said that, if the ban comes into play, they will be looking at relocating to Vanuatu, meaning the loss of 45 jobs from Alice Springs. I have already identified in my speech what I believe to be a significant loss for the Territory, which is of course a loss in intellectual property—through technology and the use of the computer and e-commerce—which is generated by developing these sites and keeping them regulated.
I want to turn to the events of this week which have seen the Northern Territory media focus on the efforts of my colleague Senator Grant Tambling. Labor's concerns about this legislation are shared by the Territory government. The Country Liberal Party up there knows that this ban is ill considered and would have a very negative impact on the Territory. Jobs would be lost, and technological expertise would be lost as a result of this ill-conceived and ineffective legislation. For once, I have to say reluctantly that it is probably something upon which I would agree with my Territory Country Liberal Party counterpart, SenatorGrant Tambling, who has been advised by his party to oppose this legislation and the effect that it will have on Territorians. I will provide for the Senate a copy of an article that was in Tuesday's paper, where the CLP tells Senator Tambling to toe the gaming line.
In fact, it has been a source of nothing but discussion on the radio this week. The Chief Minister on Tuesday in an interview on ABC radio said about Senator Tambling:
He knows absolutely clear the government's—
that is, the Northern Territory government's—
position. Unequivocally we think this legislation is nonsense. We think it's a populist politics at the least, and we believe it will have no effect on gaming or gambling.
He goes on to say that he believes:
It's an issue that he stands on wearing the badge of the CLP.
That is, Senator Tambling. It continues:
The CLP government has a firm position, the CLP as a Party through its management committee who spoke to him and gave him a unanimous point of view the other night has a very strong position.
I am led to believe that in fact Senator Tambling was preselected on the undertaking that he would be advised by and stand by the results of the central council who oppose this legislation outright. Susan Cavanagh, the president of the CLP in the Northern Territory, went on to say in an interview on Monday on ABC radio:
We had a full management committee meeting last week and unanimously with the exception of Grant obviously didn't agree, but the rest of management committee to a person told Grant that he had to cross the floor irrespective of whether the legislation was amended or not.
Senator Tambling, perhaps I can just put your name on the seat next to me. I say to you, Senator Tambling: come on over; there's a spare seat here next to me with your name on it already.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. The action of Senator Crossin is not within the standing orders, as I understand it.
 (Senator McKiernan)—I would be prepared to take further advice on your point of order, Senator Harradine.
—Order! I would be prepared to take further advice from you, Senator Harradine, on your point of order, as to where the senator's comments are in conflict with the standing orders.
—I was not referring to her comments, although I would have thought that the courtesy in that regard would be to notify the person to whom she is referring. I was referring to her actions.
—I am going to rule that there is no point of order. I am not sure whether Senator Crossin has indeed informed Senator Tambling of what her actions were going to be, but usually the matter is done privately between senators. It is a practice that I invariably follow myself when I am engaged in such as that. But I am ruling that there is no point of order.
—On a further point of order, is it therefore permissible for any senator to come in here and put a banner up, for example, over their seat? 
—You are now asking me a question, Senator Harradine, and I do not believe that I am in a position to answer the question. It is a question that should be properly directed to the President, I believe, and I will ensure that your question is directed to the President.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. We are not into advertising in this chamber. If people have a habit of—
—What is your point of order, Senator Heffernan?
—Could I seek leave to make a statement?
—Not during the course of a senator's contribution, no.
—I will go around and take it down myself, if you want me to.
—Senator Heffernan, I shall not be challenged in the chair.
—I am not challenging you.
—Order! I will not tolerate behaviour like that, Senator Heffernan, from you or from any other senator in this place. A point of order has been raised. I have considered that point of order; I have made a ruling on it. A further point of order was raised in the form of a question which I believe should properly go to the President. I have given an undertaking that I will ensure that the question is directed to the President. If you want to follow the matter further, I suggest that you do so directly to the President. 
Senator Crossin would be aware why the points of order have been raised. Senator Crossin is in control of matters whereby she can choose to remove the piece of paper that seems to have offended some people, or she can choose to leave it there. In regard to Senator Harradine's question, if it was a banner carried in the chamber, I would of course immediately rule that a banner be pulled down. But I have in the past in my time in this chamber noticed that people have used pieces of paper to illustrate points through the course of debates.
—I have made my point, and I am happy to remove Senator Tambling's name from the seat.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order to support Senator Harradine's question.
—I have already ruled on that matter, and I do not think I will engage in further dialogue on that matter. I do appreciate the action that Senator Crossin has undertaken just now.
—In doing so, I would like to remind my colleague that, when we do in fact take a vote on this bill next week—reluctantly as I might on behalf of the Northern Territory Chief Minister and the president of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory—perhaps I might invite Senator Tambling to come across and sit next to me in a seat that we will no doubt leave vacant here. He knows it has already had his name on it. He is more than welcome to cross the floor and support the Territory next week when this legislation is voted upon. He knows full well that the subject of discussion on ABC radio this week has been that the Chief Minister and the party president have indicated that they will move that the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory reconsider his Senate preselection. Senator Tambling is in a very serious situation this week, I believe. He can throw off that shirt and show us the Superman cloak and fly over here and sit next to us next week and redeem his soul and his position.
—There's an image!
—There is an image, Senator Stott Despoja. It is probably not an image that many would be able to envisage. I hasten to add that I would not like to think that my colleague's parliamentary privilege or right to vote under his office were being threatened. If he knows full well that that is what he ought to do, he should come across the floor. I believe he has no option but to oppose the legislation.
In conclusion, this bill prevents Australian Internet gambling operators from providing services to customers in Australia, but it does not prevent operators from providing the same service to overseas residents. As a senator for the Northern Territory, I am concerned about the impact this ban will have on the Territory's economy. It will cost the Territory jobs, investment and technological expertise. No-one really considers that this ban will achieve its stated objectives. It will do nothing to reduce the real problems related to gambling in Australia. It will simply force online gamblers offshore to the 1,400 or so unregulated gambling sites.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-06-21,"—I begin my remarks on the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001 by commending Senator Crossin on highlighting the right to vote according to conscience. It is something that my party, the Australian Democrats, practices. It is a right that we hold dear. While exercised rarely, when it is exercised it tends to be on matters that involve particular social, ethical and clearly personal positions. Most of the media coverage about the interactive gambling legislation has concentrated not so much on the merits of the legislation but on whether or not this government has the numbers to pass it. Subsequently, media coverage of the Democrats position has concentrated on whether or not the Australian Democrat senators will vote differently from each other on the bill. Yes, we are going to do that, and Senator Woodley and others have indicated their reasons in their contributions. Certainly, Senator Woodley has spoken and I expect other colleagues to follow, including the portfolio holder, Senator Brian Greig, who will speak on behalf of the majority of party room.
We believe on this issue of gambling that individuals may feel the need to vote according to their conscience rather than the majority position. That is why, as leader, I have declared this very much a free vote. However, in relation to this debate about gambling there are more elements that Democrat senators agree on than on which they disagree. We agree that—and I suspect any computer literate commentator also agrees on this point—it is technically difficult to stop access to Internet sites at Australian borders. We certainly endorse the IIA comments that were made available to the chamber in Senator Crossin's contribution earlier. My personal position is that the legislation before us is neither desirable nor technically feasible. The Democrats also share a very common concern that the real issues of problem gambling in Australia are not fundamentally being addressed by the legislation before us. We are united in our belief that the impact of problem gambling hits hardest in communities that can least afford it.
We know that one of the biggest sources of problem gambling in Australia right now is poker machines. This bill does not touch on this issue. Amendments are being moved to make sure that the inadvertent capturing of poker machines in this legislation does not happen. The Democrats agree that a regulatory approach is to be recommended, as did the Senate report Netbets: A review of online gambling in Australia as well as the 1999 Productivity Commission report on Australia's gambling industries. We agree that the states' and territories' reliance on gambling revenue has been a major impediment to reform.
One way of genuinely addressing problem gambling would be through the Ministerial Council on Gambling. Subsequently, it was on behalf of my party that yesterday I wrote to the Prime Minister and asked him to assume responsibilities over the Ministerial Council on Gambling in conjunction with the premiers and the chief ministers of the states and territories. The establishment of a Ministerial Council on Gambling aimed at achieving a national approach to the challenge of problem gambling was a key recommendation of the 1999 Productivity Commission report. The aim of the ministerial council was to establish a national approach to the negative impacts of problem gambling by exchanging information on responsible gambling strategies and providing a forum for discussing common issues, with the objective of developing suitable regulatory approaches. The ministerial council was meant to be a conduit for the exchange of information and approaches to gambling issues, and yet the Commonwealth did not even consult with the council in the formation of this legislation. It was raised with the council for the first time after this bill had been written.
In 1999, when the Productivity Commission report, with its frightening picture of the devastating cost of gambling, was released, the Prime Minister put out a press release acknowledging that gambling regulation is primarily a state responsibility. He said:
We need, however, a national response to what is clearly a national problem.
That national response has not been forthcoming. The Prime Minister has repeatedly called gambling a `significant social evil'. The Australian Democrats—as do, I suspect, all members in the chamber—agree that problem gambling has serious and debilitating social consequences. We welcome a commitment from the government to the Democrats that it will commit funds towards research into the social and economic effects of gambling and towards an education program warning Australians about the dangers of the misuse of gambling, as we recommended in our amendments during the moratorium legislation. We are glad to see that the government has picked up some of those recommendations, although not all. We urge the government to continue to work with the states to increase funding for counselling and rehabilitation programs.
The Prime Minister has not addressed the core of the problem. If we are to minimise the scope for problem gambling among Australians, as the explanatory memorandum of this bill suggests, we are not going to do it through this bill. This is, at best, a well-intentioned, perhaps, but unenforceable exercise in fiddling at the margins, because interactive gambling accounts for less than one per cent of gambling activities. We know one thing, though: a significant problem is poker machines or electronic gaming machines, best known as the pokies. Even Lloyd Williams, the founder of Crown Casino, has admitted that there are too many poker machines in Australia. Of all the poker machines in the world, one in five is in our country.
Reverend Tim Costello describes them as `the most aggressive form of gambling'. They are, perhaps, the least skilled gambling activity we have. It is hardly surprising that, according to the Productivity Commission's report, 92 per cent of Australians do not want to see further expansion of gambling machines. Action needs to be taken to reduce the number of pokies and to minimise their accessibility to Australians with a gambling problem. In my letter yesterday on behalf of the party to the Prime Minister, I urged him to use Commonwealth powers to prevent linked poker machine jackpots, to control misleading advertising and to reduce the number of poker machines, particularly in communities with a high incidence of problem gambling.
The Democrats have had long-held concerns—and these concerns are reflected in other parliaments in which we have representations—about the impact of problem gambling, particularly the impact of poker machines on the Australian community. We do not need another delaying tactic to avoid the real issue, or ineffective legislation designed to distract the electorate from the problem. We need decisive political force to reduce the number of poker machines in this country, but a reduction does not mean pulling them out of low risk, high income areas and leaving them in the low income, high risk areas, where the social consequences have been particularly disastrous.
The 1999 Productivity Commission report was the first comprehensive investigation into gambling in this country. It gives a picture not only of the regulatory structure of the gambling industries and the economics but also of the social consequences of the rapidly expanding gambling market. The Productivity Commission's report found that Australians gamble $11 billion per annum, more than half on poker machines—I think Senator Harradine has already put that on record—but the real issue of concern is problem gamblers, as it should be. The report found that around 290,000 Australians are problem gamblers, and problem gambling accounts for more than $3 billion in losses annually. To put that in perspective, compare the losses of more than $3 billion annually through problem gambling with, say, Commonwealth expenditure on vocational education, which is $1 billion. Problem gambling losses are more than three times what this government spends on vocational education.
These figures do not give us a feel for the human cost of problem gambling. This is disastrous not only for these problem gamblers but also for the estimated 1.5 million they directly affect as a result of bankruptcy, divorce, suicide and lost time at work. One in 10 problem gamblers said that they had contemplated suicide, and nearly half of those in counselling reported losing time from work or study in the past year due to gambling. Problem gambling is a serious issue with social and disastrous consequences for individuals, their families and their communities. Moreover, we are most concerned that problem gambling has particularly severe consequences in low socioeconomic communities.
The current regulatory environment is deficient. Regulations are complex, fragmented and often inconsistent. This has arisen primarily because of the inadequate policy making process and the strong incentives for governments to derive revenue from gambling. There are two levels to the problem of gambling that are relevant here: firstly, the individuals who are addicted to gambling; and, secondly, the states and territories who are addicted to gambling revenue.
The Ministerial Council on Gambling is the obvious starting point to initiate a national approach to the winding back of electronic gaming machines, or pokies, in this country. However, there are some problems with the council. The majority of members on that council are racing or revenue ministers. The only exceptions are the Commonwealth Minister for Family and Community Services, the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, the Deputy Premier of Tasmania and Norfolk Island's Minister for Health and Environment. They are outnumbered by six other ministers with interests in protecting gaming and raising revenue. I am not suggesting that they do not have an interest in the social and other consequences, but clearly their portfolios are in relation to gaming and racing interests.
There is a metaphor in the fact that in Brisbane they converted the old Treasury building into a casino. States' and territories' reliance on gambling revenues means that they have another focus. The Western Australian government runs its own lottery, with no shareholders, and the profits go directly to the Western Australian community. After prizes are paid to the winners, 40 per cent of the revenue is allocated to public hospitals. The rest goes to funding for the arts, to sports and to hundreds of community groups. Western Australia, however, is the state that has best resisted the temptation to allow proliferation of the pokies and, correspondingly, has a significantly lower incidence of problem gambling.
The Democrats believe it is now time for the Prime Minister, the premiers and the chief ministers of each jurisdiction to get involved. There is a popular song by the Australian band The Whitlams—which played here last night, apparently—called Blow up the pokies. One lyric says:
They are taking the food off the table so they can say the trains run on time.
There are vested interests in our states and territories in relation to this area, and that is why we need a leadership role from the Prime Minister, from the premiers and from the chief ministers. We should be pursuing regulatory measures as advocated in the Productivity Commission's report. Reverend Tim Costello, in his book Wanna bet, points to state governments' progressive watering down of the tougher regulations of 20 to 30 years ago. The Senate committee's report Netbets: A review of online gambling in Australia, as well as the Productivity Commission's report, recommended a regulatory approach over prohibition, so we are at a loss as to why the findings of the earlier Senate inquiry and the Productivity Commission's report should be disregarded.
There has been significant public discussion of the proposed ban on interactive gambling. While it is positive in that it has meant increased discussion of the broader problem of gambling, unfortunately that has seemingly led a number of the members of the public to believe that the government is doing something to address this problem. In fact, the real problem is worsening, and this bill will do very little, if anything, to address it. This bill will not even solve problem gambling in the narrow field of Internet gambling. The bill does not make it illegal for a person physically located in Australia to access offshore interactive gambling providers. As the National Office for the Information Economy has pointed out, the technical and commercial difficulties with quarantining access to offshore sites cannot be reasonably achieved. I believe that the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001 is unworkable. It is crazy to pass laws that cannot be enforced.
The bill does not and cannot prohibit online gambling. It can only hope to prevent online gambling through Australian sites. In effect, it is just handing over Australians who gamble to overseas gambling sites, with the click of a mouse. The result is that Australian money and jobs go overseas and Internet gambling is still accessible to any Australian who seeks it. Further, we will have no power to protect those Australians through regulation. Again and again this government has proven that it does not understand the technological, cultural and practical workings of the Internet. The Internet offers significant advantages to Australians, particularly those who are geographically isolated or isolated because of limited mobility. The benefits offered by the Internet also apply to gambling, as they do to other areas of the Internet. As the Northern Territory Department of Industries and Business pointed out:
This Bill ... will deny the 98% recreational gamblers the benefits of using Australian sites but will not prevent the 2% of problem gamblers from accessing almost all of the gambling sites on the Internet. As offshore sites do not have the harm minimisation features required by Australian regulations, this will exacerbate problem gambling.
The Northern Territory Department of Industries and Business also pointed out:
... many of the features that COAG and the Ministerial Council on Gambling would like to see implemented in the physical world are inspired by or easily achievable on the Internet technological platform.
Mechanisms to ensure harm minimisation are actually more readily available for Internet gambling than for other forms of gambling. I acknowledge that progress has been made in states and territories in furthering some kind of regulatory network. But, just as we were starting to see those efforts through the Darwin Summit and other meetings, the government has come in over the top of it, ignoring all the good advice we have had about regulation, why it works and why it should be promoted, with a prohibition that is both unworkable and undesirable, in my opinion.
One thing we cannot deny in this chamber is that Australia has long had a culture of gambling but a short history of failed attempts at prohibition. We have the diggers playing two-up in the back alley, the chook raffle, the meat tray and the bingo. This is gambling as it can be: entertainment, not obsession—games of chance and the chance to be game, if you like. Many charity events and fundraisers are based on gambling. We would be fools to deny it. Thousands of Australians buy books of tickets in lotteries and art unions, and not just in the remote hope of winning that trip to the Gold Coast or the car or whatever but because they want to support a worthy charity. I am not condemning those events. My small `l' liberal politics would not allow me to condemn those events, and I do not. I do not believe that these are the kinds of things that we should be worried about. I do not think we need to worry about them. These are community activities. If you like, they have in-built limits. It is a lot to do with the fact, I think, that some of these endeavours are communal; they are not lonely activities. They are out in the open, and not isolated. There are limits on how much can be bet and there are limits on when you can bet. They are, in effect, regulated. Proper regulation is what is needed to address the problems that have come from the dominant and still growing sectors of gambling—of casinos and pokies—as well as the emerging mode of gambling through the Internet.
But what is being proposed here is that we just continue to ignore one of the biggest existing problems—that is, poker machines—and concentrate all efforts on trying to stop something we cannot stop, not in this form and not practically—that is, Internet gambling. All this bill will do is move it overseas. The problem will stay in Australia but the profits will go overseas. The regulation of gambling has traditionally been a state responsibility. However, the Commonwealth has a direct responsibility in relation to the use of the Internet for gambling. So, in order to be seen to be doing something, the government is charging ahead with this ineffective bill instead of focusing on regulation as it should be.
When the moratorium legislation was discussed in its committee stage at the end of last year, I challenged the government—indeed, I did the first time round as well—to actually tackle land based and other gambling ventures. That challenge still stands because, again, there is still a distinction between the progress we have seen the Internet gaming industry make in relation to regulation versus the regulations that exist for land based and other gambling ventures. So that challenge still stands, and my party extends that challenge again to the Prime Minister today, as we did yesterday in the form of a letter on behalf of our entire party room. 
The Democrats are united in calling for the Prime Minister, the premiers and the chief ministers to immediately take a role in, and take responsibility for, the Ministerial Council on Gambling. I hope the government will hear that challenge and respond to it. I hope the government, instead of seeking headlines in order to be seen to be doing something about interactive gambling through this bill, will actually start reading some of the literature that is available, the literature that many of us who have been involved in the Netbets inquiry have read in detail and understand—that is, in short, that we should have a stringent regulatory national approach to this particular issue and not a technically unworkable and undesirable approach, as I believe is encapsulated in the legislation before us.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-21,"—I rise to speak on the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001. When the government first announced the reason for the introduction of a bill to permit the difficulties arising from problem gambling to be addressed, I was quite relieved. However, that relief was short-lived. When I read the details of the proposed moratorium bill, the futility and inadequacy of this whole project dawned on me. The original focus of the exercise was aimed at stopping any further expansion of problem gambling in Australia, alleviating the associated problems on both families in the wider community and consumer protection. These are all highly admirable qualities and ideals and I hope they are attainable. However, living in the real world, I was soon brought back to reality, firstly, by the feasibility. In 1998 a Productivity Commission report brought to light some interesting figures, mainly the fact that most Australians—that is, over 80 per cent—partake in some form of gambling, with 40 per cent of them gambling regularly. The problem factor in these figures amounts to 2.1 per cent, ranging across various levels of concern.
The most interesting factor arising from this report related to the particular concerns being raised in relation to the readily available access of poker machines across the length and breadth of this country. The commission concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to support the banning of any existing form of gambling and supported a better policy course of improving the range of strategies to alleviate the resulting gambling risks. Netbets 2000 approached the issue from a more regional state basis and recommended the development of uniform regulations be negotiated between the states. 
This exercise has been further developed with the compilation of the AUSMODEL draft, which recommends putting in place uniform and consistent standards focusing on player protection, operator probity and system integrity. This model puts in place very stringent controls on Australian Internet gambling companies, incorporating such measures as licensing controls, advertising, player registration, exclusion provisions and close monitoring of financial transactions. This model is setting world best practice standards in the Internet gambling industry, second to none in the rest of the world. As the present licensing of Internet gaming applicants rests with the provisions of the states, and each of the states presently has a very different perspective towards gambling, I maintain that the states should continue to implement their agendas without medalling by the federal government. 
The technological feasibility of the full implementation of this bill remains a concern. Any attempt to monitor or censor the Internet—and we are actually talking about the World Wide Web—would appear to be extremely difficult, if not impossible. I realise the proposed intention of this bill is to impose threats to any overseas Internet gambling provider should they step ashore in Australia, but it remains to be seen whether these people will be greatly deterred or hindered by this provision. NOIE concludes in its report that none of the methods would be 100 per cent effective. The claim that this bill is both illogical and counterproductive does bear some credence; hence the futility of the bill.
Present Australian Internet gaming businesses have, up to this point in time, invested millions of dollars within Australia and employ thousands of people—some of them highly skilled IT workers on very good salaries. The present Australian industry brings much needed export dollars into our coffers and hence generates the flow-on economic benefits. While I understand the argument that this industry is cheating the local stores and supermarkets of shopping dollars and jobs, I can see the equivalent diversionary argument that this industry—that is, the IT industry—also produces many dollars and generates many jobs, particularly in regions and less populous states, such as the Northern Territory and Tasmania. These states desperately need this investment and these jobs and, unfortunately, they will pay disproportionately to the other states.
Nowhere in the bill have I seen—nor have I heard in any discussions on the bill—any responsibility taken on the part of the government for the financial losses and hardships that are to be borne by present providers and their employees. I would think this government would owe a duty of care to those people so affected and should be required to pay compensation for these victims of the provisions in the bill. The uncertainty that this bill has generated has resulted in many of the large companies planning not to close down but to move offshore to places such as Quebec, the United Kingdom and New Zealand and countries that offer far less regulatory stringency. Australia will gain nothing from this bill, but will lose much. 
The censorship demands and costs are to be imposed on the ISPs. The inconsistency with this lies with the lack of the same censorship demands on the communications companies that provide the very same lines—not to mention the distinctions being assumed between those very same lines being used for direct phone betting as against Internet betting usage. In my private home, for example, my PC is connected to the same phone line, and it would be a choice between picking up the phone or clicking on the Internet. The bill makes no distinction between those lines. 
This bill sets about banning Internet gambling services to anyone physically present within Australia from providers both within and outside Australia. While I commend the general parochial intent of the bill to protect Australians from themselves, I find it highly unlikely that this would be achieved; hence I tend to err on the side of the lesser of the two evils. Should someone wish to avail themselves of Internet gambling facilities, I would much prefer to have them access a highly regulated and guaranteed payments site than an unregulated and highly risky overseas venue. 
I have repeatedly heard the counterargument that they will `only do it once'. This argument does not stand up to scrutiny when these overseas reputable sites emanate from the likes of the US. Companies such as the Nevada based casinos—which have seen the realities of the future and are hence on their way—and the United Kingdom's Ladbrokes and Sporting Bet Online.com are going to cash in on our citizens. These large conglomerates are highly successful businesses with equally successful reputations. This effectively results in the production of a new export industry for Australia—that is, our own Internet gambling business. I totally support the government's intention to exclude the wagering provisions in the bill covering horse racing and sports, as these industries, particularly horse racing, have a long, colourful and exciting history in this country. 
 (Senator Bartlett)—Order! It being 12.45 p.m., the debate on this matter is now adjourned.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-06-21,"—Let me commence my remarks in the second reading debate of the Governor-General Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 by indicating that the bill deals with the salary, taxation and superannuation arrangements for the Governor-General. The bill has four main purposes. They are: firstly, to set the official salary of the next Governor-General, Archbishop Peter Hollingworth; secondly, to remove the income tax exemptions which currently apply to vice-regal representatives; thirdly, to ensure that the superannuation surcharge on retirement allowance payable to governors-general will apply in the same way that it applies to the rest of the community; and fourthly, to provide the governors-general and their widowed spouses with the option to commute part of their retirement pension to meet any surcharge assessments received after retirement or death.
The bill sets the Governor-General's before tax salary at $310,000. This figure has been calculated according to the convention that has applied since 1974 and takes into account the removal of the tax exemption. The existing tax exemptions for the Governor-General date from the time when vice-regal representatives were invariably drawn from the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has paid income tax since 1993. The continuation of the tax exemption for the Governor-General is anachronistic. It is inappropriate. It is perhaps somewhat like having a foreign citizen as our head of state, which is anachronistic in the same way. 
The opposition considers the proposed measures in the bill to be fair and reasonable. We support the Governor-General Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. Nevertheless, let me complete this fine oration by saying that I look forward to the day when the Senate will consider the necessary remuneration for an Australian head of state.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I do not want to take up too much time of the Senate this afternoon speaking on the Governor-General Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. The opposition leader has already enunciated exactly what the bill is about, which is to bring the Governor-General's benefits, for want of a better word, in line with the rest of the community. As Senator Faulkner said, it is an anachronism that goes back to the 1920s when the Governor-General was regarded as a non-diplomatic foreign citizen, because most of them were. As Senator Faulkner said, most of them were retired British aristocrats. In fact, we had one prince. 
—One was a drunk. 
—I do not know whether he was a drunk, a libertine or whatever. What I wanted to talk about was the situation with our new incoming Governor-General. In doing so, I am sure that if I am out of order I will be called into order. I believe that the retiring Governor-General, Sir William Deane, probably felt that he was going to be our last Governor-General and may have requested that his appointment terminate in January 2001 on that basis. I find it ironic that an ordained Bishop of the established Church of England Dr Hollingworth is probably going to be our last Governor-General. That is the irony of all ironies.
I think we need to be well aware on our side of politics of Dr Hollingworth's statements and views over the years, because from those I can assume that he may take advantage of the role of Governor-General, as I am sure those people on the Right believed that Sir William Deane did. Over the years, the incoming Governor-General has been, as I said, outspoken on a number of issues that we on the Left of politics might be uncomfortable with. In fact, in an ABC interview in 1993, Dr Hollingworth was asked, in relation to the view of the then opposition, about industrial relations. Dr Hollingworth said:
Well, I think we've got to be open-minded about it and, again, avoid the whole business of slipping into rhetoric. It does seem to me that we've got a very cumbersome centralised system, which everybody agrees is now posing problems. And I think there's a general principle that most of us can accept, and that is the best way to negotiate satisfactory working conditions is at the grass roots level, at the shop front level.
We on the Left of politics would be very concerned about that sort of statement which strikes at what we believe are the fundamentals of industrial relations: a centralised system which gives more power to employees to bargain centrally and thus get more fairness and justice. Again, in that period, Mr Richard Palfreyman reported:
The Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, Archbishop Peter Hollingworth, has suggested that a form of non-military national service would provide opportunities for unemployed youth and, at the same time, tackle some underlying environmental and community problems.
Once again, we on this side might find that sort of compulsion repugnant. It certainly has been a view that has been expressed by our incoming Governor-General. I am also aware that the incoming Governor-General has applauded the Howard government's increased funding to private schools, which once again we might find difficult to stomach.
But on the bright side of things for the Governor-General, people on the left might be critical of him but certainly he has got a stringent critic in a very radical right-winger, Christopher Pearson. If you read Mr Pearson's piece in the FinancialReview of 30 April of this year, you will see that he is a scathing critic of our incoming Governor-General. He talks about his activities in relation to his candidature for Primate of the Church of England in Australia, his views about the resurrection and the fact that he is an avowed republican yet is now taking up the post of Governor-General. It is not a one-way street about what the incoming Governor-General may or may not stand for.
It probably is ironic that an ordained bishop in the established Church of England is going to be our last Governor-General. As you may be aware, probably the last time this sort of title was fiddled with was by Gough Whitlam in 1973, when we had a strange situation whereby the title of the Queen of Australia was Queen of the United Kingdom, et cetera, but one of her titles was `Defender of the Faith'. Irony of ironies, that was a title given to Henry VIII by the Pope at the time because of a treatise he had written criticising Martin Luther. As we all know, he decided he needed another wife and he established his own church.
We in the left of politics are going to have to expect and tolerate that Dr Hollingworth, our new Governor-General, may be outspoken on issues that he believes in and we, probably like the Right have had to, are going to have to accept that. I welcome his appointment, as the opposition has, and I believe that he will do an excellent job. I wish him luck and, as is appropriate, that he will be our last Governor-General.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-21,"—I want to take this opportunity to express the high regard I have for Sir William Deane. I also want express my thanks, primarily as a citizen of Australia and secondly as a senator, to Governor-General Deane for the great work he has done for Australia in that role. He has set a high standard for his successors, and I wish Bishop Hollingworth well as his successor.
This bill proposes to put the Governor-General on the same footing as other Australian citizens in relation to superannuation and income tax laws. Most notably, it removes the immunity from income taxation of governors-general and state governors. For centuries, the monarch of the United Kingdom had been immune from income taxation. While this immunity was withdrawn in the United Kingdom in 1993—eight years ago—the Queen's vice-regal representatives in Australia have continued to enjoy it. This bill rectifies that anomaly.
The Democrats support this bill but will be moving an amendment, which we will take on the voices. The amendment goes to the issue of superannuation and reflects a longstanding Democrat position. I refer to the Democrat amendment 2220, which has been circulated. The Democrats are moving similar amendments to every relevant piece of legislation concerning superannuation. In our view, it is essential that the legislation for superannuation is modernised in every bill that it affects.
Existing superannuation laws permit the inheritance of a spouse's superannuation interest by the surviving spouse. Spouse is a defined status. The simple rationale for this is that each of two individuals who are married with a mutual commitment to a shared life should be entitled to take the benefits of their partner's superannuation if that partner dies. We suggest the same should apply if they are not married. Interdependent people rely on superannuation benefits and other investments to sustain their standards of living on retirement. This reliance is made secure by the ability to inherit the investments and superannuation benefits of a deceased partner. The Democrats' problem with the current law is that it does not reflect the principle behind it. The law is limited in scope to spousal relationships, whereas the principle demands that all people who have a mutual commitment to a shared life be entitled to inherit superannuation interests in the same way that spouses presently do. People who are not married, whether of the opposite sex or the same sex, are treated differently in law from married people in similar relationships. On what possible basis can this discrimination be accepted?
There is an element of symbolism about this bill. There are only six governors and one Governor-General at any given time. Rather than alter the current taxation provisions by legislation, it would probably be easier to simply continue the exemption from income taxation and factor that into the salary payments. The change is prompted not by economic necessity—indeed, some of the premiers have complained that it is going to cost them a few bob—but by a desire to see our head of state and state governors treated in accordance with principles of equality and equity when it comes to their superannuation and taxation rights and liabilities. We applaud that principle. In this sense, it is an ideologically driven change—a change driven by principle. It is no longer appropriate for the incomes of vice-regal representatives to be tax free, so the government will amend that and has our support in doing so.
But the government should also recognise that a variety of relationships presenting a mutual commitment to a shared life exist in contemporary Australia. Our laws need to be modernised to reflect our society. These relationships should be recognised in law, for superannuation purposes. Just as it is now inappropriate for the representative of our head of state to be immune from income taxation, despite over a century of the practice, it is also inappropriate to unduly restrict the class of relationships the representative of our head of state can have while still enjoying joint superannuation benefits.
Consider, for example, what would happen if one of our governors or governors-general did not have a spouse. Very frequently these days, I hear those in interdependent relationships described as partners. Why should the partner or interdependent person in that relationship not be entitled to the same superannuation benefits a spouse would receive? While perhaps at present an unlikely scenario for the incoming Governor-General, we are legislating for the future. We are updating legislation which is archaic and, as I have said, there is an element of meaningful symbolism and principle about this bill.
This is a bill about structuring the Governor-General's taxation and superannuation liabilities in accordance with principles of equity and equality. It should not prohibit any future Governor-General—or even the incoming one—from sharing those superannuation rights and liabilities with an interdependent partner, as opposed to a spouse. On that basis, the arrangements established by this bill should reflect the diversity of families and relationships in modern Australia. Unamended, I suggest this bill will remain out of touch and archaic in content with regard to superannuation.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I rise to speak on the Governor-General Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. My colleague, Senator Faulkner, has explained the financial reasons for this bill. I want to associate myself with the remarks made by my colleague Senator Hutchins. He, I think quite rightly and appropriately, pointed out some concerns about the background of the new, incoming Governor-General.
I want to make a different point and talk about the appropriateness of appointing an ordained religious figure to be Governor-General of Australia for all Australians. I have drawn much of the material for my comments from a well-researched article written by Gerard Henderson and published in the Melbourne Age of 24 April 2001. I would point out that Mr Henderson is not a mad left-winger by any stretch of the imagination. I do not know which church he belongs to, if any, but I do know that at one stage in the 1980s he was a speechwriter for the present Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition. By no definition can he be seen as a card-carrying member of, nor fellow traveller or sympathiser with, the Labor Party. I will quote some of his article, because I think he sums up more articulately than I can some of the issues that have to be addressed. He says:
He is the first ordained cleric of any faith to become governor-general. And, it is to be hoped, the last.
He then quotes John Howard who said, when Bill Hayden, a republican at that time, was appointed Governor-General, that this would be:
“a bit like appointing an atheist as Archbishop of Canterbury”.
What I think is most telling is that he then points out that during the Constitutional Convention, of which Dr Hollingworth was a member, Dr Hollingworth: 
... raised the issue that he was “someone ... who swore an oath of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors”. The archbishop added that he “did so before [he] was consecrated bishop, before [he] was ordained a priest and on many other occasions ...” And he asked fellow delegates “whether or not those oaths continue to be legally binding”. His tentative conclusion was that this was “something that will have to be addressed”.
It has to be addressed now, because he is now the Governor-General, and he has said that the issue of the oath he swore to become a consecrated member of the Church of England is now the case in point.
Mr Howard defended his appointment of Dr Hollingworth by saying that Mr Deane, the present Governor-General, is a devout practising Catholic, the Governor-General before him, Mr Hayden, is a self-declared atheist and, of course, the Governor-General before him, Sir Zelman Cowan, is Jewish. As Mr Henderson points out, that misses the point. William Deane is not an ordained cleric and Sir Zelman Cowan is not a rabbi. Both are citizens of Australia, no more and no less, just like Bill Hayden and all other previous Australian governors-general. However, Dr Hollingworth is both ordained and consecrated. Moreover, as he himself has publicly acknowledged, the implications of this issue have yet to be addressed.
This point was made even by members of Dr Hollingworth's own church. At the time of the appointment, George Browning, the Anglican Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn, told ABC radio about his concern that this decision might blur the distinction between church and state. In Browning's words:
It is certainly not appropriate for the church to be inappropriately connected with the seat of power.
It matters not that Hollingworth happens to be a member of the Anglican communion, which has a connection with the Church of England headed by Queen Elizabeth II, although as archbishops and others have acknowledged some complications arise from the fact that those in Anglican orders swear certain oaths. It would also be inappropriate if a prominent and well-qualified member of the Catholic Church, such as George Pell, or of the Uniting Church, such as Dorothy McRae McMahon, or of the Baptist Church, such as Tim Costello, were appointed as the Queen's representative in Australia, or indeed if a rabbi, a mullah, a lama or whoever were.
I draw that to the Senate's attention because I think it raises the point that, although Dr Hollingworth is a distinguished citizen of Australia and has contributed to Australia being a civilised society, the issue of separation of state and church is fundamental to the operation of freedom of religion and democracy. If at times we err in blurring that distinction, it will be to the detriment of our democracy not to strengthen it. Mr Henderson finishes his article by saying:
The Most Reverend Peter Hollingworth deserves the best wishes of all Australians. It's just that the Prime Minister should not have made the offer. And the Archbishop should not have accepted it.
I agree with those remarks as a person who is a non-believer of any faith. I want a head of state who is not in any way ordained to any organised religion, a person that we can all know represents the community of Australia without taking an oath to support a particular form of religion.
I want to conclude my remarks, like Senator Murray, by paying a tribute to the outgoing Governor-General. It is a tragedy for me and many others that he is not the last Governor-General, to be succeeded by the first president of Australia and an Australian citizen. I have to say, in view of his performance as Governor-General, he would have been a fantastic first president of the Australian republic. I have had the opportunity as shadow minister for veterans' affairs to attend a number of functions where Bill Deane has spoken as Governor-General, and I have to say I know of no Governor-General that has made more compelling remarks, more moving remarks, than the present Governor-General.
First of all, though it was not a veterans function I was at, I want to draw attention to the remarks that he made at a place called Interlaken in Switzerland a year or so ago after a number of young Australians were killed in that tragic accident in the river in Switzerland. That was where Bill Deane and his wife went to the commemorative service and took with them wattle sprigs and gave them to each of the relatives to throw into the river as a commemoration on the death of their children. I just want to quote from the speech because it is much better than anything I could say. He said:
Yesterday, my wife and I, together with family members and friends of the Australian victims, visited the canyon where the accident occurred. There, in memory of each of the 14 young people who came from our homeland, we cast into the Saxetenbach 14 sprigs of wattle, our national floral emblem, which we had brought with us from Government House in Canberra. Somehow, we felt that was bringing a little of Australia to them.
He then concluded with a peroration that I find extremely moving:
It is still winter at home. But the golden wattles are coming into bloom. Just as these young men and women were in the flower of their youth. And when we are back in Australia we will remember how the flowers and the perfume and the pollen of their and our homeland were carried down the river where they died to Lake Brienz in this beautiful country on the far side of the world.
I cannot think of a more appropriate set of words for a ceremony such as that to remember a group of young Australians who died so tragically.
As far as veterans affairs is concerned and commemoration of veterans, I had, as it turned out to be, the honour to be present when the Governor-General, Sir William Deane, spoke twice at Gallipoli in 1999 on Anzac Day. First of all at the dawn service he made a speech, which I will not read in full but which I would draw to the attention of every senator, and also later he spoke at Lone Pine. He said in that speech first of all at Gallipoli as the sun came up at Anzac Cove:
And we express our thanks for the fact that this Peninsula, which the Turkish authorities on the initiative of President Demirel are developing as the Gallipoli Peace Park, is a sanctuary of peace and a constant reminder of the power of reconciliation.
He referred to the reconciliation that we have reached with the Turkish people. We all know he has used and spoken of the need for reconciliation in Australia between Australians and our original inhabitants in this country. He also went on in that speech to talk about the attempt to grow wattle at Anzac Cove. He said:
The wattles didn't survive. But his desire—
the padre, Mr Walter Dexter—
was fulfilled in any event. For not only `a bit', but an essential part, of Australia will always be here with the graves, the bodies, the memories and the spirits of the young Anzacs who were left behind. Here in this sacred site in the annals of our nation.
He used a phrase that has become important to indigenous people—that there are places in Australia for them that are sacred sites—and he saw Anzac Cove, as we all would agree as Australians, as the ultimate sacred site. He then concluded his remarks at Anzac Cove with the following:
Let us all, as we walk among these graves on this 84th Anzac Day, listening to the wind in the pine trees, looking across the scarlet-poppied slopes to the `heights of thyme and rosemary', remember the extent of our debt to our fellow countrymen who died here so many years ago. And, on this our national day of honour, let us recall not only those young Australians who gave their lives in our nation's service here at Gallipoli, so far away from their and our homeland, but also all who have died for our country on other battle fields of the First World War, in the Second World War, in Korea, in Vietnam and in other places. And let us all be conscious of the whisper of things `too deep for words' that can be heard here in this place by all who have true love of our people and our country in their hearts.
I have to say, amongst several thousand mainly young Australians, that was a moment which moved most of us to tears. At midday at Lone Pine on a beautiful sunny day he spoke again amongst the 2,000 Australians who were buried there in this very small place, where seven Victoria Crosses were won in a matter of a couple of days in the battle around Lone Pine. He concluded his words with:
No one can express all that this day means to us Australians and New Zealanders. It is, said Australia's great historian Manning Clark, `about something too deep for words.' But in the stillness of the early dawn, and in the silence that will settle once more along this shoreline, we feel it in the quiet of our hearts. The sense of great sadness. Of loss. Of gratitude. Of honour. Of national identity. Of our past. Of the spirit, the depth, the meaning, the very essence of our nations. And of the human values which those first Anzacs—and those who came after them—embodied and which we, their heirs, must cherish and pass to the future.
At the end of those remarks there was silence before the applause, because he so moved the crowd of about 8,000 people. At that moment we all reflected on what he said. Later, when he moved from the site to go to the next service, the several thousand young Australians all stood and applauded Sir William Deane all the way back to his car in appreciation that he had so tellingly and effectively expressed something that most of us hope that we would have the ability to express but do not have the eloquence of his words. Sir William Deane is a very great Australian. His words that Anzac Day, to me, were the equivalent of Pericles' address to the Athenians 2,500 years ago, or Lincoln's address at Gettysburg, dedicating the cemetery to those who fell in the Civil War, or Prime Minister Keating's address on the return of the Unknown Soldier in 1993 to our War Memorial. These remarks of Sir William Deane demonstrate that he is a truly great Australian and he will be always remembered by all of us as probably the best Governor-General this country ever had. I only wish he could be our first president.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-21,"—I rise to speak on the Governor-General Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. Unlike the three previous speakers, I would clearly express my support for the continuation of the role of Governor-General in this Commonwealth of Australia. I certainly expect to see many governors-general of equal calibre to that correctly perceived of Sir William Deane. There is a separation in the government of this country that we all normally recognise as being on three levels—that is, the legislative section, the executive government and the judiciary. Today I would like to speak briefly on the fourth level, which very clearly sets out the benefits between having a constitutional monarchy and a republic and the role of the Governor-General. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, at her coronation, swore an oath to uphold the rights of the citizens of Australia, and I stress the word `citizens'. She, as our monarch, swore to uphold my rights, your rights, Mr Acting Deputy President, the rights of everybody in this room and those of every Australian. The Governor-General, as her representative in Australia, is duty bound to carry out that activity and it is that activity that I wish to focus on today.
Our founding fathers, when they drafted our Constitution, did so in such a way that they did not replicate the British process; they did not replicate the American process. They created one that was uniquely Australian. We have benefited from that over the last 100 years. Sadly, to some degree the role of the Governor-General, I believe, has slipped from what it was originally intended to be, and that is, as I said in my opening remarks, to represent the people of Australia. The Governor-General, whoever he or she may be, both now and in the future, is the level of approach that the citizens of Australia—that is, the people of Australia—have when at some time they are aggrieved by a decision of the government. It is with great reverence that I call upon Bishop Hollingworth to take up this role. It is not an additional role; it is part of his duties to be accessible to the people of Australia and not to be constrained or to take directions totally from the executive government. All approaches that I have made to the existing Governor-General, Sir William Deane, have been responded to by reflecting that he only takes his direction from the executive government. I believe that is contrary to the original intent of our founding fathers and I look to the day when we have a continuation of governors-general in Australia and a return to the process where they clearly are there to listen to and to take into account that the citizens of Australia may be aggrieved by their government, whatever government that may be.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2001-06-21,"—I would like to thank senators for their contributions and their generous remarks in terms of the retiring Governor-General, Bill Deane, who, suffice to say, for me, is a good Joeys boy and the person that I mentioned in my maiden speech, when I first rose in this place, in regard to his commitment, the generosity of his spirit and his life that far. 
In summary, the Governor-General Legislation Amendment Bill will do three things. The bill will set a salary of $310,000 per annum for the office of Governor-General during the term of the Right Reverend Doctor Peter Hollingworth. The bill will also update income tax arrangements for the Office of Governor-General and for state governors appointed after 29 June 2001 by removing outdated income tax exemptions. Lastly, the bill will ensure that superannuation surcharge provisions for the Office of Governor-General are in line with community standards.
In proposing a taxable salary of $310,000 per annum, the government has maintained a convention followed by successive governments since 1974. In line with convention Archbishop Hollingworth's official salary is expected to be moderately above the average salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court over his notional five-year term. At present, the Governor-General and the state governors are exempted from paying income tax on their official salaries and income from outside Australia. This exemption is a legacy of an earlier era in Australian history. The amendments will update the Income Tax Assessment Act by removing the exemptions, thereby bringing the tax arrangements for vice-regal representatives into line with the rest of the community. The bill will also bring the Governor-General's superannuation surcharge provision in line with community standards. The main effect of the superannuation amendments will be to cap liability at the 15 per cent maximum surcharge rate and to deal with circumstances in which a notional surcharge assessment is issued after the Governor-General leaves office.
Honourable senators will have noted that the government is interested in vice-regal entitlements which reflect and are consistent with community standards. The amendments proposed by the Democrats go beyond what is generally available in the community. It may be the Democrats' view that the provisions available to the wider community should be changed. However, a debate about the Governor-General Act is not the appropriate context in which to initiate such changes, particularly when the current superannuation provisions of the act adequately accommodate the needs of the person who is expected to occupy the office of Governor-General for the next five years. For these reasons, the government will not be supporting the Democrats amendments, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-06-21,"—This is not as lofty a matter as the previous debate on the appointment of the new Governor-General. The Dried Vine Fruits (Rate of Primary Industry (Customs) Charge) Validation Bill 2001 and the Dried Vine Fruits (Rate of Primary Industry (Excise) Levy) Validation Bill 2001 deal with the regulations regarding the dried vine fruit industry. Whilst listening to the previous debate I was thinking about the separation of church and state some 2,000 or more years ago when a certain noted religious figure was very familiar with the dried vine fruit industry. Anyway, these bills will retrospectively validate regulations made on 29 August last year to reduce the rate of the levy and export charge on dried vine fruits from $10 to $7 per tonne as of 1 January 2000. 
The bills are necessary because of a technical difficulty that has arisen. Apparently, according to advice from the Attorney-General's Department, there is some possibility that the regulation may be invalid due to the operation of subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. We are happy to support the legislation on the basis that it corrects an anomaly. We are advised that it is not envisaged that anyone in the industry who pays the levy has actually suffered any adverse impact as a result of the implementation of the regulation as it was gazetted previously. This legislation will nevertheless ensure that any adverse impact that might occur will still be covered. So we support the legislation. In view of the time, I will not make any further comments, but I do invite honourable senators, and indeed the public, to read the excellent speech of the shadow minister, Mr O'Connor, delivered in the House on 24 May 2001.

This program was started by my predecessor, Senator Newman, and is continuing with significant funding. 
I might also touch on the question of indigenous family violence, which this government is playing a significant role in attempting to reduce. I might raise the Walking into Doors program as just one example of that. It has been extremely successful and I believe, senator, that your Territory has had some benefit from that. That program was organised with advice from the indigenous community. The key players, Archie Roach and Ruby Hunter, are indigenous themselves and they are visiting a number of towns, holding forums and arguing the case for domestic violence to be brought out into the open and to be discussed. The theme of it is walking into doors. I do not know whether you have heard that song—it is a very good one—basically arguing the case that she is sick of walking into doors.
The situation in relation to WESNET is this: the government is not defunding WESNET. Any funding received by WESNET which finishes on 30 June is doing just that—it is simply finishing. Their funding has never been recurrent funding, nor has it been cut. Funding through the department has been based on WESNET being contracted as a consultant to perform a range of activities with the government's Partnerships Against Domestic Violence initiative. These activities were intended from the outset to run between 1998 and June 2001. WESNET knew when it accepted that funding that it was what I describe as program funding, not recurrent funding.
WESNET's status relating to peak organisations stems from its membership of the Australian Federation of Homelessness Organisations, AFHO. AFHO is currently funded by FACS under the National Secretariat Program. So, of course, WESNET, as a subsidiary of AFHO, is not also going to be funded as the key peak organisation, because AFHO is that organisation and WESNET is a member of AFHO. 
WESNET is not the only organisation that contributes to government policy on domestic violence. There are a range of organisations, including the National Association of Services Against Sexual Violence and the No to Violence organisation. Others include Women with Disabilities Australia, the Older Women's Network and, frankly, a wide variety of individuals from organisations with expertise, as well as academics, business people, researchers and service providers. 
So the bottom line, Senator Crossin, is that WESNET were funded for particular tasks and those tasks have nearly come to an end. As is often the case, those people would like to be funded permanently. There is no lobby group in the world that would not like permanent funding from the government. But they are not the only people involved in this area. Prior to this matter becoming public, my office and the Office of the Status of Women have been in negotiations with WESNET to see what future tasks we could give them. As I see it, that is the basis on which, if they get any further funding, they will be funded—that is, for particular tasks. They are not a peak body. AFHO is the peak body in that area.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-06-21,"—Senator, sadly for you, it is very clear to people involved in this area—by your question—that you have no real interest and involvement in it, otherwise you would understand the wide range of partnerships in which the government has been involved and has funded. But if your proposition is that, if the government goes into partnership with people for a limited time to do a particular task, it should then be tagged forever and a day to fund that group to do whatsoever it chooses, you are mistaken. This government has committed a total of $50 million to Partnerships Against Domestic Violence, which the previous government, of which you were not a part, did not do. Labor left the area inadequately developed. Furthermore, the national Indigenous Family Violence Grants Program, announced in 1999, had a budget of $6 million over four years to deal with this problem. Under that area, there are 30 successful projects being run. WESNET may not be a part of any of them, but there are plenty of projects going on. WESNET is not the only provider in the world.

—Order! Minister, would you address the chair and ignore Senator Alston and Senator Faulkner, please.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I must say that I did not find Senator Alston at all disturbing.
Yesterday Senator Forshaw asked me a question about some budget estimates and I have an answer for him. I seek leave to have the answer incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator FORSHAW—My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care. Can the minister confirm that it is now three weeks since she admitted on Sunday Sunrise that she did not know whether the $22.5 million required to fund the extension of pharmaceutical benefits had been included in the Department of Health and Aged Care budget? What steps has the minister or the Minister for Health and Aged Care taken to ensure that these funds have actually been appropriated to the Department of Health and Aged Care and are included in the forward estimates? Can the minister give a guarantee that, if the government has overlooked this allocation, it will stand by its promise to extend pharmaceutical benefits to seniors?
Senator FORSHAW—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question of the minister, whose luck and time is running out. Minister, I draw your attention to page 97 of the budget papers for the Department of Health, which states:
... a provision has been made for these expenses in the Contingency reserve...
Can the minister confirm that a provision in the Treasury contingency reserve is not an appropriation and applies for one year only? Further, does this not mean that the seniors promise is funded for one year only and that there is no guarantee for future years?
Senator VANSTONE—The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
I can confirm that an estimate of the impact of the extension of the Seniors' Health Card on the Department of Health and Aged Care's estimates has been included in the Contingency Reserve.
While provision in the Contingency Reserve does not constitute appropriation, the expected impact will predominantly be on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is a special appropriation. The funding for extension of eligibility for the Seniors' Health Card is therefore guaranteed.
The impact will be included in the Department of Health and Aged Care's estimates in the Additional Estimates context.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Pharmaceutical Benefits: Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,speech

The response read as follows—
Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee
Inquiry into Australian Public Service Employment Matters
First Report - Australian Workplace Agreements
Government Response
Recommendation 1 - The Government, as the ultimate employer, should direct agency heads that:
·	AWAs with SES and APS employees are not to be kept confidential; and
·	APS agencies are to make AWAs available on request, allowing appropriate deletion of personal information but retaining remuneration details in the published document.
Recommendation 2 - The committee recommends that all agency heads authorise the Office of the Employment Advocate, under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, to release copies of their AWAs to DEWRSB and the PSMPC.
Response:  Disagree.
Under section 170VG(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (the WR Act) Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) must not prohibit or restrict the disclosure of details of the AWA by either party to another person.  Implicit in this requirement is that disclosure is a matter for the parties to an AWA.  A Government direction that mandates disclosure of Australian Public Service (APS) AWAs would therefore be contrary to the clear statutory intent of the Parliament that any disclosure is a matter for the parties themselves.
Unilateral disclosure by the employer of the details of an AWA, even where personal information is deleted is likely to result in employee concerns about confidentiality and privacy.
It would be open under the WR Act for APS agencies and employees to mutually agree to disclose information regarding their AWA.  However, the Government believes that disclosure of the details of the remuneration of individual public servants should not be made public although the framework within which remuneration is paid needs to be public, as it is in the case of the APS (see response to Recommendations 3 and 6 below).  Consistent with the then Government's response to the Committee's 1993 Report on performance pay, the Government believes that “the remuneration ranges of public servants in the APS be public knowledge but that the precise remuneration (involving any performance elements) paid to individuals, and the reasons for this, should remain confidential.”
With regard to Recommendation 2, s.83BS of the WR Act precludes the Employment Advocate from disclosing protected information which may identify a person as being, or having been, a party to an AWA unless disclosure is authorised in writing by that person.  As indicated above, the decision to disclose information regarding an AWA rests with the parties to the AWA.  
Recommendation 3 - The committee recommends that:
·	DEWRSB undertake a more rigorous program of information gathering in relation to APS AWAs;
·	service-wide reporting on agreement-making and remuneration be conducted annually and on a financial year basis by DEWRSB, with compulsory participation by all agencies covered by the Public Service Act; and
·	DEWRSB's service-wide reports be tabled in Parliament on the same cycle as the Public Service Commissioner's reports on the state of the APS.
Response:  Disagree.
The Government believes that existing arrangements meet the thrust of this recommendation.  
For instance in respect of remuneration issues, the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) currently coordinates and/or undertakes surveys of remuneration arrangements in APS agencies.  The outcomes of these surveys are published on the DEWRSB internet home page, and are used by DEWRSB in analysing broader APS developments. 
Specifically, the 1999 and 2000 non-SES pay surveys covered all APS agencies, while the 1999 and 2000 SES Remuneration Surveys respectively covered 97% and up to 99% of APS SES staff.  Against that background, the Government sees no reason for participation in these remuneration surveys to be made compulsory.
However, to further enhance the quality of information available regarding non-SES remuneration, DEWRSB intends revising the non-SES pay survey so that in future it will provide data regarding non-SES similar to that available in respect of SES remuneration.  This survey will encompass staff working under a collective or an individual agreement.
This data regarding remuneration is complemented by:
·	the Review of Agreement Making in the Australian Public Service undertaken by DEWRSB in 1999, with a further review to be conducted later this year;
·	the information contained in the Public Service Commissioner's State of the Service Report on service-wide agreement making and remuneration; and
·	the Auditor-General's recent report on Certified Agreements in the Australian Public Service.
In addition, the Requirements for Departmental Annual Reports - May 2000 state that annual reports must include an assessment of a department's effectiveness in managing and developing its staff to achieve its objectives.  This may include consideration of features of certified agreements and AWAs, and their impact.
In these circumstances, the Government sees no reason to significantly modify the existing approach to information gathering and reporting in relation to APS agreement making. 
Recommendation 4 - The committee recommends that the Public Service Commissioner considers AWAs as a distinct category when exercising her statutory functions, in particular, to develop, promote, review and evaluate APS employment policies and practices and in her evaluation of the extent to which agencies incorporate and uphold the APS Values.
Response: Disagree, as the proposed action is unnecessary.
Under the Public Service Act 1999, agency heads are required to promote and uphold the Values and act in accordance with the Code of Conduct.  Through the State of the Service reporting process, the Public Service Commissioner addresses issues relating to the Values and the Code of Conduct, including progress made by agencies in their organisational and management approaches.  This includes the role of, and developments in, agreement making.  In this particular area, the Commissioner's judgement may be informed by agency responses to particular questions, including questions that may be directed to staff on the request of the Commissioner through staff surveys.  DEWRSB reports regularly on SES remuneration arrangements which provides further information to inform judgements in this area.
In relation to agreement making generally, information available from certified agreements is supplemented by reports such as the DEWRSB remuneration and agreement making surveys and the ANAO's Performance Audit of Certified Agreements in the APS.  Together this provides a broad base of information for the Public Service Commissioner's consideration of agreement-making.
In her consideration of the state of the APS from a Values perspective, the Commissioner must necessarily address a broad range of organisational, management and cultural approaches which, in aggregate, reflect on the promotion and application of the Values across the APS and within agencies.
Recommendation 5 - The committee recommends that the OEA should make the full range of AWAs available to researchers, retaining the current confidentiality protections.
Response:   Agree.
The Employment Advocate already allows access to AWAs in a number of different ways.  General research into AWAs has always been via the “first AWA” sampling method.  However, if a researcher requests more specific information requiring a different method of selecting AWAs, the OEA has always provided other samples which are more appropriate to the purpose of the research.  If a researcher wishes access to particular information, they simply need to ask.  Such requests would, however, need to be considered on a case by case basis, taking into account matters such as practicality and cost.
Recommendation 6 - The committee recommends that the annual and financial reporting requirements for the Australian Public Service be at least as rigorous as those applying to the private sector.
Response:  Agree with qualification.
The Government believes that the overall reporting requirements for the APS, which derive from a wide range of sources, including the requirements for financial statements, are at least as rigorous as those applying to the private sector.  It agrees that this situation should be maintained as private and public sector reporting requirements continue to evolve.  
The Committee's recommendation was made in the context of discussion of section 300A of the Corporations Law, which requires one type of private sector entity - listed companies - to disclose in their directors' reports the nature and amount of each element of the emolument of each director and each of the five named officers of the company receiving the highest emolument.  While this particular disclosure requirement does not apply to APS executives, the conditions that led to its introduction for listed companies do not exist in the APS.
Further, extensive disclosure requirements of other types, some not applicable to the private sector, make the overall requirements on APS departments and agencies to disclose remuneration more rigorous than those applying in the private sector.  For instance, in addition to the continuing and one-off, whole-of-government reports listed in the response to recommendation 3, information on APS remuneration systems is accessible by request under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) and in response to parliamentary questions and the inquiries of parliamentary committees, including Senate estimates committees.  The FOI Act and parliamentary scrutiny elements exceed the level of disclosure normally required of any entity in the private sector.
Full details of the remuneration framework applicable to departmental Secretaries and APS agency heads are publicly available in the various determinations which set these conditions.  The only element of the remuneration packages of Secretaries and agency heads not required to be disclosed or accessible on inquiry is the amount of performance bonus, if any, paid in a particular year.  Even there, the framework of the performance bonus system is public, for example, that performance bonuses to departmental Secretaries are payable at the rates of 10 per cent or 15 per cent.  
The objective of the section 300A approach of complete disclosure of the actual remuneration of the five highest paid officers involved in management is to ensure that shareholders are aware of and can respond to decisions by those officers that may influence the level of their remuneration.  This objective would not be advanced by providing for full disclosure of top executive remuneration in the APS because the remuneration framework of departmental Secretaries and agency heads has always been public and their remuneration is determined outside the departments and agencies they head. 
Requiring disclosure of full details of remuneration, while adding little to the transparency of decision making, would also have privacy implications.  As noted in the response to recommendations 1 and 2, successive governments have considered publication of information on actual bonuses paid to be inconsistent with the operation of an appraisal-based performance pay system. 
The reporting of directors' and executives' remuneration, including in Australian public sector entities, is currently under consideration by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) which is expected to issue an exposure draft of a new accounting standard on this issue later in 2001.  For the reasons outlined above, the Government is opposed to extending the section 300A approach to the APS and will be putting that view to the AASB.
The Government acknowledges in this context that, although the APS is subject to very rigorous disclosure requirements, information is disclosed in a variety of forms and in a way which may make comparisons difficult on occasion.  In considering its response to the AASB exposure draft, the Government will also consider possible revisions to the annual reporting guidelines to improve accessibility to the information required to be disclosed.
Recommendation 7 - The committee recommends that the reporting of remuneration above a threshold of $100,000 should not be limited to SES managers.  In addition to reporting on SES managers as a group, the same details should be provided in the financial statements for other staff whose remuneration exceeds $100,000.
Response:  Disagree.
The Finance Minister's Orders (FMOs) set out the reporting requirements that apply to Commonwealth agencies and authorities regarding Director/Manager remuneration.
The current FMO requirements regarding Director/Manager remuneration reflect the private sector reporting arrangements as set out in Accounting Standard AASB 1034 regarding Financial Report Presentation and Disclosures (which deals with Executives) and AASB 1017 regarding Related Party Disclosures (which focuses on Directors).
Specifically, AASB 1034 requires “disclosing entities” to report on remuneration above $100,000 for “executive officers” of the entity.  In defining an executive officer, AASB 1034 calls up the definition used in the Corporations Law, ie. a person “who is concerned in, or takes part in, the management of the body (regardless of the person's designation and whether or not the person is a director of the body)”.  In the private sector, executive officers are considered to be those members of the senior management team involved in the strategic and operational management of the business.  In the public sector, managers (the terminology used in the FMOs) are defined more broadly as “executives of an agency, ie. SES or their equivalents”.  
Against that background, the Government sees no current need to widen the FMO reporting requirement to include other staff whose remuneration exceeds $100,000 per annum.  As mentioned in the response to Recommendation 6, the AASB is expected to issue later this year an exposure draft of a new accounting standard on the reporting of directors' and executives' remuneration.  Following the release of the draft accounting standard, the Government will consider the implications of the draft standard, if any, for the FMO requirements on reporting remuneration above $100,000. 
Further, the Government considers that the information provided by reporting on this issue could be further improved if separation and redundancy payments were to be shown separately.  This will avoid distortion of the data in circumstances where a long serving senior executive is made redundant.  The Government will amend the FMOs to require agencies to report on this basis and include information regarding the aggregate level of redundancy payments to “managers” as defined in the FMOs in the notes to financial statements. This new requirement will commence with the 2001-2002 reporting period.
Recommendation 8 - The committee recommends that individual performance bonus payments be discontinued in the Australian Public Service.
Recommendation 9 - The committee recommends that if performance bonuses continue to be paid, they must be for outstanding individual or team service, not for achieving the minimum expected of all APS employees, that is, competent performance.
Recommendation 11 - The committee recommends that if performance bonuses continue to be paid, these should be capped.  Uncapped bonuses should not be allowed.
Response:  Disagree.
The Government's APS reform agenda is aimed at promoting a high performance APS capable of operating in an increasingly competitive environment that emphasises contestability, value for money and a focus on client service.
To achieve these objectives, APS agencies not only need to be able to attract and retain suitably qualified staff, but also need to be able to appropriately reward employees, particularly high performing staff and those who deliver results in exceptionally difficult circumstances.  Performance related payments are one means through which agencies are endeavouring to attract, retain and reward high performing staff.  Any decision to remove scope for individual performance bonuses may therefore result in the APS being unable to retain some highly skilled staff.
With almost all APS agencies now covered by agreements, it is clear that agencies are taking advantage of the flexibilities available to them to tailor their terms and conditions of employment to their particular needs and those of their employees.  The diversity of arrangements adopted in agencies in respect of performance-linked remuneration systems, which include different performance rating systems and payment levels and in some instances team based rewards, provide evidence of the success of the Government's policy stance.  
It would be inconsistent with the Government's policy of devolving responsibility for workplace relations issues to APS agencies for a prescriptive, “one size fits all” approach to be imposed in respect of performance related payments.
Further, the Government's APS remuneration policy provides that improvements in pay and conditions be linked to productivity gains and are to be funded from within agency appropriations.  In this context, there is no cap on the quantum of pay increases that may be agreed at the agency level.  A cap on performance bonuses would therefore be inconsistent with this policy setting.
Recommendation 10 - If performance bonuses continue to be paid, the committee also recommends that there should be complete disclosure of all payments in annual reports, including the following:
·	the number of APS employees at each classification level who received one-off bonus payments;
·	the aggregate amount of such bonus payments at each classification level;
·	the average bonus payment and the range of such payments at each classification level; and
·	the aggregate bonus payment for the agency as a whole.
If such a disclosure were, in the case of a small agency, or a small number of SES officers, to identify payments to individuals, the committee would be prepared to accept the information grouped by SES and non-SES officers.
Response:  Agree.
The Requirements for Departmental Annual Reports will be amended, subject to the approval of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, so that annual reports for 2000-2001 will incorporate information regarding performance related payments but in a form that protects the privacy of individuals.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2001-06-21,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In the government's response, in the main the government has disagreed with the series of recommendations made by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. It has, for example, disagreed with recommendation 1, which was:
The Government, as the ultimate employer, should direct agency heads that:
AWAs with SES and APS employees are not to be kept confidential; and
APS agencies are to make AWAs available on request, allowing appropriate deletion of personal information but retaining remuneration details in a published document. 
The government's response claims that a government direction of this nature would be inconsistent with the statutory intent of the parliament, presumably in passing the Workplace Relations Act. It ignores the finding in the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee report that the Commonwealth is one of the parties to APS AWAs. In the Workplace Relations Act 1996, section 170WK deals with AWAs with Commonwealth employees. It says that `a secretary acts on behalf of the Commonwealth'. 
Therefore, there is nothing inappropriate or inconsistent with the statutory intent of the parliament in the recommendation. If it chose to do so, the government, as the ultimate employer, could issue a direction to agency heads that APS AWAs are not to be kept confidential. In fact, the government has already done so in relation to agreement making, when it issued its parameters setting out that agreements have to be consistent with the government's workplace relations policy, remuneration policy and industry development policy and be funded within agency appropriations. The response goes on to state: 
... disclosure ... even where personal information is deleted is likely to result in employee concerns about confidentiality and privacy. 
The committee sees such privacy concerns are only an issue if staff are led to believe that they are entitled to this level of privacy, and the introduction of AWAs into the private sector has mistakenly implied this. Public servants, parliamentarians and other public officials are paid by the taxpayer and are accountable to the public for the expenditure of this money and for what is bought with that money and what is not available because those funds are not available for other purposes. This is where the public interest in payments made to public servants derives. The secrecy of AWAs is inconsistent with the level of transparency applying to all forms of agreement making in the APS. It also fails to follow the requirements for tabling or gazettal of Remuneration Tribunal determinations and the Prime Minister's determinations for secretaries.
The government has also disagreed with recommendation 2. The contents of that recommendation are: 
The committee recommends that all agency heads authorise the OEA, under the provisions of the WR Act, to release copies of their AWAs to DEWRSB and the PSMPC.
The response states:
... the WR Act precludes the EA from disclosing protected information which may identify a person as being, or having been, a party to an AWA unless disclosure is authorised in writing by that person.
This position does not take into account the committee's view that the Commonwealth is a party to the AWA and that the secretary is acting on its behalf. Therefore, it is open to the government to authorise the Employment Advocate to release copies of AWAs to DEWSRB and the PSMPC, without further delay. The committee feels it is unacceptable that information held by the OEA is not available to other arms of the APS, particularly DEWSRB and the PSMPC, to enable the department to provide a more rigorous information program about devolved agreement making in the APS and to improve the quality of reporting on remuneration. It would also enhance the Public Service Commissioner's ability to perform her statutory reporting role and open the way for monitoring AWAs as a distinct management tool.
Recommendation 3, which again is disagreed with, states:
DEWSRB undertake a more rigorous program of information gathering in relation to APS AWAs; service-wide reporting on agreement-making and remuneration be conducted annually and on a financial year basis by DEWSRB, with compulsory participation by all agencies covered by the Public Service Act; and DEWRSB service-wide reports be tabled in parliament of the same cycle as the Public Service Commissioner's reports on the state of the APS.
The response states that the department:
... currently coordinates and/or undertakes surveys of remuneration arrangements in APS. 
It is noted, however, that the initiative to undertake these surveys comes from various sources and that a strategic approach for comprehensive service-wide information is needed. The committee reported that the non-SES survey completed by DEWRSB did not include AWA information for every agency. Voluntary surveys and random inclusions are not an acceptable basis for gathering and reporting on remuneration in the public sector. I draw the attention of the Senate to paragraph 6.10 of the report.
The committee welcomes the revision of this non-SES pay survey so that in future it will provide data similar to that available in respect of SES remuneration and to include both certified agreements and AWAs. It also urges the publication of the survey results in a timely manner. Even though the response noted high levels of participation, the committee sees no reason why participation should not be made compulsory, enhancing the quality of information available. The response states that, in addition to the surveys, the agencies' annual reports:
... may include consideration of features of certified agreements and AWAs, and their impact.
However, the inclusion of this information is non-mandatory and highly aggregated.
Recommendation 4, which again was disagreed with, states:
The committee recommends that the PS Commissioner considers AWAs as a distinct category when exercising her statutory functions, in particular, to develop, promote, review and evaluate APS employment policies and practices and in her evaluation of the extent to which agencies incorporate and uphold the APS values.
The main purpose of this recommendation was the committee's concern that there is no means of measuring or monitoring the impact of public sector AWAs on EEO target groups. For example, as AWAs are used throughout all levels now, can we be confident that the pay increases for those who must negotiate individually for an AWA are being treated fairly and receive fair and equitable pay outcomes? The Public Service Commissioner's responsibilities include evaluating the extent to which agencies incorporate and uphold the APS values and to develop, promote, review and evaluate APS employment policies and practices. Information about the negotiation and use of AWAs would be an important element in the scrutiny of these processes, yet the commissioner has no direct access to AWAs and no specific information on AWAs in the state of the APS report to the parliament. I draw the Senate's attention to paragraph 4.48 in the committee's report.
Recommendation 5 states:
The committee recommends that the OEA should make the full range of AWAs available to researchers, retaining the current confidentiality protections.
The government has agreed with this recommendation. Even though the government agrees with the thrust of the recommendation, it has not specifically addressed concerns of the committee—in particular, the evidence to the committee pointed to difficulties in gaining representative samples through the first AWA sampling method. Even though the response notes that particular information required by a researcher needs to be requested and would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, taking into account matters such as practicality and cost, evidence from a researcher found that access was `far from ideal and does not allow full pictures of AWAs to be drawn by anyone'. 
In respect of recommendation 6 there is agreement by the government, with qualification. The recommendation states:
The committee recommends that the annual and financial reporting requirements for the Australian Public Service be at least as rigorous as those applying to the private sector.
There is no specific requirement in relation to reporting the remuneration of staff on AWAs. The annual reporting requirements only suggest that agencies include in their annual reports an explanation of how the nature and amount of remuneration for SES is determined. Reporting on non-monetary rewards, performance pay and any other remuneration outside requirements for the financial statements is left to agencies to determine.
The response notes a number of other options available to parliament, besides the annual and financial reports, which make the overall disclosure requirements on APS departments and agencies to disclose remuneration more rigorous than those applying in the private sector—for example, FOI requests, parliamentary questions, and inquiries of parliamentary committees, including Senate estimates. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

·	the Review of Agreement Making in the Australian Public Service undertaken by DEWRSB in 1999, with a further review to be conducted later this year;
·	the information contained in the Public Service Commissioner's State of the Service Report on service-wide agreement making and remuneration; and
·	the Auditor-General's recent report on Certified Agreements in the Australian Public Service.
In addition, the Requirements for Departmental Annual Reports - May 2000 state that annual reports must include an assessment of a department's effectiveness in managing and developing its staff to achieve its objectives.  This may include consideration of features of certified agreements and AWAs, and their impact.
In these circumstances, the Government sees no reason to significantly modify the existing approach to information gathering and reporting in relation to APS agreement making. 
Recommendation 4 - The committee recommends that the Public Service Commissioner considers AWAs as a distinct category when exercising her statutory functions, in particular, to develop, promote, review and evaluate APS employment policies and practices and in her evaluation of the extent to which agencies incorporate and uphold the APS Values.
Response: Disagree, as the proposed action is unnecessary.
Under the Public Service Act 1999, agency heads are required to promote and uphold the Values and act in accordance with the Code of Conduct.  Through the State of the Service reporting process, the Public Service Commissioner addresses issues relating to the Values and the Code of Conduct, including progress made by agencies in their organisational and management approaches.  This includes the role of, and developments in, agreement making.  In this particular area, the Commissioner's judgement may be informed by agency responses to particular questions, including questions that may be directed to staff on the request of the Commissioner through staff surveys.  DEWRSB reports regularly on SES remuneration arrangements which provides further information to inform judgements in this area.
In relation to agreement making generally, information available from certified agreements is supplemented by reports such as the DEWRSB remuneration and agreement making surveys and the ANAO's Performance Audit of Certified Agreements in the APS.  Together this provides a broad base of information for the Public Service Commissioner's consideration of agreement-making.
In her consideration of the state of the APS from a Values perspective, the Commissioner must necessarily address a broad range of organisational, management and cultural approaches which, in aggregate, reflect on the promotion and application of the Values across the APS and within agencies.
Recommendation 5 - The committee recommends that the OEA should make the full range of AWAs available to researchers, retaining the current confidentiality protections.
Response:   Agree.
The Employment Advocate already allows access to AWAs in a number of different ways.  General research into AWAs has always been via the “first AWA” sampling method.  However, if a researcher requests more specific information requiring a different method of selecting AWAs, the OEA has always provided other samples which are more appropriate to the purpose of the research.  If a researcher wishes access to particular information, they simply need to ask.  Such requests would, however, need to be considered on a case by case basis, taking into account matters such as practicality and cost.
Recommendation 6 - The committee recommends that the annual and financial reporting requirements for the Australian Public Service be at least as rigorous as those applying to the private sector.
Response:  Agree with qualification.
The Government believes that the overall reporting requirements for the APS, which derive from a wide range of sources, including the requirements for financial statements, are at least as rigorous as those applying to the private sector.  It agrees that this situation should be maintained as private and public sector reporting requirements continue to evolve.  
The Committee's recommendation was made in the context of discussion of section 300A of the Corporations Law, which requires one type of private sector entity - listed companies - to disclose in their directors' reports the nature and amount of each element of the emolument of each director and each of the five named officers of the company receiving the highest emolument.  While this particular disclosure requirement does not apply to APS executives, the conditions that led to its introduction for listed companies do not exist in the APS.
Further, extensive disclosure requirements of other types, some not applicable to the private sector, make the overall requirements on APS departments and agencies to disclose remuneration more rigorous than those applying in the private sector.  For instance, in addition to the continuing and one-off, whole-of-government reports listed in the response to recommendation 3, information on APS remuneration systems is accessible by request under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) and in response to parliamentary questions and the inquiries of parliamentary committees, including Senate estimates committees.  The FOI Act and parliamentary scrutiny elements exceed the level of disclosure normally required of any entity in the private sector.
Full details of the remuneration framework applicable to departmental Secretaries and APS agency heads are publicly available in the various determinations which set these conditions.  The only element of the remuneration packages of Secretaries and agency heads not required to be disclosed or accessible on inquiry is the amount of performance bonus, if any, paid in a particular year.  Even there, the framework of the performance bonus system is public, for example, that performance bonuses to departmental Secretaries are payable at the rates of 10 per cent or 15 per cent.  
The objective of the section 300A approach of complete disclosure of the actual remuneration of the five highest paid officers involved in management is to ensure that shareholders are aware of and can respond to decisions by those officers that may influence the level of their remuneration.  This objective would not be advanced by providing for full disclosure of top executive remuneration in the APS because the remuneration framework of departmental Secretaries and agency heads has always been public and their remuneration is determined outside the departments and agencies they head. 
Requiring disclosure of full details of remuneration, while adding little to the transparency of decision making, would also have privacy implications.  As noted in the response to recommendations 1 and 2, successive governments have considered publication of information on actual bonuses paid to be inconsistent with the operation of an appraisal-based performance pay system. 
The reporting of directors' and executives' remuneration, including in Australian public sector entities, is currently under consideration by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) which is expected to issue an exposure draft of a new accounting standard on this issue later in 2001.  For the reasons outlined above, the Government is opposed to extending the section 300A approach to the APS and will be putting that view to the AASB.
The Government acknowledges in this context that, although the APS is subject to very rigorous disclosure requirements, information is disclosed in a variety of forms and in a way which may make comparisons difficult on occasion.  In considering its response to the AASB exposure draft, the Government will also consider possible revisions to the annual reporting guidelines to improve accessibility to the information required to be disclosed.
Recommendation 7 - The committee recommends that the reporting of remuneration above a threshold of $100,000 should not be limited to SES managers.  In addition to reporting on SES managers as a group, the same details should be provided in the financial statements for other staff whose remuneration exceeds $100,000.
Response:  Disagree.
The Finance Minister's Orders (FMOs) set out the reporting requirements that apply to Commonwealth agencies and authorities regarding Director/Manager remuneration.
The current FMO requirements regarding Director/Manager remuneration reflect the private sector reporting arrangements as set out in Accounting Standard AASB 1034 regarding Financial Report Presentation and Disclosures (which deals with Executives) and AASB 1017 regarding Related Party Disclosures (which focuses on Directors).
Specifically, AASB 1034 requires “disclosing entities” to report on remuneration above $100,000 for “executive officers” of the entity.  In defining an executive officer, AASB 1034 calls up the definition used in the Corporations Law, ie. a person “who is concerned in, or takes part in, the management of the body (regardless of the person's designation and whether or not the person is a director of the body)”.  In the private sector, executive officers are considered to be those members of the senior management team involved in the strategic and operational management of the business.  In the public sector, managers (the terminology used in the FMOs) are defined more broadly as “executives of an agency, ie. SES or their equivalents”.  
Against that background, the Government sees no current need to widen the FMO reporting requirement to include other staff whose remuneration exceeds $100,000 per annum.  As mentioned in the response to Recommendation 6, the AASB is expected to issue later this year an exposure draft of a new accounting standard on the reporting of directors' and executives' remuneration.  Following the release of the draft accounting standard, the Government will consider the implications of the draft standard, if any, for the FMO requirements on reporting remuneration above $100,000. 
Further, the Government considers that the information provided by reporting on this issue could be further improved if separation and redundancy payments were to be shown separately.  This will avoid distortion of the data in circumstances where a long serving senior executive is made redundant.  The Government will amend the FMOs to require agencies to report on this basis and include information regarding the aggregate level of redundancy payments to “managers” as defined in the FMOs in the notes to financial statements. This new requirement will commence with the 2001-2002 reporting period.
Recommendation 8 - The committee recommends that individual performance bonus payments be discontinued in the Australian Public Service.
Recommendation 9 - The committee recommends that if performance bonuses continue to be paid, they must be for outstanding individual or team service, not for achieving the minimum expected of all APS employees, that is, competent performance.
Recommendation 11 - The committee recommends that if performance bonuses continue to be paid, these should be capped.  Uncapped bonuses should not be allowed.
Response:  Disagree.
The Government's APS reform agenda is aimed at promoting a high performance APS capable of operating in an increasingly competitive environment that emphasises contestability, value for money and a focus on client service.
To achieve these objectives, APS agencies not only need to be able to attract and retain suitably qualified staff, but also need to be able to appropriately reward employees, particularly high performing staff and those who deliver results in exceptionally difficult circumstances.  Performance related payments are one means through which agencies are endeavouring to attract, retain and reward high performing staff.  Any decision to remove scope for individual performance bonuses may therefore result in the APS being unable to retain some highly skilled staff.
With almost all APS agencies now covered by agreements, it is clear that agencies are taking advantage of the flexibilities available to them to tailor their terms and conditions of employment to their particular needs and those of their employees.  The diversity of arrangements adopted in agencies in respect of performance-linked remuneration systems, which include different performance rating systems and payment levels and in some instances team based rewards, provide evidence of the success of the Government's policy stance.  
It would be inconsistent with the Government's policy of devolving responsibility for workplace relations issues to APS agencies for a prescriptive, “one size fits all” approach to be imposed in respect of performance related payments.
Further, the Government's APS remuneration policy provides that improvements in pay and conditions be linked to productivity gains and are to be funded from within agency appropriations.  In this context, there is no cap on the quantum of pay increases that may be agreed at the agency level.  A cap on performance bonuses would therefore be inconsistent with this policy setting.
Recommendation 10 - If performance bonuses continue to be paid, the committee also recommends that there should be complete disclosure of all payments in annual reports, including the following:
·	the number of APS employees at each classification level who received one-off bonus payments;
·	the aggregate amount of such bonus payments at each classification level;
·	the average bonus payment and the range of such payments at each classification level; and
·	the aggregate bonus payment for the agency as a whole.
If such a disclosure were, in the case of a small agency, or a small number of SES officers, to identify payments to individuals, the committee would be prepared to accept the information grouped by SES and non-SES officers.
Response:  Agree.
The Requirements for Departmental Annual Reports will be amended, subject to the approval of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, so that annual reports for 2000-2001 will incorporate information regarding performance related payments but in a form that protects the privacy of individuals.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,19,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2001-06-21,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In the government's response, in the main the government has disagreed with the series of recommendations made by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. It has, for example, disagreed with recommendation 1, which was:
The Government, as the ultimate employer, should direct agency heads that:
AWAs with SES and APS employees are not to be kept confidential; and
APS agencies are to make AWAs available on request, allowing appropriate deletion of personal information but retaining remuneration details in a published document. 
The government's response claims that a government direction of this nature would be inconsistent with the statutory intent of the parliament, presumably in passing the Workplace Relations Act. It ignores the finding in the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee report that the Commonwealth is one of the parties to APS AWAs. In the Workplace Relations Act 1996, section 170WK deals with AWAs with Commonwealth employees. It says that `a secretary acts on behalf of the Commonwealth'. 
Therefore, there is nothing inappropriate or inconsistent with the statutory intent of the parliament in the recommendation. If it chose to do so, the government, as the ultimate employer, could issue a direction to agency heads that APS AWAs are not to be kept confidential. In fact, the government has already done so in relation to agreement making, when it issued its parameters setting out that agreements have to be consistent with the government's workplace relations policy, remuneration policy and industry development policy and be funded within agency appropriations. The response goes on to state: 
... disclosure ... even where personal information is deleted is likely to result in employee concerns about confidentiality and privacy. 
The committee sees such privacy concerns are only an issue if staff are led to believe that they are entitled to this level of privacy, and the introduction of AWAs into the private sector has mistakenly implied this. Public servants, parliamentarians and other public officials are paid by the taxpayer and are accountable to the public for the expenditure of this money and for what is bought with that money and what is not available because those funds are not available for other purposes. This is where the public interest in payments made to public servants derives. The secrecy of AWAs is inconsistent with the level of transparency applying to all forms of agreement making in the APS. It also fails to follow the requirements for tabling or gazettal of Remuneration Tribunal determinations and the Prime Minister's determinations for secretaries.
The government has also disagreed with recommendation 2. The contents of that recommendation are: 
The committee recommends that all agency heads authorise the OEA, under the provisions of the WR Act, to release copies of their AWAs to DEWRSB and the PSMPC.
The response states:
... the WR Act precludes the EA from disclosing protected information which may identify a person as being, or having been, a party to an AWA unless disclosure is authorised in writing by that person.
This position does not take into account the committee's view that the Commonwealth is a party to the AWA and that the secretary is acting on its behalf. Therefore, it is open to the government to authorise the Employment Advocate to release copies of AWAs to DEWSRB and the PSMPC, without further delay. The committee feels it is unacceptable that information held by the OEA is not available to other arms of the APS, particularly DEWSRB and the PSMPC, to enable the department to provide a more rigorous information program about devolved agreement making in the APS and to improve the quality of reporting on remuneration. It would also enhance the Public Service Commissioner's ability to perform her statutory reporting role and open the way for monitoring AWAs as a distinct management tool.
Recommendation 3, which again is disagreed with, states:
DEWSRB undertake a more rigorous program of information gathering in relation to APS AWAs; service-wide reporting on agreement-making and remuneration be conducted annually and on a financial year basis by DEWSRB, with compulsory participation by all agencies covered by the Public Service Act; and DEWRSB service-wide reports be tabled in parliament of the same cycle as the Public Service Commissioner's reports on the state of the APS.
The response states that the department:
... currently coordinates and/or undertakes surveys of remuneration arrangements in APS. 
It is noted, however, that the initiative to undertake these surveys comes from various sources and that a strategic approach for comprehensive service-wide information is needed. The committee reported that the non-SES survey completed by DEWRSB did not include AWA information for every agency. Voluntary surveys and random inclusions are not an acceptable basis for gathering and reporting on remuneration in the public sector. I draw the attention of the Senate to paragraph 6.10 of the report.
The committee welcomes the revision of this non-SES pay survey so that in future it will provide data similar to that available in respect of SES remuneration and to include both certified agreements and AWAs. It also urges the publication of the survey results in a timely manner. Even though the response noted high levels of participation, the committee sees no reason why participation should not be made compulsory, enhancing the quality of information available. The response states that, in addition to the surveys, the agencies' annual reports:
... may include consideration of features of certified agreements and AWAs, and their impact.
However, the inclusion of this information is non-mandatory and highly aggregated.
Recommendation 4, which again was disagreed with, states:
The committee recommends that the PS Commissioner considers AWAs as a distinct category when exercising her statutory functions, in particular, to develop, promote, review and evaluate APS employment policies and practices and in her evaluation of the extent to which agencies incorporate and uphold the APS values.
The main purpose of this recommendation was the committee's concern that there is no means of measuring or monitoring the impact of public sector AWAs on EEO target groups. For example, as AWAs are used throughout all levels now, can we be confident that the pay increases for those who must negotiate individually for an AWA are being treated fairly and receive fair and equitable pay outcomes? The Public Service Commissioner's responsibilities include evaluating the extent to which agencies incorporate and uphold the APS values and to develop, promote, review and evaluate APS employment policies and practices. Information about the negotiation and use of AWAs would be an important element in the scrutiny of these processes, yet the commissioner has no direct access to AWAs and no specific information on AWAs in the state of the APS report to the parliament. I draw the Senate's attention to paragraph 4.48 in the committee's report.
Recommendation 5 states:
The committee recommends that the OEA should make the full range of AWAs available to researchers, retaining the current confidentiality protections.
The government has agreed with this recommendation. Even though the government agrees with the thrust of the recommendation, it has not specifically addressed concerns of the committee—in particular, the evidence to the committee pointed to difficulties in gaining representative samples through the first AWA sampling method. Even though the response notes that particular information required by a researcher needs to be requested and would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, taking into account matters such as practicality and cost, evidence from a researcher found that access was `far from ideal and does not allow full pictures of AWAs to be drawn by anyone'. 
In respect of recommendation 6 there is agreement by the government, with qualification. The recommendation states:
The committee recommends that the annual and financial reporting requirements for the Australian Public Service be at least as rigorous as those applying to the private sector.
There is no specific requirement in relation to reporting the remuneration of staff on AWAs. The annual reporting requirements only suggest that agencies include in their annual reports an explanation of how the nature and amount of remuneration for SES is determined. Reporting on non-monetary rewards, performance pay and any other remuneration outside requirements for the financial statements is left to agencies to determine.
The response notes a number of other options available to parliament, besides the annual and financial reports, which make the overall disclosure requirements on APS departments and agencies to disclose remuneration more rigorous than those applying in the private sector—for example, FOI requests, parliamentary questions, and inquiries of parliamentary committees, including Senate estimates. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-21,"—I would like to speak briefly on this matter. I was not able to speak to the report when it was tabled in the chamber earlier this week. This is a report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, of which I am a member. Firstly, as is normal and is always appropriate, I would like to thank the secretariat for their work and assistance in the review of this issue. This matter goes back some four years now, with the introduction of a $1,000 fee for unsuccessful applicants to the Refugee Review Tribunal—that is, asylum seekers wishing to have their application reviewed by the Refugee Review Tribunal and being unsuccessful now have to pay a $1,000 fee. The minister has the power to waive that fee but, obviously, in many circumstances, does not.
I think it was I, on behalf of the Democrats, who sought unsuccessfully to disallow that fee from being introduced. There was an agreement instead, reached by others in the Senate, to have a sunset clause and a review of it. That occurred initially a couple of years ago and, again, it was decided to put in another sunset clause to extend its operation until the end of this month. That time is obviously fast upon us and the review has happened again, which is what this report represents. The totality of the committee, excluding me, has decided to recommend once again that the fee be retained with another sunset clause and review for a few years hence. I have put in a lone dissenting report, and I guess that is a bit of a sad indication because the last time we reviewed it I think three other members of the committee dissented along with me. I am stuck on my own these days.
—Not only within the party. I thought that Natasha was with you.
—I have the total support of my entire party but am stuck on my own within the committee in relation to this issue. But I am sure that, if Mr Theophanous were still on the committee, he would support me as well.
—He's all alone, too.
—He is definitely on his own in the House of Representatives and, unfortunately, he is not on the committee anymore. The basic point is that the department is saying that it is not preventing genuine people from applying for asylum, and certainly there was no huge amount of evidence that that was the case. Clearly there is an implication, by virtue of charging people, that their claims are unmeritorious. The Democrats believe that, simply because someone's claim for asylum is rejected, it does not mean they are trying to rort the system. They may well not be a genuine refugee; nonetheless, they may well have genuine grounds for believing that they were or are and also have other reasons for fleeing persecution. Indeed, if people know they are not able to fit the grounds of refugee status but have other serious humanitarian reasons why they do not wish to be returned, they are sometimes allowed to stay by virtue of ministerial discretion. But the only way they can have that ministerial discretion exercised is if they apply to the Refugee Review Tribunal. So there is a catch-22 in there as well.
The Democrats have a philosophical problem with the application of the $1,000 fee for people who apply to the Refugee Review Tribunal, particularly if—as the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs have said—the regulation is primarily designed to address the growing misuse of the protection visa process by people lawfully in the community. The Democrats dispute whether or not that is a growing misuse, but we do not deny that there is always some degree of misuse. But, as I have stated in my dissenting report, on the evidence presented to the committee, it is not obvious that there is significant abuse. More to the point, there is no evidence that the fee has operated in any way as a deterrent to such misuse. The take-up rates show that the so-called positive effects of the fee, which the department suggested were expected to be seen most clearly in the low refugee producing nationalities, have not occurred. So there is no particular evidence that the so-called purpose of the fee—preventing or reducing misuse—is having that effect, and this is after four years of operation. If that is the primary purpose of it and it is not working, then we believe that it should be scrapped forthwith.
On behalf of the Democrats, I would like to emphasise my recommendation and view that the regulation should cease to operate at the end of this month rather than be extended and have another review in a few years time. We oppose the regulation being introduced. After four years of operation, there is no evidence that it is working in any effective way to meet its supposed goal. I am sure it is meeting the goal of the department in raising a bit of extra money and generally reinforcing some of the rhetoric that likes to suggest to the community that there is widespread abuse and that people who are unsuccessful in the RRT are all trying to rort the system. That is clearly not the case. I am certainly not suggesting that members of the committee who thought differently to what I thought are suggesting that that is the case, but it is an inference that has been implied through the whole existence of this fee. The Democrats believe that, particularly seeing there is little or no evidence that it is working to achieve its reputed primary goal as stated by the department of immigration, there is no need to continue it for any longer. If nothing else, it would save the committee having to review the situation again in a couple of years time, and it would mean that we could have time to spend on some of the many other important matters in the area—not just refugee issues but migration issues more broadly.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I recently spoke about this matter at the Defence estimates. It is worth while to keep plugging away at it because the issue of accountability in Defence is sometimes lacking. I must say that, in many ways, they have started to improve their game, but this report, which is one of a number of reports on defence that surface from time to time, highlights the issue of defence cooperation. That involves the provision of assistance by our security forces to other security forces in South-East Asia and the South Pacific through the program known as the Defence Cooperation Program.
The report highlights the fact that the activities that are conducted under the program include training, study visits, personnel exchanges and combined exercises with elements of various regional armed forces. There are not substantial amounts of money on an individual nation basis involved in some of these exercises and exchanges. Nonetheless, overall there is a substantial amount of money, which totals about $60 million per annum. Defence has a large budget and therefore should be subject to the scrutiny that it deserves. In noting the conclusions and the background by the Audit Office, at point 8 on page 10, they say:
Several improvements could be made to the management of DC finances and activities. Financial data could not be exchanged adequately between Defence and its overseas posts and with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
That is an underlying weakness that needs to be picked up. They say:
DC systems and practices were not effective in preventing, nor in detecting misallocations and overspending on individual DC activities.
That is a criticism of the administrative processes that are operating within Defence, not only within Australia but also within overseas posts and within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. At point 16 of the key findings, the Audit Office point out:
The systems, procedures and practices used to administer DC were not effective in preventing and detecting misallocations—
as I have said previously—
and budget overspends in program administration nor in the execution of projects.
At point 17 they went on to say:
There were many instances where internal good practice guidelines regarding documentation of details in approving, implementing and concluding projects were not followed.
That is one of the weaknesses of the Department of Defence. They have many procedures and guidelines—of course, they are invariably good procedures and good guidelines—but they do not follow them. The report highlights once again an area where there is a defect—not that it is a major defect, nonetheless it is a defect that needs to be addressed by the Department of Defence. The Audit Office also went on to say:
Projects also lacked effective monitoring systems and procedures.
One hopes that, arising out of this report by the Australian National Audit Office, the Department of Defence will tighten up its practices and procedures and put in place effective monitoring systems so that the Australian public can be assured that there is reasonable transparency and accountability in the expenditure of $60 million in fostering good relations with our South-East Asia and South Pacific neighbours.
One must recall that this is an important exercise for us. In many instances, it brings about better working relations with many of these nations, which are very small nations, and it serves a useful purpose in developing our defence personnel in understanding the region in which we live. The Audit Office made seven recommendations. The Department of Defence agreed with all bar one of them, and they agreed to the other recommendation with qualifications. Whilst it is always good to see the Department of Defence, or any department, agree with the recommendations of the Audit Office, it is another thing to ensure that those recommendations are put into force. In particular, I want to highlight recommendation 3, which states:
The ANAO recommends that Defence review its public reporting on DC program performance indicators and targets, with a view to disclosing information sufficient to discharge its accountability for public funds spent on DC and enabling an informed assessment of DC program performance.
I have looked at that in trying to assess the performance of our defence cooperation programs, which include assisting some of our smaller South-East Asian and South Pacific neighbours with a Pacific patrol boat project. I have tried to assess the effectiveness of these programs in the annual report and the accountability of the expenditure of public funds, which is not always necessarily transparent in the annual report. If Defence take note of that recommendation, I think they will improve and lift their game in a big way.

That the Senate take note of the document.
This report is in respect of the Australian Defence Force reserves. Last year, the government released the white paper for 2000. Part of the white paper states—and this is cited in the report:
The strategic role for reserves has now changed from mobilisation to meet remote threats to that of supporting and sustaining the types of contemporary military operations in which the ADF may be increasingly engaged.
There is a recognised need, as there always has been, for the reserves. The reserves have always played a significant role in our defence forces over a long period of time. Of course, this was reinforced in the recent white paper. Unfortunately, there are some difficulties within the reserves. There are difficulties in terms of recruitment to the reserves; in terms of resources for the reserves; and there were particular difficulties in respect of the Army in terms of training because of a changed training regime brought in by the defence forces two to three years ago.
Over that time, Defence have recognised the error of their ways in terms of the training for the Army Reserves and they have moved from a six-week program to a shorter period of two three-week periods to accommodate reserves who, undoubtedly, have difficulty fitting a large training block into their private lives in terms of their jobs. All reserves need to seek leave from their jobs to undergo any training or to attend parades. 
The significance of the reserve forces was highlighted with our involvement in East Timor. There was a large tapping into the reserve forces to fill some of the gaps and holes that occurred so that we could sustain a viable force in East Timor. The report highlighted the major gaps in the Defence Force, and the Army, in particular, was singled out—although that does not mean that there are no problems with Navy or, to a lesser degree, with the Air Force. It is interesting to note in the report that the ANAO concluded: 
Previous efforts to revitalise the reserve have not been successful, largely because roles have not been clearly defined and resources allocated to the Army Reserve from the Defence budget have been insufficient to achieve the capability required by the Army. There is a body of evidence indicating that the Army Reserve is not providing a level of collective capability commensurate with the resources being expended. It is indeed an issue of major concern that, in spite of the money that is being spent through the budget, our Defence Forces—and, in particular, the Army Reserve—are not at the level of capability such that they can be used effectively in times of need.
The report itself then goes on to make a number of recommendations. In particular, the ANAO found that the direct cost of maintaining full-time personnel in reserve units is more than one-third of the total direct cost of the reserve units. We have a real difficulty there in that much of the money that is allocated to reserve units is chewed up directly by the use of full-time personnel. That is a necessary evil in one way, but it is an unfortunate thing in another way. At the end of the day, it minimises the resources available for parade, for exercises and for a whole range of things under the defence reserves.
There are some other issues in the report that I will just raise briefly. The report noted:
Having regard to the costs associated with initial recruitment and employment training, the payment of a suitable proficiency bonus to retain trained and competent Reservists should prove to be cost effective.
The report then went on to make a number of recommendations. Again, interestingly, they were agreed to by Defence. In particular, I want to draw attention to part (b) of recommendation 11, where the ANAO recommended that, with a view to improving recruitment opportunities, Defence should:
... closely monitor the results of the recruiting initiatives developed by individual units and adopt those measures that prove to be particularly successful ...
That will be of interest. I know that in the coming weeks the Senate Standing Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee is conducting an inquiry into recruitment and retention within the Defence Force. Undoubtedly we will address the issue of what is happening in the reserves. We put the Defence Force on notice now that, when they come before us over the next few weeks, we will want some information on what initiatives they are taking in terms of individual units. We will want information on initiatives not only to improve recruitment into the reserves but also to ensure the retention of those people that quite a substantial amount has been outlaid upon, so that they can be brought up to the skills and proficiency of the permanent forces and at reasonable notice be slotted in to operate with the permanent forces in operations such as those that have taken place in East Timor.
I am going to pull up there. I think the report is very valuable. As a result of this report I hope we will see a concerted effort made to improve the level of funding, the level of proficiency, the level of recruitment and the level of retention in our reserves so that we have a viable Defence Force operating in this nation, comprising not only full-time ADF personnel but reserves as well. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I recently spoke about this matter at the Defence estimates. It is worth while to keep plugging away at it because the issue of accountability in Defence is sometimes lacking. I must say that, in many ways, they have started to improve their game, but this report, which is one of a number of reports on defence that surface from time to time, highlights the issue of defence cooperation. That involves the provision of assistance by our security forces to other security forces in South-East Asia and the South Pacific through the program known as the Defence Cooperation Program.
The report highlights the fact that the activities that are conducted under the program include training, study visits, personnel exchanges and combined exercises with elements of various regional armed forces. There are not substantial amounts of money on an individual nation basis involved in some of these exercises and exchanges. Nonetheless, overall there is a substantial amount of money, which totals about $60 million per annum. Defence has a large budget and therefore should be subject to the scrutiny that it deserves. In noting the conclusions and the background by the Audit Office, at point 8 on page 10, they say:
Several improvements could be made to the management of DC finances and activities. Financial data could not be exchanged adequately between Defence and its overseas posts and with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
That is an underlying weakness that needs to be picked up. They say:
DC systems and practices were not effective in preventing, nor in detecting misallocations and overspending on individual DC activities.
That is a criticism of the administrative processes that are operating within Defence, not only within Australia but also within overseas posts and within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. At point 16 of the key findings, the Audit Office point out:
The systems, procedures and practices used to administer DC were not effective in preventing and detecting misallocations—
as I have said previously—
and budget overspends in program administration nor in the execution of projects.
At point 17 they went on to say:
There were many instances where internal good practice guidelines regarding documentation of details in approving, implementing and concluding projects were not followed.
That is one of the weaknesses of the Department of Defence. They have many procedures and guidelines—of course, they are invariably good procedures and good guidelines—but they do not follow them.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2001-06-21,"—I rise to speak tonight about two innovative businesses located at Beauty Point on the River Tamar in northern Tasmania. These businesses have one thing in common: seahorses. The first is Seahorse Australia and the second is Seahorse World. Seahorse Australia's business is to breed seahorses for the lucrative Asian market, while Seahorse World provides a range of tourism experiences, including viewing the working seahorse farm, other exhibits and a range of visitor facilities. 
As a working seahorse farm, Seahorse Australia has been recognised throughout the world for its scientific breakthroughs. The farm was established in 1998 with aquaculture expert Professor Nigel Forteath, the 1997 Tasmanian of the Year, heading up a team of young aquaculturalists. The initial stages of the program involved collecting brood fish from the wild. Initially 50 fish were collected and, when they were sure there were no problems with the first batch, further batches of up to 100 fish were collected. Over an 18-month period the brood fish numbers were gradually built up to 600, the total number that was allowed to be collected from the wild. All through this time the scientists acted in an extremely careful and responsible way while conservationists watched them closely. From the outset, the ongoing program of research and development has been with a keen eye on the commercial potential of the product. Over the last three years, Professor Forteath has guided the program from the laboratory to commercial reality. With the original 600 brood fish from the wild, Seahorse Australia has now bred more than a quarter of a million seahorses and is working with third and fourth generation fish. Now they are not at all reliant on the wild stock for stock. This is one aspect of the uniqueness of the project.
Another unique aspect is concerned with the seahorses themselves, and that is the role reversal that takes place in the breeding cycle. The male seahorse takes on the maternal role. Instead of the male bringing the sperm to the female, the female puts her eggs into a pouch on the male, where the fertilisation process takes place. The male's pregnancy takes 30 days. The average brood size is about 300, but on one occasion a nameless sire gave birth to 1,113 babies—a record others around the world are trying to beat. When the babies are born they weigh 0.2 grams. At the Beauty Point facility the babies grow to over one gram in a little over a month and are ready for the aquarium market at 15 centimetres long in five months. In the wild they take over nine months to reach this size. In other words, the growth rate has been doubled or tripled. In the wild there is an extremely low survival rate, but at Seahorse Australia the survival rate is 90 per cent. Seahorse World now employs a PhD student from the University of Tasmania, and others, to work for Seahorse Australia. This student is working on methods to further enhance this amazing growth rate. In fact, far from the dour claims made by many conservationists, this is a fantastic conservation program.
Recently, Professor Forteath and Seahorse Australia Beauty Point manager Karl Maier returned from a successful trip to the high calibre exhibition Aquarama held in Singapore. Mr Maier reported that 55 aquarium wholesale companies had registered interest during the four-day show in buying seahorses. Professor Forteath indicated they could have sold the 25 seahorses they had with them 100 times over. They sold them all to one buyer, who put in a further order for 200 the next day. It is conservatively estimated that the venture might sell 50,000 a year at $10 each, which would quickly bring the company to a break-even point. While in Singapore, Professor Forteath was approached by the Singaporean, Thai and Malaysian fisheries organisations, who all showed a keen interest in the success being achieved in Tasmania.
The new tourism facility opened its doors in early November 2000, providing 1½-hour tours of Seahorse World, giving an insight into the intriguing world of these magical creatures. The tour includes the cave of the seahorse, which houses five tanks, exhibiting several different members of the seahorse family, the farm and a boutique aquarium featuring a touch pool for children. There is also a theatrette, an interpretation centre and a marine environment centre.
Since the beginning of November, nearly 50,000 people have visited the seahorse venture. This is far in excess of the predicted number for the first year. In fact, the success of the visitor numbers has completely overwhelmed the original budget predictions for the tourism venture. It is estimated that 70 to 75 per cent of visitors are from interstate. Bookings already in place for the coming season include some 2,500 pre-booked coach tour groups and, beginning in November, some 1,600 Singaporeans are expected to visit. Added to this, three cruise liners will be visiting Beauty Point on 19, 20 and 26 February next year.
So from the humble seahorse a whole industry has developed. There is a state-of-the-art fish farm, producing wonderful results in reproduction and growth, and there is the new tourism facility catering to an expanding number of visitors. All of these facets of the operation mean employment for academics and locals, and the entire operation is a drawcard to, and an example of forward thinking in, the region.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Seahorse Farms: Tasmania</title>,Adjournment,27,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-21,"—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	Australian aviation personal flotation devices (PDF) are currently required to comply with Civil Aviation Order (CAO) 103.13 Equipment Standards - Life Jackets.
CAO 103.13 requires that a life jacket carried in Australian aircraft as required by CAO 20.11, must be an inflatable type meeting the standard specified by the Federal Aviation Administration Technical Standard Order TSO-C13e or later amendment. A specification approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom is also acceptable. In addition, a whistle is required in other than an infant life jacket.
(2)	CASA performs audits on High Capacity Regular Public Transport Operators in accordance with the surveillance objectives outlined in Compliance Management Instruction 00/08 (Version 2).
As part of CASA's safety systems approach and normal audit activities, personal flotation devices are inspected. These devices are also checked during ramp inspections.
A copy of Compliance Management Instruction 00/08 (Version 2) has been provided to the Table Office.
(3)	CASA does not believe it would be appropriate to provide the level of operational detail regarding operators, as requested by Senator O'Brien. In addition, CASA holds the view that disclosure of information on the outcomes of an audit process could prejudice an operator's commercial interests and could also prejudice CASA's ability to obtain information from other operators during the course of normal investigations where compulsory extraction powers are not used.
CASA can confirm however that all matters raised with operators of High Capacity Regular Public Transport, involving the issue of Non Compliance Notices and Aircraft Survey Reports relating to personal flotation devices have been addressed.
(4)	CASA performs audits on Low Capacity Regular Public Transport Operators in accordance with the surveillance objectives outlined in Compliance Management Instruction 00/10 (Version 2).
As part of CASA's safety systems approach and normal audit activities, personal flotation devices are inspected. These devices are also checked during ramp inspections.
A copy of Compliance Management Instruction 00/10 (Version 2) has been provided to the Table Office, however, CASA wishes to note that Compliance Management Instruction 00/10 (Version 2) is currently being reviewed in accordance with the Compliance Management Instruction review process.
(5)	CASA does not believe it is appropriate to provide the level of operational detail regarding operators, as requested by Senator O'Brien. In addition, CASA holds the view that disclosure of information on the outcomes of an audit process could prejudice an operator's commercial interests and could also prejudice CASA's ability to obtain information from other operators during the course of normal investigations where compulsory extraction powers are not used.
CASA can confirm however that all matters raised with operators of Low Capacity Regular Public Transport, involving the issue of Non Compliance Notices and Aircraft Survey Reports relating to personal flotation devices have been addressed.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Aviation: Personal Flotation Devices</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,29,1,answer
