"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-08-17,"—I table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The purpose of this bill is to make a number of minor amendments to four pieces of Defence portfolio legislation: the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, the Defence Act 1903, and the Naval Defence Act 1910.
The Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (the DFDA) is amended to redefine which laws form “Territory offences” under that Act as a result of changes in the criminal law of the ACT. These amendments are considered essential to ensure that this Act continues to reflect the range of offences originally intended for its operation. The scope of these offences has been severely limited in recent times by changes to the laws that are referred to in the Act.
The DFDA imports civil criminal offences into that Act as service offences, in order to extend the ambit of the Act to circumstances that might otherwise not be prosecuted, and to give greater efficacy to disciplinary law. The mechanism currently used to achieve this is the incorporation of the laws of the Commonwealth, the ACT Crimes Act 1900 and the ACT Police Offences Act 1930 as they apply in the Jervis Bay Territory.
Since the introduction of the Territory offence provisions, changes have occurred to the incorporated legislation such that some updating of the DFDA is essential. Most concerning is that the ACT in 2001 and 2002 enacted Criminal Code legislation based on the Commonwealth Model Criminal Code, and since 2002 it has repealed numerous offences from its Crimes Act in favour of the Criminal Code. The net effect of this is that offences such as computer theft, arson and blackmail can no longer be prosecuted by the ADF under the DFDA. Furthermore, it is anticipated that offences such as murder, manslaughter and assault will also move to the Criminal Code by the end of 2005. Also of concern is the fact that the Police Offences Act was repealed in 1996, and references to it are therefore ineffective. The proposed Bill will remove redundant legislation references and refer instead to the criminal law in force in the Jervis Bay Territory from time to time.
The Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 (the Benefits Act) is to be amended to repeal Part 8 so as to remove the retention benefit currently available for certain Australian Defence Force (ADF) members of the benefits scheme.
Part 8 of the Benefits Act currently provides a bonus of one year’s salary to eligible members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits scheme who, on reaching 15 years of continuous effective service, agree to complete a further 5 years’ service. The Review of Australian Defence Force Remuneration 2001 (the Nunn review) considered that issues of attraction to and retention in the Services would be better suited for determination by the Navy, Army and Air Force Service Chiefs based on priority needs and linked to capability. An automatic retention bonus rigidly tied up to a number of years of service, at a fixed rate, is no longer regarded as appropriate.
Despite the repeal of Part 8 of the Benefits Act, it is proposed that access to the retention benefit would continue for current members for as long as they remain eligible but would not be available to new members joining the ADF after the date of the commencement of the proposed amendments.
These amendments are required to ensure that ADF pay arrangements provide an effective, efficient and flexible remuneration framework consistent with reforms in the wider public and private sectors.
Thirdly, the Defence Act 1903 is amended to change references from “investigating officers” to “inquiry officers” to make it clear that these officers are conducting purely administrative rather than criminal investigations. This amendment is an administrative amendment that is required to improve administration of military justice.
The term “investigating officer” appears in both the Defence Act and the DFDA, but has different meanings in each Act. The role of an investigating officer as referred to in the Defence Act is to conduct an administrative inquiry into matters affecting the ADF. However, some ADF members believe that officers are conducting criminal investigations because of the use of the words “investigating officers”. To remove this confusion, it is considered appropriate to change references in the Defence Act from “investigating officers” to “inquiry officers” to make it clear that these officers are conducting purely administrative investigations.
The fourth Act to be amended by this bill, the Naval Defence Act 1910, is amended to align the legislation governing eligible ages of Navy Cadets with the legislation governing their Army and Air Force counterparts. The alignment of the various laws dealing with ADF cadets to provide more consistency between the respective services is long overdue. The amendment to the Naval Defence Act will provide a uniform maximum entry age of 20 years for acceptance into the ADF cadets and will provide for a person to cease being a cadet at the age of 21 years or such lower age as is prescribed under the regulations.
Finally, this bill also contains provisions amending various Defence administered legislation resulting from the commencement of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and the Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003. These are technical housekeeping amendments to remove redundant references to the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903 and repealed provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1900. These amendments do not in any way affect the operation of the Defence legislation referred to in the bill.
Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.",SENATE,"<title>

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-08-17,"—The Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill 2005 is before us. In fact, there is quite a long saga in respect of this bill. The Minister for Justice and Customs has extended the cut-over time, but it is worth putting into context how this position has come about. The first time this became an issue was in 2001, or thereabouts, when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was inquiring into the IT outsourcing of Customs matters. That inquiry was about how to move from an old computer system that had served Customs very well to a new re-engineered, integrated cargo management system. Of course, we found fraying at the edges, even back then, in terms of how much this project was going to cost. It was indicated at the time that the cost of this project—and there was a little latitude with it, so I will give the minister that latitude—would be between $25 million and $35 million.
After those particular hearings, the issue of how to introduce the cargo management re-engineering project and the integrated cargo system, which is the computer side of it, started to run off the rails. When Labor looked at it again to see how it was going, we found that it was expanding and drawing in resources from Customs. The costs had started to expand, even before my time as the shadow minister with responsibility for Customs. The shadow minister at the time, Senator Mark Bishop, also examined this issue. This issue has drawn Customs’ resources, time, money and energy for quite some time. At the beginning, the issue involved $25 million to $35 million to get the project up and running. During the last estimates, we found it was somewhere in the order of $180 million and growing. The issue has certainly not slowed down.
One of the key issues is how to ensure that industry integrates with Customs to enable Customs to use the system. Customs then have to ensure that both the business sector and the developers of the hardware and the software come together to ensure that the system works and works well. When Labor examined it in a little more detail, we found that that fraying at the edges had started to in fact tear. This is a bill that is not necessary. It was never necessary, unless you point to some fault or some failing by the government. I think that is where the issue lies.
The government has had nine years to get Customs right, but it has not been able to do so. Having had extension after extension, the government is again seeking a further extension in respect of the imports cut-over time. Exports have ‘gone live’, a phrase used by Customs which means that the system has started to work, at least as far as exports are concerned. We then move to the next phase where imports have to go live, via a computer system that ensures people can process the various issues that surround how cargo is imported into Australia. The integrated cargo system was originally going to start on 1 July. The government has had to come back again and say: ‘We don’t think we can get it up and running by 1 July. We need an extension again.’
There is a question mark over how this government has really worked on this matter. In the nine long years since the coalition came to government, this project has stood as a metaphor for ineptitude: for how not to manage a project and for how to fail to be able to bring together a system on time and on budget. Industry, back in the eighties, realised that it could not have cost overruns and it could not have projects that went over time, because business was not going to put up with it. We find today a perfect example of where the government has been unable to deliver a business project on time and on budget—and it should be ashamed. The minister should be ashamed. He should, as part of his reply, apologise to business for not being able to deliver a business project on time and on budget. The purpose of this legislation stands as a testament to how the government has managed to cause—in my words—business grief. What it will mean, in essence, is that the cut-over date will be extended yet again.
The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act to delay the import cut-over and turn-off times that are specified in sections 5 and 6 of the application act. The import cut-over time determines which computer system a person must use to communicate electronically with the Australian Customs Service. So, in effect, it relates to the way business will interface and deal with Customs. They are going to deal electronically with Customs in the future. What Customs have not been able to do, and what they are now seeking to do with this legislation, is to extend what might be regarded as the cut-over time between the old and the new systems. We have to find a time when that cut-over is made, the old system is retired and the new system becomes operational and the only way to talk to Customs.
The Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 amended the Customs Act 1901 to allow for electronic communication between industry and Customs, using the new system known as the integrated cargo system. In order to allow those who want to communicate electronically with Customs to prepare the relevant systems, the amendments in the international trade modernisation act have been proclaimed to commence progressively. The amendments relating to the importation of goods and the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia were also included in the international trade modernisation act amendments, which commenced on 19 July this year.
It is worth while going back to what Senator Ellison said in April 2001, when he promised Australia:
The modernisation of Australia’s cargo management systems proposed by the Federal Government will significantly enhance the speed and efficiency of Customs services to Australian importers and exporters. The changes offer great potential for business to save time and money through reduced processing and handling costs, improved transit times and increase their cash flow, as well as simplifying and streamlining cargo management processes.
Yet we are still waiting to see the realisation of those benefits, nine long years after they were first promised. The fact that we are now looking at yet another change in legislation in regard to this project is—and cannot be categorised as anything else but—another waste of taxpayers’ time and money. Here we are again, taking up the time of the parliament to fix the minister’s errors—errors which he should have fixed way before we got to this point. Just one month after heralding a ‘new era in cargo management’, Minister Ellison could really only be categorised as having changed his tune. The ‘new era’ is on hold at least until 12 October and possibly until as late as 7 November.
It is true that we live in a globalised world. Imports are relied upon today by retailers and numerous people in the community who depend on them for jobs. Brokers and forwarders, freight distributors and logistics companies all depend on the certainty of deadlines and timetables to make our economy work. Yet in this legislation we see again the incompetence of the minister, who is out of touch with the needs of business and industry and who has failed yet again to meet the deadline he set himself.
The government, and Minister Ellison, will insist that the reason they want to extend the cut-over time is to give industry the opportunity to ensure that all systems are working perfectly before the new system must be used to communicate with the Australian Customs Service. I suggest that, in fact, the reason why industry remains unsure of the reliability and effectiveness of their system is that Customs took so long to deliver it in the first place. Minister Ellison has used industry concerns to justify the repeated extensions to the cut-over and implementation dates. I have to say that that is a tired line. Originally, the Customs management re-engineering project was expected to be completed and up and running in July 2003. That is when it was supposed to have been turned on, have gone live and have been operational.
If this amendment is passed and the new cut-over date is adhered to, the CMR project will be only—only!—2½ years overdue. The only problem is that the new cut-over date proposed in the bill comes right in the middle of the busiest time of the year for industry: the pre-Christmas rush. So the system will be put under immediate stress with the pre-Christmas rush. In contrast to the minister’s original claims during Senate estimates in June, the new 7 November cut-off date in this amendment falls smack bang in the middle of the pre-Christmas rush. Industry will now have to adjust to using this new system and deal with any glitches at their busiest time.
Let me return to some provisions of the bill. Section 7 of the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2004 provides that the international trade modernisation import amendments apply to reports relating to the impending arrival and uploading of goods from ships or aircraft due after the import cut-over time. This section includes the requirement to use the ICS to make electronic reports to Customs. Section 8 of the application act provides that the international trade modernisation import amendments apply to imported goods that arrive on a ship or aircraft after the import cut-over time.
Under section 5 of the application act, the CEO of Customs has specified that the import cut-over time is 2 am in the Australian Capital Territory on 28 August. This date will be altered by this bill to 2 am in the ACT on 12 October—but here is the rub—or a later date as specified by the CEO by legislative instrument, which may be anything as late as 7 November. How is that for certainty? The unamended Customs Act requires that electronic reports relating to imports and arrival of ships and aircraft be made using the sea cargo automation system, the air cargo automation system and COMPILE. The turn-off time is the time when these systems will no longer be used to make these reports.
Under section 6 of the application act, the CEO has specified that the turn-off time will be 2 am in the ACT on 7 October. This is the latest possible day that could be specified, and the 40-day gap between the import cut-over time and turn-off time will enable processes started in the old systems to be completed, as they will not be compatible with the ICS. New subsection (1) of section 6 of the Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill provides that the CEO must specify a date no more than 40 days after the import cut-over time as the turn-off time. This 40-day limit is the same as specified in the current section 6. New subsection (2) of section 6 clearly states that should the CEO change the turn-off time, it must be done before the first turn-off time, and the date must not be more than 40 days after the import cut-over time. The CEO may need to specify a second turn-off time if the import cut-over time is delayed.
Apart from representing yet another delay and providing more uncertainty within industry and the business sector, the Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill will result in a loss of revenue from cost recovery measures contained in the Import Processing Charges Act 2001—something in the order of $1.39 million during this financial year.
Not only are we finding extraordinary over-runs of time and money—and we can certainly hear from the minister whether or not staff have been drawn in and seconded to this project to make sure it works—but also we now find that there is a cost implication from the import processing charge. This is due to the continued use of existing systems before the final cut-over date and, in turn, Customs missing out on the related charges levied until the new import processing charges will be operational. This cost can be added to the already grossly blown out budget for the project. It is worth going back to it again and again, because it just defies imagination why you can start off in 1996 with a cost—and I will give the minister the benefit of the doubt—of between $25 million and $35 million and now have a cost of more than $200 million when you add up the entire cost of the project. The minister does need to come back and tell the parliament what the final cost of the project is. He needs to tell us how much he finally spent on the whole project when we get to the cut-off point.
That may not be the end of it. You will always have issues that might have to be worked around, where errors have to be fixed because of the rush to get to the cut-off time. There might be parts of the software or the system which Customs tried to implement that might not work that they have to re-look at. But that is conjecture; it might not happen. It might work perfectly. The cut-off should have been implemented many years earlier.
This illustrates just how out of touch this government and minister really are. The government has demonstrably failed in its attempt to modernise and implement new trade facilitation measures, and it has left Australian industry and importers unprepared to deal with the Christmas rush. Throughout that time it has continually pointed the finger at industry for the delays, when it was in 2001 that legislation first passed through parliament clearing the way for Customs reform. At the beginning of this year, we were told that the imports component of the system would be operational by 1 July.
This government’s incompetence in handling cargo management re-engineering has become the running joke of the IT industry. They all know it. They all talk about it, and they are all familiar with it. If you go to any IT industry gathering and mention this, they all say, ‘Aha, yes!’ and have a chuckle to themselves about it. James Riley summed it up best in the Australian by calling it ‘the longest running technology development drama in public service history’. I wish I had thought of that phrase. However, the recent 90-day extension and trial from 1 July and the further extension to the cut-off date mean that the project has been delayed a total of eight times. This is the third time parliament has been asked to allow Customs more time. All the while this saga has been continuing, the project has been draining funds from Customs. As an example, ANAO audit report 56 said: ‘The resulting drain on Customs’ previous cash and current asset reserves had placed Customs in a negative net current asset position.’ That is how big it has been. It has been huge.
While Labor supports this amendment, it is important to note that the ICS was originally intended to interface industry directly with Customs and reduce paperwork and delays. So far, Customs has been unable to meet its own self-imposed deadlines. That is why another legislative change is now required. We still do not have any guarantee, because it has allowed itself to have a bit of a fudge factor put in. Labor, as I said, will support this bill. But it is extremely disappointing to Labor, as a party concerned for the wealth and economic security of Australians, that the incompetent mismanagement of trade modernisation still continues today.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF IMPORT CUT-OVER TIME) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech,84N,
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-08-17,"—The Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill 2005 is a very important bill. It forms part of a package of legislation which relates to the largest e-government program in the Southern Hemisphere. The cargo management re-engineering program, as it is known, will revolutionise the way that we deal with the movement of goods in and out of Australia. It is the biggest program to occur in the history of Customs. The Australian Customs Service is older than Federation, which gives you an idea of the enormity of the program that we are looking at.
Many Australians would not have registered that such a program was under way. I dare say that it is of interest to business and importers and exporters, but beyond that it has not attracted much attention. But it will go a very long way towards putting Australia at the cutting edge of international best practice in processing imports and exports. That is why it is so important for Australia.
This program began with outsourcing in late 1997 and has continued since then. There has been a great deal of complexity. As you can appreciate, a program of this enormity takes a good deal of work and consultation with industry. In the United States a similar program is estimated to cost $US3.2 billion, around $A4 billion, and to take about 10 years to develop and implement. That gives you an idea of what is happening in the United States.
It is reported that Australia is the 14th-largest economy in the world. For our small population, we have high exports and imports. That is why it is so important that this program go ahead. In all my dealings with industry on this matter, which have been extensive during my time as minister for customs, there has been nothing but total support for this program. The question has been in the detail of implementation.
The cargo management re-engineering program consists of two aspects: export and import. The decision was made, quite correctly, to deal first with exports and then with imports. Exports went live in October last year, and I am happy to report that that is progressing well. A cut-over date for imports of 28 August this year was previously set. This bill will extend that to 12 October, a mere six or seven weeks. That has come about as a result of consultation with industry, who wanted this extra time in order to test the new system and put in place their own IT arrangements. Yesterday there was a meeting of programmers, and the feedback that I have had is that the cut-over is proceeding well for 12 October this year and the software developers have not indicated any reason as to why this cutover should not be achieved.
In an effort to enhance consultation, I set up a roundtable with stakeholders who were interested in the CMR program. We have had five meetings over the last two years. I want to place on record the appreciation of the government for all those involved and the constructive way they approached the issue of consultation. I do not believe that Customs could have done much more in consulting with industry. I understand that Customs engaged in some 7,000-plus workshops. Of course, in a program of this enormity, you have to get things right. Simply rushing to meet a deadline for the sake of it could well have resulted in a system which did not work and, in fact, backfired. We have achieved our goal with our exports component, which went live last year and is working well. We intend to do the same with imports on 12 October this year. We believe that we now have a system which will work and be a great asset for Australia.
Perhaps one of the most important parts of a nation’s economy is the way the import and export of goods is dealt with. If we do not move goods in a streamlined way, maintain security and maintain scrutiny of goods and the duty payable—because, after all, Customs has a very important role in protecting the revenue—the Australian community will be deprived of its just income for expenditure on vital areas such as health and education. That is why it is important to have that scrutiny of goods coming in and out of the country and to have security. In this modern day and age, that is essential.
The Australian Customs Service is recognised internationally as one of the best customs services in the world. We are acknowledged as having in place security and border control arrangements which are second to none. As well as that, this program, when it is in place, will put us at the leading edge internationally in the way we deal with goods entering and leaving Australia. This is historic for Customs. Although many people would not know of the cargo management re-engineering program, it will have a great effect on Australia’s economy and the way goods are moved and handled. Many people will not know that imported goods that they purchase or goods that are exported from Australia will be moved under this new program in a very efficient manner which will result in great benefits for this country.
A program of this sort was complex, it was never going to be easy and it was never going to be done overnight. We have put it in place and we now will have world’s best practice in a customs service which is one of the best in the world. You need to look at the time it has taken in the context of what the United States is doing: an estimated 10 years to implement their program at a cost of about $A4 billion. A country like the United States, with all its resources, is also dealing with a program which is complex and will take time. We were not going to implement this overnight and foist it on industry without consultation. We were not going to put this in place unless we got it right, and we have done that.
To suggest that this is a Trojan Horse for achieving a later cut-over date or that it will interfere with the Christmas rush is totally misrepresenting the situation. We have discussed with industry the 12 October date and they are agreeable to that. They needed the extra time. We needed to get things right in that extra six weeks, but we will not be doing this in the Christmas rush. We have discussed with industry the very question of that rush, when you have a rush of imports into Australia for the Christmas period. We believe that industry’s desire not to have that infringed will be accommodated. In fact, we are firmly of the view that this will be in place and they can have the benefit of that for the increase of imports for the December period.
I commend this bill to the Senate and we look forward to the cut-over date for the imports segment of the cargo management re-engineering program, which will indeed be a historic day for Customs in this country.
Question agreed to.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-08-17,"—Before this debate was adjourned yesterday, I was despairing for the Liberal and National parties of the coalition. I have always believed them to be ethically and ideologically inadequate when it came to governing, but it does disgust me how underhanded and despicable their actions have become. Was the lack of a Senate majority the closest the government has come to having any conscience? Sadly, this appears to be the truth. There are certainly no signs of compassion or morality now. Perhaps it is the weakness of their policies and the knowledge that what they do is not for the good of this nation but for the gratification of ideological fanatics in their own ranks that inspires such legislation. This and the coming extremist vendetta against working Australians are simply despicable. There is absolutely no proof that the radical workplace demands of the government will in any way contribute to the improved delivery of training or better equipped trainees. Indeed, any application of logic indicates the complete opposite. They simply will not.
Before I conclude my remarks on this bill, I would like to turn to the conduct of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, of which I was a member and in fact deputy chair. The chair of the committee determined that no public hearings would be conducted anywhere around the country to garner community opinion and expertise on the bill and its effects. The obvious question to ask is what senators opposite were afraid of when they refused to hold public hearings into this matter. There was no immediacy about tabling this report and any such excuse is no more than a pathetic furphy. After the committee had determined to conduct public hearings, government senators simply failed to turn up and provide a quorum for such public hearings. The fact is that the government has ignored the sector for a decade now and the only time line imposed on the committee was one the government imposed upon itself.
One of the great tragedies we face in this chamber over the coming years is more of this arrogance and the effect it will have upon our democracy and public debate in Australia. There is a sad sense of indifference pervading the ranks of senators and members of the coalition. It is time they turned away from being mindlessly herded along by ideological zealots determined to destroy the Australian way of life.
The senators of the coalition parties might be able to delude themselves into thinking that ripping the heart out of the Australian way of life and violating the fundamental human rights of Australians is the way forward, but the Australian Labor Party does not. In our three recommendations included in the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee report opposition senators and the Labor Party clearly outline what this bill needs, but fails, to do. We must increase funding for public vocational education and training to address the skills crisis. The Commonwealth must stop behaving childishly and cooperate with the states in developing a new national framework for vocational education and training and rebuild a collaborative structure to fulfil the role of ANTA, and the government must desist from its absurd attempts to include regressive workplace relations changes with every piece of legislation it introduces. It is irrational and unproductive and distorts a debate which should be held over for another occasion.
Jenny Macklin, Labor’s shadow minister for education, training, science and research, put it best when she said in the House:
Despite the fact that over 70 per cent of public VET funding comes from the states and territories and less than 30 per cent comes from the Commonwealth, this government wants 100 per cent control. No doubt the minister for education will continue to accept zero per cent of the responsibility for any problems that arise.
And in that she is absolutely right. The Australian Labor Party oppose this bill in its current form and I urge government senators to join us in supporting our amendments to it. Should this bill remain unamended by Labor’s alternatives then it ought to be rejected. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,4,1,speech,00AOP,
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I rise to speak briefly to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Nettle to the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. I wish to indicate that, whilst Labor support many of the sentiments of most of that amendment and has made very similar criticisms long and loud over the government’s approach to and underfunding of training and its abrogation of responsibility when it comes to training, we cannot support the second reading amendment in its current form, in particular the blunt requirement to end the funding of private providers, which we think is inappropriate. Whilst we have been longstanding and strong supporters of TAFE, we recognise that private providers have a role in Australia’s training system.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I move:
(1)    Clause 12, page 11 (lines 22 to 27), omit paragraph (1)(b).
The basis of this amendment is to remove the requirement from this legislation for TAFEs to offer AWAs to their staff. There has been some discussion about this in the debate on the second reading. It is interesting that a government that promotes freedom of choice is in fact requiring employers at TAFE to put AWAs to their employees. It seems an extraordinary intervention into the management and functioning of TAFE. I wonder why it is that the government believes that it is appropriate for TAFEs to be required to offer AWAs to their staff.
This aspect of the legislation really demonstrates that this bill is, at its heart, not about improving the training of Australians. A very substantial aspect of this bill is the government’s extreme ideologically driven industrial relations agenda. It has tried, and continues to try, this approach at universities and now it is requiring it in TAFE. It is extraordinary that a government that calls itself a Liberal government—or a coalition government including the Liberal Party—and has previously had a tradition of liberalism and small government is prepared to use the funding levers of the Commonwealth to implement what is so obviously a radical and extreme ideological agenda. It is prepared to use the levers of Commonwealth funding to force its own view of what extreme industrial relations arrangements should apply in the workplace and to force those arrangements onto institutions such as universities and TAFEs. It seems that the government has forgotten that, despite nine long years of its vigorous advocacy of AWAs, we still have a situation where AWAs cover around 2½ per cent of the work force. It is quite clear that Australian employees and employers are voting with their feet when it comes to this issue.
What we find extraordinary about this aspect of the legislation is that, while on the one hand the government preaches freedom of choice and articulates in both its industrial relations legislation and its rhetoric the principle that the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting the relationship between employers and employees should occur at the workplace level—that is the rhetoric—on the other hand the detail of this legislation is that the government says: ‘TAFEs, if you want this funding, you’re going to have to offer AWAs, even if you have a cooperative collective agreement process in place, even if you have a tradition of collective bargaining and that is what you regard as the best way forward in managing your work force and the delivery of your services and even if that collective bargaining process has ensured better delivery of services to students and better staff satisfaction. Even if all those things are true, we are going to require you, on the basis of the funding we give you, to offer AWAs to your work force.’ It is an extraordinary impingement upon the rights of managers and employers within the TAFE system to make their judgments about what is the best arrangement to put in place with their employees. It is an extraordinary infringement of the rights of employees within the TAFE sector to determine that they ought to collectively bargain, that they want to go down the collective bargaining path and that they want to engage in a collective and cooperative process with their employer.
Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, AWAs are not, for the great part, advantageous to employees in terms of basic working conditions. AWA employees work six per cent more hours than workers under collective arrangements, and non-managerial employees on AWAs generally earn less than workers covered by collective agreements—around two per cent less on average. Most recently, in my home state of South Australia, we have seen an employee on an AWA—which was, in fact, approved by the so-called watchdog of the government, the Office of the Employment Advocate—who was earning 25 per cent less than the minimum award wage and had to give up sick leave and annual leave, I think it was, as well. That was the sort of exploitation of a young worker on an AWA that we saw. The fact is it is a similar type of exploitation that this government is trying to force upon employees of TAFE, and it is trying to do it over the heads of the management of the institutions. We say it is an extraordinarily authoritarian thing for this government to be doing—to be using its funding powers in order to impose this extreme agenda on the TAFE work force. And of course this is in the context of a government that has abjectly failed to tackle the national crisis that is our skills shortage. This is a government that has failed to properly fund vocational education in this country.
We have seen recently the AiG, which is not known for its pro-Labor partisan position, come out and heavily criticise the government’s skewing of its training agenda to areas which are not skills rich and which are not in skills shortage. It is just another example of the government being out of touch with the needs of industry and with the national challenge of ensuring we have a well-trained work force. Labor are intransigent in our opposition to the foisting of AWAs onto the TAFE work force. We do not believe it is appropriate for the national government to be using its funding powers to require certain industrial practices that are to the detriment of employees in the TAFE sector.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,00AOU,
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-08-17,"—The Greens will be supporting the amendment put forward by the opposition. As I spoke about in the second reading debate, we have extreme concerns about the way in which the federal government is using its capacity to fund a range of different organisations, particularly in education, and holding those organisations effectively to ransom by saying, ‘If you don’t implement our particular ideological bent on industrial relations, you won’t receive the funding that is required.’
It is a serious issue for the 1.7 million students who are currently enrolled in TAFE across this country to be told by the federal government, ‘You’re not going to get the funding that your institution needs in order to provide you with the vocational education and training that you require unless your institution implements this government’s own very narrow, ideological view about how the industrial relations environment should operate within your TAFE college or other vocational education and training providers.’ Putting these requirements onto the funding to ensure that the government’s own ideological view is implemented is not an appropriate way for the government to be administering funding. I have spoken about this already in my speech in the second reading debate.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-08-17,"—A number of things have been raised in the speeches on the second reading with regard to this amendment moved by Senator Wong. But, first of all, I want to refer to where speakers in the second reading debate claimed that the Prime Minister pre-empted the debate on the bill by announcing the closure of ANTA of 22 October 2004. It is only fair and responsible that the Australian government provide ANTA staff with certainty as to their working arrangements. The government could not really expect ANTA staff to work in a climate of uncertainty. For this reason, the Prime Minister announced that the ANTA functions would be transferred to DEST from 1 July, enabling the staff to make informed decisions regarding their future employment.
Regarding the questions raised in the chamber about New Apprenticeships, New Apprenticeships continue to provide an outstanding range of opportunities, especially for the 70 per cent of young Australians who do not go straight from school to university. Over half—57 per cent—of new apprentices in training are under 25 years old, and 382,400 new apprentices were in training at the end of 2004 compared with 143,700 in 1975. This is a 166 per cent increase in the number of new apprentices. Record numbers are completing training: 139,000 new apprentices finished their training in the 12 months to 31 December 2004—this is up 11 per cent from the previous year—and 92 per cent of new apprentice graduates said that they fully or partly achieved their main aim in doing their training. Eight out of 10 employers remained satisfied with VET providers.
Surveys of new apprentice and employer satisfaction with New Apprenticeships centres show that 92.6 per cent of new apprentices and 70.2 per cent of employers were satisfied with New Apprenticeships centre services. This government has continued to provide substantial growth in vocational and technical education funding. Since 1995 there has been a 48 per cent increase in funding under ANTA agreements. There has been an 83 per cent increase for the New Apprenticeships arrangements, including employer incentives, since 1999-2000.
The Howard government are committed to leading the training sector into the future. We are making a significant investment in training, including funding of $4.4 billion provided through the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill and a further $1.4 billion over four years, announced last year, for an integrated and comprehensive suite of new policies to maximise Australia’s skills. This lifts the Australian government’s contribution to vocational and technical education to a record $10.1 billion over the next four years and represents one of the most significant boosts to vocational and technical education ever undertaken by any Australian government.
With respect to the amendment that Senator Wong moved, the skilling Australia’s work force legislation requires states to introduce a range of workplace reforms in TAFE institutions, which deliver 85 per cent of publicly funded training. These reforms will help create a more flexible and responsive training system, which will benefit industry, students and the community. The national training system needs to be flexible and responsive to the needs of industry to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to emerging pressures on the Australian economy, such as skills needs, demographic change and changing employment patterns and industry structures. The Australian government cannot make the training sector more flexible and responsive to industry needs without reforming TAFE.
Implementing workplace reform in TAFE, including through more flexible employment arrangements, such as Australian workplace agreements and performance pay, will improve its responsiveness to local employer and industry needs. Implementing a fair and transparent performance management scheme in TAFE institutions will ensure that high-performance employees are rewarded, will allow TAFE directors to attract and retain quality staff and will give them the capacity to manage underperformance more effectively. The skilling Australia’s work force legislation only requires that TAFE staff be offered AWAs. Whether staff choose to work under individual or collective arrangements will be a matter for each staff member to decide. The priority for the Australian government is that TAFE staff be given a choice of working arrangements. We will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,LI4,
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I recognise that Minister Patterson is suffering from a bit of a cold today, but it seems extraordinary that in reading her prepared response the minister ignored the fundamental contradiction that lies at the heart of my question and of the issues put by Senator Nettle. On the one hand, this government preaches freedom of choice—it tells us that we need this extreme industrial relations agenda in order to ensure that the primary decision making about terms and conditions of employment is at the workplace—but, on the other hand, it is telling a group of employers that they are required, even if they do not want to, to offer AWAs to staff.
Even if the employers are in the midst of negotiating whatever version of the collective agreement that they have been under for some time, even if they are in the midst of negotiating important productivity increases and other changes through the collective process and gaining the cooperation of their staff, the government want to come along in a heavy-handed way, stick their boot in the middle of those negotiations in order to impose their extreme agenda and say: ‘We don’t care that you’ve actually been working cooperatively and you want a collective agreement. We’re going to require you to offer an AWA.’ What an extraordinary example of the disparity between this government’s rhetoric around freedom of choice and their actual agenda! You preach freedom of choice, but when you are able to use the funding mechanisms of the Commonwealth to impose this extreme agenda, that is what you do. Freedom of choice goes out the window and you say to people, ‘You will offer these, even if your position previously has been to negotiate collective agreements and to do so in a cooperative way.’
Nothing the minister has said today and nothing that has been put by any of the government senators in this chamber on this legislation explains this contradiction, this enormous gap between the rhetoric of freedom of choice and the reality of what you are imposing on the TAFE work force. It is the same gap between rhetoric and reality that characterises your industrial relations changes. You talk about freedom of choice—what it means in practice is the ability of some employers to exploit vulnerable workers. As always, we have this enormous gap between what the government say they are doing and what they are actually doing.
The minister—and it was not particularly on point to my question, but she is obviously entitled to make her contribution as she sees fit—also gave a stout defence of the government’s record on training. That is her job, clearly, but you do not need to go very far to see the range of institutions, individuals and organisations who have been condemnatory of this government’s failure to put in place a proper, sensible training agenda for this country that deals with the national challenge of ensuring we have a skilled work force relevant to the needs of Australian industry. Heather Ridout from the AiG said in the AFR:
... the skewing of incentives to the cheaper traineeships had contributed to the skills shortages in the traditional trades.
In other words, the skills shortage that everyone from the Reserve Bank down has been talking about has been identified not just by Labor but by a significant employer industry group as being contributed to by the poor design of policy by this government. The article in the AFR continued to quote Ms Ridout:
“Incentives should be targeting skill-rich qualifications, not biasing the training system to lower wage and lower skill traineeships that frankly employers should be funding themselves,” she said.
“The fact we have such skills shortages in the traditional trades has been mainly due to the fact that the effort has been in the wrong direction, or we haven’t been training enough.”
That is a pretty significant condemnation of this government’s policies. What it says is frankly what Labor have been saying for some time: the skills crisis has been created by nine long years of this government’s refusal to tackle the emerging skills needs in the economy and the skewing of funding of traineeships to areas where there was no skills shortage and little future skills need. The balance has been all wrong. And it is not just the Labor Party saying this; it is employers as well. They understand that this government has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to ensuring that we have a work force that is trained for the current and future needs of Australian industry. Labor will continue to press this amendment. We do not see why a Commonwealth government can utilise national funding arrangements to impose their radical and extreme industrial relations agenda onto employees in the TAFE sector.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,00AOU,
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-17,"—I want to address this amendment briefly. Participants in this debate know well that there are four sorts of agreement present in the workplace. The first category is that of industry-wide agreements, known as awards. About 20 per cent of the population fall under those. The second category is that of certified collective enterprise agreements, both union and non-union. I think about 35 per cent of the working population fall under those. The next category is that of statutory individual agreements, known in federal law as AWAs, Australian workplace agreements. There are about 500,000 of those, but of course the states also have a variety of statutory individual agreements as well. The fourth and largest category is that of common-law agreements, invariably individual agreements. About 40 per cent of the working population fall under those.
The Australian Democrats believe that that variety of agreement making should remain. We are extremely strong supporters of having statutory individual agreements in workplace regulation and legislation, whether it is at the federal or the state level. One of the reasons we are strong supporters of individual agreements is that we believe that the statutory provisions provided on that basis will nearly always be superior to common-law agreements, which in law, regrettably, are principally based on master-servant type attitudes, philosophies and precedents. So we think that, where individual agreements are to apply in the workplace, statutory instruments as a protective device are in fact a good thing.
One of the problems we have consistently had with Labor’s approach to individual agreements is not their preference for collective agreements but their rejection of the idea that individual agreements are a necessary and advantageous instrument for workers and employers to use. They do provide the means for flexibility with respect to individual circumstances of both employers and employees while still preserving an underpinning safety net of wages and conditions. The confusion in Labor’s ranks is apparent in the variety of conditions underpinning their individual statutory agreements at the state level.
Having stated our strong and broad support for individual agreements as one category of agreements, we also adhere to an additional principle: freedom of association—freedom to join or not join a union—and the rights of employers and employees to bargain according to their own needs and the recognition of the particular individual circumstances that pertain in that workplace. It automatically follows, therefore, that if you are a supporter of enterprise bargaining—and every time I stand on such issues I give Labor great credit for the introduction of the 1993 reforms which introduced that form of necessary flexibility to our system and which the coalition, to its credit, supported and developed further in 1996, supported by the Democrats—and if you accept that principle, and I note that all parties accept that there should be enterprise bargaining between employers and employees, then you have to leave them alone to do that against the underpinning principles that are provided in the law.
I note Labor only oppose one clause out of the six clauses in the government’s provision. Labor are saying that government should be true not just to the law as it stands but also to the principles accepted by this parliament—that employers and employees are entitled to arrive at the provisions that meet their sense of what is necessary. If the government had put in their legislation that an employer may not refuse to offer individual agreements or may not refuse to offer collective agreements, we might have some sympathy with that position. What you do not want is that, in the bargaining position, people do not have access to the full range of possibilities—namely awards, both union and non-union collective agreements and individual agreements. But the government have gone in a completely different direction. They are saying, and it is equivalent to a form of extreme coercion: ‘We won’t give you money unless you make sure that individual agreements are offered and insisted on.’
That is just unacceptable. It goes completely contrary to the 1993 legislative changes, which were supported by the coalition and the Democrats, and to the 1996 changes, the principles of freedom of association and the flexibility that we specifically want enterprises and workplaces to have. The fact that a TAFE might be a public sector institution or organisation is irrelevant to the principle. I get disturbed, frankly, when I see the government shift from what I think are fundamentally important principles: firstly, support for the range of agreements that exist—awards, collective agreements and individual agreements—and, secondly, the principle of allowing the enterprises and the employers and employees concerned to bargain against the workplace law which is established.
That is why the Democrats are going to support Labor opposition to this. It is not because we think AWAs are close to pacts with the devil. We recognise that there are problems with AWAs and that duress or coercion is being improperly applied in some circumstances and is contrary to the law. We recognise that, in some respects, the provisions of AWAs could be strengthened, not weakened. We are not against reform of AWAs, but we are not against AWAs. We support them as individual agreements. We support statutory instruments. What we do not support are circumstances where the government seeks to violate the very principles on which its previous legislation and its conduct have rested. So we do not think you should be putting these sorts of provisions in and attachments to your funding offers.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,3M6,
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I thank Senator Murray and the Democrats for their indication of support on that. I suggest to the chamber that Senator Murray got it right when he said that this is a form of coercion. The government are imposing conditions and requirements on workplaces in return for funding. I indicate clearly that Labor will not be supporting this legislation if this amendment fails. We will not be party to a government using government funds—that is, taxpayers’ money—to impose an extreme agenda on a particular sector of the work force. We do not think that is an appropriate way for a national government to act. Like Senator Murray, we say to the government: if your rhetoric is freedom of choice then that runs completely counter to this provision. From our perspective, this is an important amendment, without which Labor cannot support this bill.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,00AOU,
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-08-17,"—I apologise for Senator Patterson’s absence. She has had to depart. I will briefly respond on behalf of the government to the contributions made. I thank and support Senator Murray for his clear support for AWAs. At least we know that the Democrats do support the right of individuals to be employed under AWAs. It is always difficult to work out exactly where the formal opposition—that is, the Labor Party—stand on AWAs. They send mixed messages. At least the Democrats’ position is clear, but I am disappointed that that support for AWAs is not sufficiently strong to enable the Democrats to support this particular provision in this bill and that they will be joining with the confused opposition in opposing it.
All I can do is restate that I think the opposition is misplaced. I think it perfectly reasonable and certainly not extreme for the government to require TAFEs simply to offer their staff the option of an AWA. TAFEs should be doing that anyway. It would be pretty outrageous if they were not to offer their staff AWAs. All this bill does is ensure that such an offer is made, and it is entirely a matter for the individual staff as to whether they choose to work under an AWA or not. It is just ridiculous and damaging to the credibility of the opposition to claim that such a proposition is extreme—their new favourite word for our government. It is not extreme at all to ensure that staff at TAFEs do have the opportunity to choose whether or not to work under an AWA. The government strongly oppose the amendment proposed by the opposition.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-08-17,"—I move amendment (1) standing in my name on sheet 4647:
(1)    Clause 4, page 6 (line 3), omit “the States and industry”, substitute “the States, industry and training providers”.
As I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats think that the government has overlooked an important acknowledgement of the critical role that training providers play in the overall delivery of vocational education and training. The purpose of an objectives clause in a bill is to explain how the legislation will implement the desired policy outcomes. Clause 4(b) states that one of the objects of the act is:
to promote a national approach to the delivery of vocational education and training through collaboration and cooperation between the Commonwealth, the States and industry;
When you look at the bill, this is in fact not reflected there. The statement is not about who is developing the policy, it is about who will be involved in promoting a national approach to the delivery of vocational education and training.
We would argue that training providers are integral to such an approach because they are the ones who, in partnership, develop curriculum and deliver the service. It seems pretty straightforward to me. So we argue that the early involvement of training providers should ensure that all parties’ needs are met, that flexibility can be built into the system and that policy is informed by those who are closest to the delivery of that service. So the effect of this amendment is simply to include in clause 4, page 6, line 3 ‘the states, industry and training providers’ instead of ‘the states and industry’.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,1M6,
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-17,"—Can I say at the outset that the opposition clearly support a national approach to training. In fact, one of our primary criticisms of the government has been that it has not taken a coherent approach and involved the states and territories sufficiently in developing a relevant, flexible and world-class training agenda.
I want to make a brief comment on this issue. I think in one of the speeches in the second reading debate there were some comments made by government senators suggesting that Labor state governments had been consulted on the proposed changes. It is clear from the information provided to us that Minister Hardgrave did write to the states indicating this legislation was coming, but, despite his promise that they would see the draft before it was tabled, the bill was introduced into the House before the states received copies of the legislation. Minister Hardgrave wrote to the states in a letter dated 11 May which enclosed a copy of the bill, but obviously that was not received by the states until the 13th or thereabouts. That is the level of consultation that this government are bringing to what they say is a national agenda but is frankly something they have dreamed up and are imposing on state governments and TAFE institutions.
I indicate that, while we clearly support consultation with and the involvement of training providers, we do not think it is appropriate for the amendment moved by Senator Allison to be supported. That is a view about what should and should not be in the legislation. Labor’s position is that, clearly, the training system primarily serves the states and industry, and providers are the delivery mechanism. We do not see that it is necessarily appropriate to refer to them in the objects of the legislation. Nevertheless, we do think it is important that providers are consulted in the context of ensuring that the national agenda proceeds appropriately.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,00AOU,
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-08-17,"—The government does not accept this amendment, and I appreciate the remarks by Senator Wong on behalf of the opposition to that effect as well. The issue relates to who should be providing advice on the skills development and training needs of industry; clearly, that should be industry. The whole point of this structure is to ensure that the role of industry is central to that, so that our training system is responsive to the needs of industry. Training providers do have an important role, of course—and we are not trying to downgrade that—but their role is recognised by their position in relation to the National Quality Council, which is responsible for quality assurance of course delivery and service delivery. We think this is an unnecessary and unhelpful amendment for those reasons and we oppose it.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,JX4,

So I am not sure what point you are seeking to make and, as I say, you are trying to integrate the training providers into a context in which we are talking about the sort of advice that is being sought on the needs of industry.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-17,"—At the request of Senator Allison, I move the Democrat amendment on sheet 4635 revised:
(1)    Page 26, after clause 40 (after line 5), insert:
40A  Accountability for advertising expenditure
         (1)    Money appropriated by section 40 must not be expended for any public education or advertising project in relation to the Commonwealth-State Agreement for Skilling Australia’s Workforce or any like-program established under this Act, where the cost of the project is estimated or contracted to be $100,000 or more, unless a statement has been presented to the Senate in accordance with this section.
         (2)    The statement must be presented by the minister to the Senate or, if the Senate is not sitting when the statement is ready for presentation, to the President of the Senate in accordance with the procedures of the Senate.
         (3)    The statement must indicate in relation to the proposed project:
              (a)    the purpose and nature of the project; and
              (b)    the intended recipients of the information to be communicated by the project; and
              (c)    who authorised the project; and
              (d)    the manner in which the project is to be carried out; and
              (e)    who is to carry out the project; and
               (f)    whether the project is to be carried out under a contract; and
              (g)    whether such contract was let by tender; and
              (h)    the estimated or contracted cost of the project; and
               (i)    whether every part of the project conforms with the Audit and JCPAA guidelines; and
               (j)    if the project in any part does not conform with those guidelines, the extent of, and reasons for, the non-conformity.
         (4)    In subsection (3), Audit and JCPAA guidelines means the guidelines set out respectively in Report No. 12 of 1998-99 of the Auditor-General, entitled Taxation Reform: Community Education and Information Programme, and Report No. 377 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, entitled Guidelines for government advertising.
Since the early 1980s, the Australian Democrats have campaigned for more controls and more consistency with respect to government advertising and information, based on a very strong public and principled opposition to any misuse or potential misuse of taxpayers’ funds with respect to government political advertising. All governments—not just this coalition government but state, federal and territory governments—have been guilty at times of using taxpayers’ money for what is judged to be overt party political purposes. Under the coalition government, the scale and cost of government advertising have escalated remarkably. A notable achievement and result of the Democrats’ campaign occurred back in 2003 when, with Labor support, we successfully moved a Senate order to enforce tougher controls on government advertising. This was a notable step towards enhancing Australian democracy, as it went some way towards trying to restore public confidence in our institutions of government.
It is important for the chamber to note that this amendment is in the names of both the Leader of the Australian Democrats and the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate. Labor stand shoulder to shoulder with us in recognising that the original 1995 guidelines should be superseded by much stronger guidelines, because of the way in which modern politics is being conducted and the way in which incumbency is being used in an improper manner.
Disappointingly, the coalition government has, rather contemptuously, I thought, refused to comply with the Senate order. I use the word ‘contemptuously’ deliberately because it is defying a Senate order. It is a defiance of a considered Senate position, which has been supported by two very responsible and competent studies of the matter—namely, the Auditor-General’s report and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit report. The Senate order stated that the details of each advertising or public information project must be tabled in the Senate and must cover: the purpose and nature of the project; the intended recipients of the information to be communicated; who authorised the project; the manner in which it is to be carried out and by whom; whether the project is put out to contract and, if so, whether such contract was let by tender; the estimated or contracted cost of the project; and whether the project meets established guidelines and, if not, the extent of and reasons for the nonconformity.
I draw the chamber’s attention to appendix 1 of the Auditor-General’s report No. 12, which contains sensible and reasonable guidelines for government advertising. It is not just a question of the government saying, ‘We want to take a different view of some of those things.’ It has actually rejected the entire package. That is just utterly unreasonable. If the government is, at any time, to consider that it needs to improve the reputation it is getting for being unaccountable, it needs to address the inadequacy of the current guidelines.
The underlying principles espoused by the Auditor-General’s report and supported by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit governing the use of public funds for government information programs are that it should allow the public to have equal rights to access information in relation to government policy or programs which affect their rights or entitlements. It also allows governments to legitimately use public funds for information programs or education campaigns to explain government policies and programs in order to inform the public of their obligations, rights and entitlements. It is sometimes wrongly said and wrongly thought that the non-government parties are opposed to any government advertising. That is not true. We all support government advertising and information, but we want it to be done with respect to proper and principled guidelines.
The guidelines are outlined as follows. Firstly, material should be relevant to government responsibilities. In developing material to be communicated to the public, it is suggested that the subject matter should be directly related to the government’s responsibilities, that an information strategy should be considered as a routine and integral part of policy development and program planning and that no campaign should be contemplated without an identified information need by identified recipients based on appropriate market research.
Secondly, material should be presented in an objective and fair manner. The guidelines are suggested to assist in determining whether the material communicated is presented in an explanatory, fair and objective manner. It states that information campaigns should be directed at the provision of objective, factual and explanatory information. Information should be presented in an unbiased and equitable manner. Information should be based on accurate, verifiable facts, carefully and precisely expressed in conformity with those facts. The recipient of the information should always be able to distinguish clearly and easily between facts on the one hand and comment, opinion and analysis on the other. When making a comparison, the material should not mislead the recipient about the situation with which the comparison is made. It should state explicitly the basis for the comparison.
Thirdly, material should not be liable for misrepresentation as party political. The guidelines under this heading recommend that information campaigns should not intentionally promote or be perceived as promoting party political interests. Material should be presented in unbiased and objective language and in a manner free from partisan promotion of government policy and political argument. Material should not directly attack or scorn the views, policies or actions of others such as the policies and opinions of opposition parties or groups. Information should avoid party political slogans or images.
Lastly, it sets out guidelines to ensure that the distribution of sensitive material should be controlled. Care should be taken to ensure that government advertising material is not used or reproduced by members of political parties in support of party political activities without appropriate approval. All advertising material, and the manner of presentation, should comply with relevant law including broadcasting, media and electoral law. Materials should be produced and distributed in an economic and relevant manner, with due regard to accountability. No information campaign should be undertaken without a justifiable cost-benefit analysis. The cost of the chosen scale and methods of communicating information must be justifiable in terms of achieving the identified objectives for the least practicable expense, and existing purchasing and procurement policies and procedures for the tendering and commissioning of services and the employment of consultants should be followed.
The extent of this government’s contempt of the intent of these guidelines is more recently demonstrated by the $20 million workplace advertising campaign. Even in government terms, this is a large campaign. That latest egregious act is the prompt for the amendment before us, because we think it is time to say, ‘Enough is enough.’ Prime Minister Howard claims that this campaign is entirely proper as it informs the public of government intentions and that it is quite legitimate to explain policy in advance of legislation being introduced. The Democrats strongly disagree. Clearly, it is aimed at countering some very effective advertisements from the unions by softening up the public before the legislation is introduced.
The advertisements are based on the ideological policies outlined by the government. I heard Senator Ellison say in the chamber the other day that if you refer to the matters as being ideological, he is proud to have that ideology because that represents his beliefs—and that is the point. The advertising does represent the government’s beliefs. It does not represent legislation that has been passed by the parliament of Australia and is law. Once that legislation is passed and is law, the government is perfectly entitled to communicate the outcomes of that legislation, subject to the kind of guidelines outlined in the Auditor-General’s report.
We believe the principle is simple: after parliament passes a law and provides the money to support that law, it is right and proper to use taxpayers’ money to inform Australians of associated government services. However, before that occurs, any government proposal is just that: it is a proposal that is to be debated, often at length, by the government and political parties. We do not include in that approach any prohibition on the government, for instance, preparing material in substantive form to argue its case. If you have to produce white papers in advance of a project or books such as those that accompanied the new tax system proposals, with the modelling, cameos, tables and graphs that were included, that is quite proper because that develops the material substantively. It develops it in detail. It is a contribution to informed debate. It is not sloganeering, half truths and contracted presentations of an issue to fit into a 30- or 15-second electronic advertisement or a one-page newspaper advertisement. It is quite plain that the IR advertising that has been put before Australians does not exhibit the full range of material that they would need to know about with respect to legislation which the parliament has not even seen and does not even understand at this time.
Clearly, there are endless forums available for the government to make their case. They have the power of incumbency and the huge resources of the bureaucracy to assist them in presenting their case. That is all that should be available. Quite frankly, you can imagine what it is like for anybody opposed to such government initiatives. The coalition are dealing with political parties, community groups or corporate groups which have much fewer resources and less material at their beck and call. Just as Labor, the Democrats and others rely on the media to get their viewpoint across, so too should the government. As private organisations the unions, in this case, were perfectly entitled to advertise their point of view. If their message must be countered, let business organisations set about doing so. Or is it true that business thinks that a government that has its hands in the taxpayers’ pockets is also in their pockets?
All we are asking for is compliance, so that the controversy surrounding the often blurred line between legitimate government and political advertising and information is addressed. But as compliance has been—and, it appears, will continue to be—absent, the Democrats and Labor will continue to put this proposition before the chamber to ensure that people know that we disagree with the way in which government advertising and information is presently approved through the committee process that is in hand and through the 1995 guidelines, which are way out of date.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,3M6,
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-17,"—This amendment was circulated jointly by the Australian Democrats and Labor, in the name of Senator Evans, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. We believe this is an extremely important amendment, and it is a matter of principle for the Labor Party. One of the many lows that we have seen in the nine long years of the Howard government has been its preparedness to raid taxpayers’ money for the purpose of funding its own propaganda campaigns. It has been extraordinary and unprecedented in the level of expenditure it has allocated out of taxpayer funds to run its own advertising campaigns for political purposes. Unchecked, this tendency continues, and will continue, to undermine our democratic system.
We have seen over the period of this government millions of dollars, around $900 million since 1996, spent on government advertising, much of it on campaigns which were clearly political and about the government articulating its political ideas and beliefs to the Australian people. Clearly, the government is entitled to do that. What the government is not entitled to do is to use its privileged position in government to channel taxpayers’ funds, public funds, into its own propaganda campaign.
We have seen the ‘Unchain my heart’ ads for the GST—which were not about information but about arguing for a GST—which cost around $119 million. Then, just before the last election, who could forget the Medicare ads? How many millions of dollars were spent on the Medicare ads telling Australians how wonderful the government was going to make the Medicare system? When the government was asked about this, what was its response? The Prime Minister and various other ministers said that people were entitled to know what their new entitlements were going to be under the changes. We now know that the rock solid guarantee that was given in relation to Medicare is no longer rock solid; in fact, it represents one of the most significant broken promises we have seen since the election—
—Like ‘no advertising’.
—I was about to say that, Senator Allison. That broken promise has clearly changed the entitlements of the Australian consumers under Medicare. Do we see a similar advertising campaign from the government saying: ‘By the way, you are not entitled to as much as we told you’? Where is the campaign on that, Minister? We are not going to see it, because it does not suit your political purposes. It is okay before an election to spend a lot of taxpayers’ money on telling people what you are going to do for them. Then, when you decide you are not going to do it for them, you do not spend any money telling them that. You could at least be consistent. If your principle is to tell people what they are entitled to, why aren’t you telling them what they are no longer entitled to because you have broken a promise? The extent to which this government is prepared to raid taxpayers’ funds for its own propaganda campaigns in a whole range of areas is a new low in Australian political history.
Labor have stood with the Democrats in trying to insert some accountability into this process. We have previously sought to ensure probity, transparency and proper standards when it comes to government advertising. We had a 2004 election commitment to legislate for all government advertising to be measured against guidelines recommended by the Auditor-General. Let’s see if the government matches that. Are you prepared to accept Labor’s election commitment to have Auditor-General guidelines in relation to government advertising?
Opposition leader Kim Beazley has previously put forward a private member’s bill, the Government Advertising (Objectivity, Fairness and Accountability) Bill, in order to try to address this important issue and to try to insert some accountability for the expenditure of public funds. Now we hear the government saying, ‘We want to spend $20 million of Australian taxpayers’ money on telling them what we want to do to their industrial relations system.’ As Senator Murray pointed out, they are entitled to do that, through the media, just as the Labor Party has to. If you want to fund advertising campaigns, like the ACTU has, you are entitled to do that. But you are not entitled to use taxpayers’ money to fund what is nothing more than a blatant attempt to put your beliefs out there about how the IR system should look. It is not an information campaign. It is simply countering a groundswell of concern in the community about how extreme your industrial relations agenda is and how harmful it will be for Australian families. That is what you are concerned about.
Instead of doing what political parties ought to do, which is to argue the case, you want to use taxpayers’ money to fund an advertising campaign. And you do it in a way that absolutely avoids accountability to this parliament. This was not an aspect of the appropriation bills. As the committee would be aware, there is in fact a legal challenge to the expenditure of that money on an advertising campaign. What an extraordinary indictment of this government that it thinks it can defend in the High Court the use of public money to fund what is nothing more than a blatant propaganda campaign because it thinks it might be on the back foot when it comes to people’s views about workplace relations. I await with great anticipation the government’s advertising campaign on its broken promise when it comes to Medicare and telling people they are not to going to get as much as they were told before the election, but somehow I think I will be waiting a fairly long time.
Labor’s view is that government advertising should be regularly reviewed by the Auditor-General, which has not happened under this government. In fact, there has been only one Audit Office report on government advertising, at the request of the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. I think Senator Murray referred to the report, which noted:
There are no Commonwealth guidelines or protocols on information and advertising campaigns … covering matters such as distinguishing between government and party-political advertisements, the distribution of unsolicited material and conduct of campaigns in the lead up to an election … It is not a matter that officials can duly decide for themselves … History shows it is not uncommon for Government advertising to increase in the period immediately preceding an election.
And didn’t we see that prior to the most recent election?
Labor support this amendment because we do want to require government advertising to meet minimum standards of objectivity, fairness and accountability. In particular we want to prohibit advertising by government that promotes party political interests. We consider it appropriate that advertising take place only after government policy has been approved by the parliament—a point that Senator Murray made in his contribution—and we absolutely consider it appropriate that there is greater transparency in appropriations for advertising, so that we do not have a situation where the government can make its own political decision to use moneys without having to ask the parliament for authority to expend public moneys in this regard.
Can I make it clear that, obviously, some advertising is often appropriate when it comes to ensuring people are aware of different entitlements that they have or to encourage them to take up opportunities that are available to them. For example, clearly Labor would not be opposing expenditure on public education which aims to encourage more young people to take up apprenticeships. That would be an appropriate use of public moneys in the context of this legislation. What we are opposed to is the consistent habit of this government of picking up taxpayers’ money and throwing it at an advertising campaign to suit its own political purpose. We support the Democrats amendment.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,00AOU,
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2005-08-17,"—We always listen to Senator Murray with great interest. Sometimes we agree with him and sometimes we do not; but he always puts his case in a moderate and consistent fashion. This probably will not surprise Senator Murray, but, after careful consideration, we find ourselves unpersuaded by the arguments. I will make a couple of observations on Senator Murray’s comments before I deal with Senator Wong’s.
I point out to Senator Murray that all money appropriated under the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill goes to the states and territories. The ministerial council, which is made up of all states and territories as well as the Australian government, may decide to reallocate some of the money back to the Australian government for projects under strategic national initiatives. I am advised that any advertising campaign that uses money appropriated under the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill would need to be endorsed by the state and territory governments through the ministerial council. That should provide some comfort to Senator Murray. It is therefore hard to see how this proposed amendment that has been put forward by the Democrats and the Labor Party would add any value to the bill. The collaborative decision-making process ensures that all jurisdictions are accountable for the money spent under the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill. That is the government’s position, Senator Murray, and you will deduce from that that we will not be supporting the amendment.
I listened carefully to Senator Wong’s arguments. I think Senator Wong sometimes comes to this chamber thinking that it is year zero, but she belongs to a party with a long history and a party that is in government in six states and two territories. When we leave Canberra we all go home to our states and regularly see advertising put out by state Labor governments. From my experience in Victoria, the state Labor governments seem to have no real guidelines on what they can advertise. I have an interesting test for Senator Wong, who comes in and attempts to lecture this government. Senator Wong, I will be looking at what occurs at the next state conference in South Australia and, given your particular passion for advertising and rules, which were never applied in the 13 years when your government was in power in Canberra—

Senator Wong interjecting—

—Senator Wong, I listened to you in silence and I expect to be listened to in silence when I am making my points. Your party was in government for 13 years here, and all of us have long memories of how your government behaved. We do not behave in that fashion. We note how state Labor governments are behaving right around Australia. This will be an interesting test for Senator Wong. Senator Wong has lectured us, so, at the next state conference of the South Australian Labor Party, I will be checking what motions she moves on advertising. Under the Labor Party rules, the state conference can instruct the parliamentary party. I will be interested to see whether Senator Wong evinces the same enthusiasm and passion for this issue as it applies to her state Labor government as she does for the rules that she seeks to apply to the Australian Liberal-National Party government.
I am going to take a particular interest in this test because we on this side of the chamber are a little bit tired of people like you, Senator Wong, on your side pretending that the Labor Party has no history. The history of the Labor Party on advertising apparently starts with you. You have a state government that advertises and can be instructed by your state council. I will be checking to see what instructions you and all the other Labor people who have spoken on this issue give at their state conferences.
In relation to the general issues of government advertising, this has been a matter of very long debate in this chamber. Some issues were raised by Senator Wong about the ANAO and JCPAA proposals. They have been discussed and debated. Our colleague Mr Georgiou raised the point that virtually anything can be interpreted as party political. Even seemingly innocuous and bipartisan campaigns can be the subject of political controversy.
For example, and this example has been quoted, doctrinaire pacifist parliamentarians could claim that something as accepted as Defence Force recruitment is party political because it reinforces a view of Australian defence, our armed forces, which is at odds with their own. Another seemingly innocuous example is the Tough on Drugs campaign, which carries an overtly anti-marijuana message. There may well be some parliamentarians who support the decriminalisation and use of that drug. That could be seen to be political although, to be quite frank, it may meet a bipartisan test that many in this chamber would strongly support.
Let me draw the committee’s attention to a statement made in this chamber by Senator Hill on 12 February 2004. It is well worth looking at by those that feel that, since this matter was raised by Senator Wong, they would like to explore this issue further. Among other things, he said:
The government has not adopted these guidelines and continues to observe the ‘Guidelines for Australian Government Information Activities’ that were adopted by the previous government in February 1995.
Senator Wong lectured to us, and I made the point that Senator Wong’s Labor Party were in government for 13 years. We know that if they had been in government for a 14th year all these things would have been done. It was the great tragedy for Labor that they never made it to that 14th year because all the things that they keep telling us to do would have been done in that year! Senator Hill went on to say:
The government continues to support a broad approach which allows detailed scrutiny and accountability but avoids duplication and unnecessary complexity and cost. Therefore our position is that the existing levels of scrutiny should continue and will be underpinned by the former government’s 1995 guidelines in relation to implementing government communication activities
So there we are. Senator Wong has got up and she has lectured to us and evinced a degree of passion about this issue and her strong commitment to it. She never addressed the issue of what Labor did in power. She never addressed the issue of the 1995 guidelines. Notably missing in action from Senator Wong’s remarks was what state Labor governments do, and particularly what her state government does in South Australia. I give notice to the Senate that I will be looking at the speeches that you make on this issue, Senator Wong, at the next state conference of the Labor Party in South Australia and I may well get up on an adjournment and make a comment about your remarks or, more likely, your lack of remarks.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,WW4,
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-17,"—The minister’s contribution really follows a longstanding practice of this government: when you are confronted by an argument you cannot meet, go the low road. Have a go on a personal level: make me the issue. I am quite happy to be the issue, Minister. I have to say it is an indication of how junior your portfolio is and how little work you have got if you are going to spend time looking at Labor Party state conferences. But, if you have not got anything better to do for the Australian people in your portfolio, be our guest. Read the minutes of all the Labor Party state conferences. I will tell you what the test actually is: will you support this amendment and will you match Labor’s commitment that we gave at the last election to bring some accountability and regulation to government advertising? The minister says, ‘She didn’t say what Labor would do in government. That is the test.’ The Labor Party made that clear. We had an election commitment on that issue, not matched by this government. That is the test.
The minister wants to play personal games in the chamber and have a go at me and threaten me—I am so terrified by this!—with the prospect of an adjournment speech from him and threaten me with scrutinising Labor Party conference minutes. If you think that is your job and you have not got anything better to do with your time as a minister of the Commonwealth, go right ahead, Minister, because the Australian people understand that the test is what you say you will do in government and what you do in government, what you do in this chamber. What you will do in this chamber, as has been indicated, is you will vote against this amendment. What you are doing in government is trying to again use taxpayers’ money to fund your propaganda campaign on industrial relations. What you did prior to the last election was to use public funds to put your propaganda campaign on Medicare—which you are not matching now when it comes to telling people that you broke that promise and their entitlements have changed. That is the test, Minister, and we on this side have no doubt that your government will continue to fail it.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,00AOU,
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-17,"—That was a good, strong debating response from the minister to the proposition before us but it did what good debaters do, and that is avoid the central issue and take the attack elsewhere. Everyone in this chamber knows that Labor has supported changes to laws that it strongly defended in its period of government, because the world moves on and there are new circumstances and new situations. We do not condemn Labor or indeed the coalition for changing laws which they supported in the past. That is the point: the world has moved on.
The Labor government in 1995 responded to legitimate and strong pressure from the coalition, who were in opposition at the time, and the Democrats to lift their game and to introduce advertising guidelines which had not applied before. But the fact is that those guidelines are inadequate, and the terrible thing is that they are not even observed. I sit as deputy chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee and we are entertained there very frequently—not often enough by you, Minister—by interchanges between those conducting the estimates inquiry process and those defending their position. One of the things we have established through questioning is that in fact there is no sign-off of those guidelines. After every information or advertising campaign is concluded, through that committee, which has a varying membership, as the chamber knows, individual ministers come in whose department’s or agencies’ advertising is subject to that committee’s approval. But there is no sign-off at the end; nobody signs that a program is actually in accordance with the 1995 guidelines. Those 1995 guidelines are probably observed more in the breach than otherwise.
The fact is that the test is exactly what Senator Wong has put to you, Minister. The test is whether you support improving the guidelines that you already have. If you reject the propositions put to you by the Joint Public Accounts and Audit Committee and the Auditor-General then come back to us with an alternative. Don’t just stick with the 1995 guidelines, which have been identified as inadequate and poor. It is no good saying that in theory everything could be regarded as party political. That is like saying that, because self-defence is a legitimate argument or because you have to defend your country when it is invaded, you should not have any laws about murder. Of course there are occasions when you have to determine principles and make judgments. Remember that the guidelines still leave it up to the executive to make the decision. They do not say that parliament has to make the decision on those matters; they say that the executive will continue to make the decision but we want them to make the decision against proper principles. The government has accepted that approach very well in areas as important as, for instance, tendering processes and procurement processes. There are areas where guidelines exist which are extremely well presented and supervised.
So the test, Minister, is not whether you should defend yourselves with respect to the proposition that you are acting improperly; the test is whether you recognise the substance of the argument—and that is that the 1995 guidelines are inadequate and do not meet the circumstances and needs of modern government. You are quite correct, of course, to say that state governments should follow the lead of the federal government. That is exactly why we would like to see you set an example. We do not disagree that the game should be lifted in state governments. Some state and territory governments are better than others; some are worse than others. But this is about federal law and federal expenditure which, when I last looked, was reaching $1.4 billion, I think, in this arena over the last 10 years. That seems to me an amount of money that is deserving of far greater accountability than we have at present.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,3M6,
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2005-08-17,"—I of course listened carefully to Senator Murray, as we always do. Senator Murray makes a number of points. The advice I have is that the guidelines you are talking about, Senator Murray, the ANAO and JCPAA guidelines, are unworkable for the reasons which I explained in my earlier remarks. At the end of the day, we have to have things that are workable and we remain unconvinced of the proposition that you are putting. In relation to the substantive part of your remarks, I pointed out in my earlier response the processes as approved and the sign-on required. I note from Senator Wong’s remarks that she is fairly sensitive. Senator Wong likes to be able to dish it out in this chamber, but when people respond to Senator Wong—
—And you don’t?
—I don’t. As you know, Senator George Campbell, I am a very consensus-style senator.

Senator George Campbell interjecting—

—You can never accuse me of that, Senator Campbell. I am very happy to have that on record. Senator Campbell said I could never be accused of being aggressive and of being sensitive. Thank you for that, Senator Campbell. I appreciate the interjection. Senator Wong has enlightened us that people should not worry at all about what goes on at a state Labor Party conference. Gee whiz! That was an interesting observation. I just hope that the members of the South Australian Labor Party accept that view, Senator Wong—that it is completely irrelevant what goes on at state Labor conferences and no-one should worry about it and no-one should read about it. The only point I make to Senator Wong is that this debate will certainly continue. I have been through the substantive points that Senator Wong has made. It is interesting to see Senator Wong’s great interest in this particular matter and it will be interesting to see what happens in South Australia. Senator Wong, despite your somewhat unfortunate personal reflections, I shall be looking very closely.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Allison’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech,WW4,
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-08-17,"—The Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1997 to make significant changes in the governance infrastructure of Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission. Labor is supporting this bill because it is an attempt to fix at least some of the many problems in real service delivery under this government that have been exposed.
The changes in this bill are the abolition of the governance boards of both Centrelink and HIC, the Health Insurance Commission; the replacement of the Health Insurance Commission, an authority with separate legal personality to the Commonwealth, with a new body, Medicare Australia, that will form part of the Commonwealth; the creation of two chief executive officers, CEOs, of Centrelink and Medicare Australia, with statutory functions; and the establishment of new governance arrangements, under which the CEOs will be directly accountable to the Minister for Human Services.
The changes will also mean that employees of the two bodies will be covered by the Public Service Act 1999, which will provide them with generic employment rights and obligations. In addition, both will be prescribed bodies under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, which provides an accountability framework for the management of resources.
These changes made by the bill are part of the government’s response to the Uhrig review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders—a report which was brought down late last year and which, I think, did not receive the public attention it should have because of the timing of its conclusion. The fact that these changes are being made signifies the failure of the governance structures of Centrelink and the HIC to provide, both currently and over the last nine years, effective accountability for all of us as citizens of Australia.
The governance boards of Centrelink and the HIC have not been in a position to provide solutions to the real failures in management systems and service delivery. However, the boards provided a buffer and a dilution of the responsibilities and accountability for the Howard government ministers. This bill should change that. Labor supports these changes as they may go some way to addressing some of the serious problems that face the customers of the agencies.
I am one of those people who can remember when the Centrelink board was being set up. To my shame, I can also remember—just vaguely—the set-up of the HIC, which was over 20 years ago. That almost reflects some of my Public Service experience. But I will concentrate for this part of the discussion on the Centrelink board. There was such heralding of the changes that were going to take place and what was going to be brought into place in the brand-new arrangements in 1997. The board, amidst other things, was going to provide transparent accountability and be part of the new world that we were entering at the time. What we are finding out is that the new world is probably not that much different to the past world, and in fact those promises about better and clearer accountability were not fulfilled by the structural changes or by the enormous amount of PR that was expended at the time when Centrelink was created.
I am a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. As I have said before in this place, that is a committee that I value deeply and was very keen to join. There have been a series of Auditor-General’s reports that reflect on governance in both Centrelink and the HIC and the key issues that this particular bill is attempting in some way to address. I will just mention a couple of the reports, because there are so many. I urge people who are interested in this issue to go back and have a look at the Auditor-General’s reports, because not only do they expose things that have not been working; they make clear recommendations for the agencies to follow. In every case, the agencies tend to say, ‘Yes, we will do it. We accept that these things should be done better and we will make the changes.’ The problem is that you cannot just keep on saying that. At some stage, real change has to occur. But I will for the sake of this debate mention a couple of the Auditor-General’s reports about the operation of governance.
I will start with Centrelink. Auditor-General’s report No. 34 of 2000-01 found 49.1 per cent of claim forms were not fully completed in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Auditor-General’s report No. 26 of 2001-02 found 20 per cent of applications for payments contained errors in the key proof-of-identity process. Recently, Auditor-General’s report No. 32 of 2004-05, on Centrelink’s customer charter, one of the key elements of the accountability of that organisation, found that the charter failed to provide any measurable standards.
Auditor-General’s report No. 34, also of 2004-05, was on Centrelink’s complaints-handling system. This is a personal favourite of mine. There has always been a process in Centrelink and in its predecessor agency, the Department of Social Security, to look at customer complaints, because that is how you have a responsible public sector and that is how you improve your service. All of these Auditor-General’s reports go directly to the issue of governance in the agency. That Auditor-General’s report on Centrelink’s complaints-handling system found a lack of customer knowledge of complaints avenues, it found that Centrelink clients feared that they would face discrimination and retribution were they to lodge complaints, it found a lack of any guidance or procedures for Centrelink staff to communicate with customers about the organisations complaints processes and it found a lack of follow-up procedures to deal with the risk of discrimination against complaints. That last finding particularly bothers me because it shows that once an issue had been identified there was no internal process to effectively follow up. To me, that is a key plank of governance.
All of these issues go to the process of effective operation. Indeed, up until now, with the proposal that is before us, the board of Centrelink was reviewing these recommendations that were made. That was part of the accountability process. One of the findings that particularly interested me in that recent audit report was to do with misleading presentation of information about complaints in annual reports. That is a fairly strong statement. The annual report is another key mechanism of accountability that all of us as citizens have to consider how public sector agencies and agencies that are linked to the public sector such as Centrelink and the HIC currently are working. You should be able to go to the annual report—and those of us who are of that bent do go to annual reports—to have a look at what is happening in agencies. But the audit report indicates that the actual complaints mechanisms and the numbers were not clearly spelt out in that process. An expectation that we should be able to have is that when you do take the effort to read about what is going on in agencies there should be accurate information in the annual report for those people who want to ask the questions: ‘Is this the best way that our money should be spent?’ and, because we are talking about service delivery agencies: ‘Is this the best, most responsible, most responsive way to get service delivery in our Australian government?’
The Auditor-General has also raised serious concerns about the administration of the Health Insurance Commission, including relevant recent revelations, which received wide media coverage, that up to 500,000 Medicare cards were out in the community somewhere, probably being held by people who are no longer alive. Maybe that is a way of ensuring you get effective health services! Nonetheless, the audit report indicates that there could be a significant number of Medicare cards—which, as we all know, have integrity in the community and are used as a means of ID; if you have a Medicare card you can use it quite confidently to prove your identity—that do not have integrity, and not only do not have integrity but reflect on the overall governance and integrity of the agency.
The audit reports should not be seen as punitive. The role of audit reports is to inform and, as I previously said, to indicate what can and should be done better. Then the agency involved—and, up until the probable passing of this bill, the boards of the HIC and Centrelink—would consider the recommendations and make a response. When you read the audit reports, you see that there is a standard structure: the issues are identified, recommendations are made and the organisation is given the opportunity to respond. In each of these cases, the organisation has had to admit that the audit reports were accurate and what was needed then was a response that the organisation would go back and make things better. The audit reports point to a failure by the government to effectively manage service delivery for the many millions of Australians who each year access the services delivered by the agencies—in this case, Centrelink and the HIC.
Over the last, long period of time—I will say over the last nine long years—the government has faced issue after issue in its delivery of social policy in the country. In attempting to neutralise the damage, there have been significant ministerial reorganisations and restructuring. The very creation of the Department of Human Services, under which Centrelink and the HIC now operate, was widely heralded as a new way to perform business. It was an attempt to look at key service delivery agencies and create a barrier between service delivery agencies and those which develop policy. That was one of the key components that was heralded by the government when the Department of Human Services was set up. When the Prime Minister announced the new administrative arrangements in October last year he said:
The new department will ensure that the development and delivery of government services is placed under strong ministerial control with clear lines of responsibility through the Secretary.
This new process would more effectively give confidence to the Australian community that they would have responsive service delivery, that their issues would be considered and their voices would be heard in the development of effective policy on one hand, through the policy department such as the Department of Family and Community Services and also the Department of Health and Ageing, which develops the policy, while those agencies which are clearly delineated as service delivery agencies would now come under the umbrella department, the Department of Human Services.
The intent of this—and I think it is the intent of the legislation we are debating today—is to continue to focus on keeping those areas separate and also, as a response to the audit report, to get rid of what they call artificial boards and actually have ministerial accountability through the CEO. The CEOs will have new arrangements in terms of focusing on their responsibilities. People in the community or people who work in the agencies probably will not see a great difference in how these things operate. There are currently CEOs in both the HIC and Centrelink. They are the key figures of the bureaucracy for the people who are there, but the expectation of this change is that the link with the minister will now be much more direct, because the boards will be removed. I am not sure whether the boards felt they were cosmetic for the last several years that they were in operation; nonetheless, they have been removed by this process.
There is an intent that, down the track, at some time there will be a new board which will be part of the human services department. Perhaps we will see, as that is created and people are appointed to it, the lessons put in place that have been learnt since 1997 in Centrelink and longer through the HIC. What must be ensured by any decision is that the people who are using the services understand the services and can feel confident that they are getting what they deserve to have out of the service delivery agencies.
In this place we have talked many times about the problems that have occurred in Centrelink with the shemozzle—I am not sure that that is the technical term, but it is a safe term—in the delivery of the family tax benefit over the years: the debts, the letters that have gone out and the concern caused to families. It does interest me that we are now debating a piece of legislation to make the service delivery more accountable by removing the boards in the HIC and Centrelink. In my office, where we see so many people coming to talk about issues they have with Centrelink and to a lesser extent, although we still see them, with HIC services, the issue of the board is not one that the community raises very often.
People come to my office mainly with complaints. I wish there were more who said, ‘I think we are getting really great service from Centrelink,’ or ‘We’re getting really great service from other agencies.’ When people come, they are seeking help. We see people who indicate that they feel that they are not valued or respected. We see those who have a degree of fear about approaching Centrelink officers or getting into the call centre processes where they feel that they cannot get their issues heard effectively or get to the nub of the issue. We see people who receive letters that threaten them, saying that they owe several thousand dollars and they have to make retribution as quickly as possible. When they come to parliamentary offices and express their fear and when we sit with them as they are sobbing, in some cases, worried about what is going on, the issue of whether there is a board in Centrelink is not one that is raised very often.
Labor are supporting this legislation. It is indicating that the government is being responsive to some concerns that have been raised. But it is in the context that the concerns that people have with the way Centrelink is operating, the way the HIC is operating and the way that, under its new guise, Medicare Australia will be operating, are not actually to do with the board process. They are to do with making sure that the governance of these agencies is effective. They relate to ensuring that complaints-handling systems are effective. They are to do with ensuring that the staffing levels are effective. One of the things about the new arrangements directly linking the minister and the CEO is that linkage with financial accountability. We consistently hear that people are worried about the length of time they have to wait to get their calls answered in a call centre in both the HIC and Centrelink. They are concerned about the length of queues when they go to offices of these agencies. They are worried about the way the forms operate. They want to ensure that they are seen as human beings and not just numbers. The CEOs are the hubs of accountability, and they are the hubs of effective service delivery.
If in some way this bill can improve those processes, it will be a good result, but we are urging the government not to end the changes with just passing this legislation. If you are going to genuinely look at the issues that are confronting service delivery in these two areas, look at the issues of staff numbers, staff satisfaction and training. Look at the issues of job security in these areas so that the people working in the two agencies feel confident, trained and effective in providing services that we as Australians should have. If that occurs then maybe we are on the right track and the messages of the audit reports will be responded to. It is not enough to just wipe out two boards.
At this stage, I want to acknowledge that the people who have been serving on those boards have probably done so with absolute integrity and with genuine commitment to the jobs they are doing. I am in no way making negative comments about the people who are working in these agencies. What I am saying is that maybe the actual internal functionings of these organisations should be considered more closely as opposed to just considering how many people are on the board.
We have had so much fanfare about better, safer and more effective service delivery. I think that what we need to have is some confidence in the community that these things will occur. When that confidence is re-established, service delivery will be effective, but not until then. As I said, Labor will be supporting this piece of legislation. We are also supporting ongoing change so that the real issues that are coming up can be addressed and we are seeking cooperation so that transparency and accountability can be openly assessed and so that we are able to work to ensure that there is a re-establishment of an effective public sector. As an old public servant—and I mean that as someone who is getting mature and who also worked in the Public Service for a long time—it is wonderful to see that we are now clearly putting back the effective public service delivery expectation into the public sector and that now HIC and new Medicare Australia staff will be returned to the Public Service from which I think many of them left over 20 years ago. I commend the legislation so that we can start on a new age in accountability.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech,00AOQ,
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-17,"—The Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 does a range of things, but it basically goes to the heart of governance arrangements for a couple of key human services agencies at the federal level. The major things the bill does are: abolish the governance boards of Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission; replace the Health Insurance Commission, which currently has a separate legal structure from the Commonwealth, with a body called Medicare Australia, which will be folded back into the Commonwealth directly; create chief executive officers for Centrelink and Medicare Australia with statutory functions; and establish new governance arrangements for those CEOs to be directly accountable to the minister. It all sounds very good. It sounds very technical. It does not sound very fascinating, but Centrelink and Medicare are agencies that impact on millions and millions of Australians, so it is very important to assess whether or not these changes will actually improve things for the people of Australia or make things more difficult.
The background to the legislation goes back to the government’s 2001 election manifesto, when the coalition parties claimed that the reform of the Public Service ‘has been a major achievement’. The word ‘reform’ is used in all sorts of curious contexts these days, and I guess it depends on where you are coming from as to whether it has been a major or positive achievement. They did indicate at the time that, in their next term of government, they would look at statutory authorities and office holders with regard to that so-called reform. Certainly, once some in the business community started jumping up and down and complaining that they were not getting a fair deal from the Competition and Consumer Commission, particularly from its then chair, Mr Allan Fels, the government decided to move on this issue. It is interesting that the Prime Minister chose to announce the review of corporate governance of Australia’s statutory authorities at the get-together of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The emphasis of the review was on a select group of agencies with critical business relationships, notably the tax office, the Competition and Consumer Commission, the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Reserve Bank, the Securities and Investments Commission, the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink. It is those last two organisations that are captured in the legislation before us today. It is curious that that focus happens to be on the human services bodies rather than on the financial bodies on this occasion.
After announcing the review, the Prime Minister said some statutory authorities are:
 ... not directly accountable to ministers, they’re only accountable to the Parliament in a rather theoretical way. In practice, they’re not.
He also said that it is a good idea that everybody else is properly accountable. I could certainly point to examples where those bodies could be more accountable to parliament. Senator Moore has highlighted some of those, but she has also highlighted ways in which they are quite clearly accountable to parliament to a significant degree. One of the concerns I have is that, in promoting the goal of being more directly accountable to ministers and to the government, the issue of how well they are accountable to the parliament might be seen as secondary. One might suggest that, from the Prime Minister’s point of view, as long as they are more accountable to him and his ministers, their being less accountable to the parliament might not be such a problem for him. As always, these things will not be able to be fully tested until the legislation is put in place, by which time, of course, it is a bit late to reverse things.
Of course statutory authorities should not be able to escape accountability from anybody, including the parliament, the government or, most critically, the people, but we do have to consider what the Prime Minister’s main driving concerns were when he argued about inadequacies and accountability. As Paddy Gourley pointed out in his article in the Public Sector Informant, Commonwealth statutory authorities do have to operate within the framework of relevant government policy as well as the legislation. They are accountable to the Auditor-General and subject to a raft of the administrative law, including freedom of information. They must provide annual reports to the parliament and regularly submit themselves to the interrogations of estimates and other parliamentary committees, such as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit that Senator Moore mentioned, which does sound like a fascinating committee. I am upset that I have not had the excitement of serving on it, but I think Senator Murray might be on that one. I am sure that, because of the fascinating issues before it, he would cling to that committee with his cold, dead hands rather than be dragged away from it, so I will just have to stand in line in that case, unless the Labor Party wants to open up a position for the smaller parties. The point I am making is that there is a reasonable degree of accountability. It is accountability after the fact, but accountability nonetheless.
The Canberra Times columnist Verona Burgess suggested that the Prime Minister’s comments might indicate a desire by the government to bring agencies to heel and to put key government industry regulators under the direct control of ministers. In his second reading speech on this legislation in the House of Representatives Minister Hockey said:
... these agencies need to move closer to government to ensure that their daily operations deliver the outcomes that government and taxpayers expect.
He also said that it is important that the organisations be brought under strong ministerial control. There are two aspects to that. Firstly, one of the issues that undoubtedly is still to play out is the question of which minister will have control of which things. We have already seen some turf wars, since the creation of this human services ministry, over which minister is responsible for what, and also over why they have that control. Given the concept of separating the policy side from the service delivery side, I can understand why there is a determination to get the service delivery right, but I can very easily see a situation developing where there will be lots of finger pointing going on every time there is a stuff-up. The people doing the service delivery will say, ‘The problem is because the policy is no good,’ and the people doing the policy will say, ‘The policy is great; it’s just that people are not delivering the services properly.’ When you add to this ministers blame-shifting and avoiding, I can foresee that this might actually lead to less accountability, and certainly less responsibility, when those lines of who is ultimately responsible become blurred.
If you look at this new culture of public service—the reformed public service, under the Howard model—and look at the example of the immigration department, you will see a department which is a complete debacle from top to bottom—something virtually admitted to by all government ministers. Yet, somehow or other, the minister is not responsible. Public servants are responsible; somehow they have got a bad culture in there, and all these public servants have gone all bad. But it was not the minister’s fault; it was not the government’s fault. It is as if the government is saying, ‘We will just shift a few people around and promote the secretary of the department and that will fix it all,’ as if somehow or other the minister was not actually responsible for any of that.
There have been heaps of criticism—quite rightly, I might say—in my home state of Queensland of the state government and the hospital system there. The state of the health area there is equally a debacle. One could not expect the eminently loyal Queensland Labor servant, Senator Moore, to agree to that fact, but I think it is nonetheless clearly the case that the state Labor government in Queensland is making a total mess of the health system. But at least the minister, after a bit of prompting, said: ‘Okay, I acknowledge it is a mess; best we get somebody new in; I will take the blame and I will shift on. We will get someone new in.’ At least we had that recognition of responsibility. Sure, it is partly due to political factors, but partly it is a recognition that you have to take some responsibility when things get to a certain degree of messiness, and that responsibility is the minister’s.
If we are going to be pulling these agencies closer to government and closer to the minister, as Minister Hockey suggested, then I hope that also means that the minister will be responsible, directly and personally, when things stuff up, rather than saying, ‘This is a service delivery problem and that is someone else’s issue.’ That is a concern I have with this.
Dr Ian Holland, in his article looking at the Uhrig review that was the catalyst for this legislation, examined what he saw as some of the missed opportunities that were represented there. He pointed out that there has been a trend since the early nineties towards increased ministerial control over the activities of statutory authorities—and there certainly can be legitimate reasons for ministers directing statutory authorities. But, as he pointed out, it is possible that there is a relationship between this tighter government control and directing of regulators in a political sense, and directing of the public service and a declining trust in government, as political direction and service delivery in an impartial sense do not always go hand in hand.
There will always be some tensions between the various aspects of our system of government and nobody disputes that, but does this necessarily mean that they should be done away with and that public opinion and specialist advice should be ignored? Dr Holland also detailed what he saw as some flaws in the Uhrig inquiry, particularly that it did not consider what direction to take for governance of statutory authorities. It also avoided examining the governance of highly autonomous statutory authorities; it incorrectly assumed that a legislative framework protects the operational independence of a statutory authority, and it paid no attention to overseas experience or models of governance. Stephen Bartos considered that the report barely addressed questions of ethics; nor did it address the role of statutory authorities in managing, in particular, political risk.
The level of consultation involved in the review process has also been criticised. The criticism was that it used a very targeted consultative approach with no call for public submissions or public hearings; did not adequately take into account the existing wisdom on these issues that had accumulated through earlier inquiries or reports—including, I might say, reports from parliamentary committees, such as the aforementioned Public Accounts and Audit Committee, the Senate finance committee and some state inquiries.
So it certainly seems that there is a lot of apprehension about the adequacy and breadth of the review that has led us to this point with the legislation here today. Without going on in great detail about some of the problems with the way the review was conducted in relation to this particular legislation, perhaps what is of most concern is that it did not examine some of the worrying issues that have emerged in the interaction of ministers and statutory authorities over the last few years.
Instead, Minister Hockey stated:
Our 20 million customers have little regard for sectoral and bureaucratic differences. Instead they just expect the government to deliver services in a timely, efficient, cost-effective and easily understandable manner.
And that is true. I am sure most people, when they are dealing with Centrelink and Medicare, probably do not mind, as long as they get what they are entitled to with a reasonably minimal degree of fuss and hassle.
Indeed, Minister Hockey’s customers probably do have little regard for such differences when they are being customers. But, more broadly, as citizens they would see the need for those in charge of delivering services, whether a board or a CEO, to be able to perform their roles with objectivity and even-handedness, understanding that they are not there to serve just the partisan interests of the appointing minister.
I know it is the modern jargon for Centrelink and other agencies to call people ‘customers’. Back when I worked for its predecessor, the Department of Social Security, I think people were called ‘clients’, although being social workers we had a different viewpoints of people, perhaps from some of the other staff. This notion of shifting people from being ‘clients’ to being ‘customers’ is all part of some new, modern approach to things. Being a bit of a traditional conservative, I am not into these newfangled modern ways but I am happy to give them try. However, in considering people as customers of departments like Centrelink, we should not allow that to obscure the key principles that are involved when dealing with legislation like this, which is also about governance.
When people are thinking as citizens of Australia about how our public sector should be operating, they certainly believe it should be operating in an impartial way, not in a way that could be misused for partisan political interests. I have no doubt that is also the view of Australia’s 20 million citizens. That might not be the first and foremost thing in their minds when they just want to make sure they get their Medicare refund, but it is when they are thinking about our Public Service being effective. That goes to the amendment that I will be moving in the committee stage. I will speak to it then, but that is about trying to ensure the appointment of these CEOs on merit rather than fostering the perception—or the reality, for that matter—of jobs for the boys. I think that is a key part of addressing that issue and indeed that principle of ensuring that these bodies operate in a non-partisan way. Meritorious appointments are the essence of accountability.
The replacement of the two governance boards by two individual CEOs will obviously mean that fewer voices will have input and provide advice on the delivery of these services and improvement proposals in human services. The government has indicated that at the appropriate time it will establish a Human Services Advisory Board. As far as I know, though, there is no information on when this will happen, how people will be appointed—whether we will have independent appointments on merit or the board will be stacked with political mates—or what the precise role of the advisory board will be.
While this legislation focuses on Centrelink and Medicare Australia, there are actually six agencies under the human services umbrella. As pointed out back in May in the Financial Review, there is room for turf wars between the portfolios related to these six agencies to the extent that relevant ministers had sought legal advice on what their powers would be under the new portfolio structures.
Despite the Prime Minister’s and Minister Hockey’s talk of greater accountability, this is an attempt to split the bureaucracy between the parts that develop policy and the parts that implement policy, such as the delivery of service and welfare payments. It can be seen as having some merit but it does also raise the question of whether that split will create more opportunities for people to fall through the cracks between the two parts. The ministers responsible for policy development will no longer be responsible necessarily for what happens with the policies they develop. As I mentioned before, they may be able to point to a failure and just blame it on the way it was delivered rather than on the policy itself. They may also be required to pay less direct, on-the-ground attention to the impact of those policies. Presumably, these agencies will now have the reporting requirements for two departments, one for policy matters and one for service delivery, and the CEOs of these agencies will be reporting to a department secretary who then reports to a minister, thus allowing the secretary to be the one who takes the blame when things go wrong. Again, I point to the recent example within the immigration department.
So there are very big question marks about the potential consequences of this bill. As with any new structure, a lot will depend on how it is implemented on the ground, in practice, and on the motives and genuine intent of the government and the individual ministers responsible. That is something that can be speculated on, as I have, but it is not something that can be guaranteed or pointed to with absolute certainty, not least because ministers—and even prime ministers—can change and that can therefore change the implementation of changes like these on the ground. But there are serious concerns and there are genuine questions, and they should at least be acknowledged by the government and the relevant ministers as things that have to be taken into account, even if it is only from the point of view of disproving them by directly addressing and countering them. That is something that we will continue to watch as these changes evolve.
I have a question for the minister to respond to when he replies. Minister Hockey said this bill addresses 20 million so-called customers—certainly, Centrelink and Medicare between them would cover pretty much everybody who is an Australian citizen and/or resident. My question is: has a family impact statement been prepared for this legislation? We have heard lots of noise about these family impact statements that will be prepared for significant pieces of legislation to assess the impact they will have on families. Obviously, the government will say this bill will have a good impact. But the point of those statements, as with separate financial impact statements, is to indicate that the impact on families has specifically been considered and that any impact is of sufficient seriousness to detail independently. I am not sure there would be many bills in this place that would have an impact on a larger number of Australian families than this bill, so I would ask where the family impact statement is and, if this is a bill in respect of which such statements do not apply, perhaps we could have clarification on when and where such statements are going to appear.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech,DT6,
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-08-17,"—The stated aims of the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 to resolve the service delivery problems, improve corporate governance and develop clear guidelines on reporting accountabilities are worthy goals. While I am keen to see improvements in the delivery of social services, I am concerned that the means to this end put forward in this bill both undermine community consultation and increase direct political interference in the governance of the organisations involved. I am concerned that the recommendations of the Uhrig inquiry, which form the basis for this bill, were critically flawed in a number of ways. I believe that the report failed to consider what direction to take for the governance of statutory authorities. It did not take into account the relevant experience of governance models from overseas. In fact, more critically, it incorrectly assumed that a legislative framework protects the operational independence of a statutory authority. As a result, we are faced with a bill that undermines the operational autonomy of these statutory authorities.
The changes made by this bill would place the power to appoint, direct and control the CEO of Centrelink and the CEO of the proposed Medicare Australia, which is the successor body to the Health Insurance Commission, or HIC, directly in the hands of the Minister for Human Services. I am concerned that this is a recipe for political interference from an executive that does not want too much decision making devolved too far down the line.
Another critical flaw of the inquiry and this bill relates to community consultation, something that I consider to be of paramount importance in the delivery of human services. The community consultation undertaken by the inquiry itself was sorely limited and narrow in its horizons. This legislation will result in a huge reduction in the contribution and value of community consultation. It will see the scrapping of the existing six community representative boards, each of which is comprised of community members who have experience and expertise that are of direct relevance to the statutory body they inform. Their replacement will be one single board comprising just six people. Given the seriousness of the issues involved, I believe this proportion is patently ridiculous. How can we expect one board of six people to contain the wealth of relevant knowledge and experience necessary to cover the broad range of issues being brought together within the new Department of Human Services—DHS? How can it possibly encompass industry and community representatives from the very different sectors being brought together in this one mega-organisation?
Let me remind the Senate that DHS will be replacing Centrelink, the HIC, the Child Support Agency, Health Services Australia, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and Australian Hearing. Clearly, these organisations that are being amalgamated deliver a range of very different services to quite distinct sectors of the community with a very wide range of differing needs. The dissatisfaction of the community with the responsiveness of these agencies to client inquiries is well known and we have all heard the horror stories, particularly in regard to Centrelink. These organisations have been accused of being unnecessarily bureaucratic and inhumane. Urgent steps are needed to provide these institutions with a human face; steps which will not be achieved by the formation of a megalithic megadepartment. This is not a reflection on the people who actually work for these agencies; it is a reflection on the agency philosophy.
There is a real danger that the proposed new structure will mean that the Department of Human Services will become increasingly out of touch with the very communities to which it is meant deliver services and the industries with which they interact. Taken together with the measures to increase executive control over the CEO by the minister, I believe we are faced with a chilling picture of an organisation more capable of and interested in meeting the needs of the minister and government than the needs of the community it is supposed to be serving.
I believe that the delivery of services is of critical importance. I believe that, for appropriate services to be delivered efficiently and effectively, there is a pressing need for more input and feedback from the industries and communities involved. Public participation in the political process and policy development is a key part of a healthy democracy. A healthy democracy requires open channels of communication between government departments, agencies, industry and community sectors, not a reduction in these channels. I think that we should resist at every opportunity any moves which increase the powers of ministers to direct and control the activities of statutory authorities at the expense of their ability to meet the pressing needs of the communities they serve.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech,E5Z,
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I too want to speak on the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, which we know is aimed at bringing accountability for human services back to the government. In that regard, it is a welcome piece of legislation, given concerns about the Howard government’s failed vision for Centrelink and the obvious need for greater accountability of the government’s statutory authorities. I hope that it leads to a significant improvement of the present human services muddle. The bill seeks to address the ongoing mismanagement of the accountability processes applicable to 20 million Australians through Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission. After nine long years, the government’s HIC and Centrelink boards are to be axed. The HIC will become Medicare Australia and a raft of new government arrangements are being put into place to make those organisations directly accountable to the minister.
The government have finally recognised and admitted that the system they established to oversee these important agencies has failed and they are taking some responsibility for trying to fix the mess that they created. This bill is outstanding in that it may be one of the very few examples over the next three years where responsibility is being taken. We have already witnessed the government attempting to abuse their new-found powers in the Senate to further diminish their accountability to the Australian public: firstly, by reducing the number of opposition questions during question time; secondly, by moving to curtail the powers of Senate estimates committees to investigate government departments; and, thirdly, by the expected denial of the referral of matters that the government might find uncomfortable to Senate committees—and aren’t there a few of those! It is certainly unlikely that, for at least the next three years, we will see another inquiry into a certain maritime incident or perhaps an inquiry into the Regional Partnerships program. It certainly will not happen. This government are well aware of their mismanagement in some very serious portfolio areas and have absolutely no interest in being held accountable for what they have done. I welcome this bill because it might at least hold this minister to account for what happens in the future.
During what might be called a rare moment of insight in November 2002, the Howard government commissioned a review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities, known now as the Uhrig review. The terms of reference required an examination of the relationships between statutory authorities and the responsible minister. The Uhrig report was finally released on 12 August last year, and it made serious criticisms of the administrative structure set in place by the government to preside over Centrelink and the HIC. It also raised important accountability and transparency questions about the operations of other government agencies.
The review noted that a key characteristic of a board is its full power to act and its responsibility to do so, including such actions as appointing and terminating the CEO. The Uhrig review of the governance arrangements for statutory authorities found:
... a number of opportunities for improvements.
The report stated:
There is a lack of effective governance for several of the authorities considered by the review due to several factors including unclear boundaries in their delegation, a lack of clarity in their relationships with Ministers and portfolio departments, and a lack of accountability for the exercise of their power. This lack of governance arises primarily due to a ‘hands off’ attitude assumed by many when dealing with statutory authorities. This situation is often further complicated by the presence of a board, particularly those where it is impractical for government to provide the full governing powers required to be effective.
In the face of Centrelink and HIC failures in management systems and service delivery, their boards were quite simply never in a position to act. The report stated:
Where a board has limited power to act, its ability to provide governance is reduced and its existence adds another layer, potentially clouding accountabilities. Given the nature of government, the circumstances in which a board can be given full power to act are going to be rare and are most likely to be limited to those authorities which are commercial in nature.
In other words, the boards merely provide a buffer and a dilution of responsibility and accountability for this government. The Uhrig review noted that in such circumstances it was unlikely that good governance would prevail. It stated:
Where statutory authorities are failing to perform adequately, the electorate will expect governments to act.
Funnily enough! After eight long years of this policy, the government finally accepted the failure it created and responded by establishing the Department of Human Services. The department, which was formally established in December 2004, has oversight for six agencies: Centrelink, the Health Insurance Commission, the Child Support Agency, Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service Australia, Australian Hearing and Health Services Australia. Accordingly, the new minister announced that the agencies’ boards would be abolished in order to establish a more direct ministerial role in their operation. This abolition of the agencies’ ineffectual boards is a key component of the bill before us today.
This legislation provides an opportunity to put a spotlight on the minister and to hold him accountable. For this, Labor wholeheartedly supports this bill. But Mr Uhrig’s analysis regarding the governance of Centrelink and the HIC went beyond the issues addressed in this bill—that is, to the purchaser-provider arrangements used to fund the agencies. I urge the government to seriously consider the comments made in the review. By way of background, a purchaser-provider arrangement is when an agency is funded through purchasing agreements with other government agencies to provide services on their behalf. This arrangement is in place for both Centrelink and the HIC. The report stated:
The main issue for governance is the extent to which these arrangements affect the way those responsible for governing the organisation work towards ensuring its success. For Centrelink and the HIC, success is considered to be the efficient and effective delivery of specified services. The issue for the review to consider has been the extent to which the purchaser/provider arrangements impact on the governance of the organisation ...
The review went on to argue that the perceived benefits of a purchaser-provider arrangement are not to be found. The report stated:
It is the assessment of the review that there are considerable resources being consumed in managing the purchasing agreement with very little or no benefit.
Finally, the report found:
From a governance perspective, the review was not able to identify a net benefit in the use of purchaser/provider arrangements for services being delivered within a portfolio due to the lack of purchasing power of the portfolio department.
My question today is: why has the government chosen to ignore this recommendation? This is clearly an area where the efficiency of these agencies could be improved. It is clearly an area that requires reform. With the savings, I suggest, Centrelink and Medicare might be able to reopen some of their offices in rural and regional Australia.
The reports have commented on the systematic failures that Australians have been living with. So what are the results of this failed governance? The answer is: generally, a community that is both frustrated and angry. The Auditor-General has exposed in a series of reports a number of deficiencies in the operations of Centrelink and the HIC. Recently, the Auditor uncovered major problems in Centrelink’s complaints handling system which are clear impediments to improving the services provided to Centrelink’s customers. Audit report No. 34 2004-05: Centrelink’s Complaints Handling System found a series of serious and damaging incompetencies, ranging from Centrelink staff being given no guidance on how to advise customers on the complaints process, to customers feeling that they would be discriminated against for making complaints and failures to adequately report on or record complaints. The report also found that someone searching on the Centrelink web site to make a complaint would be hard-pressed to find the complaints procedures.
Clearly, Centrelink’s complaints handling system needs to be dramatically improved if the system is to be more responsive to its customers. It is also hoped that, under the new arrangements, the CEO will initiate improvements as a matter of urgency. I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, from personal experience that my electorate office in Goulburn is inundated with problems that people are having not only with the Department of Human Services agencies but also with trying to make a complaint. My office is constantly asked by people to help explain why a decision has been made and how to appeal, should an agency decision not be acceptable to them.
I know that the Centrelink staff are dedicated and do a difficult job. It is the failure of the management systems put in place by this government that is putting the staff under so much pressure and causing the difficulties and complaints that we are hearing from the community all the time. By the time the constituents turn to us for assistance, they are often incredibly stressed and desperate. The Department of Human Services deals with areas very close to the hearts of people: issues relating to their income support, their health and their family relationships. So it is paramount that the systems in place within the six agencies allow for accurate, efficient and sensitive administration. It is quite obvious to me that there have been systematic failures regarding each of these criteria. If the system was working, we would not be receiving the volume of complaints that we do.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech,00AOS,
"Senator EGGLESTON,",LP,2005-08-17,"—In recent months we have witnessed calls for a debate on nuclear energy in Australia. Formerly, nuclear energy was something of a pariah when one talked about the question of energy generation, but it is undergoing a rehabilitation of sorts. On the Labor side, the former Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, has called for a reopening of the debate, and he has been joined by prominent environmental activist and Labor MP Peter Garrett—
—For a day.
—Yes. Although, when he outlined his views on nuclear power, he also made it clear that he was opposed to nuclear plants—which is a strange, double-dutch kind of approach. Many other people, including Labor’s primary industries and resources spokesman, Martin Ferguson, have spoken of the need for us to consider the nuclear power option. On the Liberal side, the Prime Minister and also the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, have added their voices to calls for a debate. I must say that I suggested in a speech in 1997 that we as Australians would need to reconsider our position on nuclear power before long, and it seems that the time for this reconsideration has now come.
Nuclear energy produces virtually no greenhouse gases, and concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and climate change have provided the impetus for this new-found interest in nuclear power. Australia has witnessed a substantial increase in electricity demand over the last 20 years, with annual increases in demand of over 44 per cent between 1980 and 2000. More recently, electricity demand in this country has more than doubled. It is projected that electricity demand will increase by at least 50 per cent over the period to 2020 and that most growth in demand will occur in eastern Australia. This will necessitate investment in large-scale electricity generation projects; and, given the concerns about greenhouse emissions, it is not unrealistic that we should consider nuclear power as an option for providing for this need for increased electricity generation.
In Australia electricity production from coal, which represents some 78 per cent of our electricity generation, represents the largest source of stationary greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, it accounts for one-third of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The combustion of coal produces large amounts of greenhouse gases. In the year 2000, the combustion of coal produced 186 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. The energy white paper Securing Australia’s energy future states:
While advances in technology are significantly lowering the emissions intensity of new coalbased electricity plants, they remain the most emission-intensive form of electricity in widespread use.
Given that, we cannot continue down the path of being so heavily reliant on coal in a world where greenhouse emissions are increasingly a matter of concern.
In Australia we have eight per cent of the world’s coal reserves and 40 per cent of the world’s uranium reserves. At the moment, rather than utilising this uranium to generate greenhouse gas-free power ourselves, we are exporting it to other countries so that they can generate electricity and thereby have a lower greenhouse emissions profile than would be the case if they made use of fossil fuels. Rather quixotically, this particularly applies to the European Union where, but for nuclear power, few of its older members would have met their Kyoto greenhouse emission targets. Some of these countries, especially Germany, are prone to be quite critical of Australia’s reliance on coal for energy generation—although they themselves use Australian uranium in nuclear power generation.
Natural gas, hydro, wind and solar are all able to produce electricity with a lower greenhouse signature than coal, but there are impediments to their expanded utilisation, and those were identified in the white paper. Some of the impediments are as follows. Gas reserves are located away from major electricity markets and would require additional pipeline and shipping capacity to bring them into full utilisation. In Australia, we have very few mountains, and even fewer with snow-capped tops, so there is very little scope for additional hydro, particularly given community attitudes to damming rivers and flooding valleys. Wind and solar are intermittent and, at times, affordable means of generating power. However, storage options still need to be developed, and there are still technical problems with the generation of large quantities of solar power. For Australia this is something of a pity, because solar is the most available source of renewable energy in Australia. Were it possible to overcome the technical problems associated with large-scale generation of power from solar sources, Australia would be one country with almost no greenhouse problems from power generation to worry about. That is not the case, but it would be very nice if it were.
Generation costs tend to be higher for some renewable sources than for coal or uranium. The white paper makes this point:
... wide-scale uptake of low-emission base load electricity generation at current costs would lead to substantial increases in electricity prices, which would reduce Australia’s competitiveness.
There are still question marks over the feasibility of carbon geosequestration, according to the white paper. It goes on to note:
Demonstrating the commercial applicability of these technologies is likely to be expensive and take at least 10 years.
On average, industrialised countries generate 24 per cent of their electricity from nuclear power. At the end of 2003, 31 countries had nuclear reactors and North Korea was in the process of constructing one. World wide there were 439 reactors in operation—with another 31 under construction—generating some 16.1 per cent of total world electricity production.
Nuclear energy is especially utilised in North America, Europe and Asia. Lithuania, although having only two reactors, produces 79.9 per cent of its electricity from uranium. It is closely followed by France, which has 59 reactors, supplying 77.7 per cent of its electricity. The United States of America has 104 reactors, supplying 19.9 per cent of its electricity. Japan has 53 reactors, with another three under construction, supplying 25 per cent of its electricity. Nuclear energy’s 16.1 per cent share of total world electricity production is estimated to avoid the emission of some 2.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. So it obviously has a lot of merit in terms of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
Given our abundant reserves of uranium, our reliance on coal-fired power generation, projected increases in demand for electricity and the implications this has for our greenhouse emissions, and the shortcomings of renewable energy, I think it is important to encourage debate on the appropriateness of nuclear power in Australia. One of the biggest stumbling blocks to overcome in this debate is public perceptions about the safety of nuclear reactors. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine, which spread highly radioactive material over a large area, the effects of which continue to be felt to some extent to this day, is uppermost in the public consciousness when talking about nuclear power generation. The other major accident—there have only ever been two—occurred at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979, but no deaths resulted from that.
I think it is important to have a sense of proportion about these accidents. The Uranium Information Centre points out that these have been the only two major accidents during more than 11,000 reactor years of civil operation of nuclear reactors. The centre states:
Apart from Chernobyl, no nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident.
The risk of danger can be managed by building high quality reactors with a range of safety mechanisms, especially passive mechanisms which require no operator intervention, and by ensuring that in the event of an accident radiological material is confined to the plant. The Uranium Information Centre argues that modern reactors have multiple safety systems and that utility requirements in the USA specify a one-in-100,000-year core damage frequency. The UIC also notes that the best currently operating plants have about a one-in-one-million-year damage or accident frequency and that those likely to be built in the next decade have an almost one-in-10-million-year likely accident frequency.
Speaking at the 19th World Energy Council congress in Sydney last year, Davainis Marius of the State Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate of Lithuania made the point:
... the safety record of the world’s nuclear plants over past decade of operation indicates nuclear related risks to be among the lowest in the energy industry.
I think that is a very important message to get out to the public in Australia. The other big question about nuclear reactors relates to the disposal of nuclear waste, which, of course, concerns a lot of people. According again to Davainis Marius:
... it is estimated that the spent fuel produced from all the world’s reactors in a year would fit into a structure the size of a football field and 1.5 meters high.
I remember having a conversation with Harold Clough, who is the head of a very large engineering firm in Western Australia, a few years ago. He said that the engineering of a safe nuclear dump was a very simple matter and that it could be done very easily. So it would seem that, even though there is a great deal of public controversy about the storage of nuclear waste, perhaps that controversy and concern is a little misplaced, because it seems that the amount of space required to store nuclear waste is not very great at all.
A recent OECD survey found that, on the basis of cost, nuclear stations are a credible alternative to coal powered stations. However, unlike Australia, most countries are not blessed with cheap, readily accessible and abundant reserves of coal close to major population centres. This means that it would be difficult for uranium to compete with coal economically as well as in terms of public acceptance in Australia. I think that when externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions are taken into consideration nuclear power will become an increasingly realistically assessed option for Australia. In conclusion, no one source of energy is perfect or a panacea, but surely it is time to move beyond the demonisation of nuclear power and have an informed debate. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Nuclear Energy</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,6,1,speech,4L6,
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2005-08-17,"—From 5 to 17 July, just a month ago, I had the honour of travelling to China, under my study entitlement, to look at and examine education as an export industry for Australia. I went because I was particularly interested to see what it is that Australia has to offer by way of education services and expertise that interests and encourages a country such as China to want to engage with and utilise that.
China’s economy grows at a rate of 10 per cent every year. Last year industrial production was up 17 per cent. China is now the world’s second largest economy according to purchasing power measures—now over 13 per cent of the global economy. China’s share of world trade has grown more rapidly than that of any other country. In 1990 its share of world exports was two per cent, by 2000 it was four per cent and in 2003 it was six per cent. As at 30 June 2003, China was Australia’s 18th largest investment destination—which is the latest figure that was supplied to me by DFAT—with a focus on manufacturing, mineral exploration and legal, banking and education services. China is changing and transforming itself, advancing and training its people in new skills faster than ever before and wanting to ensure that its people have a level of education and qualifications that is meaningful, responsive to industry and innovative.
So there is a great opportunity for us to be involved and much to be gained in developing a meaningful and cooperative relationship, especially when it comes to education as an export industry. I travelled to China in 1993 and managed to get only to Beijing that time. This time I was immensely surprised at the level of growth that is occurring in Shanghai and the sophistication of that city. Also, during this trip, I spent a week in the western province of Chongqing. Chongqing is becoming almost like the second Hong Kong of China. This in fact is the province that is at the very heart of the Yangtze River project. As people will know, the Chinese are damning the three gorges of the Yangtze River. As part of that, they will be physically relocating 3½ million people to this city. The skyline in Chongqing has 30,000 cranes registered. They tell me that they build the equivalent of a Brisbane nearly every three to four months.
There is massive development happening in this country, and we need to be a part of that. China has finally decided and realised that it wants to build on the example of vocational education and training that it gained from Germany, and it is now looking to Australia’s VET system. We took what was happening in Germany, but we have gone much further than that. It has now turned its attention to Australia, and it believes that we have a lot to offer.
My first stop was to Shanghai, where I visited the Shanghai Institute of Foreign Trade and met Mr Xia Si Yun, the vice-president, Associate Professor Nie Qing and Laura Yang, the higher education program director. This institute has a formal cooperative relationship with RMIT in Victoria and specialises in the delivery of higher education courses, particularly with an emphasis on English language training from RMIT. There is a very strong link between the academic staff of the institutions in both exchanges of information for professional development purposes and quality and content of curriculum. It is interesting to note that this institution certainly values and places a lot of importance on the work that is done between the two colleges, especially in the way that the Australian contact can contribute to the development of understanding business processes in the Western world, as well as the English proficiency that comes with such contact. It was obvious to me that what China wants from Australia is our understanding of Western business and English. More importantly, what we can get from China is a knowledge of how people do business in Asian countries. There are benefits for both countries from pursuing and cultivating these relationships.
TAFE Global is an international project arm of the New South Wales state government Department of Education and Training. I had the opportunity to meet Stuart Costello, the director of the China programs in Shanghai. The office is staffed by both local education and training experts and highly experienced TAFE teachers and administrators from New South Wales. Their work is a testament to the fact that the Australian VET system is recognised as amongst the most sophisticated in the world because not only does it involve industry but it also has defined quality training outcomes. The TAFE Global office draws on the curriculum development and training expertise of TAFE New South Wales and provides services in a variety of industries and settings in China. It is a tribute to our people who are experts in the education field of vocational education and training that such a successful operation is in place in Shanghai. Indeed, TAFE Global has a number of arms throughout South-East Asia.
I want to take this moment to ensure that people in New South Wales understand what great work Australians, with their expertise, are doing in Shanghai, passing that expertise on to the Chinese community and Chinese workers and businesses. We often do not recognise the role that our people play internationally and our tremendous wealth of experience that we can offer these countries.
My thanks also go to the Australian consulate staff in Shanghai—Sam Gerovich, Cathryn Hlavka and Xu Jianwen—who certainly assisted in getting the most out of the trip and provided the transport, assistance and organisation that is so crucial and much appreciated by visitors like me. Similarly, in Beijing, it was interesting to meet with the staff at the Australian embassy and talk through a number of issues involving our developing relationship with China. I met with Dr Alan Thomas, the ambassador, Katharine Campbell from Australian Education International and Peter Jensen from AusAID and, of course, there was Ms Ann Mao, the very competent and informative interpreter for the day. My thanks and appreciation also go to these people for organising my time in that city and preparing the program that I enjoyed and that assisted me in gaining an insight into the future of this industry for Australia and possible future directions that could be considered.
I met with CIVTE, the Central Institute of Technical and Vocational Education of the Ministry of Education. This operates in a similar way to NCVER here in Australia, in that they collect statistics, they undertake research and they provide comment on training trends in China to assist with policy development and government priorities. I was extremely impressed by the quality of work and level of expertise, and I am very sorry I did not have more time to spend in exchanging ideas with the professionals I met: Gao Ying, the deputy director; Professor Jiang Dayuan; and Yufeng Liu. As I said to them as I left their building, I probably could have spent a whole day chatting to them about the latest developments in vocational education in China. CIVTE have four research sections that have played a major role in the 2020 reform development outline. This country has an annual tertiary intake of six million students, and issues include coping with the urbanisation process, upgrading skills and skilling those who have become unemployed and graduates who are coming from high schools.
I met with people from the Chinese Service Centre for Scholarly Exchange. I found this a very interesting section of the Ministry of Education in China. It was established in 1989 and caters specifically for those students who are seeking to travel and study overseas. Since 1978, 815,000 students from China have gone to 109 countries. Of these, 198,000 have returned and 427,000 are still studying or working abroad. Of those students who have gone abroad, 125,000 were self-sponsored. About 10 per cent go to Australia, which amounts to about 50,000 students.
The issues they raised with me were accrediting foreign degrees, the comparison of foreign education systems to ensure a high-quality service for returning scholars in resettlement and helping people to find jobs when they return to China. They have a database for scholars and institutions and, of course, they assist with passports and visas. It was interesting to note what they said to me, and that is that Australia’s higher education system needs to understand two things. One is that the way in which students are studying is changing. They may not come to Australia anymore to do their four-year undergraduate degree—although they may spend part of their time in Australia while they do that degree—but more and more, people who want to study for their master’s or their PhD in finance, trade, insurance, management and engineering are seeking to come to Australia. The trend is changing. They do their undergraduate degree in China, with a bit of English, but do their PhDs and master’s in Australia. That is the first message.
The second message is this: when those students return to China, they are in fact competing in an international market. Students from China have gone to 109 other countries. They are competing for jobs with students who have gone to Cambridge and Oxford in the UK or to Harvard, or to Canada, New Zealand and Singapore. So the students who graduate from here face an international competitive market in a very big way when they return to China. The quality of training we give those students is crucial. In particular, they mentioned four universities to me: James Cook University, ANU, RMIT and Sydney—the universities in Sydney. They are the universities that people now focus on when they are coming to Australia.
There are problems with studying abroad in terms of requiting students. The international experience is beneficial and there is mutual recognition of credits. It is about the internationalism of the Chinese curriculum, but the quality needs to be guaranteed. Employment opportunities can be rare when students return and there is pressure on our institutions. The impact, of course, of our federal government’s policy when it comes to defunding higher education flows through to international students. They are very well aware of this in China and had many comments to make to me about it. I met the deputy chief executive, Shao Wei; the director general, Professor Fang Maotian; the director of the division for returned students from abroad, Cheng Jiacai; and the director of the international cooperation and exchange department, Che Weimin—all very highly intelligent and professional people. I thoroughly enjoyed my exchange with them on the future of higher education.
But I specifically went to China to examine the project in Chongqing. This is a $20 million AusAID program being managed by Antoine Barnaart. Antoine used to be the pro vice chancellor for vocational education and training and international students at our own Charles Darwin University in the Northern Territory. He is the Australian team leader of the Australia-China VET project. This project is about rolling out our vocational education and training system in Chongqing. They are trialling it in five institutions and in a school in each of those institutions. I have to say that China is very enthusiastic about adopting our VET system. I met a wonderful group of people who are doing everything they possibly can to ensure not just that our quality system is reproduced in China but also that the best of our system is taken, tailored and adapted to suit the needs of this city.
My thanks go to Yang Ping, the bilingual secretary of the project, who assisted in my trip; to Liu Li, or Lily, the interpreter whose company I enjoyed for so many days; and to Xu Lin. I want to thank for their assistance David Yunchao Chen, the director of the Municipal Education Commission, and Fu Zhenghong, from the Chongqing National Association of Vocational Education in China. I managed to go to the University of Arts in Yonghuan City, a city which has 70,000 VET students and which is 63 kilometres from the capital of Chongqing. I met Deng Changjin, the vice chairman, and Zheng Xiangdong, the vice mayor of that city. I thoroughly enjoyed my discussion with them. Madame Zou Xiaoping, the deputy director of the Chongqing Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Commission, showed me how crucial it is that China has a trained and developing work force now as it moves into this century.
Finally, I want to thank Mr Zhang Yahang, the principal of the automotive school, and his staff: Liu Dakang, the deputy principal, and Mrs Luo Xiaoqiu, the assistant to the principal. I also want to thank the people at the Chongqing School of Electronic Technology—Lu Hong, the project manager; Zhou Xiangyu, the principal; and Buo Hualin, the deputy principal—for their work on and commitment to ensuring that Australia’s quality training systems are relevant to what they are doing in China.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>China: Education</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,6,2,speech,7Y6,
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-08-17,"—The focus on debt reduction, the Future Fund and getting the bush up to scratch in order to fully privatise Telstra has taken the debate away from what ought to be the key question, which is: is the privatisation of Telstra in the national interest?
—Yes.
—The overwhelming majority of Australians do not think so, Senator Macdonald. Poll after poll shows that between 65 per cent and 80 per cent of Australians do not support the full privatisation of Telstra. Telstra provides a range of services that are absolutely vital to the national security and economic and social development of Australia. Australians are increasingly relying on e-commerce, e-health and e-banking. For many businesses, especially small business, efficient and effective communication systems are critical for them to be competitive.
A cost-effective, reliable communications system is especially critical for Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas, where the tyranny of distance, isolation and lack of services need to be overcome. A high-speed internet connection is essential for engagement with the modern economy and society. A privatised Telstra will be more likely to demand a commercial rate of return from their assets, however, and so be much more willing to close down low-return assets—just as we have seen with other services, such as banking, air services and the like—and more likely to withdraw their presence from regional Australia.
Many would argue that telecommunications is as essential as decent roads and power, and should be treated as a critical part of our nation’s infrastructure. Yet this government does not get it. Just today, Peter Costello was quoted as saying that from a financial viewpoint it was silly for the government to hold six billion shares in one company. Interestingly, the 1996 Liberal Party and National Party policy on privatisation, entitled ‘Privatisation: in the public interest and the public benefit’, states:
The Liberal and National Parties believe privatisation should only occur where it is demonstrably in the public interest. We do not take the view that privatisation is an end in itself. Indeed there are many Government functions which public interest and accountability considerations demand remain in public ownership and control.
That is quite a sensible policy in my view.
The government’s plan to fully privatise Telstra, however, is not demonstrably in the national or public interest. The government has failed to justify the sale on competition, service, legal or financial grounds. The reality is that growth in competition has slowed, Australia has dropped down the list of countries with broadband penetration within the OECD and, since Telstra has been privatised, the investment in infrastructure to revenue ratio has decreased.
Rather than accept that full privatisation is not in the national interest and develop a comprehensive telecommunications framework for the future with Telstra as a publicly owned company, the government has continued to pursue its sale strategy. To do this, it must pursue two competing goals: increasing the share price and improving service and access levels to appease public concerns. I say ‘competing goals’ because the first goal of increasing the share price requires the company to spend less, maintain a dominate market position and make record profits. On the other hand, the goal of improving services and access requires investment in infrastructure and service delivery, and greater competition. As you can see, the strategies are opposing. The end result has been a hotchpotch of policy and programs by this government, leaving the industry and consumers frustrated.
Since the government won the 2004 election with a Senate majority, we have had a situation where the Liberals’ coalition partners, The Nationals, are under pressure from their constituents in regional and rural Australia and accordingly will place conditions on the full privatisation of Telstra. The Nationals started their campaign promisingly by commissioning a position paper from Page Research Centre Ltd to identify options about how to future-proof the bush. Options A and B argued for using a large portion of the estimated $33.8 billion in revenue that would be raised from the sale of Telstra to roll out either fibre optic cable or wireless to the majority of consumers in non-metropolitan areas.
For some reason, The Nationals have abandoned the recommendations of the Page report in favour of—wait for it—a $2 billion fund. Or was it $5 billion? I am not sure. We do not know, because the figure was obviously plucked out of the air. But $2 billion is in any case chicken feed in return for selling $33.8 billion of public ownership in Telstra and is a far cry from the recommendations in the Page report. The irony is that, by Mr Vaile’s own admission, rural service provision will need to be propped up under a fully privatised Telstra and his proposed $2 billion will only fund the annual cost to maintain services.
The government has just announced an operating licence to ensure Telstra maintains a presence in the bush. Will it guarantee access to modern technology or to equitable pricing? I do not think so. And even if Telstra is forced to maintain a presence in the bush and continue with its universal service obligations, there is nothing to stop a privatised shareholder focused Telstra treating people in the regions as second-class citizens when it comes to improving or updating their telecommunications services.
Today the papers have reported that senior Telstra negotiators have threatened to cut investment in the nation’s phone service network if the government refuses to relax the ‘regulatory straitjacket’, in the words of the negotiators. Telstra could follow through with their threat because, as part of the sale package, the minister would give up the ability to give certain directions to Telstra in the public interest under part 3 of the Telecommunications Act, a power which is yet to be exercised but a safeguard nonetheless and one that the Democrats were instrumental in ensuring remained in the act.
The latest offering from the government—surfacing in only the last few days—is a further $1 billion to roll out broadband internet services in rural areas. However, very few people know what this will look like. Most likely it will be more of the HiBIS, a scheme which has been criticised for throwing taxpayers’ money at old technology or at solutions that suit single users. As I mentioned earlier, in its obsessive desire to sell Telstra, this government has completely abandoned any notion of forward planning. We now have the government making policy on the run in pursuit of ideology that is not in the national interest and a soon to be fully privatised, vertically and horizontally integrated monopoly that is already doing what most people fear, and threatening not to invest in our national telecommunications infrastructure.
The government and The Nationals are ignoring a number of solutions, including The Nationals-commissioned Page report. On the one hand, some members of The Nationals say that they want Telstra to remain in public hands but, on the other hand, they are under pressure from the Liberals to resolve the part-pregnant dilemma of part government ownership and debt reduction. In order to resolve this dilemma I am surprised that The Nationals have not explored the option of structural separation, whereby the predominately retail part of Telstra could be privatised, with government retaining the core infrastructure. The government could use part of the proceeds from the retail sale, in combination with government bonds, to roll out fibre in regional and rural Australia. The feasibility and merits of such a model have recently been revisited by Professor Peter Gerrand from Melbourne university. We are unable to test the merits of Professor Gerrand’s proposal, because the government has continually ignored the requirement by the National Competition Council to undertake a study of structural separation before privatisation and it abandoned a parliamentary inquiry in 2002.
An alternative solution offered by the Democrats to future-proof the bush and metropolitan areas lacking access to broadband is to sell off non-core activities and use the proceeds to invest in fibre and wireless technologies. As the majority shareholder, and with ministerial discretion, the government could require Telstra to focus on core activities that are in the national interest and divest its shareholdings in non-core offshoots such as Foxtel, Sensis, TelstraClear and CSL and use the proceeds—which we understand would be worth about $12 billion—to fund a national roll-out of fibre and wireless. It should be noted that that is much more than the $1 billion that is being proposed.
In addition to a future-proofing solution, the Democrats also advocate for structural separation or, at a minimum, operational separation in combination with divestiture powers; more funding; a telecommunications-specific commissioner for the ACCC; strengthening of the Trade Practices Act; regular reviews; and a requirement for ongoing investment in core infrastructure.
Unlike the current position of the Liberals and The Nationals on Telstra, the alternatives that I have outlined here today have not been made on the run or with the goal of revenue in mind. The ideas have been developed with the national interest and the consumer in mind and are based on evidence and recommendations from the myriad Senate inquiries into telecommunications that the Democrats have chaired, often initiated and taken part in over the last few years. With regard to Telstra, the Democrats say that the government needs to abandon ideology, step back and reassess exactly what is in the national interest. We say that policy that is developed on the run is not in anyone’s interest, not even in the government’s long-term interest with so many people opposed to it. It is certainly not in the public interest and it is certainly not in the interests of all Australians.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,6,3,speech,1M6,
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-08-17,"—Today I would like to bring to the attention of the chamber a very important and exciting week on the Australian educational calendar—that is, National Science Week. I wonder whether all of these young people in the public gallery today will have an opportunity while they visit Canberra to perhaps explore some of the scientific things that we have on offer here in the national capital. National Science Week is Australia’s major annual science event, scheduled from 13 to 21 August—it is, in fact, more than a week. It involves a virtual kaleidoscope of events and broadcasts Australia wide, all in the name of promoting the wonders of science. This year’s theme is energy and future challenges, which is perhaps why Senator Eggleston spoke about nuclear energy today. National Science Week provides an opportunity to draw attention to Australian scientific successes, to encourage interest in scientific pursuits and, importantly, to get people fascinated in the world around us. It is genuinely a week of scientific exploration.
Science Week is full of events of all shapes and sizes. The National Science Week web site lists over 200 science related events that occur around the country, ranging from national awards and presentations to local school competitions. In highlighting some of the events scheduled around the country at all different levels, I will give you an idea of the many varied and exciting ways to bring science to those who are, like me, not very scientific at all. Each year one or two international guests visit Australia and tour the country, sharing their views of science. This year is the International Year of Physics and two internationally renowned physicists from the United Kingdom are visiting Australia. They are robotics expert Professor Noel Sharkey and Dr Ken Skeldon, who does shows on electricity and the moon landings. At a state and territory level, the Australian National University in the ACT is giving away science mini degrees. In New South Wales, you can learn about physics in a fun and educational way with the Frying Flying Physics show, which is being run by MadLab Australia and which will travel around the state.
There are an endless number of local school activities occurring this week which are designed to engage tomorrow’s scientists and innovators. For example, at Karabar High School, in Queanbeyan, they will be challenging their students to create a PowerPoint presentation on a scientific topic relevant to their current study in order to raise awareness and promote innovation and new technologies in science. At Woodenbong Central School, up in the north of New South Wales, they are going to have energy themed lessons throughout the week, culminating in an exciting solar balloon launch. Scone and District Preschool will this week enjoy an exciting Energy Discovery session, where they will see and experience fizzy rockets, balloon powered jets, static magic and much more. And the list goes on. Who knows—perhaps one of those children from Scone and District Preschool will one day join Australia’s list of Nobel Prize laureates.
Australia has a proud number of Nobel Prize laureates—a testament to our admirable history of scientific discovery and innovation. The Noble Prize is the ultimate recognition of achievement in the fields of physics, chemistry, peace, medicine, economics and literature. It is awarded to those who have done outstanding research, invented groundbreaking techniques or equipment or made outstanding contributions to society. It is widely regarded as the supreme commendation in the world today. Australia proudly boasts 10 Nobel Prize laureates—nine in science and medicine and one in literature.
Australia’s first recipients—the father and son team Lawrence and William Bragg—won the Noble Prize in Physics in 1915 for their work on the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays. They remain the only father and son team to be awarded the prize. Lawrence, who was aged 25 at the time, is still the youngest ever Nobel Prize recipient. Howard Florey received the Nobel Prize in 1945, sharing it with British scientists Alexander Fleming and Ernst Chain, for work on the medicinal properties of penicillin. It was Florey who later turned it into a practical drug that was to go on to save countless millions of lives. In fact, many in the medical and scientific communities regard him as Australia’s greatest scientist. Former Prime Minister Robert Menzies described him as ‘in terms of world well-being, the most important man ever born in Australia’.
Macfarlane Burnet received the prize in 1960 for his work on immunology. John Eccles received the prize along with his British counterparts in 1963 for their work on nerve cells. John Cornforth received his prize in 1975 for chemistry. Peter Doherty is our most recent Noble Prize laureate. Peter received his prize, together with his Swiss counterpart Rolf Zinkernagel, in 1996 for his groundbreaking research in the field of immunology. His work has spawned an entire new field of research and has given the world a clearer understanding of the intricate mechanisms at work in our bodies. And, if winning the Nobel Prize was not enough, in 1997 Peter was named Australian of the Year. In a recent interview he was asked about qualities that were necessary to be a successful scientist. He replied:
You’ve got to be very persistent and totally absorbed in what you do. You need to have an open mind, and be prepared to drop one line of inquiry and follow another if it looks interesting. We never set out to make our discovery—we weren’t aiming in that direction at all. But when we found something unexpected we followed it.
So there is truth in the old adage that you really do make your own luck. And it is worth noting that the serendipity that befell Peter through his discovery has befallen society at large.
Although the Nobel Prize is the pinnacle of world scientific recognition and we should be proud of Australia’s contribution to it, there are countless thousands of Australian scientists who have received their recognition in the faces of those people who their innovations and discoveries have helped so much. Today I would like to highlight three Australian scientists for their exceptional efforts in scientific education and innovation. Those scientists are Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, Tony Flynn and Dr Josette Masle.
First I want to pay tribute to Dr Karl for helping to bring science to the masses and showing just how much fun and, indeed, how funny science can be. Dr Karl used to be, as he explains, a ‘proper pukka’ scientist, engineer and doctor, but he is currently an author and science commentator on radio and television. He has degrees in biomedical engineering, medicine and surgery and is the Julius Sumner Miller Fellow at the University of Sydney in the science foundation of the physics department. He was the writer and presenter of the first series of Quantum and has been a TV science reporter ever since. He has had a regular spot on Triple J for many years, where he tries to answer just about anything. I can remember listening to him when a young child rang up and asked Dr Karl where the bubbles in fizzy drink come from. Looking at his web site, I can see that he is still at it, answering questions like: ‘Why do cats land on their feet?’ and ‘Why is the sky blue?’
I think it is worth noting that in 2002 Dr Karl won the Ig Nobel Prize for his belly button lint survey. Ig Nobel Prizes are presented annually and honour people whose scientific research cannot or should not be reproduced. Dr Karl was at the Boston event when his award was presented to him before an excited crowd of 1,200 people which even included three Nobel laureates. From this survey, Dr Karl determined that you are more likely to have belly button lint—that is, BBL—if you are male, older, hairy, and have an ‘innie’. Dr Karl and former Triple J breakfast host Adam Spencer have travelled the country, visiting both city and country centres, with their Sleek Geeks show. In fact, they have even performed here in the Great Hall of Parliament House, where they explained, among many things, the science behind which way you cross your legs and why watching people yawn makes you yawn yourself.
Also, Dr Karl fronted the Roads and Traffic Authority campaign explaining the dangers of drinking and driving by highlighting the tragic danger of a microsleep. Dr Karl really has made science fun, and I am sure through his work he has inspired many young Australians to go on to a career in scientific research, as well as answering many of those pressing questions that would seem to have been the cause of many heated arguments at the local pub.
Let us pay tribute to the work of Tony Flynn. Tony is an experienced ceramist and PhD student working in the department of engineering at the Australian National University. He has done some astounding work on water filtration. Some of you may have seen it recently on ABC’s Catalyst program. Tony has demonstrated that fires using dried cow dung as fuel are hot enough for long enough to sinter, which is the firing of clay to turn it into ceramics for use as water filters among other things. The method uses a little clay, organic material such as tea leaves, coffee grounds or rice hulls and cow manure. The process involves taking a handful of dry crushed clay, mixing it with organic material and adding enough water to create a stiff biscuit-like mixture. With that, a cylindrical pot is formed which is closed in at one end. This is dried in the sun then surrounded with straw and placed in a mound of cow manure. The straw is lit with the burning manure topped up as required and in less than an hour—voila!—the filter is finished. That is right: Tony Flynn has been working on how to make cow dung the principal ingredient in producing clean water, and the uses for this process are about as incredible as the process itself.
Tests have revealed that this process can remove between 96.4 and 99.4 per cent of deadly E. coli bacterium and that one filter can produce a litre of clean water every two hours. Currently, Tony’s research is being investigated to help East Timorese villages produce water filters from local materials and in turn deliver clean, inexpensive water. This research may have worldwide humanitarian implications. The most inspiring aspect of his work which I think really captures the essence of National Science Week is, in the words of Tony Flynn:
We are deliberately not patenting this technology in the hope that it will be used widely around the world. A simple water filter really does have the capacity to save many lives in the developing world.
This sentiment complements amazing work, and we wish him all the best.
Finally, I would like to pay tribute to Dr Josette Masle, also from the Australian National University, who is working in the research school of biological sciences. Dr Masle has led the research which discovered the gene called erecta, which regulates water efficiency in plants. The gene does this by regulating the transpiration efficiency in the plant. This is a scientific breakthrough and may lead to the development of drought resistant crops that have the potential to save farmers countless millions of dollars and, more importantly, it could be a lifesaver world wide.
Dr Masle believes that now they have isolated the gene that regulates water efficiency in one particular plant they will look for other species that carry a similar gene in plants such as wheat, barley, rice, canola and tomato. Dr Richard Richards, the Chief Scientist for the CSIRO, said on the ABC recently:
It’s a very, very significant finding worldwide, not just for Australia, where water limits crop growth, but water is a major issue globally for future food production.
He suggests the savings could be potentially extraordinary—a one per cent improvement in water efficiency on Australia’s approximately $10 billion crop, which would represent a $100 million saving each year. Well done, Dr Masle. To all those involved in promoting the wonders of science in National Science Week, as my son would say, ‘That’s gold.’
I would like to conclude by mentioning an event that occurred yesterday at the Casimir Catholic College where the classes wrote to politicians encouraging more scientific funding and research. I am sure that the government is going to listen to this and I hope in science week that we can celebrate the achievements of so many hardworking Australians working in the field of science.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>National Science Week</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,6,4,speech,00AOS,
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-08-17,"—In today’s matter of public interest discussion I wish to address the plight of several hundred ex-RAAF personnel who worked on F111 aircraft at Amberley. The task of these ground crew, including some civilians, was to climb inside the fuel tanks of F111 aircraft. Once inside the fuel tank, they had to remove sealant. Next they were required to install new sealant as part of a maintenance upgrade. They then replaced that with new sealant.
These men worked in confined quarters, sometimes without appropriate breathing apparatus. In doing so, these people used up to 200 toxic chemicals in the process of their work. As many as 460 RAAF personnel may have been involved, with a possibility of some 200 others. Many believe they have been severely affected by their exposure. In effect, they believe their lives have been ruined. A number are also believed to have died in the ensuing years.
Over the last couple of decades we have witnessed the ongoing saga in the courts and the wider community of the problems associated with asbestosis originally arising out of a mine site in Western Australia. The F111 story is also a saga. But, worse, it is an act of negligence on the part of the Commonwealth as employer. In itself, this is disappointing because our services in their workshops have an outstanding record of safety. That is simply part of the discipline of excellence applied to the maintenance of equipment used by Australian defence personnel. While this project began some 30 years ago, it is nevertheless quite disappointing to find out about its eventual outcome many years after it began. That it should have happened is bad enough, but that the government has been so slow to act in recent years is almost criminal.
Many of these people are now in a quite poor state of health. Many have been unable to work for the last few years. They have survived on meagre pensions or through the support of their families. Their anger and frustration is quite understandable. Despite having known about the problem for many years, and it having been repeatedly drawn to the attention of government, little was done. Eventually, however, some years ago a health study was set up. Those who could be identified, almost 40 per cent of the total, were given detailed medical examinations. Those outcomes were compared with a control group of RAAF personnel not exposed down the road at the Richmond base. That study was released to the public on 26 October last year, almost 10 months ago. In summary, the report found that these RAAF workers are part of that 20 to 30 per cent of the Australian population with a very poor quality of life. This is related back to the nature of their work on the deseal and reseal of RAAF containers. They suffer high levels of erectile dysfunction and they are twice as likely as the control group to have depression and anxiety. They suffer a higher risk of mental distress and social dysfunction than the rest of the Australian population and the control group. They report high levels of dizziness, chest pain and irregular heartbeats. Significant levels of lung disease such as bronchitis and emphysema were found, probably not unexpectedly. Finally, if all that is not enough, they display significant levels of dermatitis, eczema and lesions.
The government released that report to the public in October of last year, almost 10 months ago. At the time of its release the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, undertook to take recommendations to cabinet to address the problems as a matter of priority. This he did, as we understand it he took those recommendations to cabinet at the end of last year. The outcome of those deliberations, we are informed, was that, in addition to normal disability compensation, lump sum payments would be made ex gratia to all those who were exposed to the chemicals in the course of their work. However, since that time—late November or early December of last year—there has been a deadly and ongoing silence as to government intent. In Queensland, the support group pressing for answers has heard nothing. At estimates on the last three occasions I pressed the Department of Veterans’ Affairs officials for answers—again, without success. All we know is that there is no finite or exact information on the number of persons affected. We know nothing of the quantum of the ex gratia sum under consideration by government. As we understand it, legislation is necessary to appropriate the funds in due course. That legislation has not been introduced into the parliament. One must say that this is an appalling set of circumstances.
To some extent our worst fears about the new military compensation scheme have been realised. The Department of Defence have absolved themselves of their line management responsibility—in terms of safe systems of work and overall occupational health and safety—by delegating responsibility, by agreement, for the new scheme to the authority of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which will simply administer the scheme. This delegation, or outsourcing, eliminated the nexus between employer responsibility for occupational health and safety and compensation accountability. That is very convenient. Regrettably, DVA is very tight-lipped about the matter.
In the meantime those harmed continue to suffer. The money they have been promised, which might make some lives more bearable, to date remains a mirage. The last excuse I was given at estimates on 30 May was that there were some legal difficulties that needed to be sorted out and resolved. These concerned, as often appears to be the case, the interaction of the Commonwealth military scheme, the proposed lump sum and the operation of a state statute—the relevant Queensland Workers’ Compensation Act—which affects some of the persons employed by civilian contractors involved in the task. We understood this to concern only a small number of civilian workers covered by the relevant state scheme. I understand there may also be a group who are engaged in legal action before the Supreme Court of Queensland. The status of that legal action is not currently known. Similarly, there is not any information on whether those actions for damages will proceed or whether any new one-off scheme that might be instituted by government includes offsets. However, advice to me at the time was that there were no longer any concerns on the part of the Queensland government.
However, there is still much to be revealed. We do know that a screening program to test people for illnesses, most likely from their exposure, has not yet been established and put into place. We also know that 170 people affected have been compensated under the Veterans’ Entitlement Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. We also know this was not for exposure; it was for other disabilities related to the nature of the work at that time. The reason for this odd development is that Australian military compensation law requires the existence of medical scientific research which satisfactorily establishes a causal link between the incident and the outcome. Unfortunately much of this particular research has not been done in Australia or, indeed, around the world. Hence the relevant body, the Repatriation Medical Authority, has not been able to issue relevant statements of principle to guide compensation deliberators. Hence the need, desire or intent of the government to establish an ad hoc, ex gratia scheme.
I have spoken on this subject in this place on a number of occasions in more recent years. It is a significant area of difference between Australian military compensation schemes and those set up and administered in, say, the United States or New Zealand. In both of those countries government has considerable discretionary powers to waive the necessity for medical scientific linkage.
Australian legislation does contain a similar provision, but it is rarely, if ever, used by government. One presumes that this is because of a fear of flow-on effects to a wide range of other disabilities where medical science is also lacking—or, more accurately, where medical science has not yet caught up with the causation factors that give rise to these particularly pronounced disabilities. Hence we presume the government’s intention is to separately legislate to cover this difficult situation. However, this in turn does create a precedent. Those who served during the atomic tests after World War II and those who served with BCOF—the British Commonwealth Occupation Force—in Japan might equally demand the same legislative response from government. They believe they were seriously affected by exposure to hazardous material but, even after almost 50 years, have been unable to satisfactorily demonstrate or prove the link between cause and effect.
It is trite to say that this matter has now gone far beyond the pale. Up to 460 people, many no doubt seriously affected by their work, have not received compensation for this matter after nearly 30 years. More than 200 people continue to receive medical treatment. This in itself, while worthwhile, needed and eminently justifiable, is little consolation. This is not a disability compensation matter any longer. The solution will evolve as medical science examines the matter and the RMA—the Repatriation Medical Authority—develops the relevant statements of principle. The single important issue here is the failure of the current government to honour its promise of 10 months ago to provide separate lump sum compensation to those workers who were affected by this difficult set of circumstances up to 30 years ago.
Many of these people are suffering from acute illnesses, and some are in the most desperate financial straits, yet they wait patiently and quietly. They wait for Minister Hill and the government to honour their undertaking and word that they would treat the issue seriously, that they would treat the issue as a matter of priority, that they would take a recommendation for urgent attention by cabinet and that they would come down as a matter of priority with decisions for implementation arising after the cabinet review. We had to put up with this nonsense from February of this year right through to June. As I understand it now, there are those who are not at the heart of the matter—a few people employed under a relevant state workers compensation statute—who have the ability to delay implementation and financial justice for the many hundreds of people who were employed in the defence forces, who worked in the workshops and who were employed in a deseal-reseal task on the F111 planes. That is something short of mindless.
So we ask, and we ask again and again, when the government is going to resolve this issue, when it is going to fix the problem and when it is going to provide the appropriate compensation for those who the government acknowledges were not at any fault, who suffer because of the work that they were tasked to do over many years many years ago and who worked in an environment where apparently little heed was paid to a safe work environment. Now many hundreds of people sit at home, many alone, isolated and waiting. At a minimum, they need to know what they will be paid and when. It really is beholden upon the government to resolve this issue after so many years—30 years after the illnesses were occasioned; 30 years after the illnesses started; 30 years after the illnesses were diagnosed.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>F111 Aircraft</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,6,5,speech,2L6,
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2005-08-17,"—I thank all of those senators who have participated in the debate on matters of public interest. In closing the debate, I again take issue with Senator Allison, who simply cannot understand what the Telstra debate is all about. Senator Allison, you do not need to own the company to regulate it. The tremendous package that has just been released by the communications minister, Senator Coonan, and the Prime Minister clearly demonstrates that. It is a continuation of what we have been doing for nine years now, and that is ensuring that government subsidies and funds go into ensuring good services for the bush. Many of us who have been around for a long time remember what the services were like in Labor’s day, when you could hardly get any sort of decent telecommunications. However, since 1996 telecommunications in the bush have improved, not because of Telstra but because of government support, regulation and subsidies.
I want to thank people like Mr Gary Nairn, Wilson Tuckey, Warren Entsch and Peter Lindsay up my way for their constant work on this package of reforms for telecommunications. Barry Wakelin, Barry Haase, Joanna Gash and Paul Neville are all members of the Liberal and National parties who have put a lot of work into this over the last nine years and who have succeeded in getting a great package there. As I said, the government has been supporting the bush. The Networking the Nation program is just one that immediately comes to mind. One would have thought that after all of these years Senator Allison would have understood that it requires government action and decision making to ensure that telecommunications are good across all parts of Australia, be it in the bush, where I come from, the outer suburban areas or the inner city. I am delighted today with the package that Senator Coonan and the Prime Minister have released. It really does demonstrate once again that the Howard government, the Liberal Party and The Nationals, are determined to provide good services for the bush—services that were sadly lacking under the previous Labor regime.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,6,6,speech,YW4,
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-08-17,"—My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I refer to her answer to an estimates question taken on notice where she indicated that 56 people had been wrongfully detained by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for more than 21 days between July 2000 and April 2005. I gather this is in addition to the infamous cases of Ms Rau and Ms Solon. Can the minister advise how many of these 56 people were either Australian citizens or Australian residents; what was the longest period of detention suffered by any of those 56 people; and how many of those 56 people were transferred to detention centres while they were held? Can the minister also indicate whether there have been any further cases of wrongful detention since April 2005—which was not covered in the question—and, if so, whether any of these additional cases also involved Australian citizens?
—I call the minister for education—sorry, immigration.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question,AX5,
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-08-17,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Through you, Mr President, I would like to ask the minister to answer the question. She sought to have a debate about semantics, to patronise and try to verbal me. Of those people who were found to be not unlawful, of the 56, how many were Australian citizens, how many were Australian residents, how many were sent off to detention centres and how long were they detained? What was the longest period of detention for someone who was later found, to use your words, Minister, not to be unlawful? Can you provide the Senate with that basic information?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question,AX5,
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-08-17,"—Been there, done that.
—And what a success that was!
—Indeed—what a success it was! I am invited by the opposition to refer back to some changes that have been made that were allegedly going to be undone—for example, Australian students being able to buy places in the way that overseas students can, freeing up government HECS places those students would otherwise have got for students who otherwise would not get in. But that is not the point of the question; so I will get back to the senator’s question. Senator Evans, you asked me about the so-called revelations in the paper today about 56 people.
—No, I didn’t ask that; I asked you about yesterday’s question.
—Mr President, I actually heard the question, and I think I am entitled to respond as I choose, if you would not mind assisting in that respect. When the Alvarez matter was discovered, the Alvarez matter was sent to Mr Palmer. At that time, I made it clear that all the cases we had already found where people had later been found to be lawful should also be sent to Mr Palmer. We were already in the process of finding what other cases came to light. ‘Later found lawful’ does not mean ‘wrongfully detained’. That has been explained on numerous occasions to journalists—who I thought understood but, on my reading of the paper, apparently do not—and to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.
If the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate wants to ask questions on immigration issues, he should understand that, when someone is detained, in order for it to be a lawful detention, the officer must have a reasonable suspicion at the time that the person is an unlawful non-citizen. To the best of my knowledge, there is not a suggestion that any of the cases referred to Palmer and now with the Ombudsman are cases where that suspicion was not reasonably held at the time. The question that I want looked at is whether, having formed that suspicion and properly and lawfully detained people, the department subsequently did everything it should have, in the haste that it should have, to ascertain who those people were. That is the question. This is not about wrongful detention or otherwise. You might look at me confused, Senator Evans, but most people understand.
—No, that was not the question.
—The people behind seem to understand.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I am happy to debate the issue with the minister, if that is her wish, but she has not shown any willingness to debate in the parliament in the last six months. My point of order is that it is not for her to tell me what the question is. That was not the question. I asked her a very specific question about information she provided to the Senate, and I would ask you to bring her back to the question asked of her as the responsible minister.
—Mr President, on the point of order: the question quite specifically asked me about people wrongfully detained. That was in the question. That is the mistake made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate that I am seeking to assist him with in my answer.
—As I have said many times in this place, I cannot direct a minister as to how to answer a question but I can remind her of the question—and she has one minute and 30 seconds to complete her answer.
—Thank you, Mr President. What I have tried to do is make clear to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, who apparently does not understand, that these people are not necessarily wrongfully detained; it is a question of whether, having been detained, everything that should have been done has been done and done with the speed that it should be done.
As to the 56 people, if the senator wants further detail, I will see if we can get that detail with respect to timing. I would just make the point, though, that I do not know of any situation where a minister has been faced with a problem that has become obvious and has said to the department, ‘Go back and find every other possible problem.’ This is open, transparent and good government.
—Good government? If this is good government, I’d hate to see bad government!
—I can think of ministers who would have tried to simply deal with the matters that came to light and keep the others hidden.
—Like Vivian Solon?
—Order! Senator Evans, I would remind you of the comments you made here in debate yesterday about behaviour in the chamber and I would ask you to remember the words you used.
—I would agree, Mr President, but I would also ask you to draw the minister’s attention to answering the question and not to debating the issue—or she will get a debate on whether this is good government.
—I have already done that and I ask you to resume your seat.
—What was properly done, Mr President, is the department was asked to seek out all the cases that could possibly have some taint and have them properly investigated. That is what is happening, and now they are with the Ombudsman. I remember members of the opposition complaining that Mr Palmer would not do a decent job. I have yet to hear someone say that he did not. I have yet to hear anyone complain about a minister having things referred to the Ombudsman. I go back to the Midford inquiry and I see that the matter was first raised in March 1991 and a final report on that matter did not arrive until 1993. If you want a very stark contrast: this is a matter that was raised in February and May and we have already got the final report and we are dealing with it. (Time expired)

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-08-17,"—I thank Senator Fifield for this very timely question. Connecting Australians to quality communications services has been a high priority for the coalition government. We have already spent more than $1 billion on improving regional communications and today we have announced that we are building on this good work with the biggest regional telecommunications package in Australia’s history that will future-proof Australians’ telecommunications services into the future.
The Connect Australia package will give Australians the telecommunications services they need now, with a $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband, new regional clever networks, mobile services and Indigenous telecommunications, and a $2 billion dedicated communications fund will be set aside to provide a source of revenue for investing in new communications services for rural Australia into the future. We will also provide a more robust regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry while maintaining strong safeguards to protect consumers. The government will provide $1.1 billion of targeted government funding to roll out broadband infrastructure, mobile phone services, Indigenous communications services and clever networks that will underpin e-health, e-education and local government services and other essential services. We will also provide a $2 billion trust fund to be invested in perpetuity and to provide a perpetual source of funding for new technologies into the future.
Our $1.1 billion package includes $878 million for Broadband Connect to provide all Australians with affordable broadband services; $113 million for clever networks to roll out innovative broadband networks for new applications to improve delivery of health, education and essential services; $30 million for Mobile Connect to extend terrestrial mobile coverage and continue satellite handset subsidies for more remote areas; and $90 million for Backing Indigenous Ability to deliver a comprehensive package addressing phones, internet and videoconferencing in remote Indigenous communities and improved Indigenous radio and television.
If the Telstra sale legislation is passed, the government will establish a range of future-proofing measures on top of the immediate investment of $1.1 billion. The perpetual communications fund of $2 billion will be tied to legislated, regular, independent reviews of rural, regional and remote telecommunications services, the first of which would occur three years after any sale of Telstra, or earlier if I so direct, and at four-yearly intervals thereafter.
Labor has opposed this spending and criticised the Liberal and National members from regional areas who have been calling for improved services in the bush. The contrast between the government’s policy on regional communications is stark. Labor attacks the government for rolling out new technology for regional Australia. Labor’s legacy in the bush was to turn off the analog mobile network and leave country phone users stranded.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-08-17,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister’s comments on 26 May 2005 when, of the 201 cases that were referred to the Palmer and Ombudsman inquiry, he said:
This is not the behaviour of a minister who is trying to cover something up.
Isn’t it true that the wrongful detention of two children, Ian and Janie Hwang, who were taken from Stanmore Public School on 8 March 2005, were not among the 201 cases referred to the Palmer and Ombudsman inquiry? Didn’t the minister claim on the AM program this morning that she had referred all cases of wrongful detention to the Palmer and Ombudsman inquiry? Does this mean, using the words of the Prime Minister, that the minister was trying to cover up the cases of the detained Hwang children?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,2,question,84N,
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-08-17,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for taking that on notice and I hope that information will be returned speedily. How many other cases, then, of wrongful detention of innocent people did the minister forget to refer to the Palmer and Ombudsman inquiry? That is the point about whether or not they have been forgotten to be referred. What kind of system, you have to then ask, is the minister running when people can be picked up and detained in the immigration detention system without actually being unlawfully in Australia? Why won’t the minister take responsibility for identifying the full extent of this mess and fixing it once and for all by ordering a royal commission? That is what is required here.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,2,question,84N,
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-08-17,"—The simple answer to this question is that what the Prime Minister said is quite right. I cannot think of a situation where a minister has been presented with an issue—I am not saying that there has not been—and has instructed the department to go back and see where this possibly could have happened on other occasions. The obvious category to look at is people who were released and later found lawful. For the benefit of those senators who do not understand—and I include Senator O’Brien in this category since his question asked about people wrongfully detained and clearly gives away that he either does not understand or wants to continue to mislead—what it means is that someone may well have been rightfully detained, maybe for a short period—
—I am happy for the minister to verbal me, but Senator O’Brien has not asked her a question, so I do not know why he is being verballed as well.
—The minister has a right to answer the question in the way she wants to. I am not going to direct her as to how to do that. But if she has made a mistake I am sure she will correct it.
—I mentioned Senator Evans as distinct from Senator Ludwig because I think he does understand.
—No, you didn’t. You mentioned Senator O’Brien.
—Sorry. My apologies, Senator O’Brien. You probably do understand the difference as well. I thank Senator Evans for giving me the opportunity to highlight the fact that he really does not understand. Therefore, I take the opportunity to highlight, through the answer to Senator Ludwig—I will try to avoid the rest of your mates, Senator Ludwig—that they are people who were later found to be lawful. As you do understand and your colleagues do not, let me say that that may have been because they were detained for a short period while their allegation that they had a visa was verified. It may be that they were detained for a short period while they gave an alternative identity but then coughed up with who they really were. It may be that they were unlawful at the time but later became lawful because either we gave them a bridging visa or the courts instructed us to give them a visa. It may be that among those cases there are cases where, for a variety of reasons, it just took far too long to ascertain that someone had been lawful all along, even though a proper decision may have been made at the time that there was a reasonable suspicion that they were unlawful. In other words, as I said to Senator Evans, that category identifies a whole bundle of people, and I have asked for them all to be looked at. The matter of the children that you raise, on the last advice that I have, is still under discussion with the children’s lawyer. But if you are asking me whether subsequent cases have been referred, I do not know that they have been but I will make inquiries and get back to you about that.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,2,answer,7E4,
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-08-17,"—I have to withdraw half of what I said earlier to Senator Ludwig, because I indicated to him wrongly that I thought he did understand. Yet still he seeks to perpetrate the myth that people who were released, later found lawful, were in fact wrongfully detained. That is simply not necessarily the case. I thought you understood that. I had the good grace to give you the opportunity to acknowledge that you understand that.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! There is too much noise in the chamber. Having conversations while the minister is on her feet is disorderly.
—Having said that, I have made it clear that the government’s purpose in having these looked at is to find out if there are any problems there—if, after the point of detaining, there were cases where people did not do what they should have done when they should have done it. That is the purpose of these being sent to the Ombudsman. It is obvious to all those who think about it for just a moment that when you have a power to detain on a reasonable suspicion, which was there when the other people were in government and is still there now, you cannot expect that to be 100 per cent correct on every occasion. Otherwise you would change the power to detain to be used only when you were absolutely certain. (Time expired)

Will the minister inform the Senate of the government’s position on the further sale of Telstra? How does the government intend to ensure that the maximum value for taxpayers is achieved from the sale?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,3,question,E4T,
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-08-17,"—I thank the senator for her question. Today I am pleased to confirm that, after cabinet and party room consideration, we will be introducing legislation to authorise the sale of the government’s remaining shareholding in Telstra. It is our belief on this side that the private sector is the one best place to be operating commercial businesses, not the public sector. It is the public sector’s job, the government’s job, to be the regulator of these businesses, to set the parameters in which these competitive companies can operate. It is a principle that Labor used to believe in when, in government, they sold Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank, CSL and other such enterprises. Indeed, Mr Beazley, when he was one of my predecessors as finance minister, must have believed this when he met with BHP to discuss with them their purchase of Telstra. He also, as we understand it, had the department of finance at that time prepare a submission on the sale of Telstra. So there is much doublespeak from the Leader of the Opposition on this issue.
We also fundamentally believe that if the government is going to have an investment of around $30 billion in the share market, which is the current situation, that should be in a diversified investment portfolio, not tied up in one telephone company. Nor should the government own over half of the biggest company in Australia. The introduction and passage of the legislation will meet one of the preconditions for sale. My colleague Senator Coonan has outlined how we are meeting our second precondition on the adequacy of service. The third precondition, as we have set out, is to get an adequate return. As we have said, we are not going to sell at just any price. The scoping study that we commissioned advised that we can achieve an appropriate return but that it would be subject to a number of future variables, which include the overall market conditions, the expected demand for Telstra shares, Telstra’s performance, the outcome of the new CEO’s operational review and the implementation of the regulatory changes we have announced.
The ideal window for sale is around October-November 2006. So we are not in a position in August 2005 to predict how all of those variables are going to look by the end of next year. We as a government, subject to the parliament giving the executive government the authority to sell its shares, will consider whether or not we will exercise that authority early next year, when we can be more certain about market conditions and likely demand for our stock. Part of that decision will be whether we sell part or all of our remaining shares in 2006. There is the option of a partial sale. If we pursued that we could then place any remaining shares directly into the Future Fund. Given that the Future Fund will be managed at arm’s length from the government, we as the government would then no longer be the owner and could focus entirely on our proper role as the regulator of telecommunications in this country.
If we are to proceed with the sale in late 2006 we now need to start making appointments of key advisers such as the joint global coordinators. The department of finance will be advertising in around a fortnight’s time to start the selection process for those advisers but on the clear understanding that no decision has yet been made on the sale.

Opposition senators interjecting—
—I am sorry, Mr President, I cannot hear—
—As I said earlier today, persistent interjections across the chamber are disorderly. We have a right to hear what the minister has to say.
—The question that Senator Conroy asked and the way in which he has framed it show, in my view, a complete lack of understanding about what has been achieved since this government started down the path of deregulation of telecommunications services, and about where we are going on telecommunications with the announcement of today’s package. Let me just recap. The government has already spent over—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Evans, yesterday you made comments about how we should keep order in this place. I would ask you to talk to some of your colleagues.
—The government has already spent over $1 billion in telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia alone, which has simply transformed the way in which telecommunications services have been improved in areas to do with mobile telephony, to do with broadband roll-out, to do with consumer safeguards and to do with a robust competitive regime. That, of course, has meant that competition has met many of the needs of rural and regional Australia for both greater choice and availability and in terms of cheaper prices.
The package that has been announced today builds on these very important steps and continues the investment that Australia will make over the next four years. This $1.1 billion package further identifies how this country can take advantage of new networks and smart networks, can take advantage of fibre optic that already exists right across the country by allowing it to be deployed into up and down main lines, local loops and wireless loops, and can take advantage of new technology, in circumstances where Australians can expect that over the next four years they will continue to have access to the very best telecommunications that are available in the country, and on a comparable basis to what is available in metropolitan Australia.
The Labor Party seems to be critical of this proposal, but included in it is $90 million for the most disadvantaged Australians—that is, Aboriginal communities, many of which do not have even a proper, basic pay telephone service available. We think that is important. We think that nobody should be left behind as far as telecommunications go, which is why we have a broadband connect program of almost $900 million, a program for mobile telephony, a program for smart networks and a program for Indigenous Australians. We think that together these address areas of market failure.
Telstra’s proposal was much more expensive and was predicated on the basis that competition in this country would be rolled back to allow Telstra to continue to upgrade its networks. Part of its proposal was to upgrade in a lot of commercial areas where Telstra will upgrade in any event. What we are about is getting the very best value for taxpayers by encouraging competition and making sure that we offer subsidies for all telecommunications services. We do not pick providers and we do not pick technologies.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-08-17,"—Senator Conroy, as usual, is absolutely dead wrong. All of the programs are open to competitive broadband providers for all technologies. In fact, Senator Joyce is perfectly right. Past experience has shown that, with the coordinated infrastructure fund deployed for clever and new innovations, there is leverage available from private investment and from matched funding from state and territory governments. I hope that somebody else asks me a question about this because I can give some very specific examples where the infrastructure that has been rolled out includes new microwave backbone networks that enable both investment from the private sector and innovative and new solutions.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-08-17,"—I thank Senator Ferguson for his important question and the inherent commonsense contained in it. As a prominent Australian once said:
In a nation of 17 million people struggling to modernise its economy, seven separate systems of industrial regulation are an absurd luxury.
Let us try to find out who said that. Once again, the Labor Party are very strangely silent, including Senator Hutchins. But Senator Hutchins should know, because it was the former Labor Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. Seven separate industrial relations systems, which are a large and unnecessary cost to the community, are a great disservice to the workers of this country.
Take, for example, Mr President, our home state of Tasmania, where the Tasmanian Industrial Commission costs just over $2 million per annum to operate. And what does it do? Its main function seems to be to simply rubber-stamp national wage case decisions. As an aside, the President of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission is also a member of the federal commission. The situation is so farcical that the workers in Tasmania have their wage increase delayed because the Tasmanian Industrial Commission has to rubber-stamp that which the national wage case has determined. As a result, for the cost of $2 million per annum, Tasmanian workers have the benefit of having their wage increase delayed! The cost in Tasmania is $2 million; nationally it is $120 million. A lot of hospital beds could be bought with that sum. With the introduction of a national system, governed by the Fair Pay Commission, not only would the unnecessary costs be saved but workers and their families would actually benefit.
The irony is that not only does Mr Carr support the national system; so does the Victorian Labor Premier, Mr Bracks. And so, too, does somebody else, who said of a national IR system:
... you can contemplate a whole range of efficiencies that would occur in the economy and in the system if that were to take place.
I will allow the Labor Party to have a guess at who said that. I will give them a hint: no, it was not the one who is going to New York; it was somebody else. It was none other than their shadow minister for industrial relations, Stephen Smith.
Once again, we have a situation where Labor leaders know what needs to be done. They know what the country needs, but they do not have the ticker to do it because they are beholden to the trade unions. They will serve the trade union interest rather than the national interest. Until such time as Labor put the national interest before the trade union interest, they are unfit to govern this country.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Industrial Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,5,answer,N26,

Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Interjections across the chamber, from both sides, do not help. I cannot hear what the good senator is saying. I ask her to repeat the question.
—I draw the President’s attention to the implications of the proposed welfare to work reforms for foster carers. Minister, I draw your attention to the important role played by the 8,000 foster carers in Australia providing care for approximately 11,500 children. Minister, are you aware that foster carers are subject to the proposed welfare to work reforms, under which carers receiving parenting payments will be moved to the Newstart allowance once their youngest biological child has turned to six—meaning that they will be obliged to seek paid work, even if they are fostering an infant? Can you explain how this is in the interest of the children, their carers and the wider community?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Welfare to Work Reforms</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,6,question,E5Z,
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-08-17,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given the important role that carers play in giving children in unfortunate circumstances the opportunity to live meaningful and productive lives, will the government undertake to recognise foster care as work for welfare to work purposes?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Welfare to Work Reforms</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,6,question,E5Z,
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-08-17,"—I thank the honourable senator for her question. The Howard government values the very important role that foster carers play, including grandparents who raise children when parents are unable to do so. About 20,500 children are in foster care, and an estimated 31,000 children aged between zero and 17 live with grandparents. The Australian government does an enormous amount to assist foster parents through the family tax benefit. In relation to the issue of the Welfare to Work program, when a parent, whose youngest child is six, goes back into the work force for 15 hours a week—and I have answered this question before—the parent’s circumstances will be taken into account. If a parent is caring for a child with a disability, that precludes that person from undertaking 15 hours of work a week; if a person needs to travel to work and that makes it more difficult for them to undertake 15 hours of work a week, that precludes them; or if a person is caring for an older person, they may be precluded.
I am sure that the question would be more appropriately directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, but I have been involved in the task force. Of course, other caring responsibilities will be taken into account. If the child is over six—it will be different when the child is under six—the parent’s caring role will be taken into account, as I said, whether it is a parent—
—They are rewriting the supplementary question!
—Order!
—The President of both sides!
—I did call them to order.
—New York, New York!
—Order! Senator Ian Campbell, that is not helpful.
—I understand the problem that the senator had in asking the question, because I could hardly hear what she was saying for all the interjections, and I am sure she is interested enough and wants to hear my answer. The minister has indicated, as I have, that people’s caring responsibilities will be taken into account when asking a person to return to work, and it will be assessed whether they are capable of doing 15 hours of work. This is about ensuring that we increase the participation rate and that we ensure that people’s skills do not get out of date.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-08-17,"—With all due respect, Senator, I do not know whether you need to recognise it as work. You need to recognise their caring responsibilities, as we will recognise the caring responsibilities of a person caring for an older parent, caring for somebody else for whom they have responsibility, such as an ageing sibling with a disability, or caring for a child that has a disability that precludes the person from working 15 hours a week. Those caring responsibilities will be taken into account, as will foster care. Some people will foster a child who is over six. That will be a different matter from fostering a child who is under six.

Will the minister inform the Senate on the outcome of the 2004-05 migration program and what Immigration is doing to support the skills needs of employers in this program year? Further, is the minister aware of any alternative policies in this area?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,7,question,E5V,
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-08-17,"—I thank Senator Parry for his question and I look forward to many more from him in that respect over what I hope will be a long and very distinguished career. The final outcome of the 2004-05 migration program—that is, the non-humanitarian and non-refugee elements—is 120,060 migrants. It is the largest outcome since the late eighties. The program delivered record numbers of skilled migrants to Australia: 77,880 visas were granted under the skills stream in 2004-05. That was made up of 39,430 visas granted to skilled primary applicants—that is, the worker—and 38,450 visas granted to their immediate family members. That is an important point to make, because I do not think it is understood—certainly not by Ms Macklin, on the basis of her question in the other place yesterday—that the numbers that come in under the skilled migration intake encompass the primary applicant and the various members of their family. It will differ from skilled visa to skilled visa, but the important thing is that the number of migrants coming in under the skilled migrant intake is not simply made up of skilled workers but will include family members.
Visas granted under the skills stream account for about 65 per cent of the total program, compared to 62 per cent in the previous year. That means we are continuing to shift the program more and more towards skilled migrants who can bring Australia the skills that she needs. Improving the targeting of skilled migrants has resulted in increases over the previous year’s numbers: in terms of doctors, nearly a 300 per cent increase; nurses, about a 40 per cent increase; accountants, about a 48 per cent increase; and tradespersons, about a 38 per cent increase. The number of skilled migrants going to regional Australia is at an all-time high. About 18,700 visas were granted under state-specific and regional migration categories in 2004-05, which is nearly a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. We are committed to working to assist employers to recruit the skills that they need.
This financial year, we have allowed for an additional 20,000 places, which should take the skilled migration stream to 97,000, and I would expect a similar breakdown within that of people who are the primary applicant for the skilled visa and their families. Many members of their family—spouses, partners or children—will also be skilled, but the primary applicant would be about 50 per cent of the stream. We expect within this increase to particularly target employers—because they know best whom they need—states and regions to be sponsors. After that, of course, there will be an expansion of the general skilled migration pool for those businesses who are not particularly motivated to be sponsors. We have put 13 senior officers out to work with industry groups to assist them with that. We are running employer seminars to assist them with sponsoring.
Senator Parry, there are many other good things that we are doing, and the comparison between us and previous governments is a good area that you might like to ask me about. I think that is particularly relevant, since not only is there clearly a misunderstanding about the whole migration program on the other side but also there is a clear inability to recognise their own failure in terms of skilling Australia when they were last in government. In particular, in relation to that, I point out that there were 382,400 apprentices in December 2004. When Mr Beazley was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training there were 122,700. The now Leader of the Opposition presided over one of the smallest intakes of apprentices in Australia’s history. (Time expired)

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-08-17,"—I thank Senator Conroy for the question. I want to first of all make clear that the government does not have a slush fund for telecommunications, or indeed for any other purpose, so there will not be any payment made from any fund of that kind or character. I utterly reject the imputation in that question. It was probably out of order. However, I am not taking a point of order.
—Get on with answering it then.
—I am very happy to. What the proposal from Telstra involved was the idea that Telstra’s portion of the $3.1 billion would be invested in metropolitan and large regional centres, in almost entirely commercial areas. That would be expected to be required in any event over the proposed five-year time frame for competitive reasons—that is, when Telstra upgrades its network it is going to be doing so in commercial areas. That seemed to be largely related to the $3.1 billion proposal.
That was to be accompanied by an investment from the government—to the tune of about $2.6 billion—which would make it pretty much entirely responsible for the full funding of network upgrades in rural and remote Australia. That was also to be accompanied by a significant wind-back of competition, which I understand the ALP supports. In fact, we have been exhorted to get tougher on competition. This proposal from Telstra proposed a significant wind-back of the telecommunications specific legislation, which the government does not find appropriate because there are lots of other benefits from having competition.
What we wish to do is to have an investment fund—we think the taxpayer will get more value out of the package we have designed. Telstra will have a very big share of that in any event because, as I have said, these subsidies target uncommercial areas and obviously Telstra has a footprint across Australia. That means that in some areas Telstra is the only provider that is able or willing to actually provide that service.
We take very seriously ideas that are brought to us. We receive a lot of them. I evaluate all of them as serious proposals, as indeed this was.

Metropolitan black spots are in fact provided for. There has recently been a discussion paper outlining the proposed framework for the program. It has been released to assist consultation with industry and other stakeholders. Once again, in Jackie Kelly’s electorate—as in anyone’s electorate—where there are black spots in an outer metropolitan area there will be an opportunity for providers to be able to design solutions.

Is the minister aware of reports yesterday of a survey that shows Australians are wary of genetic testing and the potential misuse of genetic testing in Australia? Is he also aware of the fact that we have documented cases of genetic discrimination now in Australia, including one case where a man was rejected by the Public Service because of a family history of Huntington’s disease? Is he also aware of cases of insurance applications being rejected because of applicants having had a genetic test?

I thank the minister for his answer, but I ask him whether he recalls that, when I asked him a question regarding this issue on 11 May this year he responded, ‘I can say that the government hope to finalise their response to the report shortly.’ I ask the minister: exactly when will the government respond to the ALRC? Also, does the minister understand that, despite his reference to our privacy regime and the Privacy Commissioner, there is no protection of genetic privacy or outlawing of genetic discrimination specifically in the legislation, which is why the ALRC has made a number of recommendations. Is he also aware that the NHMRC has said specifically that implementation of the recommendations in Essentially yours is important and should take place without further delay?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetic Privacy</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,9,question,3I6,
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-08-17,"—I am not aware as to where the government’s response to the ALRC report that Senator Stott Despoja refers to is. I undertake to take that up with the Attorney-General. I will advise Senator Stott Despoja in due course. I can say that this is a very important issue and one which I am aware of. I am aware of the survey that was mentioned by Senator Stott Despoja. The government takes the view that you should not have a situation where people are required to undergo genetic testing and that then is provided to insurers and other entities for the purposes of assessment in relation to some premium or something else. That is an essential privacy issue and one the government is indeed concerned about.
In relation to our privacy regime, however, we have the Privacy Commissioner, who oversees that. In Australia we have quite a robust privacy regime for the individual. But, certainly in relation to genetic testing, that is an issue that we take seriously and we do not think it is appropriate that people should be in a situation where they are tested genetically for assessment for work or insurance purposes. As to the response to that report, I will take that up with the Attorney-General and advise the Senate.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetic Privacy</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,9,answer,9X5,
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-08-17,"—I can only reiterate my undertaking to the Senate to chase up this matter with the Attorney-General. Regarding the other matters that Senator Stott Despoja raised, I recall that there is one privacy principle that states that any entity which contains private details of a person faces action from the Privacy Commissioner if they are improperly used. That could relate to someone who has taken a test from someone and then unlawfully provided it to someone else. Certainly, in relation to any compulsion, that is a matter that I will have a look at and get back to the Senate on, as well as the information I mentioned earlier.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetic Privacy</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,9,answer,9X5,

Can the minister confirm reports in the Herald Sun last month that the immigration department has commissioned a secret review of Australia’s skilled migration program? Is it true that many skilled migrants are either unemployed or working in low-skilled jobs because the government has failed to ensure that skilled migrants actually get jobs in areas of skills shortage? Is it also the case that there were 122,000 fewer Australians in training in 2004 compared with 2003, and that that was the biggest fall in more than a decade?

Can the minister confirm that, since 1998, the government has turned away 270,000 Australians from TAFE but by next year we will have imported an extra 270,000 skilled migrants since that year? Why is the government continuing to increase the skilled migration program when it does not meet the needs of business? Why isn’t training Australians first the government’s top priority?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,10,question,E5X,
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-08-17,"—Senator Polley, you do not know how much I thank you for the question. You asked me about the investment in skills training and whether such an investment would in any way have contributed to a lesser requirement for skilled migrants now. I started to make the point, in response to Senator Parry’s very helpful question, that there were, in rough figures, 382,400 apprentices in training as at December 2004. That is an increase of 166 per cent since December 1995.
When the current Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Training in 1993—he is now your leader, Senator Polley—he presided over a fall to a low of 122,000 apprentices. Since December 2003 apprenticeship commencements in trades and related occupations have increased by 14 per cent, down from 19 per cent growth in 2003-04, but that is not unusual as, traditionally, there were fewer apprentices starting an apprenticeship in the December quarter. In the year to December 2004, there were 263,100 apprentices in training commencements, compared to 70,000 in training commencements in March 1996.
I know I have a hearing problem, but just in case you did not hear it, Senator Polley, I will repeat it for your benefit: in December 2004 there were 263,100 apprentices in training commencements, compared to 70,000 apprentices in March 1996. There were 70,000 apprentices when your party left government and now we have more than three times as many apprentices. Commencements in skills based apprenticeships rose to 12,500 in December 2004. That is an increase of 51 per cent since December 2003. Thirty-nine per cent of apprentices are in trades and related occupations, yet those occupations make up only 13 per cent of the work force. So trades and related occupations make up 13 per cent of the work force, but 39 per cent of apprenticeships are in trades and related occupations.
The government Skills at work report found that new apprenticeship completions have increased 280 per cent since 1996. I am very concerned—as is the relevant minister—to ensure that the states and territories sign up to the training agreement that is being offered. That training agreement will very quickly provide additional places. The reform to Australia’s VET system and the increased funding provided by the Australian government are providing increased opportunity. The current offer to the states and territories provides for an additional 128,000 places.
Because of the changes we have made, the current crop of migrants we are bringing in have unemployment rates lower than the Australian average within 18 months of their arrival, labour force participation rates higher than the Australian average and weekly earnings higher than the Australian average. Compared with migrants who arrived when your party was last in government, unemployment rates have halved, indexed average weekly earnings have increased by 50 per cent and participation rates have increased by 10 per cent.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-08-17,"—I tried to indicate this in an earlier question, but I will repeat it for your benefit. In the skilled migration intake you do not expect every person who comes in to be a primary applicant. I might just draw your attention to that answer. It was given and you were here, so you did hear it and you do understand. You will therefore understand that the figures that Ms Macklin was using, which is why I raised that today, are not a correct assessment of the number of skilled workers coming into Australia.
With respect to TAFE, I come back to the point I made. You will know, Senator—I know that you are not a complete fool and you do understand this—that the states are responsible for TAFE training. You understand that there is an offer there for them to take up where many more places could be put in immediately. When we came to office there were an estimated 89,300 individuals who applied for but were unable to gain a place to study in a VTE course and 69,400 of those were seeking a place in TAFE. One of the propositions being put by the minister responsible is that you should go back and speak to some of your state colleagues about the charges that they are putting onto TAFE students.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-08-17,"—Senator Sherry asked me a question yesterday about the inclusion of bank fees in the CPI. I have an answer to that question. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The answer read as follows—

Yesterday I was asked by Senator Sherry why bank fees will only be included in the Consumer Price Index for the first time later this year.
The decision as to what items are included in the basket of goods and services (and their respective weights) for the purposes of measuring the Consumer Price Index is a matter for the professional judgment of the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Financial services have not traditionally been included in the CPI because of methodological difficulties in constructing a reliable measure of price changes.
However, following a review in 1997 it was decided to commence a research program to develop a measure suitable for inclusion in the CPI.
The result of that research program was an Information Paper released by the ABS in April 2005, entitled Experimental Price Indexes for Financial Services 1998 to 2003.
The ABS has also announced that as a result of the research work now undertaken, they will be in a position to include financial services into the CPI in a new group for ‘Financial and Insurance Services’.
The information paper explained some of the methodological difficulties associated with measuring price changes for financial services. For example, the approach of measuring only the direct fees and charges levied on financial products is not robust as it fails to take into account the potentially offsetting movements in interest rate margins.
It is also important to remember that a simple snapshot of fee income to financial service providers is not sufficient for inclusion in the CPI, because it does not separate price and volume effects as the CPI endeavours to do. As mentioned in my answer yesterday, the Reserve Bank maintains such data, indicating that fee increases have been largely driven by increased volumes of accounts and transactions and have been offset by reductions in interest rate margins.
Finally I note that the experimental series developed by the ABS indicates that since 1998, the cost of financial services has grown by 18.9 per cent, compared with a CPI of 17.7 per cent—that is, roughly in line with the rate of inflation.
Prices actually fell between 2000 and 2002, driven primarily by the abolition of inefficient state taxes like the Financial Institutions Duty as a result of the Government’s tax reform package, which was opposed by the Australian Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Bank Fees and Charges</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,10,1,speech,JX4,
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by Senators Fifield and Conroy today relating to telecommunications.
I am hoping that, now that his first speech is out of the way, Senator Joyce might be able to join the debate and express his views other than in the 1½ lines that we had today. We are looking forward to you taking the opportunity today, Senator Joyce, to join the debate now that you are unencumbered by your first speech. What a week it has been—what a seven days in politics! We have seen one of the fastest sell-outs politically in years. Senator Joyce, you may be shepherded out of the chamber by Senator Boswell and pushed out of the chamber by Senator Heffernan, but you will not be able to escape from the truth of your own words. Yesterday in your first speech you said:
What cannot be changed and is still the dilemma is that politics talks in riddles and packs with verbiage what is absolutely crystal clear at the mothers morning tea or the local hotel. Politics appears to be the art of telling half the story and your followers guess the rest while using the absence of the complete message as a defence against the implication drawn by your deriders.
When things get contentious we blame our faction or the joint party room as a reason that plasters over a personal political ambition.
How true those words are in relation to Senator Joyce! When Senator Joyce and the Queensland National Party ran a separate ticket, they stated that they were opposed to the sale of Telstra—no ifs and no buts. You can ask Senator Ian Macdonald—he knew they were having a lend. You can ask Senator Joyce. Let us be clear. Senator Joyce came to this chamber championing his position opposing the sale of Telstra. Inside of seven days of being sworn and after three days of pressure from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, Senator Coonan and Senator Minchin, he has folded. But to try and cover the fact that he has folded, he keeps walking around saying, ‘No it’s not really $1 billion; it’s $6 billion.’ Senator Joyce, I refer you to your first speech, where you said:
Politics appears to be the art of telling half the story ...
In Senator Joyce’s case, it is not about telling half of the story; it is about multiplying it by six! Senator Joyce has convinced the government to spend exactly what they were already spending. Congratulations, Senator Joyce—you are a legend! ‘Backdown Barnaby’ will live in political infamy!
—Senator Conroy, you should refer to senators by their correct title.
—I accept your rebuke, Mr Deputy President. Thirty pieces of silver is an acceptable price for selling out. Senator Joyce has three pieces of silver—that is all. As we know, Mr Trujillo came to Canberra last week. What an appointment he has been! If you were Mr McGauchie, the chair of Telstra, you would have to be looking over your shoulder right now, because Mr Trujillo told the truth. He stood up and said, ‘I have to tell the truth to the Australian public,’ clearly implying that somebody else might not have been telling the truth about the state of rural telecommunications services in this country.
We know who it was. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and Senator Coonan for 18 months have been walking the length of this country saying, ‘Services are up to scratch.’ You may laugh, Senator Marshall, but they have. They told the Australian public in the lead-up to the last election that they could sell Telstra because services were up to scratch. Yet Mr Trujillo, inside of a month, told the truth that all Australians have known for the last nine years: services are not up to scratch.
We should never have doubted Senator Minchin. Senator Minchin said that he would not be rolled by those hicks from the National Party, and he was dead right. I will never doubt Senator Minchin again! But let us be clear: in his first speech Senator Barnaby Joyce called for secret ballots in the Senate chamber. Why? So that you can say one thing in Queensland and vote another way and keep it secret here. He wants a secret ballot because he does not have the courage to stand up for what he has talked about for nine months. He wants a secret ballot so that he can tell the people of Queensland that he really did vote against the sale of Telstra while he slips the ‘X’ into the other box. What a hypocrite! What a farce! Here he is, wanting secret ballots to hide from the Australian public what he intends to do in a couple of weeks’ time, which is to vote for the sale of Telstra.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,11,1,speech,3L6,
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-08-17,"—Let us not be confused by ‘Confusing Conroy’ anymore. He is a man who seeks to confuse Australia on a broadcast day like this about the government’s intentions. Quite simply, Senator Conroy, the government has come up with a marvellous package called Connect Australia, which will give access to all Australians to first-class telecommunications services with a $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband, new regional clever networks, mobile services and improved Indigenous communications. In addition, there is a $2 billion program for a dedicated communications fund which will be established. The earnings from that fund, the interest on that fund, will be available to provide new communications services for rural Australia.
Senator Conroy, you can hardly say that the government has not delivered on its promises to look after the telecommunications services in regional Australia, and you have to give credit to Senator Joyce for the part he has played in achieving this. It is an outstanding package and one which will give a lot of comfort to people all over regional Australia, which is an area that Senator Conroy perhaps does not have a lot of knowledge of, coming as he does from central city Melbourne, where telecommunications are regarded as always being very good and up to date. But it is not the case, I have to tell you, in regional Australia.
—You don’t spend much time in Melbourne.
—I know I do not, but there we are. It is a city in which I find my mobile phone always works when I go there. I can pick up broadband whenever I turn on the internet. But it is a different story if you go to a place like Marble Bar or somewhere in western Queensland, where they do not have those sorts of services. But they will be provided under this package which the government has introduced.
The government has never made any secret of its desire to sell Telstra. We have always promised—do not leave Senator Conroy; if you do not want to hear the detail we can fax it over to you afterwards so that you will be better informed in future—that we would make sure that telecommunications in regional areas would be kept technologically up to date following the sale of Telstra, and this package provides a mechanism for doing that.
We have to remember that the government allocated sums of $180 million to address the recommendations made by the Estens inquiry and the earlier, Besley, inquiry. This program is going to provide an interest amount from the $2 billion which will be used to fund this communications fund. The interest on it will be equal more or less to the kind of money that was spent on addressing the problems Estens identified. This will be available on a yearly basis. Surely to goodness, even people who are as unfamiliar with the uses to which money can be put as Senator Conroy is can understand that the interest on $2 billion is going to provide a fund under which telecommunications services in regional areas will be maintained at a very high level.
The immediate upfront $1.1 billion funding includes: $878 million for Broadband Connect, to provide all Australians with affordable broadband services; $113 million for Clever Networks, to roll out innovative broadband networks for new applications to improve delivery of health, education and other essential services in regional Australia—very important; $30 million for Mobile Connect, to extend terrestrial mobile coverage and continue satellite handset subsidies for more remote areas of Australia; and, on top of all of that, there is $90 million for Backing Indigenous Ability, to deliver a comprehensive package addressing phones, internet and videoconferencing in remote Indigenous communities and improved Indigenous radio and television. This is a marvellous package. It is a tremendous package for regional Australia. The government is very proud to have come up with a package like this, in keeping faith with the people of regional Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,11,1,speech,4L6,
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I follow my colleague Senator Conroy in speaking on this take note of answers motion with profound disappointment in the outcome, not least because of Senator Joyce’s massive sell-out on the sale of Telstra but because of the implications for people right around Australia, particularly those in rural and regional areas but also those in metropolitan areas. For many years the Labor opposition has been extremely diligent in forensically drawing out information on the appalling conduct of Telstra in the Australian telecommunications marketplace—appalling conduct that has been singularly condoned and encouraged by the Howard government for the sole purpose of fattening up their bottom line for this moment.
I am astounded by the ignorance with which the National Party senators have chosen to break a promise that they made at the last election—the promise they made saying that they understood this, that they understood how profoundly Australians had been ripped off with respect to telecommunications for the last nine years. The Nationals in Queensland claimed they were opposing the sale because it was only through the retention of the majority of Telstra in public hands that these problems could be solved.
Today we see something very different. We see a package announced by the Howard government that they claim will solve these problems. I can tell you after three Senate inquiries, the Estens inquiry, the Besley inquiry and numerous investigations into the conduct of Telstra by the ACCC, the Productivity Commission and the minister’s own request for further information, Telstra as a company are incapable of servicing rural and regional Australia. They are incapable of it because they have allowed their network to run down to such a terrible state that they cannot provide the services.
I do not think it is possible to observe this massive sell-out without looking at some of the facts that underlie the problems in the Telstra network and at why this so-called $1.1 billion will be so completely ineffectual in resolving them. There are a couple of issues. First of all, we know that barely more than 1,000 of the 5,500 Telstra exchanges in this country are ADSL—or broadband—enabled. Is the Howard government saying that all of those exchanges will be ADSL enabled? I can tell you that Telstra’s response to that, despite previous offers of funding and access to some sort of taxpayer subsidy, have determined that this is not commercially viable for them. They would rather sit back and brush aside the complaints than service the needs of rural and regional Australians. We have thousands of exchanges in rural Australia that have not been upgraded and are unlikely to be. We do not know how the funds that have been provided now are going to be spent. If we look at how they have been spent in the past, we know that Telstra will continue to use them for bandaid solutions. That will not serve the long-term needs and interests of rural and regional Australia.
Another issue that I have a few words to say about is line splitting or pair gain technology. There are 1.2 million people in this country serviced by inferior, el cheapo technology called pair gain that is totally unsuitable for broadband. In fact, it blocks broadband. Telstra has not agreed in any way, shape or form to remove these broadband blockers from their network. There is no sign in this agreement that this will be done. We know that Telstra themselves previously put on the public record that the costs of removing broadband blockers in their network are around $5 billion to $8 billion. So how is $1.1 billion going to solve these broadband blockers and get them out of the network? I can tell you that 400,000 or so of these people are in rural and regional Australia, but 800,000 people who are on a broadband blocking technology are in metropolitan areas. They are in new estates and high-rise buildings in the CBDs of the cities. There are no solutions in this sop. There are no solutions in this slush fund that has been offered to The Nationals for telecommunications in this country. It represents the biggest sell-out in telecommunications—(Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-08-17,"—Mr Deputy President, if you ever doubted that the Labor Party have utterly marginalised themselves in this debate then you only had to listen to the two previous speakers who carried the debate in this chamber. Frequently they are the two, the tag team, who stand up to debate the Telstra issue. They could not have been more marginalised in their presentations today, after the announcement today by the Prime Minister and the minister for communications—in fact the whole government—in relation to the future proofing plan of Telstra, an announcement worth some $3.1 billion. All we hear from Labor is that same old bogey—‘don’t sell Telstra’. They lay their whole case on the basis of antiprivatisation. First of all, no-one believes them because of their record in government, no less than the outrageous and dishonest sale of the Commonwealth Bank. More than that, they utterly underestimate the constituency, particularly in rural and regional areas. The constituency in those areas is not against the privatisation of Telstra at all.
—I raise a point of order. Mr Deputy President, I believe that Senator McGauran specifically misled the Senate on that point.
—There is no point of order.
—Although Senator Lundy has gone into shock over that statement, let me repeat it. She underestimates the constituency, in particular, of the rural and regional areas that are not against it in the main. If you look hard enough you will find some against—
—I raise a point of order. Mr Deputy President, I believe Senator McGauran is misleading this chamber.
—There is no point of order.
—She is reeling in shock. The point is that rural and regional people are quite pragmatic about the ownership of Telstra. They know it is not who owns Telstra, government or private, it is whether the services can and will be delivered and are up to scratch. That has been our position all along. If you think that they are hooked on some ideological bent in regard to the sale of Telstra then you are out of touch—and, of course, you are. Last week Labor brought in a matter of public importance quoting some pretty dodgy polls from the Canberra Times and elsewhere in regard to the populism position they are taking: that rural and regional areas are against the privatisation of Telstra. Let me remind the other side, for the umpteenth time in this debate, that we have gone to the election on four occasions with this policy and we, as a coalition, hold more rural and regional seats than you. That is the ultimate poll, and that is the ultimate piece of evidence that you need. Every time you try and trump this up as an issue in this chamber, let alone out in the electorate or at election time, you fall flat. Today you have fallen completely flat. Talk about flogging a dead horse. Senator Ronaldson, you will probably get your turn tomorrow because last week and this week is the only chance they have to run on it. We will start a tag team match ourselves against Lundy and Conroy. Ronaldson and I will get up and we will debate—
—Senator McGauran, please refer to Senators by their correct titles. I have pulled up a couple of people on both sides for this today.
—He was formerly Mr Ronaldson, now Senator Ronaldson. The government have had three planks on this matter. First of all, we have sought to encourage competition. Second, we have sought to bring regulation to the industry across the board—such as a customer service guarantee. Third, where the market fails the government will inject funds, in particular in rural and regional areas, to fill that market failure and to bring the infrastructure and services up to a parity. The coalition believes that the sale of Telstra has always been in the public interest, let alone in the interests of the 1.7 million existing shareholders.
The five minutes given for this are not enough for our case to be put, but I recommend that the opposition go to today’s press release from the Prime Minister and the minister for communications to read about the $3.1 billion to be injected into rural and regional areas particularly, and to understand that this is a major policy which will be supported by the rural and regional areas, despite your anger and feigned objection.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,11,1,speech,WH4,
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-08-17,"—As a regional and rural Queensland senator, I am astonished at the contribution made by Senator McGauran. He had the audacity to say that regional and rural Australians do not oppose the sale of Telstra. I think that is what he said. He is nodding.
—Yes.
—That is in fact what he said. I saw the Newspoll in the Australian yesterday that said that 70 per cent of Australians were opposed to the sale of Telstra and that in Queensland that figure is closer to 80 per cent. Eighty per cent of Queenslanders in rural and regional areas and in the cities oppose the sale of Telstra.
—Rubbish.
—I saw it in Newspoll—
—Till services are up to standard.
—I want to go to that question. At the last election, Senator Joyce and other National Party candidates stood on a platform that was absolutely plain and clear—they were opposed to the sale of Telstra. There were no conditions. This was not a conditional pledge. This was a straightforward pledge to Queensland that they opposed the sale of Telstra.
Queensland has been dudded at the very first test of Senator Joyce. The man has been walking around Queensland for the last nine months pledging himself to represent his state. In his very first speech in this place he committed to supporting the sale of the rest of Telstra. Queensland has been dudded absolutely in a political sense, and we can also say goodbye to proper communications systems for most of our state. Senator Joyce knows absolutely too well—or at least he should; maybe he does not—that most of Queensland does not live in the capital city. We are a decentralised state, and we rely on very strong communications in order to run our businesses and to keep in touch with the rest of Australia. We have the most to lose of any state, and last night it would seem that we lost it.
Senator Joyce has said many times, including last night quite interestingly, that he is going to represent the interests of his state and not the interests of his party. He said that at the beginning of his speech last night. By the time he got to the end of it, he had committed to selling Telstra. I do not know what can happen in a 20-minute speech that you can convince yourself that the best way to represent the interests of Queensland is to sell Telstra.
The question that needs to be asked is: why do so many Australians, and 80 per cent of Queenslanders, oppose the sale of Telstra? It is because these people understand how the communication markets work. They know that once Telstra is privatised, once Telstra’s responsibility to turn a profit for its shareholders is its first and only priority, it will remove itself from unprofitable markets—that is, markets that do not turn a dollar for its shareholders. I would suggest that those markets are all of the areas outside the east coast of Queensland. Every single communications receiver outside of that east coast will be an unprofitable market and therefore Telstra will have to be pushed into doing anything about delivering those people services.
People out there know that when the banks were privatised and deregulated there was no compulsion for them to remain in the bush, and they left. People have seen the evidence in the banking industry, and they know that is what is going to happen to their communications sector. The other thing that Queenslanders have been dudded over is this notion that there is an enormous amount of money that is going to fill the void of providing them services. I suggest that Senator Joyce has a good look at the fine print of what the government is proposing. It is not too late for Senator Joyce to say quite clearly that he actually does represent Queensland and that he is prepared to stand up for Queenslanders and do what 80 per cent of us want him to do, and that is oppose the sale of Telstra. I encourage him to look closely at the fine print of the financial proposals that the government has put forward and to think about the people who voted for him.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-08-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Stott Despoja today relating to genetic testing and privacy.
Today I asked about the issue of genetic privacy and genetic discrimination, and I was somewhat heartened to hear that this was an important matter for Senator Ellison. He said that it was an issue of concern for the government. This made me quite happy, Mr Deputy President, because for many years now, as you may or may not be aware, I have been going on about this issue. It is about time that the Australian government legislated to outlaw discrimination on the basis of genetic information and to protect genetic privacy in Australia.
I was concerned that I did not get a specific response. That is, I wanted to know exactly when the government was planning on responding to a very impressive report—a report initiated, I might add, by this government, albeit in response to some work that I had done. Nonetheless, the report was initiated by the government. It was an ALRC and AHEC—Australian Health Ethics Committee—report into the issue of genetic privacy. That two-volume report of hundreds and hundreds of pages does recommend some action that the government can take in order to ensure that people’s genetic privacy is protected. That report was completed in March 2003 and we have yet to see a response from the government. I have reason to believe that action by various ministers, because it does cut across various portfolios, including that of the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Attorney-General and others, is about to take place—at least, I hope so.
This is not a complex or difficult issue for the government to address. In fact, the volumes of this report show how simply the government could undertake this issue. They could amend the Privacy Act, as has been suggested before—and as I have certainly attempted to do through amendments—and they could amend the Disability Discrimination Act. Contrary to Senator Ellison’s response today, which referred to the role of the Privacy Commission and the Privacy Act, there is, unfortunately, no specific reference to genetic information—though there is reference in the national privacy principles, as Senator Ellison referred to in his response. In the law, however, there is a reference to personal information or to health information. I would like to make it very clear on the record today that health information does not always cover genetic information. Genetic information is even more sensitive and even more personal—in fact, it is familial.
The thing that we have to remember is that the result of a genetic test is predictive; it is not certain. In my question to the minister today I referred to part of a report that was released yesterday that shows Australians’ attitudes towards genetic testing and, in particular, their wariness and concern about genetic testing. We need to remember that this is not only positive—because we want people to use the technology—but also nerve-racking. A lot of Australians are wary of having a genetic test because they are worried that they are going to be discriminated against when it comes to applying for insurance. We have documented cases of discrimination. They are worried that it is going to affect their employment. We have seen a man rejected from the Public Service because he had a family history of Huntington’s disease. That is outrageous. One of the banks initially rejected an applicant because that applicant had a genetic test that showed that they may develop a certain disease. Again, predictive; not certain—yet people are being discriminated against. For a whole range of reasons—pregnancy, race, gender et cetera—we would not allow that to happen under our discrimination law. All of these things are protected in law. So why is it that, in this new scientific age, where we have the wonderful, dazzling benefits of technology, we also find that this technology may be used against us?
I have been on about this since I introduced a Private Member’s Bill in 1998—which went to a committee in 1999, which then led to the ALRC report in 2003. The results of the survey released yesterday made it very clear that Australians are suffering because this area of law is not covered. A simple flick of a ministerial pen could change all of that. I promise I will support the government when they do it, but I do ask them to do it quickly because, until we do, we are lagging behind the rest of the world. That is not right, considering that report is of world-class standard—in fact, it is the best in the world. Let us act on the research, get changes to law and protect all Australian citizens in this way.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-08-17,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move:
That the following delegated legislation be disallowed:
Export Control (Meat and Meat Products) Amendment Orders 2005 (No. 1) made under regulation 3 of the Export Control (Orders) Regulations 1982.
Income Tax Assessment Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 2) as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 75 and made under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
Modification Declaration No. 1 made under section 177 of the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997.
Veterans’ Entitlements (Veterans’ Children Education Scheme—Scholarships, Statistics, MRCA) Instrument 2004—Instrument No. R11/2004 made under subsection 117 of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the Committee.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

Export Control (Meat and Meat Products) Amendment Orders 2005 (No. 1)

These Orders make various amendments to the Principal Orders including ensuring that the matters which must be notified extend to changes in, or convictions incurred by, all persons who manage and control operations at an establishment regardless of whether the occupier of the establishment is an individual, a corporation or a partnership.
New subclause 12.4, which is inserted by item [40] of this instrument, requires an occupier of a registered establishment to give the Secretary written notice if the manager or controller of operations carried on at the establishment is convicted of a serious offence. It is not clear whether this subclause is intended to create an obligation on the part of the occupier to inquire about any convictions that a manager or controller may have or, conversely, whether there is an onus on managers or controllers to inform occupiers about such convictions.
The Committee has received a response and proposes to seek further advice from the Minister.

Income Tax Assessment Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 2), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 75

These Regulations amend the Principal Regulations to reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs by allowing amounts in a foreign currency to be translated into Australian currency or an applicable functional currency using rates of exchange other than those currently prescribed in the income tax law.
The amendments in Schedule 1 to these Regulations are taken to have commenced on 1 July 2003. The Explanatory Statement indicates that this is the same commencement date as the relevant sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. However, the Explanatory Statement does not contain any assurance, in terms of subsection 12(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 that no person other than the Commonwealth is disadvantaged by the retrospective operation of these amendments. The Committee sought an assurance that no person had been disadvantaged by the retrospective commencement.
In seeking this assurance, the Committee also sought clarification regarding the operation of subregulation 775-145.01(6). This subregulation is taken to have commenced on 1 July 2003. It provides that an entity can withdraw an election to apply forex realisation events to foreign currency, or fungible rights to receive or provide foreign currency, only if it does not appear, on reasonable grounds, that the election is being withdrawn for a principal purpose of obtaining a tax benefit. This appears to contemplate the possibility that the withdrawal of an election may, retrospectively, be found to be invalid, thus disadvantaging the entity.
The Committee has received a response and is seeking further advice from the Minister.

Modification Declaration No. 1 made under section 177 of the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997

The Committee notes that section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 directs a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken particularly where a proposed instrument is likely to have an effect on business. Section 18 of the Act provides that in some circumstances consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate. The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Act requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken. The Explanatory Statement that accompanies this Declaration makes no reference to consultation. The Committee therefore sought advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation.
This Declaration commenced on the date it was signed, being 2 May 2005. The instrument was registered on 6 May 2005. The consequence of subsection 12(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 is that where an instrument takes effect before the date it is registered, the Committee requires that the Explanatory Statement give an assurance that no person other than the Commonwealth is disadvantaged by the retrospective commencement. The Explanatory Statement accompanying this instrument does not give such an assurance.

Veterans’ Entitlements (Veterans’ Children Education Scheme—Scholarships, Statistics, MRCA) Instrument 2004—Instrument No. R11/2004

This instrument was made on 9 December 2004. Clause 2 of the instrument states that it commences on its approval by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. That approval was given on 4 January 2005. The instrument was registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments on 5 April 2005.
Section 55 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 has the effect that where a legislative instrument was made before 1 January 2005, but was not published in the Gazette before that date, the instrument is to be treated as if it had been made on 1 January 2005 and thus comes under the requirements of the Act. It does not appear that this instrument was published in the Gazette before 1 January 2005. If that is the case, the instrument is subject to the Act.
If this instrument is taken to have commenced on the date of the Minister’s approval (4 January 2005), and the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 applies, an issue may arise under subsection 12(2) of the Act. That subsection provides that an instrument which purports to take effect before the date it is registered has no effect if it adversely affects the rights or liabilities of a person other than the Commonwealth. While it appears that this present instrument does not have any adverse effect on persons other than the Commonwealth, no such assurance is given in the Explanatory Statement. Indeed, the Explanatory Statement indicates that there is no retrospective effect. The Committee therefore sought advice about the proper commencement date of this instrument and an assurance that it does not adversely affect persons in accordance with subsection 12(2) of the Act.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,NOTICES,13,1,speech,VJ4,

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-17,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Senate and all political leaders to express strong support for multiculturalism in Australia as playing a key role in the battle against extremism, in light of the increased public vilification and antagonism towards Muslims and other ethnic communities in Australia.
I only have a short time to contribute to this debate on the motion that the Democrats have put forward, and I thank colleagues from other parties for their support in bringing it on. It is an urgent and straightforward matter. We as a nation—and, indeed, as a global society—are currently looking at the challenges put forward by extremism and people urging violence upon many aspects of society, for a whole range of reasons. Extremism is not new, and ideologically motivated extremist violence is not new either, but in the modern world it can touch all of us much more, wherever we are in the world. What is new for Australia is the recognition that we are less able to be immune from the consequences of some of those aspects of extremism and extremist motivated violence.
The key aspect of this motion that I have put forward today—and I hope it is a non-controversial one for all of us here—is to try to provide an opportunity at the early stages of the debate, which has been renewed following the London bombings, for all members of this Senate to reaffirm our strong support for multiculturalism and the key principles of equality that underpin it. It is a key solution to dealing with the threats posed by extremism, particularly in the light of some of the increased public vilification and antagonism towards some in our community following the London bombings—most notably Muslim communities in Australia, but others as well. The actions of a few white extremists in parts of my own state of Queensland have got more attention than they deserved but, nonetheless, they got attention for their attempts to spread blatantly racist, extremist and violent assertions around their local community.
The extra need to pass this motion, I believe, is twofold. Firstly, as part of those attacks on some people of a particular ethnic, cultural or religious background in Australia, there have also been attacks on multiculturalism. We have had the usual complete misrepresentations of what multiculturalism is about by some of those in the media who practice divisiveness as a matter of course. Piers Ackerman is one name that springs to mind as someone who says that multiculturalism has always argued that every culture and every political ideology is equal. Of course it has not at all. We have had similar sorts of assertions from Janet Albrechtsen, for example, that multiculturalism allegedly promotes all cultures as equal.
All of those people—deliberately or ignorantly, I do not know—ignore the key fact that when we are talking about multiculturalism, a key principle is recognising the importance and value of diversity in the context of a liberal democratic country which at its own core has diversity as a key value. That is why we are a liberal democratic country; that is why defending democracy is so important in all contexts, let alone the context of threats from extremists. The key principle of democracy is enabling expression of diverse views within the framework of those core values. The key principles of multiculturalism are also recognising the benefits of ensuring that all people can equally participate in society and that they can all contribute something of value, regardless of their cultural background, their religious heritage, the colour of their skin or anything else. That is the key aspect of multiculturalism. It is the keystone which is hand in glove with the foundation of liberal democracy in Australia.
The best way to fight extremism is through promoting diversity and connectedness between communities. The absolute certainty whether you promote segregation or assimilation—as I think Arnold Zable wrote in a column in the Age a few weeks ago—is that they are basically two sides of the same coin. We have seen many examples of that around the world where you have people from different backgrounds living in a community. If you try to segregate them, divide them or separate them out as having different values, different characteristics and different worth, that is the inevitable road to violence, extremism and injustice.
This motion is to emphasise multiculturalism not just on its own merits but as a key value in tackling extremism. That is something that I believe needs to be reaffirmed by all of us, whatever our political persuasion, so that we can put that aspect of the debate to bed and ensure that all Australians can participate equally and with security in the difficult challenges we have to face into the future in tackling extremism. I hope this is something that all members of this chamber can support, because it is something that I think we need to use as a simple building block to really move forward in a united way. If we allow ourselves to be divided and if we allow ourselves to have our democratic values stripped away in response to threats from terrorists or extremists of any sort, then they are halfway down the track to winning.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1,speech,DT6,
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2005-08-17,"—I support the sentiments of the motion moved by Senator Bartlett, but I do have some concerns about what this motion does not say, as opposed to what it does say. I say to Senator Bartlett that implicit in this motion is the charge that a current or future increase in extremism is or will be directly related to this chamber’s level of commitment to multiculturalism or the level of commitment of our political leaders to multiculturalism. That is obviously patent nonsense. Also implicit in this motion is that there is such a lack of commitment to multiculturalism by this chamber or our political leaders that there is a rising level of public vilification and antagonism towards our Muslim community as a result. Again, with the greatest respect to Senator Bartlett, that is patent nonsense. I say to Senator Bartlett that not only is this patent nonsense but it is actually deeply offensive. And I would have thought, ironically, that it would be deeply offensive to his leader.
Surely we are not so immature as a nation that a debate on extremism or totally inappropriate public vilification of certain sections of our community is reduced to a debate about who is more committed to multiculturalism. So that Senator Bartlett does not rush out and continue this foolishness by saying that the government is not committed to multiculturalism, I am regrettably forced to again put on the public record the government’s commitment. I will then get back to the nub of this debate. The government is deeply committed to multiculturalism. It is one of Australia’s major achievements and a natural response to our cultural diversity and our democratic Australian values. It is worth looking back at our history.
On 30 October 1996, the Prime Minister moved the parliamentary statement on racial tolerance. The statement passed both houses of federal parliament, unanimously reaffirming the parliament’s commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society, united by an overriding commitment to our nation and its democratic institutions and values. The government’s vision for a diverse but united Australia remains as valid as ever today. In 1999, in response to the landmark report by the National Multicultural Advisory Council, the government released its multicultural policy, A New Agenda for Multicultural Australia. It was updated in 2003 in the statement Multicultural Australia: united in diversity. The government believes Australian multiculturalism is for all Australians and emphasises mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The government believes the policy also unites Australians for a common commitment to the basic structures and principles which underpin our democratic society.
The Living in Harmony initiative is the government’s antiracism campaign. It is directed at the wider community. It supports local solutions to local issues through community grants and partnerships with national organisations to promote harmony and understanding. The government’s multicultural policy and its programs seek to capitalise on our strengths to benefit us all, to guarantee us all fairness and to strengthen our community through encouraging equality and belonging. Senator Bartlett, I reinforce the government’s commitment—and my own commitment—to multiculturalism. Public vilification and antagonism against any section of our community, whether Christian, Jew, Muslim, Palestinian, Kurd or anyone else, is abhorrent to all of us and is totally un-Australian.
As I said in my maiden speech, terrorism and extremism are the greatest threats to our region and to democratic nations throughout the world. Quite simply, we must work together to address this threat. The challenge is enormous. Everyone in this chamber would agree that it is not a short-term challenge; it is a short-term, medium-term and long-term challenge.
What is important is an acknowledgment by all of us that the Muslim community in this country is under threat from within. Radical clerics and spokespeople are undermining the genuine endeavours and the commitment of the moderate majority as they try to deal with extremism and negative perceptions. To reinforce that point and the threat from within—and to reinforce the difficulties that the moderate majority Muslim community in this country are up against—I will briefly quote from the transcript of an interview between Sheikh Mohammad Omran, who is based in Melbourne, and Peter Overton on 60 Minutes on 24 July this year:
PETER OVERTON: Who is responsible for September 11?
SHEIKH MOHAMMAD OMRAN: I don’t want to say USA Government, but I would say some of them, they are responsible for that.
PETER OVERTON: The Government is responsible?
SHEIKH MOHAMMAD OMRAN: Yes. Yes! I believe in that 100 percent. I believe there is—what they call it? A conspiracy against Islam and Muslims.
PETER OVERTON: I think the average person out there would be amazed that you don’t think Osama bin Laden was responsible for September 11.
SHEIKH MOHAMMAD OMRAN: There is a mastermind behind these things and the mastermind 100 percent he is from the US Government.
There are a number of those kinds of examples. I am not going to go through them because the risk is that that would reinforce some negative perception.
I quote from this to reinforce how we as the wider community have to passionately support the moderate Muslim community. We must support them to ensure that they are able to fight that threat from within. We must encourage that moderate Muslim community to stand up and support the wider community in ensuring that the voices of those who threaten not just the Muslim community but the wider Australian community are no longer heard. Whether, as I said in my maiden speech, the approach of Tony Blair, who seeks to deport radical clerics, is the answer the wider community wants and the moderate Muslim majority wants or not—and it is certainly my preferred course of action, as I said in this chamber the other night—we have to work together to support those who are committed to fighting extremism.
I would be bitterly disappointed if Senator Bartlett’s claims of the extent of vilification against the Muslim community are true—and I must admit that I do take some issue with Senator Bartlett about that. If I am wrong, I humbly apologise to him. But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness of the majority of people in this country. And I fundamentally believe that they are as supportive of the endeavours of that moderate Muslim majority as everyone in this chamber is. If anything is to come out of this motion today—apart from a reinforcement of our commitment to multiculturalism—it should be to reinforce that this chamber passionately supports the majority of Australians who passionately support that moderate Muslim majority. If we achieve that today then it has been a successful motion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1,speech,XT4,
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-08-17,"—There were a couple of issues that Senator Ronaldson went to that I cannot let pass without comment. One of those issues is this government’s commitment to multiculturalism. I would put more than a question mark over it. This government can and do adopt an approach of what I might call ‘glad handling’ and doing the multicultural festivals. But when it comes to the hard yards of promoting this area and ensuring that there exists a true spirit of multiculturalism they are absent from the field. They do not defend it in the public forums; they do not defend it in the private forums. They disappear. They are nowhere to be seen when it comes to the hard yards that have to be made in this area. When you look at some of the material that this government puts out under the banner of multiculturalism, you do not see documents that portray this government’s commitment to multiculturalism. What you see instead is a jungle full of impenetrable documents.
One example comes to mind when you look at the Public Service. You would expect that the executive government could ensure that the Public Service had a commitment to multiculturalism. However, if you take the first example—that is, the access and equity report—you find that all the report does is simply provide a bit of backslapping. It does not provide a detailed way to ensure that this government maintains its commitment to multiculturalism, it does not ensure that there is a way for this government to assess how its own bureaucracy deals with multiculturalism and it does not ensure that the departments in fact adhere to the principles that our fine Senator Ronaldson was espousing. There is no test; there is no performance measure.
The access and equity report is a way, unfortunately, in which governments can simply provide a self-promotion of how they meet the goal. There is no external assessment as to whether they are in fact meeting performance, whether they have criteria to meet, other than flipping out an example of how they do meet it, all from their own records, not from a detailed analysis of how the departments themselves have been able to meet it.
Multiculturalism is not just a facet of our society; it is now a reality in Australia today. For too long, multicultural affairs has been ignored by this government. It has been an afterthought, an add-on or an optional extra not significant enough to warrant much initiative or consideration, let alone any defence of the issue. But the fact is that multiculturalism is simply indispensable to Australia. Our unique and wonderful blend of race and culture puts us in a position perhaps unrivalled anywhere else in the world. The concept of multiculturalism is not a new one. Government settlement services policy in Australia very quickly evolved from assimilation and integration to multiculturalism. It did not happen simply for the sake of it. As a national policy we tried assimilation, we tried integration and, bluntly, they failed. They should have failed and they did fail.
In 1966 the Henderson inquiry found that migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds suffered from high poverty rates. By the early 1970s many settlers were leaving Australia. They came and settled and then said, ‘We’re going back; this is too hard.’ So many settlers were leaving Australia that an inquiry was held to find out why. It is a complete waste of everyone’s time, money and effort if we manage to attract these migrants to live here but when they arrive they find it so difficult to get assistance and to establish a new life in our country that they get discouraged, they pack up and go home. What a mistake it is that this government is moving to attract 20,000 more skilled migrants but, at the same time, is ambivalent about defending the way in which we welcome them and acclimatise them culturally into this country. That is why a settlement services program is integral to immigration policy. That was why the Whitlam government immigration minister Al Grassby first adopted and began implementing a policy of multiculturalism. If immigration is integral to the success of our nation then so too is multiculturalism. The government knows that but continually chooses to ignore it.
Multiculturalism is not only about providing settlement services to migrants; it is also about promoting community harmony. There are twin goals. But times have changed since the 1970s, and we are now living in a world where terrorists seek to destroy the harmony and relationships that we have all sought to build over time. Events such as the bombings in Britain, the attacks of September 11 and, more close to home, the Bali bombings have unsettled some members of the community and, unfortunately, provoked some incidents of vilification and antagonism towards Muslims and other ethnic communities throughout Australia.
Senator Bartlett has brought this matter of urgency before the Senate, and I agree with him: it is a matter of urgency. We must all make it clear that we will not let such attacks—whether they occur on Australian soil or overseas—affect that which we have worked so hard to establish in this country. It is important to recognise that all groups in our society can contribute to the campaign against the threat of terrorism and thereby enhance our security.
If we continue to assist in providing a strong sense of belonging to all members of the greater community, the various groups in our society will come together and reject elements espousing extremist views. They will be more likely to report them and engage with our enforcement officers and our community. The vilification of any group within our society, especially the Muslim community, as a reaction to Muslim extremists and terrorists overseas will do nothing but be counterproductive to Australian security at home. Vilification of and antagonism towards Muslims and other groups within our community will, in truth, only serve to isolate them, thus cutting them off from the broader community, in direct contradiction of the definition of multiculturalism and what it seeks to achieve.
The feeling that migrants no longer belong could have the effect of driving more moderate people towards extreme views. It creates fertile ground for extremists to recruit and operate. The end result is that vilifying one section of our society only serves to undermine the very security we are trying to enhance. Multiculturalism is not only about settlement services but about social cohesion, the ability to bring people into our communities, inclusiveness in terms of building the services, self-dependency amongst groups and being able to engage with other groups. It does mean abandoning any of your cultural backdrop or the rich tapestry from where you came. It is about sharing and opening up your heart to others within the community and demonstrating your commitment to Australia, and it is about how Australians can demonstrate their commitment to ensure that you can celebrate with them both their culture and the culture of others. Vilification destroys that.
In 1999 a report of the National Multicultural Advisory Council looked at ways that our cultural diversity could become a unifying force for Australia throughout this century. Do not forget that that report was conducted prior to the terrible events of September 11. The aim of terrorists is to do just that—spread terror. By using attacks they are attempting to promote suspicion and fear within the society that we have created, and of course ignorance is their greatest tool. If we as members of this society choose to divide and segregate then they will win. But together and unified our diversity could become our greatest weapon.
Let me put it in this way. There are Muslims who live here and many are Australian citizens. They are not going to depart Australia. They are not going to leave if we end multiculturalism tomorrow. They are here to stay. The question we need to ask is: do we have a system which ensures social cohesion and respect for the law and Australian values, or do we turn our back on multiculturalism as a means of achieving this? The Muslim community in Australia participates and must continue to participate in the fight against terrorism, as does every other religious order, group and part of our community. It is about ensuring that all of our community recognises that terrorism is against the community, our social cohesion and the fabric of our society. It is not wanted, is not needed and should be rooted out.
There is a battle going on for the hearts and minds of disenfranchised, angry young men, be they of the Islamic or Christian faith, not just in Australia but throughout the world. In this country our best mechanism of defending ourselves against radical extremism or misguided interpretations of Islamic or other theology is to talk with and engage young people and find the places where assistance and help might be needed. It is much better and in the interests of all to look for common interests and goals amongst all Australian people. That is what multiculturalism, in truth, is about. Islamic radicalism is not covered by multiculturalism. A commitment to multiculturalism includes a commitment to this country and its laws.
Labor will not shy away from this issue or from continuing to support multiculturalism. It is something of which we can all be proud. It is something we have built together over time and something for which Australia can hold its head high on the international stage as one of the truly great countries in the world. Australia has sought to promote multiculturalism and has been successful with it. Multiculturalism is about accepting that we are not all the same and celebrating that very fact. It is about welcoming the points of view of others as well as their beliefs and customs. Australia’s future lies in developing our multicultural society. It will not and cannot shy away from it, regardless of the efforts of terrorists either here or overseas.
Labor is proud of its efforts in promoting multiculturalism. We are proud of our achievements. We have no problem at all with unambiguously supporting multiculturalism and standing firm against any act against members of our multicultural community. Multiculturalism makes everyone a stakeholder in this great Australian community. It says, ‘We are all in this together and we can make it work.’ We do not have the problems that beset Europe. If you take Germany or Holland, for example, there is either a perception in the host country that migrant communities are not participating or, alternatively, a perception in migrant communities that they are locked out of participation. Our society is a great society because Australians long ago anticipated the need to deal with mass migration from different cultures and sought a successful way to ensure that that could happen.
All of us must play a part in protecting the great legacy of Whitlam; Al Grassby; Galbally, who is not often mentioned in these debates but who was a leader in the field; and Fraser, Hawke and Keating as politicians who pursued these initiatives. I think I have said this on a number of occasions, but it is always worth saying again: it is one of those phrases that Al Grassby coined. He said:
My personal ambition is that Australians of all backgrounds will always be proud before the world to say in whatever accents ‘I am an Australian’ ...",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1,speech,84N,
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2005-08-17,"—In speaking on this urgency motion, I would remind the Senate that Australia is a very successful and harmonious multicultural society, fostered by successive governments over many years. In my first speech I traced my family’s journey from my father’s arrival in 1953 to the day he sat proudly to watch his daughter in the Senate. I relayed my parents’ story which, like that of millions of other migrants, is a story of hard work; of dedication to the cause of building a better life for themselves and their family; and of pride and satisfaction as they look back over the years and the vital contribution they have made to the nation’s economic, social and cultural success. Their vision was one of a diverse but united society founded on important values such as support for family values; a strong work ethic; respect for its laws; of learning English as their new language—whilst retaining their original language; of community interaction and voluntary service; and the need to live in peace and harmony. This vision for a diverse but united Australia remains as valid today as it was for those millions of migrants who made Australia their home.
The government is committed to its multicultural programs. They have been one of Australia’s major achievements—a natural response to our unique cultural diversity and democratic Australian values. As Senator Ronaldson mentioned, on 30 October 1996 the Prime Minister moved the Parliamentary Statement on Racial Tolerance, which was supported by both houses of our parliament. It reaffirmed the commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society—a society united by an overriding commitment to our nation, and its democratic institutions and values.
Australia’s multicultural policy is one for all Australians. It is a policy based on the important tenets of mutual respect and shared responsibility. It unites Australians through a common commitment to the basic structures and principles which underpin our democratic society. I would like to take a moment to highlight some of the features of that policy. The government’s programs encourage responses to cultural diversity issues by the public, private and community sectors. Such programs as the Access and Equity Strategy make sure that all Australians have equal access to government services, irrespective of language or background. The Australian government also actively promotes the use of our cultural diversity as a rich source of language skills within our work force.
The Living in Harmony initiative is the government’s anti-racism campaign directed at the wider community. One of the aspects of this program is Harmony Day, and I was particularly pleased to represent the minister at various Harmony Day celebrations this year. It is a program which supports local solutions to local issues through community grants and partnerships with national organisations to promote harmony and understanding.
The government’s policy and programs seek to capitalise on our strengths to benefit us all, guarantee us all fairness, and strengthen our community through encouraging equality and belonging. Today’s new arrivals are assisted by generous, world-class settlement services. When millions like my parents arrived here, there were no such services. Getting a job and becoming self-sufficient was the key to building a better life for yourself and your family. Our generous settlement services demonstrate in a practical way that our newest migrants and humanitarian entrants are welcome in Australia. Equally importantly, such services help immigrants to adjust to Australian life and facilitate them to become productive members of society.
I have lived my life across the diversity that is Australia. I was born in Port Kembla. I grew up in Wollongong—a city where people from many different parts of the world came to work, raise their families and live harmoniously together. It was a city where its schools taught the many children of migrants—many not speaking English at first but soon learning to integrate, tolerate and forge lifelong friendships across the diversity. Over the years I have observed firsthand that Australia is a place where all of us, despite our differences, have shown that we are willing to listen, discuss and consider. Australia is a tolerant and compassionate society founded on understanding and respecting differences. With this tolerance has come the responsibility of integration in the Australian way of life and a respect for Australian customs and usages. In a globalised world this openness of approach has proved to be a great asset. It is also our strength against terrorism and extremism.
The attacks of September 11, the Bali bombing and the London bombings have put multiculturalism under the spotlight. We therefore cannot be complacent regarding the success of government policy to date. Recently, we have seen media coverage about the ethnic composition of our migration program. There have been unfounded and racist attacks published in the media on some of our newest communities. However, if we do move away from our policies of inclusiveness we risk playing into the hands of terrorists. Through partnership with the Australian Muslim community, the government is taking a strong stand against those who threaten Australia’s community harmony and way of life.
The Prime Minister is chairing a summit with key representatives from the Australian Islamic community on 23 August. This summit will discuss how we can work together to address extremist views in the Australian community. The summit will also focus on ways we can enhance social cohesion within the Australian community and eliminate intolerance and extremism. Furthermore, on 5 August the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs met with Muslim and media representatives to explore ways to achieve a more informed media debate. A similar forum is planned for Melbourne on 31 August. In conclusion, the government is absolutely committed to policies of mutual respect and to an inclusive Australian society.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1,speech,E4T,
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-08-17,"—The Greens wholeheartedly support the motion before the Senate. We endorse the need to strongly support multiculturalism in Australia and hope that all senators will join us in this view. Multiculturalism in Australia is a fact. It is not a theory or an experiment, as some would have us believe. It is a fact and has been at least since European colonisation of the continent began. Those who contend that Australian culture has ever been homogenous are simply wrong, and there are generations of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, Chinese, Jewish, Arab, Irish, Pacific Islander, German and so many other cultural groups living in Australia who are proof of this.
Australia is a multicultural nation—perhaps one of the most multicultural nations in the world—but it is not this fact that we should be grappling with but, rather, how we as a nation should manage our multicultural nature. It is the attack not only on the fact of multiculturalism but also on the policy of promoting multiculturalism that has given rise to this debate, and it is an attack which the Greens utterly reject. The motivations behind these attacks, including the ridiculous arguments put forward by former Nationals senator John Stone, are at their core racist. They exploit the phenomenon of bin Laden inspired terrorist acts to make claims for racist immigration policy, cultural assimilation and cultural and racial isolationism.
The Greens are proud of Australia’s progress down the road of celebrating our multiculturalism. In the face of opposition, the reaction should be not to give in to hate and prejudice but to redouble our efforts at better understanding one another and at learning and living with our multiculturalism. It is important to be clear about what this means. Celebrating multiculturalism is not the same as tolerating different cultures. Enjoying the benefits of multiculturalism is not about coexisting with other cultures—it must be more than this; it is about living with, interacting with and valuing our different cultures.
If we can only tolerate and respect and not interact with and value our different cultures, then multiculturalism has stalled and the racists will be empowered. We should note the prevalence of the language of ‘respect’ and ‘coexistence’ that permeates recent racist discourse. This means that all communities must make efforts not to defensively close off to one another during times of tension but, instead, continue to interact, to welcome and value one another. This is not about assimilation: assimilation is about dominant cultures killing off others. Multicultural interaction is about growing cultural understanding and celebration.
The positive stories of cultural diversity in Australia outweigh the demonising myths of the racists a thousandfold. Any reasonable analysis of the cultural diversity of Australia’s recent history will attest to the overwhelming benefits it has brought to all Australians. The Greens welcome the opportunity to recognise this fact, to reaffirm the importance of multicultural celebration, and look forward to a culturally diverse future for Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1,speech,00AOR,
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I too have followed the debate in the media about multiculturalism with interest, and sometimes with alarm, depending on the opinion. Australia is composed of people originating from many different countries: 43 per cent of Australians were born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas. There are 200 languages spoken in Australia. We are a multicultural country and will continue to be. The fact is we cannot do away with multiculturalism in this country without proposing some sort of other practical way to address the diversity in our country. That is what a lot of the debate that has gone on in the media has not addressed. If multiculturalism is not the way of the future, if it no longer copes in our country, what do we replace it with?
In the Labor Party we do not believe it needs replacing. We believe that multiculturalism, as a philosophy, has adapted and expanded to deal with our society. As other speakers have said, multiculturalism has brought great benefits to Australia. It has been widely acknowledged that the diversity and strengths that multiculturalism bring have been of great advantage to Australia.
There was quite an interesting quote in the Australian Financial Review on the weekend. There was an interview with the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. Speaking about China, he says:
You’ve got to fear China and you’ve got to embrace it. Take advantage of its market and know the only way you are going to win is if you bring something new. You’re not going to win with a me-too product.
Further on in the article he says:
I don’t think the distance between Australia and China, compared to the US and China, is giving you any competitive advantage. It is the number of [Chinese] people you have. It’s the knowledge base, the feel you have. I think the more Chinese people you have, the better.
He goes on to explain that one of the great advantages for the United States is its diversity of people.
Certainly one of the great advantages for Australia too is its diversity of people. Not only does it assist us in the areas of trade and foreign affairs but it has also made our everyday lives much richer and more valuable in cultural areas like philosophy, literature, music and also in the skills it has brought to Australia. There are many areas like medicine and industrial areas where the skills have been of tremendous value to Australians. Also, the hard work and family values and the depth it has brought to Australian life has been a well acknowledged facet of multiculturalism.
But there is the question today of—under the changed circumstances of terrorism, following terrorist attacks in the United States, England, the Middle East and other areas of the world—can we in Australia unite in harmony? Can we have cohesion in our society with such diversity? We have a long history in Australia of citizens of Muslim faith and it has not been recognised as a problem. The issue now is that some people are worried about the number of people of Muslim faith in Australia and the number who have what is regarded as an extreme view of that faith. We must be realistic in our view of this. A lot of the Muslim leaders in Australia are very realistic about it. For example, Dr Zachariah Matthews, head of the Australian Islamic Mission, said of young people in the Muslim community:
...we cannot allow them to be misled by those who are using twisted logic combined with hate-filled revenge to justify terrorism under the banner of Islam, because the killing of innocent human beings can never be endorsed as Islamic.
He goes on to talk about the need to include young Islamic people in Australian culture. So there is a recognition within the Muslim communities of the dangers of not being a part of the Australian community and not fully including young people in our society.
I do not think we have anything to fear from Muslim culture, and its differences, providing that the moderate force prevails in our society. Indeed, in Australia we have laws and regulations which ensure that Australian values are preserved. If there is any fear about the influx of people of different cultures and religion coming into Australia then we need to address it through an examination of our laws and regulations rather than tarring all people of that religion or ethnic group with the same brush.
I think the answer from all sides of this chamber today is that we can live in harmony providing we address correctly the way we live. Senators from the government side have talked about the government’s initiatives in promoting harmony. Indeed there is a particular Living in Harmony initiative and Harmony Day has been a part of that. It has been a very useful initiative in bringing people together. I applaud the government’s response in that area, but in their own report, Multicultural Australia: united in diversity, they talk about the access and equity issue. The report says:
The primary objective of the Access and Equity strategy is to ensure that government services and programs are attuned to the realities of diversity in Australian society. There is a strong case for better developing even greater levels of government investment in vulnerable individuals.
I think that is the key point here—the government’s failing has been in developing that access and equity for vulnerable individuals in our society. I have no problem with the government referring to it as an investment, because it is indeed an investment in people, an investment in our country. The issue is that the government programs have not been sufficient in the areas that are critical to people coming into this society, wanting to learn English, wanting to get a job and wanting to get some assistance with settlement so that they and their family can be properly part of the Australian community. It is in those areas of education and employment that I think the government has been lacking, and because the government supports multiculturalism it should pay more attention to these critical areas to ensure that we do continue to benefit from the input of diverse societies within our community.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1,speech,E4U,
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-08-17,"—Like other government senators, I support the motion. Multiculturalism has been a central fact of Australia’s national life for some 30 years now. The reason it has been a central fact of our nation’s life is because it has been embraced with equal commitment by both sides of politics. I am at pains to say that because, listening to Senator Ludwig earlier in the afternoon, one may have thought that it is one side of politics—the Australian Labor Party—which has contributed more to the development of multiculturalism in this country than the non-Labor side of politics. Not so.
The necessary prerequisite to the development of multiculturalism was the elimination of a racially discriminatory immigration policy. That process—a process that happened on both sides of Australian politics—was begun by the Holt Liberal government in 1966 and brought to fulfilment by the Whitlam Labor government in the early 1970s. Both sides of Australian politics contributed to that fundamental reorientation of Australian values. Much has been made of the role of Mr Whitlam and Mr Grassby in the development of multiculturalism, and I acknowledge it, but there is another person who I think shares equal honours with Mr Grassby to be regarded as the father of Australian multiculturalism, and that is Mr Petro Georgiou, the member for Kooyong.
I want to read to the Senate a lost piece of Australian history, which is recounted by Dr Mark Lopez in his book, The Origins of Multiculturalism in Australian Politics 1945-1975. Dr Lopez speaks of a function hosted by the Greek Australian Liberal Association—GALA—on 26 October 1975. When one dwells on the date—26 October 1975—one can imagine why this important turning point in Australian history was missed. But on that occasion, the Leader of the Opposition, soon to be Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, delivered a speech. Dr Lopez recounts the story:
… Fraser used the GALA Ball to declare his support for multiculturalism and ending the era of Anglo-conformism. Fraser’s speech, drafted by Georgiou, included the following unambiguous statement: ‘We as Liberals are committed to encouraging and supporting diversity in our multi-cultural society. We reject the sterile Anglo-conformity of past days.’ Georgiou, after presenting the draft to Fraser, had questioned him about whether he was aware of the implications of those lines: ‘I said, “Do you really want to say this?” And he said, “Yes”’. Georgiou had wanted Fraser to support multiculturalism but only then realised the extent of Fraser’s commitment. Fraser later explained his motives in these terms: ‘Because whatever the Labor Party was going to do, whatever Gough was going to do, it needed somebody on the conservative side of politics to really say that Anglo-Saxon Australia is dead. This isn’t the kind of society we are.’
That occasion, 26 October 1975, marks the point in Australian history when multiculturalism was officially adopted as the policy position of both sides of politics.
Dr Barry York, the well-known historian of Australian immigration, in a paper published by the ANU in 1996, while giving great credit to the Whitlam government’s initiatives, went on to say:
... multiculturalism’s institutional development and its incorporation into the political structures of society really took place under the Liberal government of Malcolm Fraser. Examples of Fraser’s multicultural structures include SBS-TV and the Australian Institute for Multicultural Affairs, which later became the Office of Multicultural Affairs within the Prime Minister’s Department.
Malcolm Fraser, who is much criticised on my side of politics these days, will always have an honourable place as one of the Australian statesmen who ushered in the era of multiculturalism. In conclusion, I will quote some words he used in giving the inaugural address to the Institute of Multicultural Affairs on 30 November 1981. He said:
... multiculturalism is concerned with far more than the passive toleration of diversity. It sees diversity as a quality to be actively embraced, a source of social wealth and dynamism. It encourages groups to be open and to interact, so that all Australians may learn and benefit from each other’s heritages. Multiculturalism is about diversity, not division—it is about interaction not isolation. It is about the cultural and ethnic differences set within a framework of shared fundamental values which enables them to co-exist on a complementary rather than competitive basis.
Those values, embraced by my side and the other side of politics, have been the shared values of this land for 30 years, and we say, ‘Long may they continue to be so.’

Yes. It is well established that a number of chemicals can affect endocrine systems and thus have the potential to adversely impact on human health and environmental systems. 
(2)   (a)   In 2002 the World Health Organization’s International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) published a ‘Global Assessment on the State-of-the-Science of Endocrine Disruptors’ (available at http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/who) which detailed the available scientific knowledge on a range of effects of so-called endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including possible developmental effects in humans.  The Government contributed funds to this study.

Reasonably extensive information is available on concentrations of some EDCs in the global environment, particularly for those which are persistent organic pollutants.  Australia has measured the occurrence in humans and the environment of a number of chemicals with, or suspected of possessing, endocrine disrupting potential, including dioxins (see http://www.deh.gov.au/settlements/ chemicals/dioxins/ under ‘Technical Reports’) and certain brominated flame retardants (see http://www.ephc.gov.au/ephc/ocp_pbde_human_milk.html).
Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) advises that contaminants in food are regularly monitored by state and Commonwealth government agencies.  These food agencies undertake a comprehensive assessment of the available safety data on chemical contaminants that occur in food, including those that may act as EDCs.
The Department of the Environment and Heritage advises that studies in animals have demonstrated that EDCs can act at multiple sites and have multiple modes of action.  For some EDCs there is broad understanding of these processes at the molecular, cellular and individual organism level.  Impacts at population and ecosystem levels have been observed but are limited to a few situations in which wildlife have been exposed to elevated levels of some EDCs.
No single country can adequately address this broad area of investigation.  Australia is particularly interested in the issue of EDCs in the riverine environment, given the implications for water re-use.  The Department of the Environment and Heritage advises that CSIRO Land and Water has an active research project in this area.  Currently, the national industrial chemicals regulator, National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS), is conducting a scientific review of several groups of chemicals with suspected endocrine disruptor potential (phthalates and brominated flame retardants), as part of an ongoing program to ensure chemicals already in use in Australia remain safe.
(5)   (a)   The Australian Government funds a number of general monitoring programs covering chemicals in the environment, wildlife, food and the general population.  If significant human health or environmental concerns arise, the levels of specific chemicals (which may or not be EDCs) in the environment are monitored.  The Government recently spent $5 million on the National Dioxins Program, of which approximately 50% was used to monitor exposure of the environment and the Australian population to dioxins, a class of chemicals which can be classified as EDCs.

The Government is conscious of the need to protect human health and the environment from the hazardous effects of all chemicals, regardless of whether or not their mechanism of action is via endocrine disruption.  Hence, health monitoring programs for the effects of chemicals are more general in their focus and scope and actual expenditure on monitoring effects of EDCs as a class is not available.
NICNAS is a chemical entity based risk assessment scheme.  As such it has the legislative authority to assess industrial chemicals introduced as individual chemicals, as part of a mixture and as chemicals that leach out of imported articles such as furniture and toys.  NICNAS is currently conducting reviews on two groups of chemicals suspected of being EDCs, namely phthalates and brominated flame retardants.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,27,3,answer,LI4,

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-08-17," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 30 June 2005:
With reference to the report of the Working Party on the Registration of Drugs for use in Children 1997:
Is the Minister aware that an Australian study published in 2002 in Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, looking at the use of unlicensed and off-label medication in the neonatal intensive care unit at the Royal Women’s Hospital, Melbourne, reported that 80 per cent of infants received unlicensed or off-label medication and 93 per cent of infants weighing less than 1kg received unlicensed or off-label medication.
Given that the report was completed in 1997, has the Minister been approached by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to acquaint her with problems regarding registration of drugs for use in children, including problems associated with limitations imposed by legislation.
Have the guidelines of the working party been accepted by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee.
Have the changes necessary for implementation been made to the Australian guidelines for the registration of drugs.
Does the Minister accept as adequate, the working party’s recommendation that the sponsors of clinical trials required for registering drugs be merely encouraged to undertake clinical trials in children; if so, why.
Has the Government provided the additional funding to the TGA recommended by the working party to allow the organisation to process applications of sponsors necessary to extend the approval of use of essential drugs to children; if not, why not.
Which other working party recommendations: (a) have been accepted; (b) have already been adopted or implemented; and (c) have not been adopted or implemented and why.
Is the Minister aware of any steps to develop methods that may result in an increase in the rate of reporting of adverse drug reactions.
Given that it may take many years for the effects of drugs on developing organisms to manifest, is the Minister aware of any steps to develop methods to monitor long-term effects of drugs used in childhood.
Given that the working party failed to address the category of children who are born prematurely, what plans are there for this work to be done.
Given that unborn babies are also exposed to off-label and off‑license drugs such as antidepressants, often with short‑term significant side effects, and that there is no formal mandatory reporting of such events, much less long term follow-up to determine sequelae, what plans are there for this work to be done.
Has the TGA been able to gain access to the information provided to the regulatory bodies of North America and the European Union that has resulted in registration of drugs in those communities that are currently unavailable to Australian children; if not, why not.
Is a formal review of progress on the registration of drugs for use in children to be conducted; if so, when; if not, why not.
Will preterm and unborn babies be considered in further reviews.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Registration of Drugs for Use In Children</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,27,5,question,1M6,
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-08-17,"—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
Yes.
Yes, the report of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Working Party was seen by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Subsequently the issue of paediatric access to drugs has been referred to an Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council (AHMAC) working party, which is due to report later this year.
The ADEC Working Party guidelines were superseded by the development of international guidelines.  The most recent version of these has been adopted by the TGA, replacing the earlier version.
Yes.
Yes, however, the government is unable to compel companies to undertake research in Australia, nor in a global pharmaceutical environment is most drug development undertaken in Australia.  The current format for submissions of prescription medicine applications to the TGA requires companies to justify the absence of data on use in special groups, including children and the elderly.
Mechanisms were put in place to ensure fee reductions or waivers for situations where therapies are required on public health grounds or for small subgroups of patients, but it would otherwise be financially non viable for submissions to be lodged.
(7)   (a) (b) and (c)  Please see answer to Senate Question 907.
(b) and (c)  Please see answer to Senate Question 907.
Please see answer to Senate Question 907.
The TGA undertakes a variety of monitoring activities from the earliest clinical trial usage of a product, through its approval phase, and throughout its post market use.  As part of post marketing commitments, companies are required to report information on any safety issues that arise for the life of the product.   The TGA also works co-operatively with other regulatory agencies around the world.  These steps ensure that there is monitoring of products in the longer term.
It is widely acknowledged that it is very difficult and not necessarily appropriate to require large studies be conducted in very small patient sub-groups, such as premature babies.  However, small sub groups of patients, such as premature babies, are recognised as Orphan populations and particularly may benefit from the Orphan Drug Program, which waives all evaluation fees for submissions to register products for use in such groups.  This scheme was set up to facilitate lodgment of submissions and product access for such vulnerable sub-groups.
The government supports the availability of information on use of medicines in pregnancy.  The product information documents for health professionals contain a section specifically to inform prescribers on this issue.  There is also a Medicines in Pregnancy handbook that contains information for health professionals and patients about the safety or otherwise of individual medicines in pregnancy.
The TGA considers the evaluation reports of the regulators from comparable countries where submitted or relevant to the application.  However, in order for a product to be considered for registration, a sponsor company must still be prepared to make an application and, if successful, to make an appropriate formulation available for supply in Australia.
The AHMAC working party on paediatric access to medicines is due to present its report later this year.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-08-17," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 20 July 2005:
Is the Minister aware that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States of America (US) has produced a DES Update website at www.cdc.gov/des, with important health information for both the public and medical professionals about exposure to the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) and that a link of this website has been put on the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) website.
Will the TGA advice on the world standard protocol of annual DES examinations for DES daughters be adjusted in the light of the information on the US DES Update website.
Will the Minister consider providing a link to this information on the department’s website.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Diethylstilbestrol</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,27,6,question,1M6,
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-08-17,"—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
Yes.
The Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Bulletin published an item on diethylstilbestrol (DES) in June 2004.  In that item it was noted that guidelines for cervical and breast screening for all women are being reviewed.  In the interim, any women with a history of exposure to DES (mothers and daughters) should, at least, follow the current national cervical and breast screening recommendations.  It was further advised that daughters exposed in utero should, if they have not previously, be reviewed by a gynaecologist.
        The US Centers for Disease Control maintains a website that contains specific guidance on the review of daughters exposed in utero to DES.  A link to this site was provided in the bulletin item.  The TGA website also has a link to this site.  The address is http://www.cdc.gov/des/
        That website describes appropriate pelvic examinations for DES daughters and states that the description was published by the National Cancer Institute.  No indication is provided that this description is a world standard protocol. 
        There is no world standard protocol of annual DES examinations for DES daughters.  Specific advice on the management of DES daughters has been provided in the USA as described above.  The French regulatory authority has issued a health advisory to medical practitioners.  That advisory is also adopted by the Canadians and is available on the Canadian regulatory authority website.  Information in that advisory does not include a protocol for annual DES examinations.  Health professionals are advised that if a young woman who knows she was exposed to DES in utero consults for gynaecological or obstetrical reasons, she should be informed of the risks and referred to a specialist for appropriate monitoring.
        The advice in the June 2004 edition of the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Bulletin that DES daughters should be reviewed by a gynaecologist remains current.  Recently the National Health and Medical Research Council published Screening to prevent cervical cancer: guidelines for the management of asymptomatic women with screen-detected abnormalities.  This publication contains a section specifically about cervical cancer in women exposed in utero to DES.
The department already has a link to the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention DES Update website through ‘diethylstilbestrol” on the department’s A to Z index.  The A to Z index on diethylstilbestrol links directly to the TGA diethylstilbestrol web page where there is a link to the CDC website.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Diethylstilbestrol</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,27,6,answer,LI4,
