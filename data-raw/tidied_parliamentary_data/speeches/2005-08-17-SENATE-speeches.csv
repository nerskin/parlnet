"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-08-17,"—The Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill 2005 is before us. In fact, there is quite a long saga in respect of this bill. The Minister for Justice and Customs has extended the cut-over time, but it is worth putting into context how this position has come about. The first time this became an issue was in 2001, or thereabouts, when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was inquiring into the IT outsourcing of Customs matters. That inquiry was about how to move from an old computer system that had served Customs very well to a new re-engineered, integrated cargo management system. Of course, we found fraying at the edges, even back then, in terms of how much this project was going to cost. It was indicated at the time that the cost of this project—and there was a little latitude with it, so I will give the minister that latitude—would be between $25 million and $35 million.
After those particular hearings, the issue of how to introduce the cargo management re-engineering project and the integrated cargo system, which is the computer side of it, started to run off the rails. When Labor looked at it again to see how it was going, we found that it was expanding and drawing in resources from Customs. The costs had started to expand, even before my time as the shadow minister with responsibility for Customs. The shadow minister at the time, Senator Mark Bishop, also examined this issue. This issue has drawn Customs’ resources, time, money and energy for quite some time. At the beginning, the issue involved $25 million to $35 million to get the project up and running. During the last estimates, we found it was somewhere in the order of $180 million and growing. The issue has certainly not slowed down.
One of the key issues is how to ensure that industry integrates with Customs to enable Customs to use the system. Customs then have to ensure that both the business sector and the developers of the hardware and the software come together to ensure that the system works and works well. When Labor examined it in a little more detail, we found that that fraying at the edges had started to in fact tear. This is a bill that is not necessary. It was never necessary, unless you point to some fault or some failing by the government. I think that is where the issue lies.
The government has had nine years to get Customs right, but it has not been able to do so. Having had extension after extension, the government is again seeking a further extension in respect of the imports cut-over time. Exports have ‘gone live’, a phrase used by Customs which means that the system has started to work, at least as far as exports are concerned. We then move to the next phase where imports have to go live, via a computer system that ensures people can process the various issues that surround how cargo is imported into Australia. The integrated cargo system was originally going to start on 1 July. The government has had to come back again and say: ‘We don’t think we can get it up and running by 1 July. We need an extension again.’
There is a question mark over how this government has really worked on this matter. In the nine long years since the coalition came to government, this project has stood as a metaphor for ineptitude: for how not to manage a project and for how to fail to be able to bring together a system on time and on budget. Industry, back in the eighties, realised that it could not have cost overruns and it could not have projects that went over time, because business was not going to put up with it. We find today a perfect example of where the government has been unable to deliver a business project on time and on budget—and it should be ashamed. The minister should be ashamed. He should, as part of his reply, apologise to business for not being able to deliver a business project on time and on budget. The purpose of this legislation stands as a testament to how the government has managed to cause—in my words—business grief. What it will mean, in essence, is that the cut-over date will be extended yet again.
The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act to delay the import cut-over and turn-off times that are specified in sections 5 and 6 of the application act. The import cut-over time determines which computer system a person must use to communicate electronically with the Australian Customs Service. So, in effect, it relates to the way business will interface and deal with Customs. They are going to deal electronically with Customs in the future. What Customs have not been able to do, and what they are now seeking to do with this legislation, is to extend what might be regarded as the cut-over time between the old and the new systems. We have to find a time when that cut-over is made, the old system is retired and the new system becomes operational and the only way to talk to Customs.
The Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 amended the Customs Act 1901 to allow for electronic communication between industry and Customs, using the new system known as the integrated cargo system. In order to allow those who want to communicate electronically with Customs to prepare the relevant systems, the amendments in the international trade modernisation act have been proclaimed to commence progressively. The amendments relating to the importation of goods and the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia were also included in the international trade modernisation act amendments, which commenced on 19 July this year.
It is worth while going back to what Senator Ellison said in April 2001, when he promised Australia:
The modernisation of Australia’s cargo management systems proposed by the Federal Government will significantly enhance the speed and efficiency of Customs services to Australian importers and exporters. The changes offer great potential for business to save time and money through reduced processing and handling costs, improved transit times and increase their cash flow, as well as simplifying and streamlining cargo management processes.
Yet we are still waiting to see the realisation of those benefits, nine long years after they were first promised. The fact that we are now looking at yet another change in legislation in regard to this project is—and cannot be categorised as anything else but—another waste of taxpayers’ time and money. Here we are again, taking up the time of the parliament to fix the minister’s errors—errors which he should have fixed way before we got to this point. Just one month after heralding a ‘new era in cargo management’, Minister Ellison could really only be categorised as having changed his tune. The ‘new era’ is on hold at least until 12 October and possibly until as late as 7 November.
It is true that we live in a globalised world. Imports are relied upon today by retailers and numerous people in the community who depend on them for jobs. Brokers and forwarders, freight distributors and logistics companies all depend on the certainty of deadlines and timetables to make our economy work. Yet in this legislation we see again the incompetence of the minister, who is out of touch with the needs of business and industry and who has failed yet again to meet the deadline he set himself.
The government, and Minister Ellison, will insist that the reason they want to extend the cut-over time is to give industry the opportunity to ensure that all systems are working perfectly before the new system must be used to communicate with the Australian Customs Service. I suggest that, in fact, the reason why industry remains unsure of the reliability and effectiveness of their system is that Customs took so long to deliver it in the first place. Minister Ellison has used industry concerns to justify the repeated extensions to the cut-over and implementation dates. I have to say that that is a tired line. Originally, the Customs management re-engineering project was expected to be completed and up and running in July 2003. That is when it was supposed to have been turned on, have gone live and have been operational.
If this amendment is passed and the new cut-over date is adhered to, the CMR project will be only—only!—2½ years overdue. The only problem is that the new cut-over date proposed in the bill comes right in the middle of the busiest time of the year for industry: the pre-Christmas rush. So the system will be put under immediate stress with the pre-Christmas rush. In contrast to the minister’s original claims during Senate estimates in June, the new 7 November cut-off date in this amendment falls smack bang in the middle of the pre-Christmas rush. Industry will now have to adjust to using this new system and deal with any glitches at their busiest time.
Let me return to some provisions of the bill. Section 7 of the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2004 provides that the international trade modernisation import amendments apply to reports relating to the impending arrival and uploading of goods from ships or aircraft due after the import cut-over time. This section includes the requirement to use the ICS to make electronic reports to Customs. Section 8 of the application act provides that the international trade modernisation import amendments apply to imported goods that arrive on a ship or aircraft after the import cut-over time.
Under section 5 of the application act, the CEO of Customs has specified that the import cut-over time is 2 am in the Australian Capital Territory on 28 August. This date will be altered by this bill to 2 am in the ACT on 12 October—but here is the rub—or a later date as specified by the CEO by legislative instrument, which may be anything as late as 7 November. How is that for certainty? The unamended Customs Act requires that electronic reports relating to imports and arrival of ships and aircraft be made using the sea cargo automation system, the air cargo automation system and COMPILE. The turn-off time is the time when these systems will no longer be used to make these reports.
Under section 6 of the application act, the CEO has specified that the turn-off time will be 2 am in the ACT on 7 October. This is the latest possible day that could be specified, and the 40-day gap between the import cut-over time and turn-off time will enable processes started in the old systems to be completed, as they will not be compatible with the ICS. New subsection (1) of section 6 of the Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill provides that the CEO must specify a date no more than 40 days after the import cut-over time as the turn-off time. This 40-day limit is the same as specified in the current section 6. New subsection (2) of section 6 clearly states that should the CEO change the turn-off time, it must be done before the first turn-off time, and the date must not be more than 40 days after the import cut-over time. The CEO may need to specify a second turn-off time if the import cut-over time is delayed.
Apart from representing yet another delay and providing more uncertainty within industry and the business sector, the Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill will result in a loss of revenue from cost recovery measures contained in the Import Processing Charges Act 2001—something in the order of $1.39 million during this financial year.
Not only are we finding extraordinary over-runs of time and money—and we can certainly hear from the minister whether or not staff have been drawn in and seconded to this project to make sure it works—but also we now find that there is a cost implication from the import processing charge. This is due to the continued use of existing systems before the final cut-over date and, in turn, Customs missing out on the related charges levied until the new import processing charges will be operational. This cost can be added to the already grossly blown out budget for the project. It is worth going back to it again and again, because it just defies imagination why you can start off in 1996 with a cost—and I will give the minister the benefit of the doubt—of between $25 million and $35 million and now have a cost of more than $200 million when you add up the entire cost of the project. The minister does need to come back and tell the parliament what the final cost of the project is. He needs to tell us how much he finally spent on the whole project when we get to the cut-off point.
That may not be the end of it. You will always have issues that might have to be worked around, where errors have to be fixed because of the rush to get to the cut-off time. There might be parts of the software or the system which Customs tried to implement that might not work that they have to re-look at. But that is conjecture; it might not happen. It might work perfectly. The cut-off should have been implemented many years earlier.
This illustrates just how out of touch this government and minister really are. The government has demonstrably failed in its attempt to modernise and implement new trade facilitation measures, and it has left Australian industry and importers unprepared to deal with the Christmas rush. Throughout that time it has continually pointed the finger at industry for the delays, when it was in 2001 that legislation first passed through parliament clearing the way for Customs reform. At the beginning of this year, we were told that the imports component of the system would be operational by 1 July.
This government’s incompetence in handling cargo management re-engineering has become the running joke of the IT industry. They all know it. They all talk about it, and they are all familiar with it. If you go to any IT industry gathering and mention this, they all say, ‘Aha, yes!’ and have a chuckle to themselves about it. James Riley summed it up best in the Australian by calling it ‘the longest running technology development drama in public service history’. I wish I had thought of that phrase. However, the recent 90-day extension and trial from 1 July and the further extension to the cut-off date mean that the project has been delayed a total of eight times. This is the third time parliament has been asked to allow Customs more time. All the while this saga has been continuing, the project has been draining funds from Customs. As an example, ANAO audit report 56 said: ‘The resulting drain on Customs’ previous cash and current asset reserves had placed Customs in a negative net current asset position.’ That is how big it has been. It has been huge.
While Labor supports this amendment, it is important to note that the ICS was originally intended to interface industry directly with Customs and reduce paperwork and delays. So far, Customs has been unable to meet its own self-imposed deadlines. That is why another legislative change is now required. We still do not have any guarantee, because it has allowed itself to have a bit of a fudge factor put in. Labor, as I said, will support this bill. But it is extremely disappointing to Labor, as a party concerned for the wealth and economic security of Australians, that the incompetent mismanagement of trade modernisation still continues today.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF IMPORT CUT-OVER TIME) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-08-17,"—The Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill 2005 is a very important bill. It forms part of a package of legislation which relates to the largest e-government program in the Southern Hemisphere. The cargo management re-engineering program, as it is known, will revolutionise the way that we deal with the movement of goods in and out of Australia. It is the biggest program to occur in the history of Customs. The Australian Customs Service is older than Federation, which gives you an idea of the enormity of the program that we are looking at.
Many Australians would not have registered that such a program was under way. I dare say that it is of interest to business and importers and exporters, but beyond that it has not attracted much attention. But it will go a very long way towards putting Australia at the cutting edge of international best practice in processing imports and exports. That is why it is so important for Australia.
This program began with outsourcing in late 1997 and has continued since then. There has been a great deal of complexity. As you can appreciate, a program of this enormity takes a good deal of work and consultation with industry. In the United States a similar program is estimated to cost $US3.2 billion, around $A4 billion, and to take about 10 years to develop and implement. That gives you an idea of what is happening in the United States.
It is reported that Australia is the 14th-largest economy in the world. For our small population, we have high exports and imports. That is why it is so important that this program go ahead. In all my dealings with industry on this matter, which have been extensive during my time as minister for customs, there has been nothing but total support for this program. The question has been in the detail of implementation.
The cargo management re-engineering program consists of two aspects: export and import. The decision was made, quite correctly, to deal first with exports and then with imports. Exports went live in October last year, and I am happy to report that that is progressing well. A cut-over date for imports of 28 August this year was previously set. This bill will extend that to 12 October, a mere six or seven weeks. That has come about as a result of consultation with industry, who wanted this extra time in order to test the new system and put in place their own IT arrangements. Yesterday there was a meeting of programmers, and the feedback that I have had is that the cut-over is proceeding well for 12 October this year and the software developers have not indicated any reason as to why this cutover should not be achieved.
In an effort to enhance consultation, I set up a roundtable with stakeholders who were interested in the CMR program. We have had five meetings over the last two years. I want to place on record the appreciation of the government for all those involved and the constructive way they approached the issue of consultation. I do not believe that Customs could have done much more in consulting with industry. I understand that Customs engaged in some 7,000-plus workshops. Of course, in a program of this enormity, you have to get things right. Simply rushing to meet a deadline for the sake of it could well have resulted in a system which did not work and, in fact, backfired. We have achieved our goal with our exports component, which went live last year and is working well. We intend to do the same with imports on 12 October this year. We believe that we now have a system which will work and be a great asset for Australia.
Perhaps one of the most important parts of a nation’s economy is the way the import and export of goods is dealt with. If we do not move goods in a streamlined way, maintain security and maintain scrutiny of goods and the duty payable—because, after all, Customs has a very important role in protecting the revenue—the Australian community will be deprived of its just income for expenditure on vital areas such as health and education. That is why it is important to have that scrutiny of goods coming in and out of the country and to have security. In this modern day and age, that is essential.
The Australian Customs Service is recognised internationally as one of the best customs services in the world. We are acknowledged as having in place security and border control arrangements which are second to none. As well as that, this program, when it is in place, will put us at the leading edge internationally in the way we deal with goods entering and leaving Australia. This is historic for Customs. Although many people would not know of the cargo management re-engineering program, it will have a great effect on Australia’s economy and the way goods are moved and handled. Many people will not know that imported goods that they purchase or goods that are exported from Australia will be moved under this new program in a very efficient manner which will result in great benefits for this country.
A program of this sort was complex, it was never going to be easy and it was never going to be done overnight. We have put it in place and we now will have world’s best practice in a customs service which is one of the best in the world. You need to look at the time it has taken in the context of what the United States is doing: an estimated 10 years to implement their program at a cost of about $A4 billion. A country like the United States, with all its resources, is also dealing with a program which is complex and will take time. We were not going to implement this overnight and foist it on industry without consultation. We were not going to put this in place unless we got it right, and we have done that.
To suggest that this is a Trojan Horse for achieving a later cut-over date or that it will interfere with the Christmas rush is totally misrepresenting the situation. We have discussed with industry the 12 October date and they are agreeable to that. They needed the extra time. We needed to get things right in that extra six weeks, but we will not be doing this in the Christmas rush. We have discussed with industry the very question of that rush, when you have a rush of imports into Australia for the Christmas period. We believe that industry’s desire not to have that infringed will be accommodated. In fact, we are firmly of the view that this will be in place and they can have the benefit of that for the increase of imports for the December period.
I commend this bill to the Senate and we look forward to the cut-over date for the imports segment of the cargo management re-engineering program, which will indeed be a historic day for Customs in this country.
Question agreed to.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-08-17,"—Before this debate was adjourned yesterday, I was despairing for the Liberal and National parties of the coalition. I have always believed them to be ethically and ideologically inadequate when it came to governing, but it does disgust me how underhanded and despicable their actions have become. Was the lack of a Senate majority the closest the government has come to having any conscience? Sadly, this appears to be the truth. There are certainly no signs of compassion or morality now. Perhaps it is the weakness of their policies and the knowledge that what they do is not for the good of this nation but for the gratification of ideological fanatics in their own ranks that inspires such legislation. This and the coming extremist vendetta against working Australians are simply despicable. There is absolutely no proof that the radical workplace demands of the government will in any way contribute to the improved delivery of training or better equipped trainees. Indeed, any application of logic indicates the complete opposite. They simply will not.
Before I conclude my remarks on this bill, I would like to turn to the conduct of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, of which I was a member and in fact deputy chair. The chair of the committee determined that no public hearings would be conducted anywhere around the country to garner community opinion and expertise on the bill and its effects. The obvious question to ask is what senators opposite were afraid of when they refused to hold public hearings into this matter. There was no immediacy about tabling this report and any such excuse is no more than a pathetic furphy. After the committee had determined to conduct public hearings, government senators simply failed to turn up and provide a quorum for such public hearings. The fact is that the government has ignored the sector for a decade now and the only time line imposed on the committee was one the government imposed upon itself.
One of the great tragedies we face in this chamber over the coming years is more of this arrogance and the effect it will have upon our democracy and public debate in Australia. There is a sad sense of indifference pervading the ranks of senators and members of the coalition. It is time they turned away from being mindlessly herded along by ideological zealots determined to destroy the Australian way of life.
The senators of the coalition parties might be able to delude themselves into thinking that ripping the heart out of the Australian way of life and violating the fundamental human rights of Australians is the way forward, but the Australian Labor Party does not. In our three recommendations included in the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee report opposition senators and the Labor Party clearly outline what this bill needs, but fails, to do. We must increase funding for public vocational education and training to address the skills crisis. The Commonwealth must stop behaving childishly and cooperate with the states in developing a new national framework for vocational education and training and rebuild a collaborative structure to fulfil the role of ANTA, and the government must desist from its absurd attempts to include regressive workplace relations changes with every piece of legislation it introduces. It is irrational and unproductive and distorts a debate which should be held over for another occasion.
Jenny Macklin, Labor’s shadow minister for education, training, science and research, put it best when she said in the House:
Despite the fact that over 70 per cent of public VET funding comes from the states and territories and less than 30 per cent comes from the Commonwealth, this government wants 100 per cent control. No doubt the minister for education will continue to accept zero per cent of the responsibility for any problems that arise.
And in that she is absolutely right. The Australian Labor Party oppose this bill in its current form and I urge government senators to join us in supporting our amendments to it. Should this bill remain unamended by Labor’s alternatives then it ought to be rejected. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I rise to speak briefly to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Nettle to the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. I wish to indicate that, whilst Labor support many of the sentiments of most of that amendment and has made very similar criticisms long and loud over the government’s approach to and underfunding of training and its abrogation of responsibility when it comes to training, we cannot support the second reading amendment in its current form, in particular the blunt requirement to end the funding of private providers, which we think is inappropriate. Whilst we have been longstanding and strong supporters of TAFE, we recognise that private providers have a role in Australia’s training system.
Question negatived.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-08-17,"—The Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1997 to make significant changes in the governance infrastructure of Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission. Labor is supporting this bill because it is an attempt to fix at least some of the many problems in real service delivery under this government that have been exposed.
The changes in this bill are the abolition of the governance boards of both Centrelink and HIC, the Health Insurance Commission; the replacement of the Health Insurance Commission, an authority with separate legal personality to the Commonwealth, with a new body, Medicare Australia, that will form part of the Commonwealth; the creation of two chief executive officers, CEOs, of Centrelink and Medicare Australia, with statutory functions; and the establishment of new governance arrangements, under which the CEOs will be directly accountable to the Minister for Human Services.
The changes will also mean that employees of the two bodies will be covered by the Public Service Act 1999, which will provide them with generic employment rights and obligations. In addition, both will be prescribed bodies under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, which provides an accountability framework for the management of resources.
These changes made by the bill are part of the government’s response to the Uhrig review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders—a report which was brought down late last year and which, I think, did not receive the public attention it should have because of the timing of its conclusion. The fact that these changes are being made signifies the failure of the governance structures of Centrelink and the HIC to provide, both currently and over the last nine years, effective accountability for all of us as citizens of Australia.
The governance boards of Centrelink and the HIC have not been in a position to provide solutions to the real failures in management systems and service delivery. However, the boards provided a buffer and a dilution of the responsibilities and accountability for the Howard government ministers. This bill should change that. Labor supports these changes as they may go some way to addressing some of the serious problems that face the customers of the agencies.
I am one of those people who can remember when the Centrelink board was being set up. To my shame, I can also remember—just vaguely—the set-up of the HIC, which was over 20 years ago. That almost reflects some of my Public Service experience. But I will concentrate for this part of the discussion on the Centrelink board. There was such heralding of the changes that were going to take place and what was going to be brought into place in the brand-new arrangements in 1997. The board, amidst other things, was going to provide transparent accountability and be part of the new world that we were entering at the time. What we are finding out is that the new world is probably not that much different to the past world, and in fact those promises about better and clearer accountability were not fulfilled by the structural changes or by the enormous amount of PR that was expended at the time when Centrelink was created.
I am a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. As I have said before in this place, that is a committee that I value deeply and was very keen to join. There have been a series of Auditor-General’s reports that reflect on governance in both Centrelink and the HIC and the key issues that this particular bill is attempting in some way to address. I will just mention a couple of the reports, because there are so many. I urge people who are interested in this issue to go back and have a look at the Auditor-General’s reports, because not only do they expose things that have not been working; they make clear recommendations for the agencies to follow. In every case, the agencies tend to say, ‘Yes, we will do it. We accept that these things should be done better and we will make the changes.’ The problem is that you cannot just keep on saying that. At some stage, real change has to occur. But I will for the sake of this debate mention a couple of the Auditor-General’s reports about the operation of governance.
I will start with Centrelink. Auditor-General’s report No. 34 of 2000-01 found 49.1 per cent of claim forms were not fully completed in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. Auditor-General’s report No. 26 of 2001-02 found 20 per cent of applications for payments contained errors in the key proof-of-identity process. Recently, Auditor-General’s report No. 32 of 2004-05, on Centrelink’s customer charter, one of the key elements of the accountability of that organisation, found that the charter failed to provide any measurable standards.
Auditor-General’s report No. 34, also of 2004-05, was on Centrelink’s complaints-handling system. This is a personal favourite of mine. There has always been a process in Centrelink and in its predecessor agency, the Department of Social Security, to look at customer complaints, because that is how you have a responsible public sector and that is how you improve your service. All of these Auditor-General’s reports go directly to the issue of governance in the agency. That Auditor-General’s report on Centrelink’s complaints-handling system found a lack of customer knowledge of complaints avenues, it found that Centrelink clients feared that they would face discrimination and retribution were they to lodge complaints, it found a lack of any guidance or procedures for Centrelink staff to communicate with customers about the organisations complaints processes and it found a lack of follow-up procedures to deal with the risk of discrimination against complaints. That last finding particularly bothers me because it shows that once an issue had been identified there was no internal process to effectively follow up. To me, that is a key plank of governance.
All of these issues go to the process of effective operation. Indeed, up until now, with the proposal that is before us, the board of Centrelink was reviewing these recommendations that were made. That was part of the accountability process. One of the findings that particularly interested me in that recent audit report was to do with misleading presentation of information about complaints in annual reports. That is a fairly strong statement. The annual report is another key mechanism of accountability that all of us as citizens have to consider how public sector agencies and agencies that are linked to the public sector such as Centrelink and the HIC currently are working. You should be able to go to the annual report—and those of us who are of that bent do go to annual reports—to have a look at what is happening in agencies. But the audit report indicates that the actual complaints mechanisms and the numbers were not clearly spelt out in that process. An expectation that we should be able to have is that when you do take the effort to read about what is going on in agencies there should be accurate information in the annual report for those people who want to ask the questions: ‘Is this the best way that our money should be spent?’ and, because we are talking about service delivery agencies: ‘Is this the best, most responsible, most responsive way to get service delivery in our Australian government?’
The Auditor-General has also raised serious concerns about the administration of the Health Insurance Commission, including relevant recent revelations, which received wide media coverage, that up to 500,000 Medicare cards were out in the community somewhere, probably being held by people who are no longer alive. Maybe that is a way of ensuring you get effective health services! Nonetheless, the audit report indicates that there could be a significant number of Medicare cards—which, as we all know, have integrity in the community and are used as a means of ID; if you have a Medicare card you can use it quite confidently to prove your identity—that do not have integrity, and not only do not have integrity but reflect on the overall governance and integrity of the agency.
The audit reports should not be seen as punitive. The role of audit reports is to inform and, as I previously said, to indicate what can and should be done better. Then the agency involved—and, up until the probable passing of this bill, the boards of the HIC and Centrelink—would consider the recommendations and make a response. When you read the audit reports, you see that there is a standard structure: the issues are identified, recommendations are made and the organisation is given the opportunity to respond. In each of these cases, the organisation has had to admit that the audit reports were accurate and what was needed then was a response that the organisation would go back and make things better. The audit reports point to a failure by the government to effectively manage service delivery for the many millions of Australians who each year access the services delivered by the agencies—in this case, Centrelink and the HIC.
Over the last, long period of time—I will say over the last nine long years—the government has faced issue after issue in its delivery of social policy in the country. In attempting to neutralise the damage, there have been significant ministerial reorganisations and restructuring. The very creation of the Department of Human Services, under which Centrelink and the HIC now operate, was widely heralded as a new way to perform business. It was an attempt to look at key service delivery agencies and create a barrier between service delivery agencies and those which develop policy. That was one of the key components that was heralded by the government when the Department of Human Services was set up. When the Prime Minister announced the new administrative arrangements in October last year he said:
The new department will ensure that the development and delivery of government services is placed under strong ministerial control with clear lines of responsibility through the Secretary.
This new process would more effectively give confidence to the Australian community that they would have responsive service delivery, that their issues would be considered and their voices would be heard in the development of effective policy on one hand, through the policy department such as the Department of Family and Community Services and also the Department of Health and Ageing, which develops the policy, while those agencies which are clearly delineated as service delivery agencies would now come under the umbrella department, the Department of Human Services.
The intent of this—and I think it is the intent of the legislation we are debating today—is to continue to focus on keeping those areas separate and also, as a response to the audit report, to get rid of what they call artificial boards and actually have ministerial accountability through the CEO. The CEOs will have new arrangements in terms of focusing on their responsibilities. People in the community or people who work in the agencies probably will not see a great difference in how these things operate. There are currently CEOs in both the HIC and Centrelink. They are the key figures of the bureaucracy for the people who are there, but the expectation of this change is that the link with the minister will now be much more direct, because the boards will be removed. I am not sure whether the boards felt they were cosmetic for the last several years that they were in operation; nonetheless, they have been removed by this process.
There is an intent that, down the track, at some time there will be a new board which will be part of the human services department. Perhaps we will see, as that is created and people are appointed to it, the lessons put in place that have been learnt since 1997 in Centrelink and longer through the HIC. What must be ensured by any decision is that the people who are using the services understand the services and can feel confident that they are getting what they deserve to have out of the service delivery agencies.
In this place we have talked many times about the problems that have occurred in Centrelink with the shemozzle—I am not sure that that is the technical term, but it is a safe term—in the delivery of the family tax benefit over the years: the debts, the letters that have gone out and the concern caused to families. It does interest me that we are now debating a piece of legislation to make the service delivery more accountable by removing the boards in the HIC and Centrelink. In my office, where we see so many people coming to talk about issues they have with Centrelink and to a lesser extent, although we still see them, with HIC services, the issue of the board is not one that the community raises very often.
People come to my office mainly with complaints. I wish there were more who said, ‘I think we are getting really great service from Centrelink,’ or ‘We’re getting really great service from other agencies.’ When people come, they are seeking help. We see people who indicate that they feel that they are not valued or respected. We see those who have a degree of fear about approaching Centrelink officers or getting into the call centre processes where they feel that they cannot get their issues heard effectively or get to the nub of the issue. We see people who receive letters that threaten them, saying that they owe several thousand dollars and they have to make retribution as quickly as possible. When they come to parliamentary offices and express their fear and when we sit with them as they are sobbing, in some cases, worried about what is going on, the issue of whether there is a board in Centrelink is not one that is raised very often.
Labor are supporting this legislation. It is indicating that the government is being responsive to some concerns that have been raised. But it is in the context that the concerns that people have with the way Centrelink is operating, the way the HIC is operating and the way that, under its new guise, Medicare Australia will be operating, are not actually to do with the board process. They are to do with making sure that the governance of these agencies is effective. They relate to ensuring that complaints-handling systems are effective. They are to do with ensuring that the staffing levels are effective. One of the things about the new arrangements directly linking the minister and the CEO is that linkage with financial accountability. We consistently hear that people are worried about the length of time they have to wait to get their calls answered in a call centre in both the HIC and Centrelink. They are concerned about the length of queues when they go to offices of these agencies. They are worried about the way the forms operate. They want to ensure that they are seen as human beings and not just numbers. The CEOs are the hubs of accountability, and they are the hubs of effective service delivery.
If in some way this bill can improve those processes, it will be a good result, but we are urging the government not to end the changes with just passing this legislation. If you are going to genuinely look at the issues that are confronting service delivery in these two areas, look at the issues of staff numbers, staff satisfaction and training. Look at the issues of job security in these areas so that the people working in the two agencies feel confident, trained and effective in providing services that we as Australians should have. If that occurs then maybe we are on the right track and the messages of the audit reports will be responded to. It is not enough to just wipe out two boards.
At this stage, I want to acknowledge that the people who have been serving on those boards have probably done so with absolute integrity and with genuine commitment to the jobs they are doing. I am in no way making negative comments about the people who are working in these agencies. What I am saying is that maybe the actual internal functionings of these organisations should be considered more closely as opposed to just considering how many people are on the board.
We have had so much fanfare about better, safer and more effective service delivery. I think that what we need to have is some confidence in the community that these things will occur. When that confidence is re-established, service delivery will be effective, but not until then. As I said, Labor will be supporting this piece of legislation. We are also supporting ongoing change so that the real issues that are coming up can be addressed and we are seeking cooperation so that transparency and accountability can be openly assessed and so that we are able to work to ensure that there is a re-establishment of an effective public sector. As an old public servant—and I mean that as someone who is getting mature and who also worked in the Public Service for a long time—it is wonderful to see that we are now clearly putting back the effective public service delivery expectation into the public sector and that now HIC and new Medicare Australia staff will be returned to the Public Service from which I think many of them left over 20 years ago. I commend the legislation so that we can start on a new age in accountability.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-17,"—The Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 does a range of things, but it basically goes to the heart of governance arrangements for a couple of key human services agencies at the federal level. The major things the bill does are: abolish the governance boards of Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission; replace the Health Insurance Commission, which currently has a separate legal structure from the Commonwealth, with a body called Medicare Australia, which will be folded back into the Commonwealth directly; create chief executive officers for Centrelink and Medicare Australia with statutory functions; and establish new governance arrangements for those CEOs to be directly accountable to the minister. It all sounds very good. It sounds very technical. It does not sound very fascinating, but Centrelink and Medicare are agencies that impact on millions and millions of Australians, so it is very important to assess whether or not these changes will actually improve things for the people of Australia or make things more difficult.
The background to the legislation goes back to the government’s 2001 election manifesto, when the coalition parties claimed that the reform of the Public Service ‘has been a major achievement’. The word ‘reform’ is used in all sorts of curious contexts these days, and I guess it depends on where you are coming from as to whether it has been a major or positive achievement. They did indicate at the time that, in their next term of government, they would look at statutory authorities and office holders with regard to that so-called reform. Certainly, once some in the business community started jumping up and down and complaining that they were not getting a fair deal from the Competition and Consumer Commission, particularly from its then chair, Mr Allan Fels, the government decided to move on this issue. It is interesting that the Prime Minister chose to announce the review of corporate governance of Australia’s statutory authorities at the get-together of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The emphasis of the review was on a select group of agencies with critical business relationships, notably the tax office, the Competition and Consumer Commission, the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Reserve Bank, the Securities and Investments Commission, the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink. It is those last two organisations that are captured in the legislation before us today. It is curious that that focus happens to be on the human services bodies rather than on the financial bodies on this occasion.
After announcing the review, the Prime Minister said some statutory authorities are:
 ... not directly accountable to ministers, they’re only accountable to the Parliament in a rather theoretical way. In practice, they’re not.
He also said that it is a good idea that everybody else is properly accountable. I could certainly point to examples where those bodies could be more accountable to parliament. Senator Moore has highlighted some of those, but she has also highlighted ways in which they are quite clearly accountable to parliament to a significant degree. One of the concerns I have is that, in promoting the goal of being more directly accountable to ministers and to the government, the issue of how well they are accountable to the parliament might be seen as secondary. One might suggest that, from the Prime Minister’s point of view, as long as they are more accountable to him and his ministers, their being less accountable to the parliament might not be such a problem for him. As always, these things will not be able to be fully tested until the legislation is put in place, by which time, of course, it is a bit late to reverse things.
Of course statutory authorities should not be able to escape accountability from anybody, including the parliament, the government or, most critically, the people, but we do have to consider what the Prime Minister’s main driving concerns were when he argued about inadequacies and accountability. As Paddy Gourley pointed out in his article in the Public Sector Informant, Commonwealth statutory authorities do have to operate within the framework of relevant government policy as well as the legislation. They are accountable to the Auditor-General and subject to a raft of the administrative law, including freedom of information. They must provide annual reports to the parliament and regularly submit themselves to the interrogations of estimates and other parliamentary committees, such as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit that Senator Moore mentioned, which does sound like a fascinating committee. I am upset that I have not had the excitement of serving on it, but I think Senator Murray might be on that one. I am sure that, because of the fascinating issues before it, he would cling to that committee with his cold, dead hands rather than be dragged away from it, so I will just have to stand in line in that case, unless the Labor Party wants to open up a position for the smaller parties. The point I am making is that there is a reasonable degree of accountability. It is accountability after the fact, but accountability nonetheless.
The Canberra Times columnist Verona Burgess suggested that the Prime Minister’s comments might indicate a desire by the government to bring agencies to heel and to put key government industry regulators under the direct control of ministers. In his second reading speech on this legislation in the House of Representatives Minister Hockey said:
... these agencies need to move closer to government to ensure that their daily operations deliver the outcomes that government and taxpayers expect.
He also said that it is important that the organisations be brought under strong ministerial control. There are two aspects to that. Firstly, one of the issues that undoubtedly is still to play out is the question of which minister will have control of which things. We have already seen some turf wars, since the creation of this human services ministry, over which minister is responsible for what, and also over why they have that control. Given the concept of separating the policy side from the service delivery side, I can understand why there is a determination to get the service delivery right, but I can very easily see a situation developing where there will be lots of finger pointing going on every time there is a stuff-up. The people doing the service delivery will say, ‘The problem is because the policy is no good,’ and the people doing the policy will say, ‘The policy is great; it’s just that people are not delivering the services properly.’ When you add to this ministers blame-shifting and avoiding, I can foresee that this might actually lead to less accountability, and certainly less responsibility, when those lines of who is ultimately responsible become blurred.
If you look at this new culture of public service—the reformed public service, under the Howard model—and look at the example of the immigration department, you will see a department which is a complete debacle from top to bottom—something virtually admitted to by all government ministers. Yet, somehow or other, the minister is not responsible. Public servants are responsible; somehow they have got a bad culture in there, and all these public servants have gone all bad. But it was not the minister’s fault; it was not the government’s fault. It is as if the government is saying, ‘We will just shift a few people around and promote the secretary of the department and that will fix it all,’ as if somehow or other the minister was not actually responsible for any of that.
There have been heaps of criticism—quite rightly, I might say—in my home state of Queensland of the state government and the hospital system there. The state of the health area there is equally a debacle. One could not expect the eminently loyal Queensland Labor servant, Senator Moore, to agree to that fact, but I think it is nonetheless clearly the case that the state Labor government in Queensland is making a total mess of the health system. But at least the minister, after a bit of prompting, said: ‘Okay, I acknowledge it is a mess; best we get somebody new in; I will take the blame and I will shift on. We will get someone new in.’ At least we had that recognition of responsibility. Sure, it is partly due to political factors, but partly it is a recognition that you have to take some responsibility when things get to a certain degree of messiness, and that responsibility is the minister’s.
If we are going to be pulling these agencies closer to government and closer to the minister, as Minister Hockey suggested, then I hope that also means that the minister will be responsible, directly and personally, when things stuff up, rather than saying, ‘This is a service delivery problem and that is someone else’s issue.’ That is a concern I have with this.
Dr Ian Holland, in his article looking at the Uhrig review that was the catalyst for this legislation, examined what he saw as some of the missed opportunities that were represented there. He pointed out that there has been a trend since the early nineties towards increased ministerial control over the activities of statutory authorities—and there certainly can be legitimate reasons for ministers directing statutory authorities. But, as he pointed out, it is possible that there is a relationship between this tighter government control and directing of regulators in a political sense, and directing of the public service and a declining trust in government, as political direction and service delivery in an impartial sense do not always go hand in hand.
There will always be some tensions between the various aspects of our system of government and nobody disputes that, but does this necessarily mean that they should be done away with and that public opinion and specialist advice should be ignored? Dr Holland also detailed what he saw as some flaws in the Uhrig inquiry, particularly that it did not consider what direction to take for governance of statutory authorities. It also avoided examining the governance of highly autonomous statutory authorities; it incorrectly assumed that a legislative framework protects the operational independence of a statutory authority, and it paid no attention to overseas experience or models of governance. Stephen Bartos considered that the report barely addressed questions of ethics; nor did it address the role of statutory authorities in managing, in particular, political risk.
The level of consultation involved in the review process has also been criticised. The criticism was that it used a very targeted consultative approach with no call for public submissions or public hearings; did not adequately take into account the existing wisdom on these issues that had accumulated through earlier inquiries or reports—including, I might say, reports from parliamentary committees, such as the aforementioned Public Accounts and Audit Committee, the Senate finance committee and some state inquiries.
So it certainly seems that there is a lot of apprehension about the adequacy and breadth of the review that has led us to this point with the legislation here today. Without going on in great detail about some of the problems with the way the review was conducted in relation to this particular legislation, perhaps what is of most concern is that it did not examine some of the worrying issues that have emerged in the interaction of ministers and statutory authorities over the last few years.
Instead, Minister Hockey stated:
Our 20 million customers have little regard for sectoral and bureaucratic differences. Instead they just expect the government to deliver services in a timely, efficient, cost-effective and easily understandable manner.
And that is true. I am sure most people, when they are dealing with Centrelink and Medicare, probably do not mind, as long as they get what they are entitled to with a reasonably minimal degree of fuss and hassle.
Indeed, Minister Hockey’s customers probably do have little regard for such differences when they are being customers. But, more broadly, as citizens they would see the need for those in charge of delivering services, whether a board or a CEO, to be able to perform their roles with objectivity and even-handedness, understanding that they are not there to serve just the partisan interests of the appointing minister.
I know it is the modern jargon for Centrelink and other agencies to call people ‘customers’. Back when I worked for its predecessor, the Department of Social Security, I think people were called ‘clients’, although being social workers we had a different viewpoints of people, perhaps from some of the other staff. This notion of shifting people from being ‘clients’ to being ‘customers’ is all part of some new, modern approach to things. Being a bit of a traditional conservative, I am not into these newfangled modern ways but I am happy to give them try. However, in considering people as customers of departments like Centrelink, we should not allow that to obscure the key principles that are involved when dealing with legislation like this, which is also about governance.
When people are thinking as citizens of Australia about how our public sector should be operating, they certainly believe it should be operating in an impartial way, not in a way that could be misused for partisan political interests. I have no doubt that is also the view of Australia’s 20 million citizens. That might not be the first and foremost thing in their minds when they just want to make sure they get their Medicare refund, but it is when they are thinking about our Public Service being effective. That goes to the amendment that I will be moving in the committee stage. I will speak to it then, but that is about trying to ensure the appointment of these CEOs on merit rather than fostering the perception—or the reality, for that matter—of jobs for the boys. I think that is a key part of addressing that issue and indeed that principle of ensuring that these bodies operate in a non-partisan way. Meritorious appointments are the essence of accountability.
The replacement of the two governance boards by two individual CEOs will obviously mean that fewer voices will have input and provide advice on the delivery of these services and improvement proposals in human services. The government has indicated that at the appropriate time it will establish a Human Services Advisory Board. As far as I know, though, there is no information on when this will happen, how people will be appointed—whether we will have independent appointments on merit or the board will be stacked with political mates—or what the precise role of the advisory board will be.
While this legislation focuses on Centrelink and Medicare Australia, there are actually six agencies under the human services umbrella. As pointed out back in May in the Financial Review, there is room for turf wars between the portfolios related to these six agencies to the extent that relevant ministers had sought legal advice on what their powers would be under the new portfolio structures.
Despite the Prime Minister’s and Minister Hockey’s talk of greater accountability, this is an attempt to split the bureaucracy between the parts that develop policy and the parts that implement policy, such as the delivery of service and welfare payments. It can be seen as having some merit but it does also raise the question of whether that split will create more opportunities for people to fall through the cracks between the two parts. The ministers responsible for policy development will no longer be responsible necessarily for what happens with the policies they develop. As I mentioned before, they may be able to point to a failure and just blame it on the way it was delivered rather than on the policy itself. They may also be required to pay less direct, on-the-ground attention to the impact of those policies. Presumably, these agencies will now have the reporting requirements for two departments, one for policy matters and one for service delivery, and the CEOs of these agencies will be reporting to a department secretary who then reports to a minister, thus allowing the secretary to be the one who takes the blame when things go wrong. Again, I point to the recent example within the immigration department.
So there are very big question marks about the potential consequences of this bill. As with any new structure, a lot will depend on how it is implemented on the ground, in practice, and on the motives and genuine intent of the government and the individual ministers responsible. That is something that can be speculated on, as I have, but it is not something that can be guaranteed or pointed to with absolute certainty, not least because ministers—and even prime ministers—can change and that can therefore change the implementation of changes like these on the ground. But there are serious concerns and there are genuine questions, and they should at least be acknowledged by the government and the relevant ministers as things that have to be taken into account, even if it is only from the point of view of disproving them by directly addressing and countering them. That is something that we will continue to watch as these changes evolve.
I have a question for the minister to respond to when he replies. Minister Hockey said this bill addresses 20 million so-called customers—certainly, Centrelink and Medicare between them would cover pretty much everybody who is an Australian citizen and/or resident. My question is: has a family impact statement been prepared for this legislation? We have heard lots of noise about these family impact statements that will be prepared for significant pieces of legislation to assess the impact they will have on families. Obviously, the government will say this bill will have a good impact. But the point of those statements, as with separate financial impact statements, is to indicate that the impact on families has specifically been considered and that any impact is of sufficient seriousness to detail independently. I am not sure there would be many bills in this place that would have an impact on a larger number of Australian families than this bill, so I would ask where the family impact statement is and, if this is a bill in respect of which such statements do not apply, perhaps we could have clarification on when and where such statements are going to appear.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-08-17,"—The stated aims of the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 to resolve the service delivery problems, improve corporate governance and develop clear guidelines on reporting accountabilities are worthy goals. While I am keen to see improvements in the delivery of social services, I am concerned that the means to this end put forward in this bill both undermine community consultation and increase direct political interference in the governance of the organisations involved. I am concerned that the recommendations of the Uhrig inquiry, which form the basis for this bill, were critically flawed in a number of ways. I believe that the report failed to consider what direction to take for the governance of statutory authorities. It did not take into account the relevant experience of governance models from overseas. In fact, more critically, it incorrectly assumed that a legislative framework protects the operational independence of a statutory authority. As a result, we are faced with a bill that undermines the operational autonomy of these statutory authorities.
The changes made by this bill would place the power to appoint, direct and control the CEO of Centrelink and the CEO of the proposed Medicare Australia, which is the successor body to the Health Insurance Commission, or HIC, directly in the hands of the Minister for Human Services. I am concerned that this is a recipe for political interference from an executive that does not want too much decision making devolved too far down the line.
Another critical flaw of the inquiry and this bill relates to community consultation, something that I consider to be of paramount importance in the delivery of human services. The community consultation undertaken by the inquiry itself was sorely limited and narrow in its horizons. This legislation will result in a huge reduction in the contribution and value of community consultation. It will see the scrapping of the existing six community representative boards, each of which is comprised of community members who have experience and expertise that are of direct relevance to the statutory body they inform. Their replacement will be one single board comprising just six people. Given the seriousness of the issues involved, I believe this proportion is patently ridiculous. How can we expect one board of six people to contain the wealth of relevant knowledge and experience necessary to cover the broad range of issues being brought together within the new Department of Human Services—DHS? How can it possibly encompass industry and community representatives from the very different sectors being brought together in this one mega-organisation?
Let me remind the Senate that DHS will be replacing Centrelink, the HIC, the Child Support Agency, Health Services Australia, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and Australian Hearing. Clearly, these organisations that are being amalgamated deliver a range of very different services to quite distinct sectors of the community with a very wide range of differing needs. The dissatisfaction of the community with the responsiveness of these agencies to client inquiries is well known and we have all heard the horror stories, particularly in regard to Centrelink. These organisations have been accused of being unnecessarily bureaucratic and inhumane. Urgent steps are needed to provide these institutions with a human face; steps which will not be achieved by the formation of a megalithic megadepartment. This is not a reflection on the people who actually work for these agencies; it is a reflection on the agency philosophy.
There is a real danger that the proposed new structure will mean that the Department of Human Services will become increasingly out of touch with the very communities to which it is meant deliver services and the industries with which they interact. Taken together with the measures to increase executive control over the CEO by the minister, I believe we are faced with a chilling picture of an organisation more capable of and interested in meeting the needs of the minister and government than the needs of the community it is supposed to be serving.
I believe that the delivery of services is of critical importance. I believe that, for appropriate services to be delivered efficiently and effectively, there is a pressing need for more input and feedback from the industries and communities involved. Public participation in the political process and policy development is a key part of a healthy democracy. A healthy democracy requires open channels of communication between government departments, agencies, industry and community sectors, not a reduction in these channels. I think that we should resist at every opportunity any moves which increase the powers of ministers to direct and control the activities of statutory authorities at the expense of their ability to meet the pressing needs of the communities they serve.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I too want to speak on the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, which we know is aimed at bringing accountability for human services back to the government. In that regard, it is a welcome piece of legislation, given concerns about the Howard government’s failed vision for Centrelink and the obvious need for greater accountability of the government’s statutory authorities. I hope that it leads to a significant improvement of the present human services muddle. The bill seeks to address the ongoing mismanagement of the accountability processes applicable to 20 million Australians through Centrelink and the Health Insurance Commission. After nine long years, the government’s HIC and Centrelink boards are to be axed. The HIC will become Medicare Australia and a raft of new government arrangements are being put into place to make those organisations directly accountable to the minister.
The government have finally recognised and admitted that the system they established to oversee these important agencies has failed and they are taking some responsibility for trying to fix the mess that they created. This bill is outstanding in that it may be one of the very few examples over the next three years where responsibility is being taken. We have already witnessed the government attempting to abuse their new-found powers in the Senate to further diminish their accountability to the Australian public: firstly, by reducing the number of opposition questions during question time; secondly, by moving to curtail the powers of Senate estimates committees to investigate government departments; and, thirdly, by the expected denial of the referral of matters that the government might find uncomfortable to Senate committees—and aren’t there a few of those! It is certainly unlikely that, for at least the next three years, we will see another inquiry into a certain maritime incident or perhaps an inquiry into the Regional Partnerships program. It certainly will not happen. This government are well aware of their mismanagement in some very serious portfolio areas and have absolutely no interest in being held accountable for what they have done. I welcome this bill because it might at least hold this minister to account for what happens in the future.
During what might be called a rare moment of insight in November 2002, the Howard government commissioned a review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities, known now as the Uhrig review. The terms of reference required an examination of the relationships between statutory authorities and the responsible minister. The Uhrig report was finally released on 12 August last year, and it made serious criticisms of the administrative structure set in place by the government to preside over Centrelink and the HIC. It also raised important accountability and transparency questions about the operations of other government agencies.
The review noted that a key characteristic of a board is its full power to act and its responsibility to do so, including such actions as appointing and terminating the CEO. The Uhrig review of the governance arrangements for statutory authorities found:
... a number of opportunities for improvements.
The report stated:
There is a lack of effective governance for several of the authorities considered by the review due to several factors including unclear boundaries in their delegation, a lack of clarity in their relationships with Ministers and portfolio departments, and a lack of accountability for the exercise of their power. This lack of governance arises primarily due to a ‘hands off’ attitude assumed by many when dealing with statutory authorities. This situation is often further complicated by the presence of a board, particularly those where it is impractical for government to provide the full governing powers required to be effective.
In the face of Centrelink and HIC failures in management systems and service delivery, their boards were quite simply never in a position to act. The report stated:
Where a board has limited power to act, its ability to provide governance is reduced and its existence adds another layer, potentially clouding accountabilities. Given the nature of government, the circumstances in which a board can be given full power to act are going to be rare and are most likely to be limited to those authorities which are commercial in nature.
In other words, the boards merely provide a buffer and a dilution of responsibility and accountability for this government. The Uhrig review noted that in such circumstances it was unlikely that good governance would prevail. It stated:
Where statutory authorities are failing to perform adequately, the electorate will expect governments to act.
Funnily enough! After eight long years of this policy, the government finally accepted the failure it created and responded by establishing the Department of Human Services. The department, which was formally established in December 2004, has oversight for six agencies: Centrelink, the Health Insurance Commission, the Child Support Agency, Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service Australia, Australian Hearing and Health Services Australia. Accordingly, the new minister announced that the agencies’ boards would be abolished in order to establish a more direct ministerial role in their operation. This abolition of the agencies’ ineffectual boards is a key component of the bill before us today.
This legislation provides an opportunity to put a spotlight on the minister and to hold him accountable. For this, Labor wholeheartedly supports this bill. But Mr Uhrig’s analysis regarding the governance of Centrelink and the HIC went beyond the issues addressed in this bill—that is, to the purchaser-provider arrangements used to fund the agencies. I urge the government to seriously consider the comments made in the review. By way of background, a purchaser-provider arrangement is when an agency is funded through purchasing agreements with other government agencies to provide services on their behalf. This arrangement is in place for both Centrelink and the HIC. The report stated:
The main issue for governance is the extent to which these arrangements affect the way those responsible for governing the organisation work towards ensuring its success. For Centrelink and the HIC, success is considered to be the efficient and effective delivery of specified services. The issue for the review to consider has been the extent to which the purchaser/provider arrangements impact on the governance of the organisation ...
The review went on to argue that the perceived benefits of a purchaser-provider arrangement are not to be found. The report stated:
It is the assessment of the review that there are considerable resources being consumed in managing the purchasing agreement with very little or no benefit.
Finally, the report found:
From a governance perspective, the review was not able to identify a net benefit in the use of purchaser/provider arrangements for services being delivered within a portfolio due to the lack of purchasing power of the portfolio department.
My question today is: why has the government chosen to ignore this recommendation? This is clearly an area where the efficiency of these agencies could be improved. It is clearly an area that requires reform. With the savings, I suggest, Centrelink and Medicare might be able to reopen some of their offices in rural and regional Australia.
The reports have commented on the systematic failures that Australians have been living with. So what are the results of this failed governance? The answer is: generally, a community that is both frustrated and angry. The Auditor-General has exposed in a series of reports a number of deficiencies in the operations of Centrelink and the HIC. Recently, the Auditor uncovered major problems in Centrelink’s complaints handling system which are clear impediments to improving the services provided to Centrelink’s customers. Audit report No. 34 2004-05: Centrelink’s Complaints Handling System found a series of serious and damaging incompetencies, ranging from Centrelink staff being given no guidance on how to advise customers on the complaints process, to customers feeling that they would be discriminated against for making complaints and failures to adequately report on or record complaints. The report also found that someone searching on the Centrelink web site to make a complaint would be hard-pressed to find the complaints procedures.
Clearly, Centrelink’s complaints handling system needs to be dramatically improved if the system is to be more responsive to its customers. It is also hoped that, under the new arrangements, the CEO will initiate improvements as a matter of urgency. I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, from personal experience that my electorate office in Goulburn is inundated with problems that people are having not only with the Department of Human Services agencies but also with trying to make a complaint. My office is constantly asked by people to help explain why a decision has been made and how to appeal, should an agency decision not be acceptable to them.
I know that the Centrelink staff are dedicated and do a difficult job. It is the failure of the management systems put in place by this government that is putting the staff under so much pressure and causing the difficulties and complaints that we are hearing from the community all the time. By the time the constituents turn to us for assistance, they are often incredibly stressed and desperate. The Department of Human Services deals with areas very close to the hearts of people: issues relating to their income support, their health and their family relationships. So it is paramount that the systems in place within the six agencies allow for accurate, efficient and sensitive administration. It is quite obvious to me that there have been systematic failures regarding each of these criteria. If the system was working, we would not be receiving the volume of complaints that we do.

"Senator EGGLESTON,",LP,2005-08-17,"—In recent months we have witnessed calls for a debate on nuclear energy in Australia. Formerly, nuclear energy was something of a pariah when one talked about the question of energy generation, but it is undergoing a rehabilitation of sorts. On the Labor side, the former Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, has called for a reopening of the debate, and he has been joined by prominent environmental activist and Labor MP Peter Garrett—
—For a day.
—Yes. Although, when he outlined his views on nuclear power, he also made it clear that he was opposed to nuclear plants—which is a strange, double-dutch kind of approach. Many other people, including Labor’s primary industries and resources spokesman, Martin Ferguson, have spoken of the need for us to consider the nuclear power option. On the Liberal side, the Prime Minister and also the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, have added their voices to calls for a debate. I must say that I suggested in a speech in 1997 that we as Australians would need to reconsider our position on nuclear power before long, and it seems that the time for this reconsideration has now come.
Nuclear energy produces virtually no greenhouse gases, and concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and climate change have provided the impetus for this new-found interest in nuclear power. Australia has witnessed a substantial increase in electricity demand over the last 20 years, with annual increases in demand of over 44 per cent between 1980 and 2000. More recently, electricity demand in this country has more than doubled. It is projected that electricity demand will increase by at least 50 per cent over the period to 2020 and that most growth in demand will occur in eastern Australia. This will necessitate investment in large-scale electricity generation projects; and, given the concerns about greenhouse emissions, it is not unrealistic that we should consider nuclear power as an option for providing for this need for increased electricity generation.
In Australia electricity production from coal, which represents some 78 per cent of our electricity generation, represents the largest source of stationary greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, it accounts for one-third of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The combustion of coal produces large amounts of greenhouse gases. In the year 2000, the combustion of coal produced 186 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. The energy white paper Securing Australia’s energy future states:
While advances in technology are significantly lowering the emissions intensity of new coalbased electricity plants, they remain the most emission-intensive form of electricity in widespread use.
Given that, we cannot continue down the path of being so heavily reliant on coal in a world where greenhouse emissions are increasingly a matter of concern.
In Australia we have eight per cent of the world’s coal reserves and 40 per cent of the world’s uranium reserves. At the moment, rather than utilising this uranium to generate greenhouse gas-free power ourselves, we are exporting it to other countries so that they can generate electricity and thereby have a lower greenhouse emissions profile than would be the case if they made use of fossil fuels. Rather quixotically, this particularly applies to the European Union where, but for nuclear power, few of its older members would have met their Kyoto greenhouse emission targets. Some of these countries, especially Germany, are prone to be quite critical of Australia’s reliance on coal for energy generation—although they themselves use Australian uranium in nuclear power generation.
Natural gas, hydro, wind and solar are all able to produce electricity with a lower greenhouse signature than coal, but there are impediments to their expanded utilisation, and those were identified in the white paper. Some of the impediments are as follows. Gas reserves are located away from major electricity markets and would require additional pipeline and shipping capacity to bring them into full utilisation. In Australia, we have very few mountains, and even fewer with snow-capped tops, so there is very little scope for additional hydro, particularly given community attitudes to damming rivers and flooding valleys. Wind and solar are intermittent and, at times, affordable means of generating power. However, storage options still need to be developed, and there are still technical problems with the generation of large quantities of solar power. For Australia this is something of a pity, because solar is the most available source of renewable energy in Australia. Were it possible to overcome the technical problems associated with large-scale generation of power from solar sources, Australia would be one country with almost no greenhouse problems from power generation to worry about. That is not the case, but it would be very nice if it were.
Generation costs tend to be higher for some renewable sources than for coal or uranium. The white paper makes this point:
... wide-scale uptake of low-emission base load electricity generation at current costs would lead to substantial increases in electricity prices, which would reduce Australia’s competitiveness.
There are still question marks over the feasibility of carbon geosequestration, according to the white paper. It goes on to note:
Demonstrating the commercial applicability of these technologies is likely to be expensive and take at least 10 years.
On average, industrialised countries generate 24 per cent of their electricity from nuclear power. At the end of 2003, 31 countries had nuclear reactors and North Korea was in the process of constructing one. World wide there were 439 reactors in operation—with another 31 under construction—generating some 16.1 per cent of total world electricity production.
Nuclear energy is especially utilised in North America, Europe and Asia. Lithuania, although having only two reactors, produces 79.9 per cent of its electricity from uranium. It is closely followed by France, which has 59 reactors, supplying 77.7 per cent of its electricity. The United States of America has 104 reactors, supplying 19.9 per cent of its electricity. Japan has 53 reactors, with another three under construction, supplying 25 per cent of its electricity. Nuclear energy’s 16.1 per cent share of total world electricity production is estimated to avoid the emission of some 2.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. So it obviously has a lot of merit in terms of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
Given our abundant reserves of uranium, our reliance on coal-fired power generation, projected increases in demand for electricity and the implications this has for our greenhouse emissions, and the shortcomings of renewable energy, I think it is important to encourage debate on the appropriateness of nuclear power in Australia. One of the biggest stumbling blocks to overcome in this debate is public perceptions about the safety of nuclear reactors. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine, which spread highly radioactive material over a large area, the effects of which continue to be felt to some extent to this day, is uppermost in the public consciousness when talking about nuclear power generation. The other major accident—there have only ever been two—occurred at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979, but no deaths resulted from that.
I think it is important to have a sense of proportion about these accidents. The Uranium Information Centre points out that these have been the only two major accidents during more than 11,000 reactor years of civil operation of nuclear reactors. The centre states:
Apart from Chernobyl, no nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident.
The risk of danger can be managed by building high quality reactors with a range of safety mechanisms, especially passive mechanisms which require no operator intervention, and by ensuring that in the event of an accident radiological material is confined to the plant. The Uranium Information Centre argues that modern reactors have multiple safety systems and that utility requirements in the USA specify a one-in-100,000-year core damage frequency. The UIC also notes that the best currently operating plants have about a one-in-one-million-year damage or accident frequency and that those likely to be built in the next decade have an almost one-in-10-million-year likely accident frequency.
Speaking at the 19th World Energy Council congress in Sydney last year, Davainis Marius of the State Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate of Lithuania made the point:
... the safety record of the world’s nuclear plants over past decade of operation indicates nuclear related risks to be among the lowest in the energy industry.
I think that is a very important message to get out to the public in Australia. The other big question about nuclear reactors relates to the disposal of nuclear waste, which, of course, concerns a lot of people. According again to Davainis Marius:
... it is estimated that the spent fuel produced from all the world’s reactors in a year would fit into a structure the size of a football field and 1.5 meters high.
I remember having a conversation with Harold Clough, who is the head of a very large engineering firm in Western Australia, a few years ago. He said that the engineering of a safe nuclear dump was a very simple matter and that it could be done very easily. So it would seem that, even though there is a great deal of public controversy about the storage of nuclear waste, perhaps that controversy and concern is a little misplaced, because it seems that the amount of space required to store nuclear waste is not very great at all.
A recent OECD survey found that, on the basis of cost, nuclear stations are a credible alternative to coal powered stations. However, unlike Australia, most countries are not blessed with cheap, readily accessible and abundant reserves of coal close to major population centres. This means that it would be difficult for uranium to compete with coal economically as well as in terms of public acceptance in Australia. I think that when externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions are taken into consideration nuclear power will become an increasingly realistically assessed option for Australia. In conclusion, no one source of energy is perfect or a panacea, but surely it is time to move beyond the demonisation of nuclear power and have an informed debate. (Time expired)

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-08-17,"—Senator Sherry asked me a question yesterday about the inclusion of bank fees in the CPI. I have an answer to that question. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The answer read as follows—

Yesterday I was asked by Senator Sherry why bank fees will only be included in the Consumer Price Index for the first time later this year.
The decision as to what items are included in the basket of goods and services (and their respective weights) for the purposes of measuring the Consumer Price Index is a matter for the professional judgment of the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Financial services have not traditionally been included in the CPI because of methodological difficulties in constructing a reliable measure of price changes.
However, following a review in 1997 it was decided to commence a research program to develop a measure suitable for inclusion in the CPI.
The result of that research program was an Information Paper released by the ABS in April 2005, entitled Experimental Price Indexes for Financial Services 1998 to 2003.
The ABS has also announced that as a result of the research work now undertaken, they will be in a position to include financial services into the CPI in a new group for ‘Financial and Insurance Services’.
The information paper explained some of the methodological difficulties associated with measuring price changes for financial services. For example, the approach of measuring only the direct fees and charges levied on financial products is not robust as it fails to take into account the potentially offsetting movements in interest rate margins.
It is also important to remember that a simple snapshot of fee income to financial service providers is not sufficient for inclusion in the CPI, because it does not separate price and volume effects as the CPI endeavours to do. As mentioned in my answer yesterday, the Reserve Bank maintains such data, indicating that fee increases have been largely driven by increased volumes of accounts and transactions and have been offset by reductions in interest rate margins.
Finally I note that the experimental series developed by the ABS indicates that since 1998, the cost of financial services has grown by 18.9 per cent, compared with a CPI of 17.7 per cent—that is, roughly in line with the rate of inflation.
Prices actually fell between 2000 and 2002, driven primarily by the abolition of inefficient state taxes like the Financial Institutions Duty as a result of the Government’s tax reform package, which was opposed by the Australian Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Bank Fees and Charges</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,10,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by Senators Fifield and Conroy today relating to telecommunications.
I am hoping that, now that his first speech is out of the way, Senator Joyce might be able to join the debate and express his views other than in the 1½ lines that we had today. We are looking forward to you taking the opportunity today, Senator Joyce, to join the debate now that you are unencumbered by your first speech. What a week it has been—what a seven days in politics! We have seen one of the fastest sell-outs politically in years. Senator Joyce, you may be shepherded out of the chamber by Senator Boswell and pushed out of the chamber by Senator Heffernan, but you will not be able to escape from the truth of your own words. Yesterday in your first speech you said:
What cannot be changed and is still the dilemma is that politics talks in riddles and packs with verbiage what is absolutely crystal clear at the mothers morning tea or the local hotel. Politics appears to be the art of telling half the story and your followers guess the rest while using the absence of the complete message as a defence against the implication drawn by your deriders.
When things get contentious we blame our faction or the joint party room as a reason that plasters over a personal political ambition.
How true those words are in relation to Senator Joyce! When Senator Joyce and the Queensland National Party ran a separate ticket, they stated that they were opposed to the sale of Telstra—no ifs and no buts. You can ask Senator Ian Macdonald—he knew they were having a lend. You can ask Senator Joyce. Let us be clear. Senator Joyce came to this chamber championing his position opposing the sale of Telstra. Inside of seven days of being sworn and after three days of pressure from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, Senator Coonan and Senator Minchin, he has folded. But to try and cover the fact that he has folded, he keeps walking around saying, ‘No it’s not really $1 billion; it’s $6 billion.’ Senator Joyce, I refer you to your first speech, where you said:
Politics appears to be the art of telling half the story ...
In Senator Joyce’s case, it is not about telling half of the story; it is about multiplying it by six! Senator Joyce has convinced the government to spend exactly what they were already spending. Congratulations, Senator Joyce—you are a legend! ‘Backdown Barnaby’ will live in political infamy!
—Senator Conroy, you should refer to senators by their correct title.
—I accept your rebuke, Mr Deputy President. Thirty pieces of silver is an acceptable price for selling out. Senator Joyce has three pieces of silver—that is all. As we know, Mr Trujillo came to Canberra last week. What an appointment he has been! If you were Mr McGauchie, the chair of Telstra, you would have to be looking over your shoulder right now, because Mr Trujillo told the truth. He stood up and said, ‘I have to tell the truth to the Australian public,’ clearly implying that somebody else might not have been telling the truth about the state of rural telecommunications services in this country.
We know who it was. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and Senator Coonan for 18 months have been walking the length of this country saying, ‘Services are up to scratch.’ You may laugh, Senator Marshall, but they have. They told the Australian public in the lead-up to the last election that they could sell Telstra because services were up to scratch. Yet Mr Trujillo, inside of a month, told the truth that all Australians have known for the last nine years: services are not up to scratch.
We should never have doubted Senator Minchin. Senator Minchin said that he would not be rolled by those hicks from the National Party, and he was dead right. I will never doubt Senator Minchin again! But let us be clear: in his first speech Senator Barnaby Joyce called for secret ballots in the Senate chamber. Why? So that you can say one thing in Queensland and vote another way and keep it secret here. He wants a secret ballot because he does not have the courage to stand up for what he has talked about for nine months. He wants a secret ballot so that he can tell the people of Queensland that he really did vote against the sale of Telstra while he slips the ‘X’ into the other box. What a hypocrite! What a farce! Here he is, wanting secret ballots to hide from the Australian public what he intends to do in a couple of weeks’ time, which is to vote for the sale of Telstra.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,11,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-08-17,"—Let us not be confused by ‘Confusing Conroy’ anymore. He is a man who seeks to confuse Australia on a broadcast day like this about the government’s intentions. Quite simply, Senator Conroy, the government has come up with a marvellous package called Connect Australia, which will give access to all Australians to first-class telecommunications services with a $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband, new regional clever networks, mobile services and improved Indigenous communications. In addition, there is a $2 billion program for a dedicated communications fund which will be established. The earnings from that fund, the interest on that fund, will be available to provide new communications services for rural Australia.
Senator Conroy, you can hardly say that the government has not delivered on its promises to look after the telecommunications services in regional Australia, and you have to give credit to Senator Joyce for the part he has played in achieving this. It is an outstanding package and one which will give a lot of comfort to people all over regional Australia, which is an area that Senator Conroy perhaps does not have a lot of knowledge of, coming as he does from central city Melbourne, where telecommunications are regarded as always being very good and up to date. But it is not the case, I have to tell you, in regional Australia.
—You don’t spend much time in Melbourne.
—I know I do not, but there we are. It is a city in which I find my mobile phone always works when I go there. I can pick up broadband whenever I turn on the internet. But it is a different story if you go to a place like Marble Bar or somewhere in western Queensland, where they do not have those sorts of services. But they will be provided under this package which the government has introduced.
The government has never made any secret of its desire to sell Telstra. We have always promised—do not leave Senator Conroy; if you do not want to hear the detail we can fax it over to you afterwards so that you will be better informed in future—that we would make sure that telecommunications in regional areas would be kept technologically up to date following the sale of Telstra, and this package provides a mechanism for doing that.
We have to remember that the government allocated sums of $180 million to address the recommendations made by the Estens inquiry and the earlier, Besley, inquiry. This program is going to provide an interest amount from the $2 billion which will be used to fund this communications fund. The interest on it will be equal more or less to the kind of money that was spent on addressing the problems Estens identified. This will be available on a yearly basis. Surely to goodness, even people who are as unfamiliar with the uses to which money can be put as Senator Conroy is can understand that the interest on $2 billion is going to provide a fund under which telecommunications services in regional areas will be maintained at a very high level.
The immediate upfront $1.1 billion funding includes: $878 million for Broadband Connect, to provide all Australians with affordable broadband services; $113 million for Clever Networks, to roll out innovative broadband networks for new applications to improve delivery of health, education and other essential services in regional Australia—very important; $30 million for Mobile Connect, to extend terrestrial mobile coverage and continue satellite handset subsidies for more remote areas of Australia; and, on top of all of that, there is $90 million for Backing Indigenous Ability, to deliver a comprehensive package addressing phones, internet and videoconferencing in remote Indigenous communities and improved Indigenous radio and television. This is a marvellous package. It is a tremendous package for regional Australia. The government is very proud to have come up with a package like this, in keeping faith with the people of regional Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,11,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I follow my colleague Senator Conroy in speaking on this take note of answers motion with profound disappointment in the outcome, not least because of Senator Joyce’s massive sell-out on the sale of Telstra but because of the implications for people right around Australia, particularly those in rural and regional areas but also those in metropolitan areas. For many years the Labor opposition has been extremely diligent in forensically drawing out information on the appalling conduct of Telstra in the Australian telecommunications marketplace—appalling conduct that has been singularly condoned and encouraged by the Howard government for the sole purpose of fattening up their bottom line for this moment.
I am astounded by the ignorance with which the National Party senators have chosen to break a promise that they made at the last election—the promise they made saying that they understood this, that they understood how profoundly Australians had been ripped off with respect to telecommunications for the last nine years. The Nationals in Queensland claimed they were opposing the sale because it was only through the retention of the majority of Telstra in public hands that these problems could be solved.
Today we see something very different. We see a package announced by the Howard government that they claim will solve these problems. I can tell you after three Senate inquiries, the Estens inquiry, the Besley inquiry and numerous investigations into the conduct of Telstra by the ACCC, the Productivity Commission and the minister’s own request for further information, Telstra as a company are incapable of servicing rural and regional Australia. They are incapable of it because they have allowed their network to run down to such a terrible state that they cannot provide the services.
I do not think it is possible to observe this massive sell-out without looking at some of the facts that underlie the problems in the Telstra network and at why this so-called $1.1 billion will be so completely ineffectual in resolving them. There are a couple of issues. First of all, we know that barely more than 1,000 of the 5,500 Telstra exchanges in this country are ADSL—or broadband—enabled. Is the Howard government saying that all of those exchanges will be ADSL enabled? I can tell you that Telstra’s response to that, despite previous offers of funding and access to some sort of taxpayer subsidy, have determined that this is not commercially viable for them. They would rather sit back and brush aside the complaints than service the needs of rural and regional Australians. We have thousands of exchanges in rural Australia that have not been upgraded and are unlikely to be. We do not know how the funds that have been provided now are going to be spent. If we look at how they have been spent in the past, we know that Telstra will continue to use them for bandaid solutions. That will not serve the long-term needs and interests of rural and regional Australia.
Another issue that I have a few words to say about is line splitting or pair gain technology. There are 1.2 million people in this country serviced by inferior, el cheapo technology called pair gain that is totally unsuitable for broadband. In fact, it blocks broadband. Telstra has not agreed in any way, shape or form to remove these broadband blockers from their network. There is no sign in this agreement that this will be done. We know that Telstra themselves previously put on the public record that the costs of removing broadband blockers in their network are around $5 billion to $8 billion. So how is $1.1 billion going to solve these broadband blockers and get them out of the network? I can tell you that 400,000 or so of these people are in rural and regional Australia, but 800,000 people who are on a broadband blocking technology are in metropolitan areas. They are in new estates and high-rise buildings in the CBDs of the cities. There are no solutions in this sop. There are no solutions in this slush fund that has been offered to The Nationals for telecommunications in this country. It represents the biggest sell-out in telecommunications—(Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-08-17,"—Mr Deputy President, if you ever doubted that the Labor Party have utterly marginalised themselves in this debate then you only had to listen to the two previous speakers who carried the debate in this chamber. Frequently they are the two, the tag team, who stand up to debate the Telstra issue. They could not have been more marginalised in their presentations today, after the announcement today by the Prime Minister and the minister for communications—in fact the whole government—in relation to the future proofing plan of Telstra, an announcement worth some $3.1 billion. All we hear from Labor is that same old bogey—‘don’t sell Telstra’. They lay their whole case on the basis of antiprivatisation. First of all, no-one believes them because of their record in government, no less than the outrageous and dishonest sale of the Commonwealth Bank. More than that, they utterly underestimate the constituency, particularly in rural and regional areas. The constituency in those areas is not against the privatisation of Telstra at all.
—I raise a point of order. Mr Deputy President, I believe that Senator McGauran specifically misled the Senate on that point.
—There is no point of order.
—Although Senator Lundy has gone into shock over that statement, let me repeat it. She underestimates the constituency, in particular, of the rural and regional areas that are not against it in the main. If you look hard enough you will find some against—
—I raise a point of order. Mr Deputy President, I believe Senator McGauran is misleading this chamber.
—There is no point of order.
—She is reeling in shock. The point is that rural and regional people are quite pragmatic about the ownership of Telstra. They know it is not who owns Telstra, government or private, it is whether the services can and will be delivered and are up to scratch. That has been our position all along. If you think that they are hooked on some ideological bent in regard to the sale of Telstra then you are out of touch—and, of course, you are. Last week Labor brought in a matter of public importance quoting some pretty dodgy polls from the Canberra Times and elsewhere in regard to the populism position they are taking: that rural and regional areas are against the privatisation of Telstra. Let me remind the other side, for the umpteenth time in this debate, that we have gone to the election on four occasions with this policy and we, as a coalition, hold more rural and regional seats than you. That is the ultimate poll, and that is the ultimate piece of evidence that you need. Every time you try and trump this up as an issue in this chamber, let alone out in the electorate or at election time, you fall flat. Today you have fallen completely flat. Talk about flogging a dead horse. Senator Ronaldson, you will probably get your turn tomorrow because last week and this week is the only chance they have to run on it. We will start a tag team match ourselves against Lundy and Conroy. Ronaldson and I will get up and we will debate—
—Senator McGauran, please refer to Senators by their correct titles. I have pulled up a couple of people on both sides for this today.
—He was formerly Mr Ronaldson, now Senator Ronaldson. The government have had three planks on this matter. First of all, we have sought to encourage competition. Second, we have sought to bring regulation to the industry across the board—such as a customer service guarantee. Third, where the market fails the government will inject funds, in particular in rural and regional areas, to fill that market failure and to bring the infrastructure and services up to a parity. The coalition believes that the sale of Telstra has always been in the public interest, let alone in the interests of the 1.7 million existing shareholders.
The five minutes given for this are not enough for our case to be put, but I recommend that the opposition go to today’s press release from the Prime Minister and the minister for communications to read about the $3.1 billion to be injected into rural and regional areas particularly, and to understand that this is a major policy which will be supported by the rural and regional areas, despite your anger and feigned objection.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,11,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-08-17,"—As a regional and rural Queensland senator, I am astonished at the contribution made by Senator McGauran. He had the audacity to say that regional and rural Australians do not oppose the sale of Telstra. I think that is what he said. He is nodding.
—Yes.
—That is in fact what he said. I saw the Newspoll in the Australian yesterday that said that 70 per cent of Australians were opposed to the sale of Telstra and that in Queensland that figure is closer to 80 per cent. Eighty per cent of Queenslanders in rural and regional areas and in the cities oppose the sale of Telstra.
—Rubbish.
—I saw it in Newspoll—
—Till services are up to standard.
—I want to go to that question. At the last election, Senator Joyce and other National Party candidates stood on a platform that was absolutely plain and clear—they were opposed to the sale of Telstra. There were no conditions. This was not a conditional pledge. This was a straightforward pledge to Queensland that they opposed the sale of Telstra.
Queensland has been dudded at the very first test of Senator Joyce. The man has been walking around Queensland for the last nine months pledging himself to represent his state. In his very first speech in this place he committed to supporting the sale of the rest of Telstra. Queensland has been dudded absolutely in a political sense, and we can also say goodbye to proper communications systems for most of our state. Senator Joyce knows absolutely too well—or at least he should; maybe he does not—that most of Queensland does not live in the capital city. We are a decentralised state, and we rely on very strong communications in order to run our businesses and to keep in touch with the rest of Australia. We have the most to lose of any state, and last night it would seem that we lost it.
Senator Joyce has said many times, including last night quite interestingly, that he is going to represent the interests of his state and not the interests of his party. He said that at the beginning of his speech last night. By the time he got to the end of it, he had committed to selling Telstra. I do not know what can happen in a 20-minute speech that you can convince yourself that the best way to represent the interests of Queensland is to sell Telstra.
The question that needs to be asked is: why do so many Australians, and 80 per cent of Queenslanders, oppose the sale of Telstra? It is because these people understand how the communication markets work. They know that once Telstra is privatised, once Telstra’s responsibility to turn a profit for its shareholders is its first and only priority, it will remove itself from unprofitable markets—that is, markets that do not turn a dollar for its shareholders. I would suggest that those markets are all of the areas outside the east coast of Queensland. Every single communications receiver outside of that east coast will be an unprofitable market and therefore Telstra will have to be pushed into doing anything about delivering those people services.
People out there know that when the banks were privatised and deregulated there was no compulsion for them to remain in the bush, and they left. People have seen the evidence in the banking industry, and they know that is what is going to happen to their communications sector. The other thing that Queenslanders have been dudded over is this notion that there is an enormous amount of money that is going to fill the void of providing them services. I suggest that Senator Joyce has a good look at the fine print of what the government is proposing. It is not too late for Senator Joyce to say quite clearly that he actually does represent Queensland and that he is prepared to stand up for Queenslanders and do what 80 per cent of us want him to do, and that is oppose the sale of Telstra. I encourage him to look closely at the fine print of the financial proposals that the government has put forward and to think about the people who voted for him.

Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

Export Control (Meat and Meat Products) Amendment Orders 2005 (No. 1)

These Orders make various amendments to the Principal Orders including ensuring that the matters which must be notified extend to changes in, or convictions incurred by, all persons who manage and control operations at an establishment regardless of whether the occupier of the establishment is an individual, a corporation or a partnership.
New subclause 12.4, which is inserted by item [40] of this instrument, requires an occupier of a registered establishment to give the Secretary written notice if the manager or controller of operations carried on at the establishment is convicted of a serious offence. It is not clear whether this subclause is intended to create an obligation on the part of the occupier to inquire about any convictions that a manager or controller may have or, conversely, whether there is an onus on managers or controllers to inform occupiers about such convictions.
The Committee has received a response and proposes to seek further advice from the Minister.

Income Tax Assessment Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 2), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 75

These Regulations amend the Principal Regulations to reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs by allowing amounts in a foreign currency to be translated into Australian currency or an applicable functional currency using rates of exchange other than those currently prescribed in the income tax law.
The amendments in Schedule 1 to these Regulations are taken to have commenced on 1 July 2003. The Explanatory Statement indicates that this is the same commencement date as the relevant sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. However, the Explanatory Statement does not contain any assurance, in terms of subsection 12(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 that no person other than the Commonwealth is disadvantaged by the retrospective operation of these amendments. The Committee sought an assurance that no person had been disadvantaged by the retrospective commencement.
In seeking this assurance, the Committee also sought clarification regarding the operation of subregulation 775-145.01(6). This subregulation is taken to have commenced on 1 July 2003. It provides that an entity can withdraw an election to apply forex realisation events to foreign currency, or fungible rights to receive or provide foreign currency, only if it does not appear, on reasonable grounds, that the election is being withdrawn for a principal purpose of obtaining a tax benefit. This appears to contemplate the possibility that the withdrawal of an election may, retrospectively, be found to be invalid, thus disadvantaging the entity.
The Committee has received a response and is seeking further advice from the Minister.

Modification Declaration No. 1 made under section 177 of the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997

The Committee notes that section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 directs a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken particularly where a proposed instrument is likely to have an effect on business. Section 18 of the Act provides that in some circumstances consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate. The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Act requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken. The Explanatory Statement that accompanies this Declaration makes no reference to consultation. The Committee therefore sought advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation.
This Declaration commenced on the date it was signed, being 2 May 2005. The instrument was registered on 6 May 2005. The consequence of subsection 12(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 is that where an instrument takes effect before the date it is registered, the Committee requires that the Explanatory Statement give an assurance that no person other than the Commonwealth is disadvantaged by the retrospective commencement. The Explanatory Statement accompanying this instrument does not give such an assurance.

Veterans’ Entitlements (Veterans’ Children Education Scheme—Scholarships, Statistics, MRCA) Instrument 2004—Instrument No. R11/2004

This instrument was made on 9 December 2004. Clause 2 of the instrument states that it commences on its approval by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. That approval was given on 4 January 2005. The instrument was registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments on 5 April 2005.
Section 55 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 has the effect that where a legislative instrument was made before 1 January 2005, but was not published in the Gazette before that date, the instrument is to be treated as if it had been made on 1 January 2005 and thus comes under the requirements of the Act. It does not appear that this instrument was published in the Gazette before 1 January 2005. If that is the case, the instrument is subject to the Act.
If this instrument is taken to have commenced on the date of the Minister’s approval (4 January 2005), and the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 applies, an issue may arise under subsection 12(2) of the Act. That subsection provides that an instrument which purports to take effect before the date it is registered has no effect if it adversely affects the rights or liabilities of a person other than the Commonwealth. While it appears that this present instrument does not have any adverse effect on persons other than the Commonwealth, no such assurance is given in the Explanatory Statement. Indeed, the Explanatory Statement indicates that there is no retrospective effect. The Committee therefore sought advice about the proper commencement date of this instrument and an assurance that it does not adversely affect persons in accordance with subsection 12(2) of the Act.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,NOTICES,13,1

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-17,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Senate and all political leaders to express strong support for multiculturalism in Australia as playing a key role in the battle against extremism, in light of the increased public vilification and antagonism towards Muslims and other ethnic communities in Australia.
I only have a short time to contribute to this debate on the motion that the Democrats have put forward, and I thank colleagues from other parties for their support in bringing it on. It is an urgent and straightforward matter. We as a nation—and, indeed, as a global society—are currently looking at the challenges put forward by extremism and people urging violence upon many aspects of society, for a whole range of reasons. Extremism is not new, and ideologically motivated extremist violence is not new either, but in the modern world it can touch all of us much more, wherever we are in the world. What is new for Australia is the recognition that we are less able to be immune from the consequences of some of those aspects of extremism and extremist motivated violence.
The key aspect of this motion that I have put forward today—and I hope it is a non-controversial one for all of us here—is to try to provide an opportunity at the early stages of the debate, which has been renewed following the London bombings, for all members of this Senate to reaffirm our strong support for multiculturalism and the key principles of equality that underpin it. It is a key solution to dealing with the threats posed by extremism, particularly in the light of some of the increased public vilification and antagonism towards some in our community following the London bombings—most notably Muslim communities in Australia, but others as well. The actions of a few white extremists in parts of my own state of Queensland have got more attention than they deserved but, nonetheless, they got attention for their attempts to spread blatantly racist, extremist and violent assertions around their local community.
The extra need to pass this motion, I believe, is twofold. Firstly, as part of those attacks on some people of a particular ethnic, cultural or religious background in Australia, there have also been attacks on multiculturalism. We have had the usual complete misrepresentations of what multiculturalism is about by some of those in the media who practice divisiveness as a matter of course. Piers Ackerman is one name that springs to mind as someone who says that multiculturalism has always argued that every culture and every political ideology is equal. Of course it has not at all. We have had similar sorts of assertions from Janet Albrechtsen, for example, that multiculturalism allegedly promotes all cultures as equal.
All of those people—deliberately or ignorantly, I do not know—ignore the key fact that when we are talking about multiculturalism, a key principle is recognising the importance and value of diversity in the context of a liberal democratic country which at its own core has diversity as a key value. That is why we are a liberal democratic country; that is why defending democracy is so important in all contexts, let alone the context of threats from extremists. The key principle of democracy is enabling expression of diverse views within the framework of those core values. The key principles of multiculturalism are also recognising the benefits of ensuring that all people can equally participate in society and that they can all contribute something of value, regardless of their cultural background, their religious heritage, the colour of their skin or anything else. That is the key aspect of multiculturalism. It is the keystone which is hand in glove with the foundation of liberal democracy in Australia.
The best way to fight extremism is through promoting diversity and connectedness between communities. The absolute certainty whether you promote segregation or assimilation—as I think Arnold Zable wrote in a column in the Age a few weeks ago—is that they are basically two sides of the same coin. We have seen many examples of that around the world where you have people from different backgrounds living in a community. If you try to segregate them, divide them or separate them out as having different values, different characteristics and different worth, that is the inevitable road to violence, extremism and injustice.
This motion is to emphasise multiculturalism not just on its own merits but as a key value in tackling extremism. That is something that I believe needs to be reaffirmed by all of us, whatever our political persuasion, so that we can put that aspect of the debate to bed and ensure that all Australians can participate equally and with security in the difficult challenges we have to face into the future in tackling extremism. I hope this is something that all members of this chamber can support, because it is something that I think we need to use as a simple building block to really move forward in a united way. If we allow ourselves to be divided and if we allow ourselves to have our democratic values stripped away in response to threats from terrorists or extremists of any sort, then they are halfway down the track to winning.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2005-08-17,"—I support the sentiments of the motion moved by Senator Bartlett, but I do have some concerns about what this motion does not say, as opposed to what it does say. I say to Senator Bartlett that implicit in this motion is the charge that a current or future increase in extremism is or will be directly related to this chamber’s level of commitment to multiculturalism or the level of commitment of our political leaders to multiculturalism. That is obviously patent nonsense. Also implicit in this motion is that there is such a lack of commitment to multiculturalism by this chamber or our political leaders that there is a rising level of public vilification and antagonism towards our Muslim community as a result. Again, with the greatest respect to Senator Bartlett, that is patent nonsense. I say to Senator Bartlett that not only is this patent nonsense but it is actually deeply offensive. And I would have thought, ironically, that it would be deeply offensive to his leader.
Surely we are not so immature as a nation that a debate on extremism or totally inappropriate public vilification of certain sections of our community is reduced to a debate about who is more committed to multiculturalism. So that Senator Bartlett does not rush out and continue this foolishness by saying that the government is not committed to multiculturalism, I am regrettably forced to again put on the public record the government’s commitment. I will then get back to the nub of this debate. The government is deeply committed to multiculturalism. It is one of Australia’s major achievements and a natural response to our cultural diversity and our democratic Australian values. It is worth looking back at our history.
On 30 October 1996, the Prime Minister moved the parliamentary statement on racial tolerance. The statement passed both houses of federal parliament, unanimously reaffirming the parliament’s commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society, united by an overriding commitment to our nation and its democratic institutions and values. The government’s vision for a diverse but united Australia remains as valid as ever today. In 1999, in response to the landmark report by the National Multicultural Advisory Council, the government released its multicultural policy, A New Agenda for Multicultural Australia. It was updated in 2003 in the statement Multicultural Australia: united in diversity. The government believes Australian multiculturalism is for all Australians and emphasises mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The government believes the policy also unites Australians for a common commitment to the basic structures and principles which underpin our democratic society.
The Living in Harmony initiative is the government’s antiracism campaign. It is directed at the wider community. It supports local solutions to local issues through community grants and partnerships with national organisations to promote harmony and understanding. The government’s multicultural policy and its programs seek to capitalise on our strengths to benefit us all, to guarantee us all fairness and to strengthen our community through encouraging equality and belonging. Senator Bartlett, I reinforce the government’s commitment—and my own commitment—to multiculturalism. Public vilification and antagonism against any section of our community, whether Christian, Jew, Muslim, Palestinian, Kurd or anyone else, is abhorrent to all of us and is totally un-Australian.
As I said in my maiden speech, terrorism and extremism are the greatest threats to our region and to democratic nations throughout the world. Quite simply, we must work together to address this threat. The challenge is enormous. Everyone in this chamber would agree that it is not a short-term challenge; it is a short-term, medium-term and long-term challenge.
What is important is an acknowledgment by all of us that the Muslim community in this country is under threat from within. Radical clerics and spokespeople are undermining the genuine endeavours and the commitment of the moderate majority as they try to deal with extremism and negative perceptions. To reinforce that point and the threat from within—and to reinforce the difficulties that the moderate majority Muslim community in this country are up against—I will briefly quote from the transcript of an interview between Sheikh Mohammad Omran, who is based in Melbourne, and Peter Overton on 60 Minutes on 24 July this year:
PETER OVERTON: Who is responsible for September 11?
SHEIKH MOHAMMAD OMRAN: I don’t want to say USA Government, but I would say some of them, they are responsible for that.
PETER OVERTON: The Government is responsible?
SHEIKH MOHAMMAD OMRAN: Yes. Yes! I believe in that 100 percent. I believe there is—what they call it? A conspiracy against Islam and Muslims.
PETER OVERTON: I think the average person out there would be amazed that you don’t think Osama bin Laden was responsible for September 11.
SHEIKH MOHAMMAD OMRAN: There is a mastermind behind these things and the mastermind 100 percent he is from the US Government.
There are a number of those kinds of examples. I am not going to go through them because the risk is that that would reinforce some negative perception.
I quote from this to reinforce how we as the wider community have to passionately support the moderate Muslim community. We must support them to ensure that they are able to fight that threat from within. We must encourage that moderate Muslim community to stand up and support the wider community in ensuring that the voices of those who threaten not just the Muslim community but the wider Australian community are no longer heard. Whether, as I said in my maiden speech, the approach of Tony Blair, who seeks to deport radical clerics, is the answer the wider community wants and the moderate Muslim majority wants or not—and it is certainly my preferred course of action, as I said in this chamber the other night—we have to work together to support those who are committed to fighting extremism.
I would be bitterly disappointed if Senator Bartlett’s claims of the extent of vilification against the Muslim community are true—and I must admit that I do take some issue with Senator Bartlett about that. If I am wrong, I humbly apologise to him. But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness of the majority of people in this country. And I fundamentally believe that they are as supportive of the endeavours of that moderate Muslim majority as everyone in this chamber is. If anything is to come out of this motion today—apart from a reinforcement of our commitment to multiculturalism—it should be to reinforce that this chamber passionately supports the majority of Australians who passionately support that moderate Muslim majority. If we achieve that today then it has been a successful motion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-08-17,"—There were a couple of issues that Senator Ronaldson went to that I cannot let pass without comment. One of those issues is this government’s commitment to multiculturalism. I would put more than a question mark over it. This government can and do adopt an approach of what I might call ‘glad handling’ and doing the multicultural festivals. But when it comes to the hard yards of promoting this area and ensuring that there exists a true spirit of multiculturalism they are absent from the field. They do not defend it in the public forums; they do not defend it in the private forums. They disappear. They are nowhere to be seen when it comes to the hard yards that have to be made in this area. When you look at some of the material that this government puts out under the banner of multiculturalism, you do not see documents that portray this government’s commitment to multiculturalism. What you see instead is a jungle full of impenetrable documents.
One example comes to mind when you look at the Public Service. You would expect that the executive government could ensure that the Public Service had a commitment to multiculturalism. However, if you take the first example—that is, the access and equity report—you find that all the report does is simply provide a bit of backslapping. It does not provide a detailed way to ensure that this government maintains its commitment to multiculturalism, it does not ensure that there is a way for this government to assess how its own bureaucracy deals with multiculturalism and it does not ensure that the departments in fact adhere to the principles that our fine Senator Ronaldson was espousing. There is no test; there is no performance measure.
The access and equity report is a way, unfortunately, in which governments can simply provide a self-promotion of how they meet the goal. There is no external assessment as to whether they are in fact meeting performance, whether they have criteria to meet, other than flipping out an example of how they do meet it, all from their own records, not from a detailed analysis of how the departments themselves have been able to meet it.
Multiculturalism is not just a facet of our society; it is now a reality in Australia today. For too long, multicultural affairs has been ignored by this government. It has been an afterthought, an add-on or an optional extra not significant enough to warrant much initiative or consideration, let alone any defence of the issue. But the fact is that multiculturalism is simply indispensable to Australia. Our unique and wonderful blend of race and culture puts us in a position perhaps unrivalled anywhere else in the world. The concept of multiculturalism is not a new one. Government settlement services policy in Australia very quickly evolved from assimilation and integration to multiculturalism. It did not happen simply for the sake of it. As a national policy we tried assimilation, we tried integration and, bluntly, they failed. They should have failed and they did fail.
In 1966 the Henderson inquiry found that migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds suffered from high poverty rates. By the early 1970s many settlers were leaving Australia. They came and settled and then said, ‘We’re going back; this is too hard.’ So many settlers were leaving Australia that an inquiry was held to find out why. It is a complete waste of everyone’s time, money and effort if we manage to attract these migrants to live here but when they arrive they find it so difficult to get assistance and to establish a new life in our country that they get discouraged, they pack up and go home. What a mistake it is that this government is moving to attract 20,000 more skilled migrants but, at the same time, is ambivalent about defending the way in which we welcome them and acclimatise them culturally into this country. That is why a settlement services program is integral to immigration policy. That was why the Whitlam government immigration minister Al Grassby first adopted and began implementing a policy of multiculturalism. If immigration is integral to the success of our nation then so too is multiculturalism. The government knows that but continually chooses to ignore it.
Multiculturalism is not only about providing settlement services to migrants; it is also about promoting community harmony. There are twin goals. But times have changed since the 1970s, and we are now living in a world where terrorists seek to destroy the harmony and relationships that we have all sought to build over time. Events such as the bombings in Britain, the attacks of September 11 and, more close to home, the Bali bombings have unsettled some members of the community and, unfortunately, provoked some incidents of vilification and antagonism towards Muslims and other ethnic communities throughout Australia.
Senator Bartlett has brought this matter of urgency before the Senate, and I agree with him: it is a matter of urgency. We must all make it clear that we will not let such attacks—whether they occur on Australian soil or overseas—affect that which we have worked so hard to establish in this country. It is important to recognise that all groups in our society can contribute to the campaign against the threat of terrorism and thereby enhance our security.
If we continue to assist in providing a strong sense of belonging to all members of the greater community, the various groups in our society will come together and reject elements espousing extremist views. They will be more likely to report them and engage with our enforcement officers and our community. The vilification of any group within our society, especially the Muslim community, as a reaction to Muslim extremists and terrorists overseas will do nothing but be counterproductive to Australian security at home. Vilification of and antagonism towards Muslims and other groups within our community will, in truth, only serve to isolate them, thus cutting them off from the broader community, in direct contradiction of the definition of multiculturalism and what it seeks to achieve.
The feeling that migrants no longer belong could have the effect of driving more moderate people towards extreme views. It creates fertile ground for extremists to recruit and operate. The end result is that vilifying one section of our society only serves to undermine the very security we are trying to enhance. Multiculturalism is not only about settlement services but about social cohesion, the ability to bring people into our communities, inclusiveness in terms of building the services, self-dependency amongst groups and being able to engage with other groups. It does mean abandoning any of your cultural backdrop or the rich tapestry from where you came. It is about sharing and opening up your heart to others within the community and demonstrating your commitment to Australia, and it is about how Australians can demonstrate their commitment to ensure that you can celebrate with them both their culture and the culture of others. Vilification destroys that.
In 1999 a report of the National Multicultural Advisory Council looked at ways that our cultural diversity could become a unifying force for Australia throughout this century. Do not forget that that report was conducted prior to the terrible events of September 11. The aim of terrorists is to do just that—spread terror. By using attacks they are attempting to promote suspicion and fear within the society that we have created, and of course ignorance is their greatest tool. If we as members of this society choose to divide and segregate then they will win. But together and unified our diversity could become our greatest weapon.
Let me put it in this way. There are Muslims who live here and many are Australian citizens. They are not going to depart Australia. They are not going to leave if we end multiculturalism tomorrow. They are here to stay. The question we need to ask is: do we have a system which ensures social cohesion and respect for the law and Australian values, or do we turn our back on multiculturalism as a means of achieving this? The Muslim community in Australia participates and must continue to participate in the fight against terrorism, as does every other religious order, group and part of our community. It is about ensuring that all of our community recognises that terrorism is against the community, our social cohesion and the fabric of our society. It is not wanted, is not needed and should be rooted out.
There is a battle going on for the hearts and minds of disenfranchised, angry young men, be they of the Islamic or Christian faith, not just in Australia but throughout the world. In this country our best mechanism of defending ourselves against radical extremism or misguided interpretations of Islamic or other theology is to talk with and engage young people and find the places where assistance and help might be needed. It is much better and in the interests of all to look for common interests and goals amongst all Australian people. That is what multiculturalism, in truth, is about. Islamic radicalism is not covered by multiculturalism. A commitment to multiculturalism includes a commitment to this country and its laws.
Labor will not shy away from this issue or from continuing to support multiculturalism. It is something of which we can all be proud. It is something we have built together over time and something for which Australia can hold its head high on the international stage as one of the truly great countries in the world. Australia has sought to promote multiculturalism and has been successful with it. Multiculturalism is about accepting that we are not all the same and celebrating that very fact. It is about welcoming the points of view of others as well as their beliefs and customs. Australia’s future lies in developing our multicultural society. It will not and cannot shy away from it, regardless of the efforts of terrorists either here or overseas.
Labor is proud of its efforts in promoting multiculturalism. We are proud of our achievements. We have no problem at all with unambiguously supporting multiculturalism and standing firm against any act against members of our multicultural community. Multiculturalism makes everyone a stakeholder in this great Australian community. It says, ‘We are all in this together and we can make it work.’ We do not have the problems that beset Europe. If you take Germany or Holland, for example, there is either a perception in the host country that migrant communities are not participating or, alternatively, a perception in migrant communities that they are locked out of participation. Our society is a great society because Australians long ago anticipated the need to deal with mass migration from different cultures and sought a successful way to ensure that that could happen.
All of us must play a part in protecting the great legacy of Whitlam; Al Grassby; Galbally, who is not often mentioned in these debates but who was a leader in the field; and Fraser, Hawke and Keating as politicians who pursued these initiatives. I think I have said this on a number of occasions, but it is always worth saying again: it is one of those phrases that Al Grassby coined. He said:
My personal ambition is that Australians of all backgrounds will always be proud before the world to say in whatever accents ‘I am an Australian’ ...",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2005-08-17,"—In speaking on this urgency motion, I would remind the Senate that Australia is a very successful and harmonious multicultural society, fostered by successive governments over many years. In my first speech I traced my family’s journey from my father’s arrival in 1953 to the day he sat proudly to watch his daughter in the Senate. I relayed my parents’ story which, like that of millions of other migrants, is a story of hard work; of dedication to the cause of building a better life for themselves and their family; and of pride and satisfaction as they look back over the years and the vital contribution they have made to the nation’s economic, social and cultural success. Their vision was one of a diverse but united society founded on important values such as support for family values; a strong work ethic; respect for its laws; of learning English as their new language—whilst retaining their original language; of community interaction and voluntary service; and the need to live in peace and harmony. This vision for a diverse but united Australia remains as valid today as it was for those millions of migrants who made Australia their home.
The government is committed to its multicultural programs. They have been one of Australia’s major achievements—a natural response to our unique cultural diversity and democratic Australian values. As Senator Ronaldson mentioned, on 30 October 1996 the Prime Minister moved the Parliamentary Statement on Racial Tolerance, which was supported by both houses of our parliament. It reaffirmed the commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society—a society united by an overriding commitment to our nation, and its democratic institutions and values.
Australia’s multicultural policy is one for all Australians. It is a policy based on the important tenets of mutual respect and shared responsibility. It unites Australians through a common commitment to the basic structures and principles which underpin our democratic society. I would like to take a moment to highlight some of the features of that policy. The government’s programs encourage responses to cultural diversity issues by the public, private and community sectors. Such programs as the Access and Equity Strategy make sure that all Australians have equal access to government services, irrespective of language or background. The Australian government also actively promotes the use of our cultural diversity as a rich source of language skills within our work force.
The Living in Harmony initiative is the government’s anti-racism campaign directed at the wider community. One of the aspects of this program is Harmony Day, and I was particularly pleased to represent the minister at various Harmony Day celebrations this year. It is a program which supports local solutions to local issues through community grants and partnerships with national organisations to promote harmony and understanding.
The government’s policy and programs seek to capitalise on our strengths to benefit us all, guarantee us all fairness, and strengthen our community through encouraging equality and belonging. Today’s new arrivals are assisted by generous, world-class settlement services. When millions like my parents arrived here, there were no such services. Getting a job and becoming self-sufficient was the key to building a better life for yourself and your family. Our generous settlement services demonstrate in a practical way that our newest migrants and humanitarian entrants are welcome in Australia. Equally importantly, such services help immigrants to adjust to Australian life and facilitate them to become productive members of society.
I have lived my life across the diversity that is Australia. I was born in Port Kembla. I grew up in Wollongong—a city where people from many different parts of the world came to work, raise their families and live harmoniously together. It was a city where its schools taught the many children of migrants—many not speaking English at first but soon learning to integrate, tolerate and forge lifelong friendships across the diversity. Over the years I have observed firsthand that Australia is a place where all of us, despite our differences, have shown that we are willing to listen, discuss and consider. Australia is a tolerant and compassionate society founded on understanding and respecting differences. With this tolerance has come the responsibility of integration in the Australian way of life and a respect for Australian customs and usages. In a globalised world this openness of approach has proved to be a great asset. It is also our strength against terrorism and extremism.
The attacks of September 11, the Bali bombing and the London bombings have put multiculturalism under the spotlight. We therefore cannot be complacent regarding the success of government policy to date. Recently, we have seen media coverage about the ethnic composition of our migration program. There have been unfounded and racist attacks published in the media on some of our newest communities. However, if we do move away from our policies of inclusiveness we risk playing into the hands of terrorists. Through partnership with the Australian Muslim community, the government is taking a strong stand against those who threaten Australia’s community harmony and way of life.
The Prime Minister is chairing a summit with key representatives from the Australian Islamic community on 23 August. This summit will discuss how we can work together to address extremist views in the Australian community. The summit will also focus on ways we can enhance social cohesion within the Australian community and eliminate intolerance and extremism. Furthermore, on 5 August the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs met with Muslim and media representatives to explore ways to achieve a more informed media debate. A similar forum is planned for Melbourne on 31 August. In conclusion, the government is absolutely committed to policies of mutual respect and to an inclusive Australian society.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-08-17,"—The Greens wholeheartedly support the motion before the Senate. We endorse the need to strongly support multiculturalism in Australia and hope that all senators will join us in this view. Multiculturalism in Australia is a fact. It is not a theory or an experiment, as some would have us believe. It is a fact and has been at least since European colonisation of the continent began. Those who contend that Australian culture has ever been homogenous are simply wrong, and there are generations of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, Chinese, Jewish, Arab, Irish, Pacific Islander, German and so many other cultural groups living in Australia who are proof of this.
Australia is a multicultural nation—perhaps one of the most multicultural nations in the world—but it is not this fact that we should be grappling with but, rather, how we as a nation should manage our multicultural nature. It is the attack not only on the fact of multiculturalism but also on the policy of promoting multiculturalism that has given rise to this debate, and it is an attack which the Greens utterly reject. The motivations behind these attacks, including the ridiculous arguments put forward by former Nationals senator John Stone, are at their core racist. They exploit the phenomenon of bin Laden inspired terrorist acts to make claims for racist immigration policy, cultural assimilation and cultural and racial isolationism.
The Greens are proud of Australia’s progress down the road of celebrating our multiculturalism. In the face of opposition, the reaction should be not to give in to hate and prejudice but to redouble our efforts at better understanding one another and at learning and living with our multiculturalism. It is important to be clear about what this means. Celebrating multiculturalism is not the same as tolerating different cultures. Enjoying the benefits of multiculturalism is not about coexisting with other cultures—it must be more than this; it is about living with, interacting with and valuing our different cultures.
If we can only tolerate and respect and not interact with and value our different cultures, then multiculturalism has stalled and the racists will be empowered. We should note the prevalence of the language of ‘respect’ and ‘coexistence’ that permeates recent racist discourse. This means that all communities must make efforts not to defensively close off to one another during times of tension but, instead, continue to interact, to welcome and value one another. This is not about assimilation: assimilation is about dominant cultures killing off others. Multicultural interaction is about growing cultural understanding and celebration.
The positive stories of cultural diversity in Australia outweigh the demonising myths of the racists a thousandfold. Any reasonable analysis of the cultural diversity of Australia’s recent history will attest to the overwhelming benefits it has brought to all Australians. The Greens welcome the opportunity to recognise this fact, to reaffirm the importance of multicultural celebration, and look forward to a culturally diverse future for Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2005-08-17,"—I too have followed the debate in the media about multiculturalism with interest, and sometimes with alarm, depending on the opinion. Australia is composed of people originating from many different countries: 43 per cent of Australians were born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas. There are 200 languages spoken in Australia. We are a multicultural country and will continue to be. The fact is we cannot do away with multiculturalism in this country without proposing some sort of other practical way to address the diversity in our country. That is what a lot of the debate that has gone on in the media has not addressed. If multiculturalism is not the way of the future, if it no longer copes in our country, what do we replace it with?
In the Labor Party we do not believe it needs replacing. We believe that multiculturalism, as a philosophy, has adapted and expanded to deal with our society. As other speakers have said, multiculturalism has brought great benefits to Australia. It has been widely acknowledged that the diversity and strengths that multiculturalism bring have been of great advantage to Australia.
There was quite an interesting quote in the Australian Financial Review on the weekend. There was an interview with the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. Speaking about China, he says:
You’ve got to fear China and you’ve got to embrace it. Take advantage of its market and know the only way you are going to win is if you bring something new. You’re not going to win with a me-too product.
Further on in the article he says:
I don’t think the distance between Australia and China, compared to the US and China, is giving you any competitive advantage. It is the number of [Chinese] people you have. It’s the knowledge base, the feel you have. I think the more Chinese people you have, the better.
He goes on to explain that one of the great advantages for the United States is its diversity of people.
Certainly one of the great advantages for Australia too is its diversity of people. Not only does it assist us in the areas of trade and foreign affairs but it has also made our everyday lives much richer and more valuable in cultural areas like philosophy, literature, music and also in the skills it has brought to Australia. There are many areas like medicine and industrial areas where the skills have been of tremendous value to Australians. Also, the hard work and family values and the depth it has brought to Australian life has been a well acknowledged facet of multiculturalism.
But there is the question today of—under the changed circumstances of terrorism, following terrorist attacks in the United States, England, the Middle East and other areas of the world—can we in Australia unite in harmony? Can we have cohesion in our society with such diversity? We have a long history in Australia of citizens of Muslim faith and it has not been recognised as a problem. The issue now is that some people are worried about the number of people of Muslim faith in Australia and the number who have what is regarded as an extreme view of that faith. We must be realistic in our view of this. A lot of the Muslim leaders in Australia are very realistic about it. For example, Dr Zachariah Matthews, head of the Australian Islamic Mission, said of young people in the Muslim community:
...we cannot allow them to be misled by those who are using twisted logic combined with hate-filled revenge to justify terrorism under the banner of Islam, because the killing of innocent human beings can never be endorsed as Islamic.
He goes on to talk about the need to include young Islamic people in Australian culture. So there is a recognition within the Muslim communities of the dangers of not being a part of the Australian community and not fully including young people in our society.
I do not think we have anything to fear from Muslim culture, and its differences, providing that the moderate force prevails in our society. Indeed, in Australia we have laws and regulations which ensure that Australian values are preserved. If there is any fear about the influx of people of different cultures and religion coming into Australia then we need to address it through an examination of our laws and regulations rather than tarring all people of that religion or ethnic group with the same brush.
I think the answer from all sides of this chamber today is that we can live in harmony providing we address correctly the way we live. Senators from the government side have talked about the government’s initiatives in promoting harmony. Indeed there is a particular Living in Harmony initiative and Harmony Day has been a part of that. It has been a very useful initiative in bringing people together. I applaud the government’s response in that area, but in their own report, Multicultural Australia: united in diversity, they talk about the access and equity issue. The report says:
The primary objective of the Access and Equity strategy is to ensure that government services and programs are attuned to the realities of diversity in Australian society. There is a strong case for better developing even greater levels of government investment in vulnerable individuals.
I think that is the key point here—the government’s failing has been in developing that access and equity for vulnerable individuals in our society. I have no problem with the government referring to it as an investment, because it is indeed an investment in people, an investment in our country. The issue is that the government programs have not been sufficient in the areas that are critical to people coming into this society, wanting to learn English, wanting to get a job and wanting to get some assistance with settlement so that they and their family can be properly part of the Australian community. It is in those areas of education and employment that I think the government has been lacking, and because the government supports multiculturalism it should pay more attention to these critical areas to ensure that we do continue to benefit from the input of diverse societies within our community.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Multiculturalism</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,25,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-08-17,"—Like other government senators, I support the motion. Multiculturalism has been a central fact of Australia’s national life for some 30 years now. The reason it has been a central fact of our nation’s life is because it has been embraced with equal commitment by both sides of politics. I am at pains to say that because, listening to Senator Ludwig earlier in the afternoon, one may have thought that it is one side of politics—the Australian Labor Party—which has contributed more to the development of multiculturalism in this country than the non-Labor side of politics. Not so.
The necessary prerequisite to the development of multiculturalism was the elimination of a racially discriminatory immigration policy. That process—a process that happened on both sides of Australian politics—was begun by the Holt Liberal government in 1966 and brought to fulfilment by the Whitlam Labor government in the early 1970s. Both sides of Australian politics contributed to that fundamental reorientation of Australian values. Much has been made of the role of Mr Whitlam and Mr Grassby in the development of multiculturalism, and I acknowledge it, but there is another person who I think shares equal honours with Mr Grassby to be regarded as the father of Australian multiculturalism, and that is Mr Petro Georgiou, the member for Kooyong.
I want to read to the Senate a lost piece of Australian history, which is recounted by Dr Mark Lopez in his book, The Origins of Multiculturalism in Australian Politics 1945-1975. Dr Lopez speaks of a function hosted by the Greek Australian Liberal Association—GALA—on 26 October 1975. When one dwells on the date—26 October 1975—one can imagine why this important turning point in Australian history was missed. But on that occasion, the Leader of the Opposition, soon to be Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, delivered a speech. Dr Lopez recounts the story:
… Fraser used the GALA Ball to declare his support for multiculturalism and ending the era of Anglo-conformism. Fraser’s speech, drafted by Georgiou, included the following unambiguous statement: ‘We as Liberals are committed to encouraging and supporting diversity in our multi-cultural society. We reject the sterile Anglo-conformity of past days.’ Georgiou, after presenting the draft to Fraser, had questioned him about whether he was aware of the implications of those lines: ‘I said, “Do you really want to say this?” And he said, “Yes”’. Georgiou had wanted Fraser to support multiculturalism but only then realised the extent of Fraser’s commitment. Fraser later explained his motives in these terms: ‘Because whatever the Labor Party was going to do, whatever Gough was going to do, it needed somebody on the conservative side of politics to really say that Anglo-Saxon Australia is dead. This isn’t the kind of society we are.’
That occasion, 26 October 1975, marks the point in Australian history when multiculturalism was officially adopted as the policy position of both sides of politics.
Dr Barry York, the well-known historian of Australian immigration, in a paper published by the ANU in 1996, while giving great credit to the Whitlam government’s initiatives, went on to say:
... multiculturalism’s institutional development and its incorporation into the political structures of society really took place under the Liberal government of Malcolm Fraser. Examples of Fraser’s multicultural structures include SBS-TV and the Australian Institute for Multicultural Affairs, which later became the Office of Multicultural Affairs within the Prime Minister’s Department.
Malcolm Fraser, who is much criticised on my side of politics these days, will always have an honourable place as one of the Australian statesmen who ushered in the era of multiculturalism. In conclusion, I will quote some words he used in giving the inaugural address to the Institute of Multicultural Affairs on 30 November 1981. He said:
... multiculturalism is concerned with far more than the passive toleration of diversity. It sees diversity as a quality to be actively embraced, a source of social wealth and dynamism. It encourages groups to be open and to interact, so that all Australians may learn and benefit from each other’s heritages. Multiculturalism is about diversity, not division—it is about interaction not isolation. It is about the cultural and ethnic differences set within a framework of shared fundamental values which enables them to co-exist on a complementary rather than competitive basis.
Those values, embraced by my side and the other side of politics, have been the shared values of this land for 30 years, and we say, ‘Long may they continue to be so.’
