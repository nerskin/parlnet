Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (09:01)  by leave—I would like to reflect on an important anniversary this weekend—the 20th anniversary of the Mabo decision in the High Court. The Mabo decision marked a turning point for reconciliation in Australia. The decision was a significant step forward in truly recognising the proud history of the Indigenous peoples of this land, the oldest continuing cultures on our planet. It is unquestionably an enduring stain on our history that since the First Fleet successive governments institutionalised an abject denial of the rights of Indigenous people to land and waters. Sunday, 3 June will mark a very important day in the history of Australia—20 years to the day since six High Court justices changed forever the rights of Indigenous peoples in this country by recognising native title.


As the First Law Officer of the Commonwealth, it is appropriate to pause briefly to also recognise the significance of the decision in the context of the judiciary's role in Australia's constitutional democracy. The decision has been widely recognised as a triumph for the common law, although criticised by others. And whilst there has been much commentary on the nature of the court's decision, the decision unquestionably provided a valuable point upon which to further develop recognition and respect for Indigenous Australians. 


But this decision was not just the work of the court. This long journey started 10 years earlier when Eddie Koiki Mabo, Sam Passi, David Passi, Celuia Mapo Salee and James Rice began a legal claim for ownership of their lands on Mer between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The battle to claim rights over their land is a captivating story. Indeed, a drama will shortly be shown—I think in fact on Sunday—on ABC television, which details this remarkable story of the Mabo claim.


Ten years after beginning work to claim their rights, the High Court ultimately held that British possession had not eliminated their title and that 'the Meriam people are entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands'. The perpetual myth called terra nullius that had haunted Indigenous Australians for over two hundred years was finally dispelled. The significance of this judgment should not be understated; its impact extended well beyond Indigenous land rights. Indeed, as former Prime Minister Keating recently stated, the Mabo decision was 'an opportunity to deal with the longest continuing problem Australia faced as a nation; the fundamental colonial grievance; the dispossession of the Indigenous people and the injustice inherent in that dispossession'. 


In response to the decision, the Keating Labor government developed, and the parliament ultimately passed, the Native Title Act 1993. The act was developed in partnership with the Indigenous community and saw leadership from influential figures such as Lowitja O'Donoghue. The act was very much a partnership, an historic partnership. As Paul Keating highlighted last year in his Lowitja O'Donoghue Oration, the in-depth negotiations to develop the Native Title Act was the first time in the history of settled Australia that 'Indigenous people sat in full concert with the government'. The Native Title Act legislatively validated and built on the Mabo decision. Key features of the act include providing a pathway for recognising native title, validating existing titles and establishing the right to negotiate. 


The decision to legislate by the Keating government was far from uncontroversial. I am sure there are many in this place can remember only too well the hate, lies and threats that dominated public debate. Some of those opposite might actually feel a little uncomfortable in recalling this today, as they remember how some of their own whipped up fear amongst the masses. We were told that native title would 'destroy our society', would 'put a brake on investment, break the economy and break up Australia' and that 'every property in Australia could be at risk'. 


Thankfully, much cooler heads prevailed. Together, the Labor government and Indigenous leaders stared down those who said native title would destroy our society. As former Prime Minister Keating stated in his second reading speech on the introduction of the Native Title Bill:


…some seem to see the High Court as having just handed Australia a problem. The fact is that the High Court has handed this nation an opportunity.


…   …   …


… this bill provides for the future—it delivers justice and certainty for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, industry, and the whole community.


We should not discount the significance of Prime Minister Keating's achievement in establishing the Native Title Act. As the Chief Justice of the High Court at the time of the Mabo decision, Sir Anthony Mason, highlighted in the recent Four Corners program on Mabo, Mr Keating: 


…supported the court's decision; he took the very important step of supporting the enactment of the federal Native Title Act. Without the federal Native Title Act you would not have had a system, a process for orderly handling of Indigenous land claims, and that was absolutely essential. 


People might recall that the bill was not passed until after one of the longest debates in recent memory in the other place—some 51 hours and 49 minutes. It would be remiss of me not to recognise the efforts of Senator Evans in this marathon debate. The then Minister for Foreign Affairs delivered a performance that has been described as a 'political tour de force in overcoming an opposition determination to destroy the legislation by filibuster'. Twenty years down the track from the Mabo decision, it is rewarding to look how far Australia has come. The Chicken Littles were proven wrong—the sky did not fall in. And, as a nation, we are better for it. Australia can and has prospered with native title and it will continue to do so. Today, native title continues to be a lived experience for Indigenous people and has led to stronger partnerships with the broader Australian community. Native title determinations cover at least 16 per cent of the country and there have been 141 determinations that native title exists in the entire determination area or in parts of the determination area. And, very significantly, the native title claims system continues to develop and has become integrated in the broader role in supporting the development of Indigenous communities—something I know my colleague, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, has been very active in promoting.


The Native Title Act recognises and protects native title and sets up processes by which claims for native title can be determined and future activity impacting on native title may be undertaken. The act has undergone a range of reforms over the years to ensure it can meet the ongoing needs of stakeholders, particularly native title groups. Native title rights and interests can make a significant contribution to ensuring sustainable intergenerational benefits for Indigenous communities, whether through a determination of native title or through a native title agreement with governments, developers, miners, or others with an interest in the land. These opportunities can only be delivered by improving the way that native title agreements are struck and how they are managed.


The government's vision for the native title system is for faster, better outcomes, with a focus on economic development for Indigenous communities and sustainable agreement-making. We need to keep working to meet these objectives so that, 20 years hence, we can see the continuing development of the system; a system where native title rights can be appropriately leveraged by native title holders to support Indigenous communities on an intergenerational basis while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate others with an interest in land and its uses.


To touch briefly on just one aspect of the government's work to promote the speedy resolution of claims, I mention that, in the recent budget, the government announced institutional reforms to the native title system. These reforms involve claims mediation moving from the National Native Title Tribunal to the Federal Court. The initiative builds on the government's 2009 reforms, which gave the Federal Court greater control of native title mediation and saw the number of consent determinations more than double, rising from 11 in 2008-2009, the last full year before the government's reforms came into effect, to 24 in 2010-11. This reform also refocuses the resources of the tribunal on its areas of strength, enabling greater focus on crucial functions relating to future land uses affecting native title.


I am very pleased to say that next week I will be travelling with Minister Macklin to Townsville to deliver keynote addresses at the 2012 National Native Title Conference, which is commemorating the important Mabo decision. We will take this opportunity to further reflect upon the accomplishments to date, the challenges ahead for native title and the Commonwealth's vision for the native title system.


Today, I am sure all members in this place will join with me to reflect on the achievements that have been made since the courageous journey by Eddie Koiki Mabo and others in seeking, and achieving, the landmark Mabo decision 20 years ago in the High Court of Australia.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Stirling to speak for 10 minutes.


Leave granted.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (09:11):  On behalf of the coalition, I would like to associate myself with the Attorney-General's remarks on the 20th anniversary of the Mabo decision. We on this side of the House recognise that this is an important date and that the decision provided a valuable point upon which to further develop recognition and respect for Indigenous Australians. There is no doubt that the story of Eddie Mabo and his fellow claimants is a compelling one, and that the ultimate decision of the High Court was a landmark case in the common law of this country. 


It is appropriate that we mark this anniversary today. In keeping with what we believe is the dignity of the occasion, I do not propose to rise to some of the Attorney-General's baiting remarks and allow this moment to become a matter of partisan point-scoring. In response to the Attorney-General's fine words, I will note that they are completely at odds with the reality of Labor's decision to break a longstanding Commonwealth commitment to fund 75 per cent of all native title compensation. This decision has been characterised by the Western Australian government as 'the lowest act of a poor government—disgraceful, completely unethical and a betrayal to every Indigenous person in Australia'.


The coalition recognises that, despite the important developments in native title that have occurred over the last 20 years—under both sides of politics—Indigenous Australians continue to face particular challenges, particularly in seeking to access education and employment, which are the basic building blocks to a happy and productive life. Governments must approach these issues in a way that builds trust, empowers and respects Indigenous leaders and focuses on building sustainable communities to ensure that we can make a lasting difference and not just make yet another government announcement.


At present, Australians are considering how best to recognise Indigenous Australians in the founding document of our Federation—the Constitution. As the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians has recognised, in order for this to succeed it must have bipartisan support. The coalition took its support for such an initiative to the last election and remains committed to this important symbolic step. 


It is the coalition's deep desire that this occasion can used to achieve a truly unifying moment in the history of our country. On behalf of the coalition, I join with the government in marking the 20th anniversary of this important day.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (09:15):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The government believes in a free and independent trade union movement. The government believes in the advocacy of employer organisations on behalf of their members. 


The government believes that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2012 will improve financial transparency and disclosure by registered organisations to their members. This bill will improve the way that investigations into breaches of registered organisations provisions are conducted by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia and it will introduce a threefold increase in civil penalties for contraventions of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009.


Registered organisations play a fundamentally important role in the operation of Australia's workplace relations system. These are organisations created and registered for the purposes of representing Australian employers and employees. They have particular recognition under Australian workplace relations law by virtue of their representative status and it is because of that registration they have particular statutory obligations in relation to their operation, conduct and disclosure.


In recent weeks and months conduct by a small number of officials in some parts of one organisation has dented public confidence in all registered organisations in this country. 


Therefore I wish to place on the record, again, that it is my view and the government's view that registered organisations in Australia—whether employer organisations or unions—are overwhelmingly democratic, representative, highly professional and member focused. 


And today, we are improving the laws which govern registered organisations covered by this act.


In addition, to this bill this government has taken the unusual action in respect of some parts of one union by applying to the Federal Court for the appointment of an administrator.


This bill would insert a new object into the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 which provides that the parliament recognises and respects the role of employer and employee organisations in facilitating the operation of the workplace relations system. The new object recognises the fundamental importance of free and independent unions and employer associations as economic and democratic institutions in our society.


The government considers that improved financial disclosure and transparency rules for registered organisations, as well as targeted training in financial management, will improve the operation and accountability of registered organisations and raise and restore public confidence in the operation of the workplace relations system. 


This bill will require the rules of registered organisations to provide for the disclosure of remuneration, including board fees, of the five highest paid officials of the organisation as well as the two highest paid in each branch, to the members of the organisation. Determining the five highest paid officials will be based upon monetary remuneration rather than non-cash benefits. However, where an official's remuneration is required to be disclosed, that disclosure will require non-cash benefits paid to the official to be identified. 


The rules of the organisation will be able to provide for how remuneration is disclosed. The legislation will enable the rules of the organisation to specify the level of detail on how remuneration is disclosed. This may be on the basis of a specific total remuneration package figure, salary bands or classifications, specifying items of non-cash benefits such as, for example, a 'vehicle'. The amendments do not require the disclosure of the reimbursement of expenses, such as airfares, or certain low-level non-cash benefits like mobile telephones.


In addition, where an official sits on a board because of their status within a registered organisation, or they were nominated to the board by the organisation of which they are an official or peak council, then board fees received from that position must be disclosed by the official to the organisation and, if the official is one of the five highest paid officials of the organisation or one of the two highest paid in a branch, by the organisation to its members. 


Under the amendments proposed by the government, registered organisations will be required to amend their rules to provide for the disclosure of transactions between the organisation and related parties, which may include the family members of officials. The proposed amendments use concepts of 'related party' from the Corporations Act 2001 and family members as commonly defined in Commonwealth law.


In addition, the rules of an organisation must require that any material personal interests of officials which relate to the affairs of the organisation will be required to be disclosed. 


Disclosure must be at least every 12 months, for example, to align with the usual reporting periods for annual reports and the filing of financial returns.


The proposed amendments will also require the rules of registered organisations to require the organisation to develop and implement policies in relation to financial expenditure. This could, for example, outline policies in relation to the use and authorisation of expenditure on credit cards, procurement matters and internal financial accountability and authorisation.


The bill provides that the minister can develop model disclosure rules. The model rules will be developed in consultation with registered organisations.


To improve financial literacy within registered organisations, the rules of organisations will require each officer whose duties relate to the financial management of the organisation or the branch as the case may be to undertake approved training relating to the officials' financial management obligations. 


The General Manager of Fair Work Australia may approve training that can be provided by an organisation, a peak council or another body or person the general manager is satisfied has appropriate skills and expertise to provide the training. This may include, for example, a peak body for a particular industry or a recognised education provider.


It is intended that the general manager will be able to approve a range of training of different formats, styles and lengths in recognition of the different significance that financial management duties have to the roles of different officials as well as the backgrounds, experience and qualifications of those officials. 


Similarly, it is intended that the general manager would be able to approve general training that covers a range of financial management duties as well as more specific training that is tailored to a particular area or areas of financial management. 


In addition to improvements in the financial management and disclosure regime, the bill proposes to increase penalties. The current maximum civil penalties are $11,000 for an organisation and $2,200 for an individual.  These have been unchanged since this legislation was introduced into the parliament by the then Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon. Tony Abbott MP in 2002. The government's bill proposes to triple the maximum civil penalties to a maximum of $33,000 for an organisation and $6,600 for an individual. This represents a significant increase in penalties to reflect the seriousness with which this government, and registered organisations, take compliance with workplace relations law. The increase in penalties will align them with the maximum civil penalties available under the Fair Work Act 2009.


The government committed in early May this year to introducing improved financial accountability rules for organisations and this bill delivers on that commitment. These amendments can be built upon if organisations want to adopt additional or best practice measures. The government has developed the content of this bill with the members of the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council (NWRCC), who are the peak representatives of this nation's employer and employee organisations.


I thank the representatives of organisations who are members of the NWRCC and who participated in these discussions—representatives from the ACTU, UnionsNSW, the AEU, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, Master Builders Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the National Farmers Federation. I thank the NWRCC for their diligence and cooperation in developing this legislation which will apply to their members and organisations. I thank the members of the NWRCC for their unanimous support for this important bill.


The bill also provides for improvements to the conduct of investigations into compliance with the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia, or their delegate.


In addition to the measures contained in this bill, it is the government's intention to implement any recommendations arising from the independent review being conducted by KPMG into the conduct of the investigations into the HSU Victoria No. 1 Branch and the HSU National Office by the delegate to the General Manager, Fair Work Australia. The government has made clear that those investigations took too long. The General Manager of Fair Work Australia has indicated publicly that there are a number of matters that could improve the operation of the investigation provisions within the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The amendments proposed in this bill are designed to address these matters.


The bill requires Fair Work Australia to conduct investigations as soon as is practicable.


If the general manager has notified an organisation's reporting unit of a contravention, then the general manager must, within 12 months, make inquiries as to whether the reporting unit is complying with the provision, guidelines or rule, the contravention of which was notified to the reporting unit.


The General Manager of Fair Work Australia will be given the express power to disclose information to third parties such as the AFP, state police forces and other government regulatory agencies where the general manager considers it necessary or appropriate to do so in the course of performing their functions or to assist in the administration or enforcement of a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory.  This power will only be able to be exercised by the general manager and not a delegate. 


The general manager will be able to delegate investigative functions beyond current SES officers to third parties with substantial and significant experience or knowledge in fields like accounting, auditing, financial reporting, conducting compliance audits or investigations. This will enable Fair Work Australia to draw upon particular expertise for investigations where this is required. The general manager will retain the current final decision-making functions currently conferred by section 336 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act.


The bill will expand those to whom notices to produce documents or to attend and give evidence can be issued. Currently such notices can only be issued to designated officers and former officers or the auditor of the reporting unit. The bill will expand this to other parties where the general manager has reason to believe that a third party has information or a document that cannot be provided by the auditor, officers or former officers of the reporting unit and that is relevant to the investigation. This line of inquiry can only be undertaken by the general manager following initial inquiries within the reporting unit. The power to issue such notices cannot be delegated.


Fair Work Australia is an agency independent of the executive. It must retain its independence, particularly in the face of partisan politicking. These amendments are proposed by the government for the sole purpose of improving the operation of Fair Work Australia's investigative function. They are supported by the government and the members of the NWRCC. They deserve to be supported by the parliament.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2012-05-31,"



Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (11:34):  I rise to speak on the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill 2012 and associated cognate bills—a suite of legislation that will be greatly welcomed in my electorate of Newcastle, where maritime activities have always been central to our economy, the activities of our port and of course to exactly the people we are. I am very proud to stand here today, the niece of two wharfies—two MUA waterside workers—who, sadly, are no longer with us. One of them, Tom Lockett, particularly is missed by my staff for the wonderful voluntary work he did for us. But fortunately we also have the benefit in my office of a young man from a very well-known MUA family in Newcastle, Matt Murray. So it is very much part of who we are.


On any given day, there are dozens of bulk carriers off the coast of Newcastle waiting to enter the port and to transport cargo around the world. What is lesser known is that, whilst Newcastle is no stranger to Australian shipping or to shipbuilding, our national fleet has shrunk over the past decade from 55 to 21 ships, with only four of these operating on international routes. The vast majority of carriers entering and leaving the port in my electorate are foreign ships with foreign workers.


I looked back today at a 2004 newsletter which I sent around my electorate and I will repeat the sentence that caught my eye: 'In a bid to obtain the cheapest priced shipping services by assisting foreign ships to gain continuous and single voyage permits, the Howard government put Australian ports and borders at risk.' Well, that is exactly what did happen. Finally, this legislation before the House attempts to redress this situation.


Whilst Australia does not currently lack a shipbuilding industry altogether, it very well could in the near future if our situation does not improve. There has been a 40 per cent decline in Australia's national maritime fleet over the past decade. As well, our fleet is ageing. The average age of Australia's fleet is around 20 years compared to the global average of 12 years. Our country moves 99.9 per cent of our trade via cargo ships, with just half of one per cent of our maritime trade carried out on Australian flagged ships. The time is long overdue to act to ensure that the Australian shipping industry does not further flounder and become a distant memory.


This package of bills is a major step towards revitalising our shipping industry. It is part of the Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy package—the same package we took to the 2010 election. The federal Labor government is now delivering on that commitment. We are a government that keeps its promises. We are a government that believes in our nation's future.


As part of this package of legislation, the tax incentives bill that our government will introduce a zero tax rate for Australian shipping companies. We are introducing provisions for: accelerated depreciation of vessels through a cap of 10 years, down from 20 years, to the effective life of the ship; roll-over tax relief on the sale of shipping vessels; employer refundable tax offsets in relation to seafarers; and exemptions from royalty withholding tax for payments made for the lease of shipping vessels. We are also introducing a generous income tax exemption for core shipping activities, allowing flexibility and increased competitiveness on the global stage.


As the Australian Financial Review noted on 8 March 2012, the opposition were initially behind our recommended tax changes in 2008, but in 2012 have turned their backs on this important measure. It is a shame that the opposition do not support these tax incentives; it really does seem that there is not a tax cut that they would not say no to.


The Australian Shipowners Association has welcomed these bills, saying that the legislation will level the playing field. The association, which represents BlueScope Steel, Caltex Australia, Rio Tinto Marine, BP Shipping, Newcastle Port Corporation, Toll Marine Logistics and ANL Container Lines, has estimated that these tax changes could trigger up to $4 billion worth of investment as local shipowners look to add to the 21 Australian operated ships. This is investment into Australia, investment into local industry and investment into local job creation. With almost 800,000 jobs created by this federal Labor government, we know that to continue this employment growth we must keep introducing the necessary reforms to sustain our competitiveness, sustain our local industry and retain the capacity to build diversity in our economy.


Other measures in these bills include the shipping registration amendment component, which will establish a new Australian International Shipping Register and Australian General Shipping Register. The bill sets out the operation, administration and associated employment conditions. This new national body will oversee our participation in international trade, facilitate growth within the local industry and promote the viability and enhancement of our maritime skills base. Importantly, the bill will provide employment terms and conditions that are consistent with the ILO's Maritime Labour Convention. The bill will set employment conditions in accordance with the Maritime Labour Convention and other relevant ILO treaties to which Australia is a signatory. I welcome that measure.


In April this year, the vessel MCP Kopenhagen was floating off the coast of Newcastle, temporarily storing 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate for chemical company Orica to service the region's mines. By all accounts, the conditions for the Filipino seafarers aboard were abysmal. I have boarded flag of convenience ships in the port of Newcastle in the past, with Dean Summers from the ITF, and on several occasions I expressed my concerns regarding the management of dangerous cargoes as well as conditions on ships. I know that when our local MUA judges a ship or the welfare of its crew to be substandard then action does have to be taken. I am pleased that in this case the shipowners came through and signed an agreement with the International Transport Workers Federation, ensuring the workers' pay rise and that their wellbeing would be maintained on board. 


But we must ask: why does it always have to come to a point where an inspector has to intervene and board a ship? Quality standards and conditions should be made a priority around the clock, but what we continue to see is a quest to keep prices down by neglecting responsibilities to crews, to safe practice and to the maintenance of an acceptable condition of ships. The stronger shipping bills will certainly go a long way towards addressing these concerns, concerns that the MUA has had the integrity to keep raising with governments for many years.


I cannot mention 'ships of shame' without acknowledging the former member for Shortland and minister for transport under the Hawke government, the Hon. Peter Morris, who, I am pleased to report to the House, was awarded an Order of Australia Medal this year. Peter chaired the International Commission on Shipping and headed the Ships of shame inquiry in the 1990s, an inquiry that found significant problems occurring within the maritime industry—from unseaworthy ships to ships being operated by seafarers with false qualifications. It was a very well deserved award. Peter is also the President of the Newcastle Maritime Centre, which this year commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Newcastle submarine attack, which saw a Japanese assault on merchant ships within the port, as well as the anniversary of the sinking of the Iron Chieftain on 3 June 1942, killing 12 crew members. The Iron Chieftain was one of the big iron ships of BHP, sailing from Newcastle to Whyalla. BHP's second ship, the Iron Crown, was also attacked the following day, with only five of the ship's 43 crew surviving. Those were the days when Australian merchant mariners prevailed, and they worked hard for our nation during times of peace and times of conflict. Sadly, you can count the iron fleet on one hand today.


I would also like to mention to the House that the Merchant Mariners Memorial Service will be held in Newcastle's foreshore park on 2 June, this coming weekend, to commemorate the most invaluable contributions made by our merchant mariners and the waterside workers who supported them.


Other measures in the bill include the three-tier licensing system which will increase efficiency within our national shipping system. A general licence for general register vessels will provide unrestricted access to engage in coastal trading within our waters. A temporary licence will provide access to coastal trading, limited in time and voyages, authorised by this licence. Emergency licences will also provide access to Australian waters for coastal trading purposes, with such licences granted within three business days for emergency situations such as natural disasters. We also recognise that change cannot happen overnight, and this legislation puts in place transitional arrangements through a transitional general licence, which will authorise foreign flagged ships operating under existing licences to continue their operations for up to five years. It is fair legislation and it certainly carries through on our belief that if you are working in Australian waters, you should have Australian regulation on your side.


The MUA's Paddy Crumlin says these changes will be a vital economic boost, stating in the Financial Review on 10 September 2011: 'It will be massive.' Citing London as an example of a successful shipping industry, he said: 'It's got 500 ships on its register. It's got no iron ore, no coal, no LNG.' And that is very true. He is absolutely correct. Why shouldn't Australia take advantage of its resources, of its capacity, of it strengths, to support our local industry and our primary resource industries with local ships, local jobs and fair working conditions? This is a Labor package that has been developed with no half measures. It will bring good news for our local shipping, keep our local industry afloat and deliver prosperity in Australia's maritime sector for many years to come. In conclusion, I note the AMWU's video 'Aussie Shipbuilders' Message to Clive Palmer'. I recommend that everyone has a look at it. It is certainly doing the rounds online and in my city. It features Newcastle's Forgacs, who, of course, build ships. We still do build ships, Mr Palmer, and now we have a real change to make sure we can build the shipping industry of the future. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (11:45):  This is one of the very few times in my 17 or 18 years in this place that I have been able to get up and actually praise a minister and an initiative. For the first time in 18 years there is actually a minister moving to protect Australian industry. When we use the word 'protection' in this place, we are looked at as some sort of foreign insect that has invaded Australia. Once upon a time, we were very proud to be able to say that we believed in seeing that our industries were protected.


I will give you an idea of what other countries do in respect of such issues as this. I represent what may be the biggest beef-producing area in Australia. Six thousand tonnes of beef—which may be 12,000 cattle—is all that is allowed into the European Union. So do not let the EU preach to us about free markets. They are the most protected market on earth. Do not let China preach to us about free trade. Not one single kilogram of Australian beef is allowed into China, which has the biggest population on earth. Do not let the Brazilians talk to us about free markets. The Brazilians simply took all the debt of their sugar industry—$6 billion—and wrote it off. The government took over their debt. The farmers owe no debt, the millers owe no debt and the people of Brazil have a debt of $6 billion. They did not stop there. They then said the industry had to be profitable. How do you make it profitable? Ethanol. They said: 'We've got dirty cities. Listen to us because this will clean up our cities.' Of course, ethanol gave them $440 a tonne for their sugar whereas the world price was $270 a tonne. As for the United States, in shipping, if your ship's hull was not been built in the United States you do not get into the United States.


That is free trade. Every other country proudly waves a flag that says: 'Don't come here, Buster Brown! We protect our people.' This government and the last government did not protect their people. But today we are actually seeing a minister—I do not know how he has got away with it, but God bless him; and I hope he replicates it—bravely saying, 'Yes, I believe that we should not send our champion into the arena with just a sword.' But every other minister who has sat here since I have been a member of parliament has said that we should send our champion into the arena with just a sword—in the Keating ministry, in the Howard ministry and, I regret to say, in the current ministry. Every single one of them has said: 'No, you don't go into that arena with a helmet and a shield. You go down there with just a sword.' Our champion says: 'Hold on a minute, mate! The other bloke has got a shield and a helmet.' They say, 'If you fight unprotected, without the shield and the helmet, it will make you tough.' Our champion says: 'Make me tough, mate? It's going to make me dead!'


That is what it is going to do. But no-one here can see that. They constantly come in here and preach to us about the marvels of free trade and removing all protection. Well, let us have a look at the marvellous outcomes. Cattle numbers are down by 30 per cent. Wool, our greatest industry—in 1990 it was the biggest export earner for this country—is down by 60 per cent. It will never come back. It was destroyed completely by Mr Keating's free-market policy. The sugar policy is down by 60 per cent, thanks to the free-market policies of the Howard government. They were entirely responsible for the crash in the sugar industry. And there has been the reluctance of successive governments to go into ethanol—which, I might add, would deliver cheaper petrol to us as well. But let me focus on agriculture. Cattle is down 25 per cent—I said 30 per cent before, but it is actually 25 per cent. Sugar is down by 30 per cent. The dairy herd is down by 30 per cent. The sheep herd is down by 60 per cent. Within three years this country will be a net importer of food, thanks to these stupid free-market policies.


We can say that Mr Albanese is right and all the other governments and ministers in recent Australia history were wrong. But let us compare Mr Albanese's performance with that of the rest of the world. I mean, no country on earth does anything like free trading—absolutely nothing remotely like it. To show the contrast: with the ideological approaches of the LNP-ALP junta, which runs Australia and every state in Australia, within three years this nation will be a net importer of food. As for our industrial and manufacturing base, it has been completely destroyed. We do not produce an electric motor in this country. We do not produce a motor car tyre in this country. Yes, I am well aware of the doctrine of comparative advantage. I did go to university and I did do a doctorate on comparative advantage. But not a single country on earth subscribes to this policy. Mr Costello and Mr Keating used to get up in this place and skite about how the high dollar was a judgment by the world's investors of how marvellous they were. In fact, it was a judgment on their incredible towering stupidity at having interest rates 400 per cent higher than the rest of the world. That is what it was a reflection upon; that is what it really disclosed. In the meantime, whilst Mr Keating and Mr Costello were skiting about how wonderful the high dollar is and how it demonstrates what a wonderful government you are, China and America were almost firing bombs at each other, both accusing each other—quite rightly, I might add—of holding down their currencies.


So here were the two greatest economies on earth both cheating on their currencies, but here was Australia saying, 'Oh, geez, it's a reflection upon how clever we are.' I disagree diametrically. It was a brilliant speech by the Prime Minister last night, I pay her great tribute, but I disagree diametrically with her saying to us that we have a wonderful economy because of the high dollar. We have a high dollar because we have interest rates 500 per cent higher than the European Union and 1,000 per cent higher than Japan and the United States. That is the only reason we have a high dollar.


Every industry, the Prime Minister said, has the Dutch disease. I will tell you one country that is riddled with it: it is our country. The Dutch had a high-flying currency because of North Sea oil, but they did nothing about it except skite about how they had a high currency because they had a wonderful economy. Of course, the North Sea oil is now running out and there is no industry left in Holland at all. Do I know of another country that has no industry left at all? Oh, yes! Australia. We have a coalmining quarry and an iron ore quarry—and there is nothing else left. When Mr Keating started this rubbish, 72 per cent of the cars in Australia were proudly Australian made. This year, it looks as if 12 per cent will be Australian made. A wonderful success story! Congratulations, Nick Minchin! Congratulations, Peter Costello! Congratulations, Paul Keating!


Today we see a minister with the courage to stand against the tide. In 1996 we had 55 Australian ships with a crew of maybe 30 or 40 on each of them; because you have to have standby crews, it might have been 100. So there might have been 5,000 jobs there. Today there are only 22 ships, so there are only 2,000 jobs and 3,000 Australian jobs have vanished. So today I pay the minister the highest of tributes. He has shown a lot of courage. He is swimming against the flow. That is how you get yourself in the history books—and I just wrote one; it is very successful—not by doing what the mob says is the right thing to do and leading your country down over the precipice. It is when you stand up. When Winston Churchill said, 'This Hitler bloke is bad,' everyone said, 'You dirty, filthy warmonger; you dangerous person.' Two years later, on their bended knees, they asked him to take over running the country. You might be in with a bit of a show there, Albo! When you stand against the tide, that is when you really deserve the accolades. If you are just drifting with the mob you do not deserve them.


There are 400 ships servicing 55 Australian ports internally, from Australian port to Australian port, but there are 400 ships servicing our ports and taking goods overseas or bringing them in. Less than five per cent of those ships are Australian owned. In America, by law they have to be 100 per cent owned. Either America is stupid and Australia is very clever or else we are very stupid and America is very clever. I tell you what, they get American ships carrying their goods and this country is losing $5,000 million a year because all those ships are foreign owned. That $5,000 million a year will only be recouped if ministers have the courage to do the right thing.


In my book on Australian history there is a statement in it that Ben Chifley is the Prime Minister without peer. There is no Prime Minister that has even got remotely close to Ben Chifley. He is the Prime Minister who had tuberculosis abolished in Australia, had a telephone put in every house in Australia, had 26,000 houses built after the war, gave us the Snowy Mountains scheme and gave us the wheat stabilisation scheme—the complete antithesis of free markets. He is in every history book because he introduced the wheat stabilisation scheme to Australia. That is what made him famous. That is why we say, 'What a great man' Chifley had delivered to Australia the Holden motor car. There was no free market then. If we had had free markets then, we would never have had Holden motor cars or an Australian motor vehicle industry.


I spit upon free markets. We are here to protect our people. We are here to take our people forward, and to do that we have to have a comprehensive, wide-ranging economy. I have a very big picture of the great John McEwen on a wall in my parliamentary office. I quote him in my book. He said:


The third reason for tariffs, but you are too young to appreciate this—


and he had a faraway look in his eyes—


is that I will never see my country placed in another war without the ability to build a main battletank.


Today, we cannot build a tyre; we cannot build an electric motor, let alone building a main battletank. We have no technology because the stupidity of the Dutch disease has contaminated virtually every single person in state—with the obvious exception of the minister for transport, God bless him—and has left the people of Australia without the heart and fight to go on.


Every single person who has tried to open a manufacturing business has just said: 'What's the use? I am up against the Chinese, who work for $5,000 a year. I am up against the Filipinos, who work for $4 a day.' Our farmers have said: 'What's the use? I can't compete. Even if I could, Woolworths and Coles are not going to pay me anything anyway.' So the free market has been the greatest disaster. Just read my book, Mr Deputy Speaker—it is only $39—and you will see the dimensions of the disaster. You are in a country now without any manufacturing, a country nearly without any agriculture—it has not reached quite that far yet but it is getting pretty close to it—and a country that cannot produce an electric motor or a tyre. That is the country that we live in. Except for the iron ore quarrying and the coal quarrying—not mining; quarrying—there is nothing left in our country. It has been completely destroyed and the iron ore will run out and the coal will run out— (Time expired)

Mr MARLES
 (Corio—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (12:00):  I would like to add my voice to the member for Kennedy's in commending the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure for his efforts and, like the member for Kennedy, I too say, 'God bless Albo'. I am here to support this package of reforms, in particular the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill 2012, which establishes an Australian international register—which will be a genuine and quality national register that upholds an appropriate standard of ships, robust regulations, decent labour standards and good safety.


The AISR provides for the establishment of a high-quality register under the regulation of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is internationally regarded as a leading-edge regulator in international shipping. The bill establishes a strong regime for the employment of seafarers, recognising that to be internationally competitive with other quality shipping registers, such as Singapore, Denmark and the UK, the Fair Work Act and related Australian workers compensation standards cannot apply. Instead, the bill provides a framework for the establishment of labour relation standards that are comparable with better quality international registers, like those in Europe and the UK, based around the ILO Maritime Labour Convention and International Transport Workers Federation standards.


In that context, the bill allows for mixed crews on ships on the AISR, requiring a minimum of two Australian resident crew members, ideally the master and the chief engineer. The remainder of the crew can be non-nationals. Minister Albanese in his second reading speech acknowledged the opportunity for those non-nationals to be drawn from the near region—from seafarer nations of the Pacific and from Timor Leste. I fully support that objective and will work with the Australian stakeholders and regional nations to ensure that our regional neighbours are provided with the opportunity to participate in Australian shipping reform.


Australia understands labour mobility is critical to the economic sustainability of the Pacific region. In Kiribati, remittances—mainly from merchant seamen—represented around seven per cent of GDP in 2009. In Tuvalu last year, remittances— again mostly from locally-trained merchant seamen—were worth around six per cent of GDP. Our commitment to increasing opportunities for labour mobility was demonstrated last year when this government expanded the Pacific Seasonal Workers Scheme to nine countries across the Pacific and East Timor. This aspect of Australian shipping reform creates a new employment stream for the graduates of Pacific maritime institutes, a number of which are already delivering outcomes to IMO standards. It also creates opportunities to build the standing and standards of those regional maritime training institutes so they can also supply internationally recognised seafarers to other nations which encourage investment in shipping.


Of course, all of this will provide a new source of remittances for the nations of the Pacific. We know, as I have stated, that in some Pacific nations remittances from seafarers are a substantial part of the national economy.. Such an outcome fits well with the existing development assistance objectives around education and training and the creation of genuine employment streams in quality and sustainable industries. For Australia, there will be an opportunity for our high-quality seafarer training institutes, such as the Australian Maritime College or the Great Barrier Reef International Maritime College, to deliver top-up training to meet the requirements of the new IMO International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping, known as the 2010 Manila amendments, which create globally an international integrated rating.


The creation of a genuine regional seafarer labour market will help smooth out the peaks and troughs of the domestic seafarer labour market, driven by the demands of the offshore oil and gas industry. I am committed and I know AusAID is committed to fostering these opportunities. This will create economic benefit for Australia and for regional nations who come on board. This is one aspect of the shipping reform bills where Australia can show regional, and indeed global, leadership in a partnership with domestic stakeholders and regional nations.


The regional employment and training opportunities demonstrate how Labor has structured this package as an integrated package of bills that delivers positive benefits for Australia, for seafaring families and for the nations in the region. I commend the minister for his foresight in developing these bills. I will be providing my support to see that workers from Pacific and neighbouring countries have the opportunity to be part of high-quality seafaring crews under the AISR. I commend the bills, and in particular the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill 2012, to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-05-31,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (12:05):  I thank all members of parliament for their contribution to the debate on these five bills that comprise the government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy legislative reforms. These bills represent the most significant overhaul of the Australian coastal trading arrangements since these arrangements were put in place in the 1920s. These reforms address the 40 per cent decline in the Australian fleet over the last decade by encouraging investment in Australian shipping and levelling the playing field for Australian flagged ships so they can better compete.


The Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill sets out the new licensing arrangements to enable vessels to engage in coastal trading in Australian waters. Australian vessels paying Australian wages and providing jobs to Australians will be given preference to carry Australian goods on the Australian coast. However, as I have said previously, the new licensing arrangements do not close the coast to foreign ships.


The government recognises the legitimate role foreign-registered vessels have in our domestic shipping industry, and they will continue to have access to the coast, subject to Australian vessels being given the opportunity to compete for the job. The bill provides for an open and transparent decision-making process when deciding who gets that job. The bill also provides for sufficient flexibility to enable variations to existing licences. We have introduced government amendments to address concerns that have been raised by the major oil companies. Expedited variations may be made to temporary licences to enable fuel carriers to respond quickly to special energy related situations.


The Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill will provide for a smooth transition from the current coasting trade arrangements to the new regulatory framework to ensure the supply chain will continue to operate while the new regulatory regime is being bedded down. As I have said previously, we have only four Australian vessels participating solely in international trade. It is time that we take action to increase Australian participation in the international trades.


One way of achieving this is the creation of an Australian International Shipping Register through the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill. Over the last 20 years, international registers have been embraced by many advanced maritime nations to address loss of tonnage to open registers. Most of these countries have now established international registers, which provide financial and taxation incentives to increase the competitiveness of their fleets. The Australian International Shipping Register is not, however, a flag of convenience. Companies wishing to register on the Australian International Shipping Register will need to have strong links to Australia. This will ensure that our maritime safety regulator, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, has the regulatory reach to ensure compliance with our safety, environmental and occupational health and safety standards.


Importantly, we have the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill and the Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Bill, which provide for tax and other fiscal incentives to ship operators. The major concessions provided through the tax bills are a zero tax rate for ship operators and a seafarers' tax exemption, measures that reduce the cost of Australian shipping operations. The tax bills also enable shipowners to depreciate the cost of their ships over 10 years instead of the average 20 years, along with roll-over relief on sale of a ship. Finally, an exemption from royalty withholding tax reduces the cost for Australian ship operators to secure foreign vessels. We have also introduced a minor government amendment to this arrangement to ensure the exemption from royalty withholding tax will not have the unintended consequence of creating an income tax liability for the foreign lessor in lieu of the royalty withholding tax.


When I introduced these bills I stated that the industry had to do its bit to reduce the costs of Australian shipping. I can advise the House that the shipping industry and unions have reached an agreement on an industry compact—something that the shadow minister said would not happen. It has happened and here it is: the bluewater Shipping Reform Labour Relations Compact, signed by Paddy Crumlin, the National Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia; Fred Ross on behalf of the AMOU Executive Council; and Theresa Lloyd, the Executive Director of the bluewater employers' Australian Shipowners Association.


Here we have a historic agreement. I congratulate both industry and unions on getting together in the interests of our nation, putting aside sectional interest for the national interest. That is why this legislation should be supported by everyone in this House. It is extraordinary that you have a position whereby industry and unions are as one in urging support for this legislation;  yet those opposite cannot bring themselves to support this legislation, even though it is consistent with the policy adopted at the National Party conference just a short time ago.


What the amendment before the House does is ask for another review lasting six months. We have had a House of Representatives committee inquiry, of which the member for Hinkler was the deputy chair. It produced unanimous recommendations. We then had a discussion paper released. We had a shipping advisory task force, comprising groups including the National Farmers Federation, people who use the ships, as well as the Australian Shipping Association and the unions. We then had another process where you had three groups: one looking at taxation, chaired by Treasury; one looking at regulatory reform; and one looking at workforce development. In this, groups across the sector were involved in the development of this legislation. We then had exposure drafts of the legislation released for people to comment on. We then had another House of Representatives inquiry into these bills. We have produced amendments as a result of some of the submissions to that inquiry. And what do they say over there? They say, 'Let's have another inquiry.'


We had 55 ships when this mob came to office in 1996, and we are now down to less than half of that. You reach a tipping point whereby there is no industry at all. We either do this today and get it done or the industry is done—there will be no Australian flag on our coast. The consequences of that not just for our economy but also for our national security and for our environment are dire indeed. We as an island continent with the fourth-largest shipping task in the world simply cannot walk away from our responsibility to take action. That is what I am urging here today—supported by industry and supported by unions.


I congratulate the delivery of key productivity reform in this agreement. Productivity and efficiency gains, a process to review minimum manning levels and the introduction of riding gangs in coastal trades are all included. In addition, the compact contains many other desirable clauses, such as a dispute resolution clause with a continuity of work commitment; a commitment to review the Seacare scheme, with the objective of protection and indemnity insurance clubs re-entering the market; and setting the crew to berth ratio at two to one. These reforms will benefit Australian shipping companies and establish a solid platform for investment in Australian shipping. More importantly, the revitalisation of the Australian shipping industry will build the maritime cluster and benefit the Australian economy as a whole. These legislative reforms are a product of a long and thorough process of review and industry consultations beginning back in 2007.


We simply cannot afford to continue to do nothing about these issues. In fact, a number of significant industry groups—Teekay Shipping and other shipping operators—have written to members of the opposition asking them to support this vital legislation. So I encourage the opposition to listen to Australian industry and think about the future prosperity of the nation. These reforms are long overdue. The country cannot afford any further inaction on this important issue. We are an island continent. We must be a shipping nation, not just a shipper nation. We have had the courage to take action. I encourage members of this House to do the same.


There are people up there in the public gallery—and I want to particularly single out Teresa Lloyd and Paddy Crumlin—who have had the courage to not get their ambit claims up in this process. They have not got everything that they want. They have had the courage to step away and to make decisions to make sure this reform can happen and that you have a movement forward on these issues. I commend the bills to the House and ask the House to reject the amendment moved by Leader of the National Party to set up yet another inquiry.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (12:26):  by leave—I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum and move government amendments (1) to (5) as circulated together:


(1) Clause 5, page 3 (after line 9), after the definition of constitutional corporation, insert:



excluded vessel has the meaning given by subsections 10(4) and (5).


(2) Clause 10, page 10 (line 6), omit ""of a kind set out in subsection (4)"", substitute ""an excluded vessel"".


(3) Clause 10, page 10 (line 19), omit ""The excluded kinds of vessels are as follows"", substitute ""The following are excluded vessels"".


(4) Clause 10, page 10 (line 32), at the end of subclause (4), add:


; (k) vessels of a kind specified under paragraph (5)(a).


(5) Clause 10, page 10 (after line 32), at the end of the clause, add:


(5) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, specify:


   (a) kinds of vessels that are to be excluded vessels; and


   (b) kinds of vessels that are not to be excluded vessels.


Despite subsection (4), a vessel of a kind specified under paragraph (b) is not an excluded vessel.


I move that an amendment be made to the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill 2012 to enable the minister to make a determination under subclause 10(5) that further clarifies which vessel should be eligible for the tax concessions. Clause 10 of the bill sets out which vessels are eligible for the tax concessions. Vessels will need to be over 500 gross tonnes and registered under either the Australian General Shipping Register or the Australian International Shipping Register. Additionally, vessels may not be eligible if they fall within the list of excluded vessels in subclause 10(4). The list aims to confine the concession to the so-called 'blue water fleet'. Due to the broad nature of the definitions contained in this list, the amendment to the bill allows for the minister to make a determination under subclause 10(5) that further clarifies which vessels should be eligible for the tax concessions.


I commend the bill, as amended, to the House.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (12:28):  I want to add to what the minister has said. The argument is that the cost of intercoastal shipping will increase because of this bill, but just the opposite is true. The ships that are plying now are half empty. If this bill goes through, they will be full and the cost per unit will come down, not up. In any event, ever since Australia has been Australia, it has been a spurious argument that has been applied, and is being applied, to argue against protecting Australian industry.

Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (11:34):  I rise to speak on the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill 2012 and associated cognate bills—a suite of legislation that will be greatly welcomed in my electorate of Newcastle, where maritime activities have always been central to our economy, the activities of our port and of course to exactly the people we are. I am very proud to stand here today, the niece of two wharfies—two MUA waterside workers—who, sadly, are no longer with us. One of them, Tom Lockett, particularly is missed by my staff for the wonderful voluntary work he did for us. But fortunately we also have the benefit in my office of a young man from a very well-known MUA family in Newcastle, Matt Murray. So it is very much part of who we are.


On any given day, there are dozens of bulk carriers off the coast of Newcastle waiting to enter the port and to transport cargo around the world. What is lesser known is that, whilst Newcastle is no stranger to Australian shipping or to shipbuilding, our national fleet has shrunk over the past decade from 55 to 21 ships, with only four of these operating on international routes. The vast majority of carriers entering and leaving the port in my electorate are foreign ships with foreign workers.


I looked back today at a 2004 newsletter which I sent around my electorate and I will repeat the sentence that caught my eye: 'In a bid to obtain the cheapest priced shipping services by assisting foreign ships to gain continuous and single voyage permits, the Howard government put Australian ports and borders at risk.' Well, that is exactly what did happen. Finally, this legislation before the House attempts to redress this situation.


Whilst Australia does not currently lack a shipbuilding industry altogether, it very well could in the near future if our situation does not improve. There has been a 40 per cent decline in Australia's national maritime fleet over the past decade. As well, our fleet is ageing. The average age of Australia's fleet is around 20 years compared to the global average of 12 years. Our country moves 99.9 per cent of our trade via cargo ships, with just half of one per cent of our maritime trade carried out on Australian flagged ships. The time is long overdue to act to ensure that the Australian shipping industry does not further flounder and become a distant memory.


This package of bills is a major step towards revitalising our shipping industry. It is part of the Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy package—the same package we took to the 2010 election. The federal Labor government is now delivering on that commitment. We are a government that keeps its promises. We are a government that believes in our nation's future.


As part of this package of legislation, the tax incentives bill that our government will introduce a zero tax rate for Australian shipping companies. We are introducing provisions for: accelerated depreciation of vessels through a cap of 10 years, down from 20 years, to the effective life of the ship; roll-over tax relief on the sale of shipping vessels; employer refundable tax offsets in relation to seafarers; and exemptions from royalty withholding tax for payments made for the lease of shipping vessels. We are also introducing a generous income tax exemption for core shipping activities, allowing flexibility and increased competitiveness on the global stage.


As the Australian Financial Review noted on 8 March 2012, the opposition were initially behind our recommended tax changes in 2008, but in 2012 have turned their backs on this important measure. It is a shame that the opposition do not support these tax incentives; it really does seem that there is not a tax cut that they would not say no to.


The Australian Shipowners Association has welcomed these bills, saying that the legislation will level the playing field. The association, which represents BlueScope Steel, Caltex Australia, Rio Tinto Marine, BP Shipping, Newcastle Port Corporation, Toll Marine Logistics and ANL Container Lines, has estimated that these tax changes could trigger up to $4 billion worth of investment as local shipowners look to add to the 21 Australian operated ships. This is investment into Australia, investment into local industry and investment into local job creation. With almost 800,000 jobs created by this federal Labor government, we know that to continue this employment growth we must keep introducing the necessary reforms to sustain our competitiveness, sustain our local industry and retain the capacity to build diversity in our economy.


Other measures in these bills include the shipping registration amendment component, which will establish a new Australian International Shipping Register and Australian General Shipping Register. The bill sets out the operation, administration and associated employment conditions. This new national body will oversee our participation in international trade, facilitate growth within the local industry and promote the viability and enhancement of our maritime skills base. Importantly, the bill will provide employment terms and conditions that are consistent with the ILO's Maritime Labour Convention. The bill will set employment conditions in accordance with the Maritime Labour Convention and other relevant ILO treaties to which Australia is a signatory. I welcome that measure.


In April this year, the vessel MCP Kopenhagen was floating off the coast of Newcastle, temporarily storing 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate for chemical company Orica to service the region's mines. By all accounts, the conditions for the Filipino seafarers aboard were abysmal. I have boarded flag of convenience ships in the port of Newcastle in the past, with Dean Summers from the ITF, and on several occasions I expressed my concerns regarding the management of dangerous cargoes as well as conditions on ships. I know that when our local MUA judges a ship or the welfare of its crew to be substandard then action does have to be taken. I am pleased that in this case the shipowners came through and signed an agreement with the International Transport Workers Federation, ensuring the workers' pay rise and that their wellbeing would be maintained on board. 


But we must ask: why does it always have to come to a point where an inspector has to intervene and board a ship? Quality standards and conditions should be made a priority around the clock, but what we continue to see is a quest to keep prices down by neglecting responsibilities to crews, to safe practice and to the maintenance of an acceptable condition of ships. The stronger shipping bills will certainly go a long way towards addressing these concerns, concerns that the MUA has had the integrity to keep raising with governments for many years.


I cannot mention 'ships of shame' without acknowledging the former member for Shortland and minister for transport under the Hawke government, the Hon. Peter Morris, who, I am pleased to report to the House, was awarded an Order of Australia Medal this year. Peter chaired the International Commission on Shipping and headed the Ships of shame inquiry in the 1990s, an inquiry that found significant problems occurring within the maritime industry—from unseaworthy ships to ships being operated by seafarers with false qualifications. It was a very well deserved award. Peter is also the President of the Newcastle Maritime Centre, which this year commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Newcastle submarine attack, which saw a Japanese assault on merchant ships within the port, as well as the anniversary of the sinking of the Iron Chieftain on 3 June 1942, killing 12 crew members. The Iron Chieftain was one of the big iron ships of BHP, sailing from Newcastle to Whyalla. BHP's second ship, the Iron Crown, was also attacked the following day, with only five of the ship's 43 crew surviving. Those were the days when Australian merchant mariners prevailed, and they worked hard for our nation during times of peace and times of conflict. Sadly, you can count the iron fleet on one hand today.


I would also like to mention to the House that the Merchant Mariners Memorial Service will be held in Newcastle's foreshore park on 2 June, this coming weekend, to commemorate the most invaluable contributions made by our merchant mariners and the waterside workers who supported them.


Other measures in the bill include the three-tier licensing system which will increase efficiency within our national shipping system. A general licence for general register vessels will provide unrestricted access to engage in coastal trading within our waters. A temporary licence will provide access to coastal trading, limited in time and voyages, authorised by this licence. Emergency licences will also provide access to Australian waters for coastal trading purposes, with such licences granted within three business days for emergency situations such as natural disasters. We also recognise that change cannot happen overnight, and this legislation puts in place transitional arrangements through a transitional general licence, which will authorise foreign flagged ships operating under existing licences to continue their operations for up to five years. It is fair legislation and it certainly carries through on our belief that if you are working in Australian waters, you should have Australian regulation on your side.


The MUA's Paddy Crumlin says these changes will be a vital economic boost, stating in the Financial Review on 10 September 2011: 'It will be massive.' Citing London as an example of a successful shipping industry, he said: 'It's got 500 ships on its register. It's got no iron ore, no coal, no LNG.' And that is very true. He is absolutely correct. Why shouldn't Australia take advantage of its resources, of its capacity, of it strengths, to support our local industry and our primary resource industries with local ships, local jobs and fair working conditions? This is a Labor package that has been developed with no half measures. It will bring good news for our local shipping, keep our local industry afloat and deliver prosperity in Australia's maritime sector for many years to come. In conclusion, I note the AMWU's video 'Aussie Shipbuilders' Message to Clive Palmer'. I recommend that everyone has a look at it. It is certainly doing the rounds online and in my city. It features Newcastle's Forgacs, who, of course, build ships. We still do build ships, Mr Palmer, and now we have a real change to make sure we can build the shipping industry of the future. I commend the bills to the House.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-05-31,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (11:45):  This is one of the very few times in my 17 or 18 years in this place that I have been able to get up and actually praise a minister and an initiative. For the first time in 18 years there is actually a minister moving to protect Australian industry. When we use the word 'protection' in this place, we are looked at as some sort of foreign insect that has invaded Australia. Once upon a time, we were very proud to be able to say that we believed in seeing that our industries were protected.


I will give you an idea of what other countries do in respect of such issues as this. I represent what may be the biggest beef-producing area in Australia. Six thousand tonnes of beef—which may be 12,000 cattle—is all that is allowed into the European Union. So do not let the EU preach to us about free markets. They are the most protected market on earth. Do not let China preach to us about free trade. Not one single kilogram of Australian beef is allowed into China, which has the biggest population on earth. Do not let the Brazilians talk to us about free markets. The Brazilians simply took all the debt of their sugar industry—$6 billion—and wrote it off. The government took over their debt. The farmers owe no debt, the millers owe no debt and the people of Brazil have a debt of $6 billion. They did not stop there. They then said the industry had to be profitable. How do you make it profitable? Ethanol. They said: 'We've got dirty cities. Listen to us because this will clean up our cities.' Of course, ethanol gave them $440 a tonne for their sugar whereas the world price was $270 a tonne. As for the United States, in shipping, if your ship's hull was not been built in the United States you do not get into the United States.


That is free trade. Every other country proudly waves a flag that says: 'Don't come here, Buster Brown! We protect our people.' This government and the last government did not protect their people. But today we are actually seeing a minister—I do not know how he has got away with it, but God bless him; and I hope he replicates it—bravely saying, 'Yes, I believe that we should not send our champion into the arena with just a sword.' But every other minister who has sat here since I have been a member of parliament has said that we should send our champion into the arena with just a sword—in the Keating ministry, in the Howard ministry and, I regret to say, in the current ministry. Every single one of them has said: 'No, you don't go into that arena with a helmet and a shield. You go down there with just a sword.' Our champion says: 'Hold on a minute, mate! The other bloke has got a shield and a helmet.' They say, 'If you fight unprotected, without the shield and the helmet, it will make you tough.' Our champion says: 'Make me tough, mate? It's going to make me dead!'


That is what it is going to do. But no-one here can see that. They constantly come in here and preach to us about the marvels of free trade and removing all protection. Well, let us have a look at the marvellous outcomes. Cattle numbers are down by 30 per cent. Wool, our greatest industry—in 1990 it was the biggest export earner for this country—is down by 60 per cent. It will never come back. It was destroyed completely by Mr Keating's free-market policy. The sugar policy is down by 60 per cent, thanks to the free-market policies of the Howard government. They were entirely responsible for the crash in the sugar industry. And there has been the reluctance of successive governments to go into ethanol—which, I might add, would deliver cheaper petrol to us as well. But let me focus on agriculture. Cattle is down 25 per cent—I said 30 per cent before, but it is actually 25 per cent. Sugar is down by 30 per cent. The dairy herd is down by 30 per cent. The sheep herd is down by 60 per cent. Within three years this country will be a net importer of food, thanks to these stupid free-market policies.


We can say that Mr Albanese is right and all the other governments and ministers in recent Australia history were wrong. But let us compare Mr Albanese's performance with that of the rest of the world. I mean, no country on earth does anything like free trading—absolutely nothing remotely like it. To show the contrast: with the ideological approaches of the LNP-ALP junta, which runs Australia and every state in Australia, within three years this nation will be a net importer of food. As for our industrial and manufacturing base, it has been completely destroyed. We do not produce an electric motor in this country. We do not produce a motor car tyre in this country. Yes, I am well aware of the doctrine of comparative advantage. I did go to university and I did do a doctorate on comparative advantage. But not a single country on earth subscribes to this policy. Mr Costello and Mr Keating used to get up in this place and skite about how the high dollar was a judgment by the world's investors of how marvellous they were. In fact, it was a judgment on their incredible towering stupidity at having interest rates 400 per cent higher than the rest of the world. That is what it was a reflection upon; that is what it really disclosed. In the meantime, whilst Mr Keating and Mr Costello were skiting about how wonderful the high dollar is and how it demonstrates what a wonderful government you are, China and America were almost firing bombs at each other, both accusing each other—quite rightly, I might add—of holding down their currencies.


So here were the two greatest economies on earth both cheating on their currencies, but here was Australia saying, 'Oh, geez, it's a reflection upon how clever we are.' I disagree diametrically. It was a brilliant speech by the Prime Minister last night, I pay her great tribute, but I disagree diametrically with her saying to us that we have a wonderful economy because of the high dollar. We have a high dollar because we have interest rates 500 per cent higher than the European Union and 1,000 per cent higher than Japan and the United States. That is the only reason we have a high dollar.


Every industry, the Prime Minister said, has the Dutch disease. I will tell you one country that is riddled with it: it is our country. The Dutch had a high-flying currency because of North Sea oil, but they did nothing about it except skite about how they had a high currency because they had a wonderful economy. Of course, the North Sea oil is now running out and there is no industry left in Holland at all. Do I know of another country that has no industry left at all? Oh, yes! Australia. We have a coalmining quarry and an iron ore quarry—and there is nothing else left. When Mr Keating started this rubbish, 72 per cent of the cars in Australia were proudly Australian made. This year, it looks as if 12 per cent will be Australian made. A wonderful success story! Congratulations, Nick Minchin! Congratulations, Peter Costello! Congratulations, Paul Keating!


Today we see a minister with the courage to stand against the tide. In 1996 we had 55 Australian ships with a crew of maybe 30 or 40 on each of them; because you have to have standby crews, it might have been 100. So there might have been 5,000 jobs there. Today there are only 22 ships, so there are only 2,000 jobs and 3,000 Australian jobs have vanished. So today I pay the minister the highest of tributes. He has shown a lot of courage. He is swimming against the flow. That is how you get yourself in the history books—and I just wrote one; it is very successful—not by doing what the mob says is the right thing to do and leading your country down over the precipice. It is when you stand up. When Winston Churchill said, 'This Hitler bloke is bad,' everyone said, 'You dirty, filthy warmonger; you dangerous person.' Two years later, on their bended knees, they asked him to take over running the country. You might be in with a bit of a show there, Albo! When you stand against the tide, that is when you really deserve the accolades. If you are just drifting with the mob you do not deserve them.


There are 400 ships servicing 55 Australian ports internally, from Australian port to Australian port, but there are 400 ships servicing our ports and taking goods overseas or bringing them in. Less than five per cent of those ships are Australian owned. In America, by law they have to be 100 per cent owned. Either America is stupid and Australia is very clever or else we are very stupid and America is very clever. I tell you what, they get American ships carrying their goods and this country is losing $5,000 million a year because all those ships are foreign owned. That $5,000 million a year will only be recouped if ministers have the courage to do the right thing.


In my book on Australian history there is a statement in it that Ben Chifley is the Prime Minister without peer. There is no Prime Minister that has even got remotely close to Ben Chifley. He is the Prime Minister who had tuberculosis abolished in Australia, had a telephone put in every house in Australia, had 26,000 houses built after the war, gave us the Snowy Mountains scheme and gave us the wheat stabilisation scheme—the complete antithesis of free markets. He is in every history book because he introduced the wheat stabilisation scheme to Australia. That is what made him famous. That is why we say, 'What a great man' Chifley had delivered to Australia the Holden motor car. There was no free market then. If we had had free markets then, we would never have had Holden motor cars or an Australian motor vehicle industry.


I spit upon free markets. We are here to protect our people. We are here to take our people forward, and to do that we have to have a comprehensive, wide-ranging economy. I have a very big picture of the great John McEwen on a wall in my parliamentary office. I quote him in my book. He said:


The third reason for tariffs, but you are too young to appreciate this—


and he had a faraway look in his eyes—


is that I will never see my country placed in another war without the ability to build a main battletank.


Today, we cannot build a tyre; we cannot build an electric motor, let alone building a main battletank. We have no technology because the stupidity of the Dutch disease has contaminated virtually every single person in state—with the obvious exception of the minister for transport, God bless him—and has left the people of Australia without the heart and fight to go on.


Every single person who has tried to open a manufacturing business has just said: 'What's the use? I am up against the Chinese, who work for $5,000 a year. I am up against the Filipinos, who work for $4 a day.' Our farmers have said: 'What's the use? I can't compete. Even if I could, Woolworths and Coles are not going to pay me anything anyway.' So the free market has been the greatest disaster. Just read my book, Mr Deputy Speaker—it is only $39—and you will see the dimensions of the disaster. You are in a country now without any manufacturing, a country nearly without any agriculture—it has not reached quite that far yet but it is getting pretty close to it—and a country that cannot produce an electric motor or a tyre. That is the country that we live in. Except for the iron ore quarrying and the coal quarrying—not mining; quarrying—there is nothing left in our country. It has been completely destroyed and the iron ore will run out and the coal will run out— (Time expired)

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2012-05-31,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (12:00):  I would like to add my voice to the member for Kennedy's in commending the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure for his efforts and, like the member for Kennedy, I too say, 'God bless Albo'. I am here to support this package of reforms, in particular the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill 2012, which establishes an Australian international register—which will be a genuine and quality national register that upholds an appropriate standard of ships, robust regulations, decent labour standards and good safety.


The AISR provides for the establishment of a high-quality register under the regulation of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is internationally regarded as a leading-edge regulator in international shipping. The bill establishes a strong regime for the employment of seafarers, recognising that to be internationally competitive with other quality shipping registers, such as Singapore, Denmark and the UK, the Fair Work Act and related Australian workers compensation standards cannot apply. Instead, the bill provides a framework for the establishment of labour relation standards that are comparable with better quality international registers, like those in Europe and the UK, based around the ILO Maritime Labour Convention and International Transport Workers Federation standards.


In that context, the bill allows for mixed crews on ships on the AISR, requiring a minimum of two Australian resident crew members, ideally the master and the chief engineer. The remainder of the crew can be non-nationals. Minister Albanese in his second reading speech acknowledged the opportunity for those non-nationals to be drawn from the near region—from seafarer nations of the Pacific and from Timor Leste. I fully support that objective and will work with the Australian stakeholders and regional nations to ensure that our regional neighbours are provided with the opportunity to participate in Australian shipping reform.


Australia understands labour mobility is critical to the economic sustainability of the Pacific region. In Kiribati, remittances—mainly from merchant seamen—represented around seven per cent of GDP in 2009. In Tuvalu last year, remittances— again mostly from locally-trained merchant seamen—were worth around six per cent of GDP. Our commitment to increasing opportunities for labour mobility was demonstrated last year when this government expanded the Pacific Seasonal Workers Scheme to nine countries across the Pacific and East Timor. This aspect of Australian shipping reform creates a new employment stream for the graduates of Pacific maritime institutes, a number of which are already delivering outcomes to IMO standards. It also creates opportunities to build the standing and standards of those regional maritime training institutes so they can also supply internationally recognised seafarers to other nations which encourage investment in shipping.


Of course, all of this will provide a new source of remittances for the nations of the Pacific. We know, as I have stated, that in some Pacific nations remittances from seafarers are a substantial part of the national economy.. Such an outcome fits well with the existing development assistance objectives around education and training and the creation of genuine employment streams in quality and sustainable industries. For Australia, there will be an opportunity for our high-quality seafarer training institutes, such as the Australian Maritime College or the Great Barrier Reef International Maritime College, to deliver top-up training to meet the requirements of the new IMO International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping, known as the 2010 Manila amendments, which create globally an international integrated rating.


The creation of a genuine regional seafarer labour market will help smooth out the peaks and troughs of the domestic seafarer labour market, driven by the demands of the offshore oil and gas industry. I am committed and I know AusAID is committed to fostering these opportunities. This will create economic benefit for Australia and for regional nations who come on board. This is one aspect of the shipping reform bills where Australia can show regional, and indeed global, leadership in a partnership with domestic stakeholders and regional nations.


The regional employment and training opportunities demonstrate how Labor has structured this package as an integrated package of bills that delivers positive benefits for Australia, for seafaring families and for the nations in the region. I commend the minister for his foresight in developing these bills. I will be providing my support to see that workers from Pacific and neighbouring countries have the opportunity to be part of high-quality seafaring crews under the AISR. I commend the bills, and in particular the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill 2012, to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-05-31,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (12:05):  I thank all members of parliament for their contribution to the debate on these five bills that comprise the government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy legislative reforms. These bills represent the most significant overhaul of the Australian coastal trading arrangements since these arrangements were put in place in the 1920s. These reforms address the 40 per cent decline in the Australian fleet over the last decade by encouraging investment in Australian shipping and levelling the playing field for Australian flagged ships so they can better compete.


The Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill sets out the new licensing arrangements to enable vessels to engage in coastal trading in Australian waters. Australian vessels paying Australian wages and providing jobs to Australians will be given preference to carry Australian goods on the Australian coast. However, as I have said previously, the new licensing arrangements do not close the coast to foreign ships.


The government recognises the legitimate role foreign-registered vessels have in our domestic shipping industry, and they will continue to have access to the coast, subject to Australian vessels being given the opportunity to compete for the job. The bill provides for an open and transparent decision-making process when deciding who gets that job. The bill also provides for sufficient flexibility to enable variations to existing licences. We have introduced government amendments to address concerns that have been raised by the major oil companies. Expedited variations may be made to temporary licences to enable fuel carriers to respond quickly to special energy related situations.


The Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill will provide for a smooth transition from the current coasting trade arrangements to the new regulatory framework to ensure the supply chain will continue to operate while the new regulatory regime is being bedded down. As I have said previously, we have only four Australian vessels participating solely in international trade. It is time that we take action to increase Australian participation in the international trades.


One way of achieving this is the creation of an Australian International Shipping Register through the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill. Over the last 20 years, international registers have been embraced by many advanced maritime nations to address loss of tonnage to open registers. Most of these countries have now established international registers, which provide financial and taxation incentives to increase the competitiveness of their fleets. The Australian International Shipping Register is not, however, a flag of convenience. Companies wishing to register on the Australian International Shipping Register will need to have strong links to Australia. This will ensure that our maritime safety regulator, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, has the regulatory reach to ensure compliance with our safety, environmental and occupational health and safety standards.


Importantly, we have the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill and the Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Bill, which provide for tax and other fiscal incentives to ship operators. The major concessions provided through the tax bills are a zero tax rate for ship operators and a seafarers' tax exemption, measures that reduce the cost of Australian shipping operations. The tax bills also enable shipowners to depreciate the cost of their ships over 10 years instead of the average 20 years, along with roll-over relief on sale of a ship. Finally, an exemption from royalty withholding tax reduces the cost for Australian ship operators to secure foreign vessels. We have also introduced a minor government amendment to this arrangement to ensure the exemption from royalty withholding tax will not have the unintended consequence of creating an income tax liability for the foreign lessor in lieu of the royalty withholding tax.


When I introduced these bills I stated that the industry had to do its bit to reduce the costs of Australian shipping. I can advise the House that the shipping industry and unions have reached an agreement on an industry compact—something that the shadow minister said would not happen. It has happened and here it is: the bluewater Shipping Reform Labour Relations Compact, signed by Paddy Crumlin, the National Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia; Fred Ross on behalf of the AMOU Executive Council; and Theresa Lloyd, the Executive Director of the bluewater employers' Australian Shipowners Association.


Here we have a historic agreement. I congratulate both industry and unions on getting together in the interests of our nation, putting aside sectional interest for the national interest. That is why this legislation should be supported by everyone in this House. It is extraordinary that you have a position whereby industry and unions are as one in urging support for this legislation;  yet those opposite cannot bring themselves to support this legislation, even though it is consistent with the policy adopted at the National Party conference just a short time ago.


What the amendment before the House does is ask for another review lasting six months. We have had a House of Representatives committee inquiry, of which the member for Hinkler was the deputy chair. It produced unanimous recommendations. We then had a discussion paper released. We had a shipping advisory task force, comprising groups including the National Farmers Federation, people who use the ships, as well as the Australian Shipping Association and the unions. We then had another process where you had three groups: one looking at taxation, chaired by Treasury; one looking at regulatory reform; and one looking at workforce development. In this, groups across the sector were involved in the development of this legislation. We then had exposure drafts of the legislation released for people to comment on. We then had another House of Representatives inquiry into these bills. We have produced amendments as a result of some of the submissions to that inquiry. And what do they say over there? They say, 'Let's have another inquiry.'


We had 55 ships when this mob came to office in 1996, and we are now down to less than half of that. You reach a tipping point whereby there is no industry at all. We either do this today and get it done or the industry is done—there will be no Australian flag on our coast. The consequences of that not just for our economy but also for our national security and for our environment are dire indeed. We as an island continent with the fourth-largest shipping task in the world simply cannot walk away from our responsibility to take action. That is what I am urging here today—supported by industry and supported by unions.


I congratulate the delivery of key productivity reform in this agreement. Productivity and efficiency gains, a process to review minimum manning levels and the introduction of riding gangs in coastal trades are all included. In addition, the compact contains many other desirable clauses, such as a dispute resolution clause with a continuity of work commitment; a commitment to review the Seacare scheme, with the objective of protection and indemnity insurance clubs re-entering the market; and setting the crew to berth ratio at two to one. These reforms will benefit Australian shipping companies and establish a solid platform for investment in Australian shipping. More importantly, the revitalisation of the Australian shipping industry will build the maritime cluster and benefit the Australian economy as a whole. These legislative reforms are a product of a long and thorough process of review and industry consultations beginning back in 2007.


We simply cannot afford to continue to do nothing about these issues. In fact, a number of significant industry groups—Teekay Shipping and other shipping operators—have written to members of the opposition asking them to support this vital legislation. So I encourage the opposition to listen to Australian industry and think about the future prosperity of the nation. These reforms are long overdue. The country cannot afford any further inaction on this important issue. We are an island continent. We must be a shipping nation, not just a shipper nation. We have had the courage to take action. I encourage members of this House to do the same.


There are people up there in the public gallery—and I want to particularly single out Teresa Lloyd and Paddy Crumlin—who have had the courage to not get their ambit claims up in this process. They have not got everything that they want. They have had the courage to step away and to make decisions to make sure this reform can happen and that you have a movement forward on these issues. I commend the bills to the House and ask the House to reject the amendment moved by Leader of the National Party to set up yet another inquiry.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:03):  This coming Sunday, 3 June, marks the 20th anniversary of the Mabo judgment, a sublime moment in the life of our nation. This was a judgment of the High Court at its finest, led by the brilliant Justice Mason, having a case brought by one of the most remarkable plaintiffs ever to grace a court room, the late Eddie Mabo, someone whose story is very well known, and becoming increasingly well known as a result of the recent film Mabo. The case brought in his name was no dry legal or constitutional argument but went to the core of our identity and integrity as a nation. Mabo fundamentally readjusted the terms upon which black Australians and white Australians share this land, reaching across two centuries to erase our nation's founding lie, the lie of terra nullius. Instead, Mabo acknowledged and affirmed in law what Indigenous Australians always knew: this land was not empty and vacant, but occupied by a proud and ancient people who maintained the oldest culture on earth.


My distinguished predecessor Paul Keating recognised Mabo for what it was: not a burden or a problem, but an opportunity. It was an opportunity to take the principles of the High Court judgment and inscribe them in Australian law forever. It was an act of courage and conviction for which Mr Keating will be lastingly honoured. It was also a reminder that the big things, the great things, in Australian politics never come easily and are always purchased at a high price but a price worth paying.


Of all the millions of words written and said about Mabo, the best were those spoken by Pat Dodson when he remarked that the judgment should be received in a spirit of joy and celebration. The fear and division abroad in 1992 meant that our nation did not have the chance to receive Mabo in such a spirit at that time. Perhaps now, 20 years later, when we see that the dire predictions have not come to pass and native title is a routine and accepted part of our legal machinery, we do have the perspective that enables joy and celebration. We should celebrate with proud and generous hearts the fact that Mabo righted a grave injustice and set our nation ever more firmly on the path of reconciliation, a path upon which we will continue with the work of healing—and more healing has to be done. I commend this anniversary to the House.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:07):  I rise to join the Prime Minister in acknowledging the 20th anniversary of the Mabo decision, which really created native title in Australia. I also acknowledge that it was not universally welcomed at the time, but it is now seen by everyone, including former critics, as a very important milestone in the recognition of the first Australians. The challenge for us now is to ensure that land is not just a spiritual asset for Aboriginal people but an economic asset too. There is a long road still to travel towards ensuring that home ownership is available to Indigenous people on native title land. I have to say that as we travel that road it is good that we in this place will be assisted by the first Indigenous member of the House of Representatives, and it is good that we do have an Indigenous member of this House here with us today as we mark this important 20th anniversary.

 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:08):  I am very pleased to be able to add to the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Attorney-General in her statement this morning to commemorate the achievements of Eddie Koiki Mabo and the achievements of a people who fought for and won recognition of their rights over the lands that they had cared for for thousands and thousands of years.


Twenty years ago, former Prime Minister Paul Keating said:


It begins, I think, with an act of recognition.


Recognition has allowed us to see beyond the falsehood of terra nullius and to the future. Hard work remains in our line of sight. We must continue to labour together to turn this legal recognition into a reality—to build the houses and schools, and to see local economies grow and businesses prosper.


Today we remember the achievement of a man and his people. Today we recognise that his achievement changed us. We recognise the truth that changed Australia.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (14:10):  I also rise, and I concur with the comments of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The Mabo decision was a welcome decision across this nation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander communities who saw the merit and the value of the changing relationship between Australians and that the dreams and aspirations that arise from the Mabo decision could become the reality that we have often aspired to. The Mabo decision has changed the relationship between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians who make this country the great nation it is, so that there is strength in the partnership. I hope that we build on those opportunities that have prevailed from that—the achievements that have been gained—but plan into a future in which home ownership, education, employment opportunities and our ability to walk together as one nation of people is realised and develops the nation in a way that makes us a great country within this world.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:12):  I am grateful to be given these few moments to note that before the parliament next meets Her Majesty the Queen will have celebrated her diamond jubilee. I think it is worth recalling today the words of Prime Minister Ben Chifley when noting in this parliament many, many years ago the marriage between Princess Elizabeth and Phillip Mountbatten. Prime Minister Chifley said:


The members of this Parliament would wish to be associated directly with the general rejoicing throughout the Empire on the occasion …


He went on to say:


… all Australians regard with deep affection this charming girl, whose natural dignity, intelligence and nobility of mind so well equip her to become the ruler of the British Commonwealth of Nations.


That charming girl has become a gracious and dutiful monarch who has served this country and many others for 60 eventful years. We are indeed lucky as Australians to have had her as our Queen, and the whole world is lucky to have had such an exemplar of duty and service. May I conclude with the words of the royal hymn, which I hope will be widely sung in this jubilee year: May God save our Queen, and may she long reign over us.

That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Selection Committee’s determinations in respect of private Members’ business for the Federation Chamber on Monday, 18 June 2012, from 6.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. as reported to the House today, being adopted and shown on the Notice Paper for Monday, 18 June 2012.




Ms HALL:
  I second the motion.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  I thank the House. I will quickly say what a wonderful thing it is that the Selection Committee is, these days, working so cooperatively; agreement on the motion I have just moved reflects that, and I want to thank the opposition for that. I think the parliament works best when the Selection Committee is working freely and well, and that has certainly been the case of late. This amendment was necessary because of a mistake on the part of the government—a minor mistake, but still one which had consequences—and the opposition very generously agreed to fix that problem.


On that note, I should offer my best wishes to the Chief Opposition Whip, who is today celebrating a birthday, and, of course, to the member for Reid, who is also celebrating a birthday today—they were born not only on the same day but indeed in the same year. I am sure all members will join with me in extending very warm wishes to both members.

",HoR,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economic Competitiveness</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,19,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2012-05-31,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:24):  On a day when we get the news that Australia's international economic competitiveness has declined 10 places from fifth to 15th place in the world, we have a government in denial about the further damage to our competitiveness that will be inflicted on the workers and the businesses of this country by the world's biggest carbon tax. This is a government in denial. So much is this government in denial that we had the sad and dispiriting spectacle of the Minister for Climate Change coming into this parliament at question time and singing a song. He mocked the plight of the workers of this country, who are threatened by a carbon tax, by coming into this parliament and singing a song. I wonder whether he sang that song to the workers at Kurri Kurri who are losing their jobs, in part, because of the impact of carbon tax. I wonder whether members opposite would have laughed as uproariously under those circumstances as they did in this parliament today.


This is a shameful government. It is a shameful parliament to be in denial about the impact of this carbon tax on the jobs of the people that it claims to represent. What we saw in parliament today was a shameful and embarrassing attempt by this government, including by the Prime Minister, to deny the obvious. We even had the Prime Minister today trying to claim, in the face of all the evidence to the contrary including a report by the respected Productivity Commission, that somewhere out there, somewhere in the world there was a place with a higher carbon tax than the one she is about to impose on the families, workers and businesses of Australia. She finally came up with British Columbia. I have news for the Prime Minister: British Columbia is not a country. I do not know what planet she is on but it is not a country; it is a province. I remind the Prime Minister of what the finance minister of British Columbia said earlier this year in his budget speech:


This is a good time to pause and examine how the carbon tax is affecting our economic competitiveness. To that end, we will carry out a comprehensive review, examining the tax's impact—both positive and negative—on every economic sector.


I am afraid that this Prime Minister is in total denial about the impact of the carbon tax on Australia's competitiveness and in total denial about the impact of the carbon tax on families cost of living and jobs.


But that is not all we have seen this week from this government when it comes to an assault on the economic competitiveness of our country. Last Friday there was an announcement that the Roy Hill Project should go ahead. This was unambiguous good news for our country: $10 billion worth of new investment, 50 years of production that would be exported to the benefit of our country and of the wider world, and 8,000 new jobs. But it takes a special genius unique to this government and this Prime Minister to turn a good news story like 8,000 new jobs into political disaster, but that is what this Prime Minister did. She turned 8,000 new jobs into another story about sovereign risk issues which now dog investment in this country because of this Prime Minister and this government. Yet again, it was another illustration of how this Prime Minister completely lacks judgment and another demonstration of how this is a government that is deeply ambivalent about business in general and particularly ambivalent about the role of the mining sector in this country.


What we saw in the wake of that announcement was an ugly brawl between the minister for immigration and the minister for resources on the one hand and the born-again socialists inside the caucus. And it was no surprise whose side the Prime Minister turned out to be on. What we saw last week was, first of all, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in an interesting development, tip off the unions about the enterprise migration agreement that they all knew was coming. The unions spooked the Prime Minister, the caucus rolled the cabinet, and now the issue of sovereign risk is yet again front and centre for the people who we need to invest in this country. No-one quite knows what this new caucus oversight committee is going to do. But one thing we can be certain of is that enterprise migration agreements will henceforth be harder to negotiate, they will be more onerous and they will make it much harder for investment to take place and jobs to be created in this country.


This week we have seen again and again a Prime Minister shifty and evasive with this parliament, incapable of telling the complete truth. Again and again this week we have seen a desperate government trying to claw its way back into political relevance with an advertising blitz the like of which this country has never seen. They spent $36 million on a carbon tax which they will not even name—$36 million advertising that which dare not speak its name: the carbon tax. They spent $20 million advertising the National Broadband Network and they spent $12 million advertising the education cash splash. They are even sending letters to millions of Australians: 'Extra cash for you. You have just received some extra money from the Australian government. This advance is just the start. There is more to come. From the middle of next year you will get extra cash. Don't worry, you don't need to make a new claim. This assistance will come automatically just like the cash you have just had. PS: This is just part of the extra help the government is giving.' And they never mentioned the carbon tax! The last communication most people got like that was from the Nigerian lottery scammers!


It is all borrowed money. How dare this government come into this parliament and boast about Australia's economic performance when that sort of thing is taking place, all with borrowed money. This is a government which is in full retreat from the market capitalism which has been the basis of Australia's economic prosperity. If we look at the World Competitiveness Yearbook, which has just been released, Australia's overall economic competitiveness, in just two years, has fallen from fifth to 15th. But it gets worse. Our economic performance, in just two years, has fallen from seventh to 23rd. And this is a government that wants to boast about how brilliant its economic management is! We are being beaten by Qatar. But it is okay. We are still one place ahead of the United Arab Emirates!


Is it any wonder that further investments vital to the economic health of our country and the prosperity of Australians, like the Olympic Dam investment, are now at risk. This is a government which has damaged our productivity by, amongst other things, abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It has jeopardised our fiscal strength by blowing the hard-won surplus that Peter Costello and John Howard achieved. And now it has unleashed a class war, but it cannot even get that right. This mob are so hopeless they cannot even organise a class war properly. They cannot decide whether they are against 'bad Gina Rinehart', who opposes the mining tax, or in favour of 'good Gina Rinehart', who is creating 1,000 jobs for the long-term benefit of our country. This government just never understands, it just does not get it. You cannot have wealth distribution unless you have wealth creation first. That is what this government simply does not understand.


We had the enterprise migration agreements, which everyone opposite supported until the Prime Minister was spooked by the union movement. We have got a consistent preference for government over market, for government enterprise over private enterprise, from members opposite. There is the 'green bank'—$10 billion of borrowed money that is going to go out there and pick losers, pick businesses that could not make money. We have got the National Broadband Network, $50 billion worth of spending to dig up the roads to 93 per cent of the houses in this country—whether or not people need it, want it or can afford to pay three times the price for their broadband services—even though the private sector can give us much better broadband much more quickly and much more affordably than this government telecommunications monopoly ever will.


Bizarrely, and perhaps the worst decision of all, in just the last few months they have chosen a government owned and operated freight intermodal hub at Moorebank over a private sector proposal that was vastly cheaper, vastly quicker to build and vastly more affordable. They always choose government, they always choose nationalisation, over the private businesses of this country. That is the problem with the born-again socialists of this country.


There is the mining tax, which, especially if increased, is going to kill the goose that has laid the golden egg for this country. And then of course there is the carbon tax—that wrecking ball that is about to swing right through the Australian economy from 1 July because this Prime Minister broke her solemn commitment: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' There was the Prime Minister in question time today, shrilly demanding that I stand up and guarantee that I might do this and guarantee that I might do that. Well, I tell you what, at least my guarantees count. At least my guarantees can be trusted, unlike those of this Prime Minister, who never again can make a solemn pledge to the Australian people because of her grievous deception, the deception that will haunt her to her political grave—that 'there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'.


It is the world's biggest carbon tax at the worst possible time. Already, a month before the tax begins, there are jobs gone in the steel industry and jobs gone in the aluminium industry. Prices are up and routes have gone in the airline industry. Rates are up in the local government sector. You just have to look at the government's own documents—its own carbon tax modelling. It says that there will be a 21 per cent decrease in steel and iron production in this country, a 61 per cent decrease in aluminium production in this country and, absent carbon capture and storage, coal generated power in this country will fall from 70 per cent to 10 per cent. That is why the carbon tax is the death of the coal industry. The whole point of a carbon tax is to make using coal and using gas more expensive—too expensive, in fact—for us to use as opposed to the alternative.


This is a country that is suffering because of an incompetent government that just cannot be trusted with the economic management of our great country. Every day this government does more damage to families' cost of living. It does more damage to job security. But there is a better way. This is a great country let down by a bad government. There is nothing wrong with Australia that a change of government would not improve.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (15:39):  It is great to be able to contribute to this matter of public importance. Talk about the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition, coming forward and talking about consistency when it comes to economic policy. When it comes to consistency on economic policy, the only thing he has consistently been is confused. He has been confused on just about every front when it comes to economic policy.



Opposition members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The Assistant Treasurer will resume his seat for a moment. If there are members wanting to leave the chamber, would they do so quietly and quickly and not conduct secondary little conversations, standing out of their places.




Mr BRADBURY:
  Members might want to reflect upon the last time that they saw the Leader of the Opposition walk into this place and talk about the good news that exists about this economy, about one of the strongest economies in the developed world. As a member of this government, I am very proud of the record that we have. I am very proud, as a member of this country, as an Australian citizen, that we can stand tall and proud in having one of the strongest economies in the developed world.


Let us have a look at the strength of the economy, because you will not hear it from those opposite. They do not want to talk about it. Their approach is to talk the economy down. At every opportunity they want to talk it down because, to them, more important than economic success is political success, and they have equated political success with talking the Australian economy down. That is why at every opportunity they come into this place and they talk the economy down. Let us have a look at the fundamentals of this economy. Let us have a look at what every major institution has said about the Australian economy, whether it be the IMF, the OECD. They all say the same thing, and that is that we are standout performer on the world stage, that this is a strong economy. Not only is it a strong economy, but we as a government are determined to spread the benefits of that strength. That is the difference between us and them.


The Leader of the Opposition came in and he started talking about class warfare. He said, 'The problem is that the government want to conduct a class war; they are just not very good at it.' The truth of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition wants to conduct a class war. In his budget reply speech he came forward and said that $150,000 is not a huge household income. Well, nobody is proposing to take an axe to any of the benefits or entitlements that people above that have. Nobody is proposing to do that. But the Leader of the Opposition is proposing to rip money away from people on incomes of less than $150,000. This is the class warfare that the Leader of the Opposition wants to wage—on anyone on low and middle incomes. And in fact we all know that, at the end of the day, he will sing to the tune that the piper plays. The piper, we all know, is Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart—Clive Palmer because of his considerable contributions to the Liberal National Party. We know about those considerable contributions, and the donations that he makes are so important that they could not do without them and they have to put up with his crazy comments every now and again.


Let us look at the strength of the Australian economy. There is low unemployment, at 4.9 per cent.



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member for Kooyong would not know an unemployed person if he tripped over them; that is his problem. He might have met one once. Well, I tell you what, we stand for those hardworking individuals out there that deserve the right to employment. That is why we fought hard to deliver support for the economy during the global financial crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Australian workers are only in a job or only stayed in a job because we took some decisions to invest in and support those jobs. That is what we did. Those opposite voted against it. The Leader of the Opposition actually did not vote against it because he did not come into the chamber. Just to remind members, this was not one of those occasions where he came in and then tried to scurry out of the chamber; this was one of those occasions where he just fell asleep. The biggest global event since the Great Depression, and the man who wants to come and sit on this side of the chamber, who wants to get his hands on the Treasury benches—he fell asleep through it. He slept through the whole thing. He slept through the global financial crisis and certainly was not here to stand up for the people across this country that needed our support. 


We stood up and we acted. It is not only about low unemployment. Have a look at contained inflation—it is well and truly within the band that the Reserve Bank looks at. We know that is so important to families and businesses all around this country. We do not want to put pressure on interest rates. They put lots of pressure on interest rates. Remember they were the party that were always going to keep interest rates at record lows. What about the 20 warnings that they got from the Reserve Bank to cut their expenditure, to address infrastructure bottlenecks, to address capacity constraints? They never did any of those things. They did not listen to the 20 warnings they got from the Reserve Bank, and interest rates went up and up and up—10 consecutive increases in interest rates. 


Working families around this country and small businesses around this country will know that interest rates are lower today than when we came to office. A family that has a mortgage of $300,000 is paying about 3½ thousand dollars a year less. They come in and they talk about the carbon price impact. Let's wait and see. If you can find me a family that ends up getting slugged by that amount, then that will be really interesting to see. We have low unemployment, contained inflation, net government debt amongst the lowest in the world—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  Not growing, as the member for Kooyong protests, peaking this year amongst the lowest of all of our competitor economies—9.6 per cent net debt—and we are returning that figure lower and lower as time goes by. In addition to that, we have a record pipeline of investment coming into the resources sector. Members could be forgiven for thinking that most of that money was flowing in from the pockets of Liberal members, because they have all decided to invest in the resources sector. We have seen how confident they are in the success of the resources sector. Don't listen to what they say, but when they stick their hand in their pocket—the member for Kooyong knows; he is laughing. He is laughing because he is watching his stock prices go up, he is watching the strength of the resources sector and he is going out and investing more.


There is considerable investment in the resources sector that extends beyond the pockets of the Liberal Party members. Half a trillion dollars worth of investment is coming into the resources sector. So you have to ask a question. They said the mining tax was going to kill the resources sector. They say the carbon price it is going to kill the resources sector. If all of these things are going to kill the resources sector, firstly, why would they be investing in it? But, secondly, why would half a trillion dollars worth of global capital be flowing into this sector? It is because people have confidence in the strength of the resources sector and they know that the mining tax was always what we said it was about, and that is just making sure that we get a reasonable return for the Australian people on the resources that we all own. Those opposite think that they are the preserve of the rich and the privileged, that because these people are investing the capital to extract it they should take all of the profit. They only get the opportunity to do that because the Australian people give them permission to extract the resources. In giving that permission, we think it is only fair that we secure a fair return for the Australian people. That is what we are doing.


If those people ever get the opportunity to come into this place as a government at some point in the future and they want to repeal the mining tax, that will be one of the most shameful public policy decisions this country has ever seen. To hand back a tax cut to some of the wealthiest entities in the world at a time when our economy is doing so well, but those particular sectors are doing particularly well, would be an absolute disgrace—and they know it. When they go around and talk to people in their communities, they hear the same message. There are plenty of people out there that are not experiencing the benefits of the mining boom. We want to make sure they get their fair share. That is why we are increasing family payments. That is why we have delivered a schoolkids bonus. 




Mr Frydenberg interjecting—





Mr BRADBURY:
  The member for Kooyong walks right into it. He says, 'And cutting company tax.' He would be the first member for Kooyong in that seat's history to come into this place and oppose a tax cut for business. In fact, he should be disendorsed. How could any respectable member for Kooyong come into this place and oppose a business tax cut? You are a disgrace to your predecessors. Menzies would roll in his grave. Even the more dissenting members for Kooyong, those who on occasion took a more aberrant view, would have supported a tax cut for business. You are one out, and you did it because of the relentless and destructive negativity of the Leader of the Opposition. It does not matter what we propose, he will say no. This government could propose the canonisation of Mother Theresa and he would oppose it, because at the end of the day he says no to everything—except for a big fat tax cut to some of the wealthiest miners in this country. 


On the question of consistency of economic policy message, we have heard from the others—they do not even know if they would deliver a surplus if they were in government. You listen to the member for North Sydney, you listen to the Leader of the Opposition, then you go and listen to the member for Goldstein or Senator Abetz, who said, 'We're not in the business of making any outlandish promises.' We are not making outlandish promises. We are delivering a surplus, and we are going to deliver increasing surpluses over the forward estimates. That is what we are going to do. The member for Kooyong points to the carbon price. If you are interested, we are delivering an emissions trading scheme with a three-year fixed price. They went to an election saying they wanted an emissions trading scheme. The member for North Sydney has come into this place and has said, 'Pricing carbon is inevitable.' Okay, so it is inevitable. So when are you going to do it? 'Not just now.' So when is the member for North Sydney proposing that we price carbon? When does he think is the best time to do that. John Howard, whose mantle they seek to try to cling to, already got there. He got over the line on this one. He decided that a carbon price, an emissions trading scheme, is what this country needed. He said very proudly at the time that if we want to maintain our competitiveness as an economy in the future, these are the hard decisions that governments have to take. I do not know anyone out there that seriously thinks that in 50 years time this country will be able to rely on fossil fuels in the way it does today or has in the past. If you believe that, then you realise that the process of beginning the transformation towards less dependence on fossil fuels and greater reliance upon a clean energy future are the hard decisions that governments have to take. We are taking them. We are taking them in difficult circumstances through a minority government. The member for Cook might be lucky enough to come back into this place at some point in the future and actually have to make a concession—to confess that he got it wrong. In fact, he got it right when he went to the election in 2007 promising an emissions trading scheme. He got it right then. But he got it wrong this time. They have got it wrong. 


This government is taking some hard decisions that will make the structural changes that our economy will need for the future. That is what we have done. They all know it. Governments in the past have taken those hard decisions, quite often with some political cost, but in the end we all enjoy the bounty of that today. That is why we have one of the strongest economies in the world. It will keep going from strength to strength. It will keep growing.


The Leader of the Opposition comes into this place and says, 'We are all about wealth creation, not wealth redistribution.' I tell you what: no government in the advanced world, no developed economy, has been more about wealth creation since the global financial crisis than us. That is why our economy is seven per cent larger today than it was before the global financial crisis. No developed economy in the world has grown in that period to the extent that we have. The only reason we even get to have a debate in this country today about wealth redistribution is that we have created the wealth. Along with industry and the private sector, this government has created wealth. We helped to create that wealth by investing and supporting jobs through the global financial crisis. As for those opposite—and the Australian people will always remember this—when the tough times hit we were there to stand up and to support jobs, while they were asleep. And now we see that they just cannot wait to scurry away from the chamber at every opportunity, because they do not want to be here for the hard decisions.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2012-05-31,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:55):  Now more than ever Australia needs a steady hand at the wheel, and they do not have one. Our economy, business and families alike, crave surety and a logical, consistent and predictable government that they can rely on, and they do not have one. Even this week's Labor infighting, as it gathered pace amongst the backbenchers, as they rolled the Prime Minister's control over vital resource sectors, just showed once again how this government has completely lost its way. It has no idea what kind of direction and course to set for our country. They follow the demands of the Greens. They follow the demands of the union heavies, knowing that they are already circling around the Prime Minister for the next time a leadership challenge happens.


The political intrigue that is paralysing Labor, though, not just has a cost for Labor; sadly, it has a cost for the whole of the country. It is a real cost. This instability at the top and the crisis of confidence in the Prime Minister's decision-making comes at a precarious time for all businesses, big and small across all sectors. Labor has pushed Australia to another economic crossroads, one we do not need to be facing. It has come at a time so soon after they inherited a strong and robust economy. They inherited surpluses, they inherited savings—savings that could be used for the future. All that has been squandered, all of that has been lost, and this government continues on its endless path of destruction.


This government has eroded Australia's great natural competitive advantages—the things that have made us great over the years, the reasons why companies and investors wanted to come to Australia, the reasons why Australians worked so hard to build their own country. All of these things now are being eroded by a government that has completely lost its way and lost a vision for our future. We have seen in the last couple of days practical evidence of that, as Australia has slid down the index of competitiveness, slid down the index of ease of doing business. This is an embarrassment and a humiliation to a once great country.


Let us look at some of those competitive advantages and what Labor has done to them. We once had low-cost electricity. That attracted mineral processors—smelters and refineries for aluminium, gold and copper. Energy-intensive manufacturers actually wanted to come to Australia because we had this natural advantage. But now what has Labor done to destroy this great advantage? They are buying Australia's low-cost power stations and closing them down. They are closing down our big competitive assets. What they are doing is introducing a carbon tax that is going to massively add to the cost of electricity and make it so much less attractive to come to this country.


The Business Council of Australia has identified 240 federal and state energy and climate change policies which are adding to energy costs and eroding our competitive advantage. Is it any wonder that no new low-cost power stations are being built in this country? This government does not want them and therefore it does not want the jobs and the industries that would be attracted—and it does not want the jobs in the industries and factories that are currently closing. They have indeed lost their way and squandered one of our competitive advantages.


We as a nation have abundant resources of high quality that have been relatively accessible. Under this government the ease of doing business in Australia, according to the World Bank index, has slipped from eighth to 15th. These abundant resources are no longer easy to access. This government has made it harder to get there. They have done it through endless bureaucracy—bureaucracy that guarantees now it takes years to get an approval for any project. In question time yesterday we even heard the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, trying to make a virtue out of taking years and years to make decisions about environmental approvals. He was embarrassed that the new Newman government, after only a few weeks in office, was able to give approval to projects, whereas he still has years of work to do to get through his environmental assessments. This is the kind of thing that discourages people from investing in this country. Then we have inadequate ports and railways, because the government has been unable to initiate the key projects that are necessary to service these industries.


One of the other major reasons industries came to Australia was that this was a country with low sovereign risk. The governments have traditionally been stable. They have been trustworthy, they have honoured their promises, they did not change the rules every second day. Now we have a government that does not control its own agenda. The Greens run the country and the unions run Labor. The reality is they cannot make the decisions that are necessary to deliver the kind of stable environment that would encourage investment. They cannot manage themselves, let alone manage a successful economy. They stumble from one political disaster to another. There is no stability in the investment climate either. Remember the words, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That was a clear statement, a clear signal to the world's business community that you could come here and not get a carbon tax, you would not get this extra cost burden. The promise lasted just a matter of days and it was dishonoured.


Then we have the mining super tax. People invest in this country in mining schemes on the basis of an economic environment that has been passed into law through the legislation of the parliament, and Labor just simply changes it as though it has no substance. Their super tax on mining has damaged industry confidence to ever make an investment because they know the rules will be changed yet again. Labor has changed the withholding tax for investors on numerous occasions. There can be no certainty for an investment when this sort of thing is happening. The promised tax cuts have been abandoned altogether. Labor never cuts taxes; Labor only puts them up. That is just the kind of environment that sends investors to other parts of the world.


Then the Prime Minister promised everybody that they could have an EMA so they could get some of the workforce that they needed. She was quite happy to tell the mining companies that she supported EMAs, but then she told the unions precisely the opposite. She wants to walk away.



An opposition member:  She is furious.




Mr TRUSS:
  Yes, she is furious about the idea that this might happen. Then there are the changes to the shipping industry. Legislation has gone through this House this morning on the transport industry, which gives control to the unions in key sectors of the industry and guarantees that the sovereign risk in coming to a country like Australia will continue to grow.


Another major advantage that we had in this country was the productive, skilled and reliable workforce. Once we were skilled with a reputation for productivity, even if our wages were a bit higher than those of other parts of the world. But that is also being lost. On the world competitive index Australia has slipped from fifth to 15th, and industrial lawlessness is one of the issues that is raising its head again and again. Jac Nasser, the head of BHP, reported just recently that the BMA consortium had experienced 3,200 industrial incidents in just one year in the Bowen Basin.


How can a company invest or make decisions for the future when it has to put up with 3,200 industrial incidents in a year? In many of these instances they use the Qantas strategy, where the unions call a strike and then call it off just at the last minute so they can keep their wages but the maximum disadvantage is done to their employer. Where are these unions coming from that believe they can actually achieve things for their members by destroying their employer? What is the sense of destroying the company, destroying the industry and destroying the competitiveness of our nation just in the name of some kind of industrial power and industrial lawlessness? Many of these unions now want to take control of the decision-making in their companies. How is anybody going to invest in those circumstances?


Labor is fond of boasting that there is $500 billion worth of projects in the pipeline. Yes, they are in the pipeline and they are stuck there. The pipeline is choked. It is blocked up by government red tape and green tape and black tape and it needs a good decent flush out. A clean-out is what is desperately needed and it is going to have to go right to the top. This government must go if we are going to restore confidence in our country and restore our competitiveness so that we can deliver a decent lifestyle for all Australians.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2012-05-31,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:05):  Anyone listening to the debate in here would be questioning. They would really be thinking about the grim reaper's hand of death already on the shoulder of the Australian economy and on Australian business and Australian people. This could not be further from the truth. The opposition can wish it all they want. The opposition can wish for the end of business in Australia. They can wish for a bad economy. But they are not going to get their wish from this government. This government will continue to work hard to deliver a surplus budget, to deliver a strong economy, to deliver jobs for Australians, to invest in our schools, to help families with the cost of living, to do the things that governments are meant to do to assist not only the economy but also to make sure that ordinary people—people at home listening to this, people that go to work every day, people that educate their kids—get a hand-up, assistance and support from their government, not this negative claptrap that we hear from the opposition.


It does not get any more palpable when you come into this place at question time. Every word that is uttered by the opposition is about negativity. It is about bringing down the economy; it is about ramming down confidence. At the same time that they are talking down the economy, they are wishing for Australia to become like Greece. This is their wish because, in their minds, the faster that would happen the quicker they would get government. That is their strategy and their plan. It is to bring down the economy. Let us burn the place down because by doing that we will have proved something and we will get to government quicker. This government is not going to do that. We are not going to sit by idly. We going to do the tough things and the hard things. We are going to do the things that are necessary for this economy. And you might ask why. Why would we do this? There is a very simple answer: because people deserve to keep working. They deserve to have a job, and that is what we are doing. And I think it is pretty well reflected in the unemployment figures. Look anywhere in the world, pick a country and make a comparison with Australia. You cannot wish that away. You cannot wish the numbers away, because it is the same methodology that the Australian Bureau of Statistics have used for 30 years. That same set of statistics and data say that there is now only 4.9 per cent unemployment in this country, down from 5.1 per cent. That is a record that is better than when the Howard government was in, better than the golden years when the rivers of gold used to flow to Canberra. They had more money than they could ever budget for. They used to predict a surplus and it was always big, but they did not have a clue how much money was coming in to the economy. They were good days. The whole world was peaking. Tax was a lot higher; people paid more. It did not matter which measure you used, everyone paid more tax. In fact, people paid more for their mortgages as well; interest rates were higher.


But in tough economic conditions this government has been able to do the hard yards, the hard work—nose to the grindstone. Not for us the death hand of the grim reaper trying to choke the confidence of Australians, trying to choke small business, turning up at some poor small business and telling them that they have nothing for the future, that they should just lay everybody off and give up—when the next day those same businesses announce growth, they announce new profits and good things happening. This is all that the other side look for. They look for the doom and the gloom. They wish it every day. I can see the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, kneeling down beside his bed at night and saying, 'God bless Mum, God bless dad, God bless Australia and, please God, wreck the Australian economy so I can become the Prime Minister,' because the quicker he thinks he can wreck this economy the quicker he believes that he personally will benefit and become the Prime Minister.


But nothing could be further from the truth, as you will see if you pick any report in the world—I am very confident about picking any report in the world. These guys are looking every single day and thinking, 'Can we just find one little bit of negative reporting on Australia?' They cannot turn to the rating agencies because for, the first time in our history, in over 100 years, this Australian economy under this Labor government has managed a AAA rating, the highest possible rating you can get across all three agencies. Where are the geniuses on the other side? Hang on, one of them just walked in. By the way, my offer is still on the table: if you want to run faster, I am happy to give you a few tips on how on this side we run the economy a little bit faster, how we speed things up; how we get investment into the country; how we keep people in jobs and how we make a difference to people's lives. In the end there is a measure of difference. It is called 'people having a job'. It is called 'being able to pay the mortgage', which of course is cheaper under Labor, because people, on average, are paying at least $3,000 a year less.


The shadow Treasurer shakes his head. So what? He shakes his head at everything; it would not matter what I said. If I said, 'Do you want an ice cream?' he would say no. It does not matter what I say, he would shake his head so it does not worry me too much. The reality is that the data does not lie, nor does the economy, nor does business growth, nor does the half trillion dollars of confidence—dollars, investment, confidence. So while they are saying that the coal industry is dead, energy is dead, retail is dead, manufacturing is dead—you name it, everything is dead—and that on 1 July we will all wake up with a scorched earth and nothing left, of course, we all know that that is just hollow rhetoric designed to do one thing. And this is the sad part: small business people are out there trying to create more work, keep themselves and their workers employed and do something for their families—in fact, trying to do something for the economy. But every day they hear negativity from the Leader of the Opposition. He cannot run fast enough to get out of this place. He is banging into walls to get out of this place so he can talk down the economy.


I will tell you who has got some confidence in our economy. I will give you some idea. Every other country in the world looks at us and says, 'We'd hack off our right arms to have just a little piece of your good economy.' Who else has got confidence in our economy? We have on this side. We have confidence in our economy and we will keep working hard to grow it to make sure people have got jobs. Who else has got confidence in our economy? All of those people who have poured half a trillion dollars worth of their money into our economy based on one thing: they believe we are growing, they believe we have a bright future, they believe it is good. I will tell you what, there is another interesting group of people who think we have some opportunities, some good news, some growth. While the Leader of the Opposition sits here and talks down the end of the earth as we know it, Liberal National Party members on his side are out there buying the very stocks and shares of the things he is talking—




Mr Symon:
  Follow the money.




Mr RIPOLL:
  Absolutely—follow the money. Put your money where your mouth is. While their leader tells everybody, tells the mums and dads, 'Oh, no; it's all over. There's nothing left in the Australian economy. There's no confidence,' what do his guys do? They go and put money on the table and say, 'I'll take a wager on that because I think things are going to go up.' You do not put money on the table unless you think there is a good, bright economy ahead, and that is exactly what there is—a strong economy despite—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  I love hearing from that side. They talk about the politics of envy. The worst politics of envy is this: they envy the Greek economy! That is what they want. That is the real politics of envy. 'Please, please give us a Greek economy.'



An opposition member:  You're on your way!




Mr RIPOLL:
  If we are on our way, I am satisfied that we are well placed to survive the worst because we have done the hard work. We actually do our homework. On this side we have actually done the right things. In one of the toughest global economies that this planet has faced for a long, long time, we did the hard work to make sure we delivered a surplus. We made sure that we invested in schools. But the book burners over there, the antiscientists, the antiresearchers, have a plan to save money. They say, 'Get rid of teachers, that'll save a lot of money. Let's not have so many schools. Science and research is overrated, why would we waste money on things like that? Computers in schools—who needs them? Computers are overrated.'


Let me tell you about the success of investing in education. If we start talking about the Asian century then we have to do something about it. I heard the other day the shadow Treasurer talk about the Asian century, but he just said, 'Let's just run faster.' Which direction? To it or away from it, because all I can see on this side—



A government member:  Out the door.




Mr RIPOLL:
  Out the door—that is exactly where they ran. They are scared of it. On this side we are not scared of it, because Australia is in the right place at the right time, with the right government and the right economy. We are the right government because when it comes to facilitating jobs we help that happen. When there are big projects in this country—you can look me in the eye—we help facilitate them.


Roy Hill is a fantastic example and one of the best news stories I have heard for a very long time. It shows that on this side we are prepared to help create and facilitate jobs and projects. It is just one of up to 30 new projects, part of the half-trillion dollar investment, and 6,500 new Australian jobs will be created just in that one project. (Time expired)

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-05-31,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:15):  Just before coming here I was reading an article that leads the Financial Times called 'Rush for havens as Euro fears rise'. It identifies that 'US benchmark borrowing costs have plunged to their lowest levels since 1946', and UK interest rates have fallen to '1.64 per cent, the lowest since records for benchmark borrowing costs began in 1703'. US 10-year yields are down to 1.62 per cent, which is a level last reached just after World War II, and German two-year bond yields have fallen to zero for the first time, meaning that people are prepared to lend money to Germany for two years without any interest rate, without any return, simply to get their money back.


If you believe the logic of this government when it talks about the cash rate in Australia falling, which we would encourage in a strong economy with lower funding costs, all of this is good news. But there is a rush to safe havens at the moment because there is growing uncertainty about where the Western world is heading. Europe is one great big Ponzi scheme at the moment. At every moment where there appears to be money lost or about to be lost they reach again for the debt lever. That is the challenge. Who is well placed?


Everywhere around the world people are trying to re-price sovereign risk. It is the single most significant challenge for the globe and for capital markets over the next 20 years: how to properly price sovereign risk. We are going through it again in Spain. It was Greece a few weeks ago and it continues to be Greece into the future, but it is not just Spain and Greece. It is France. It is the United States, with its near default on its loans. It is the Western world that is now being sized up for sovereign risk. Even though there is a rush to invest in places like the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany I would say it is because they are seen as safer havens than other jurisdictions.


This is an opportunity for Australia. Sure, there are significant inflows of money at the moment, and significant interest in buying Australian government bonds and state government semibonds, but there would be more interest and greater investment in Australia if we had a government that was consistent, predictable, reliable and trustworthy. CEDA has put out the World Competitiveness Yearbook results, which show us slipping from a nine ranking to 15 in the last 12 months. The government said this is all about the currency, but I see that Canada is well ahead of us and it has had a similar surge in the value of the Canadian dollar because, much like Australia, it has a vast amount of resources that are attractive. But in Australia there has been a relatively significant deterioration in labour regulation, transparency, labour relations, government decisions and the stability of those decisions, and environmental laws that made it all much harder. Those factors have played into our reduced competitiveness.


That follows on the back of other reports that identify that government decision making is having an impact. For example, even when we had solid results from the ABS about infrastructure investment, JP Morgan today put out in an Australian economic research paper that 'key project sponsors have complained about rising costs, labour and capital, of being strangled by worsening regulation and green tape, of lower commodity prices and slower growth in China'. These calamities, they argue, 'risk important projects being delayed or even scrapped'. The author recognises there may be some posturing by those companies, but the fact is the companies would not be saying it if they did not mean it because they rely on that investment. They rely on a stable, predictable investment environment, and how could it be stable and predictable in the face of initiatives like the carbon tax?


The Treasurer and Minister for Trade in Queensland, Tim Nicholls, released at nearly three o'clock today an analysis of the impact of the carbon tax. He identified: that it could see 21,000 Queenslanders lose their jobs; that real wages could be reduced by up to $2,940; and that Queensland's gross state product could take a hit of $9.6 billion as a result of this.


This is because the government is so uncommercial. It does not understand what sovereign risk is. At a time when the rest of the world is unstable we should be stable. At a time when the rest of the world is uncertain we should be certain. At a time when there is a lack of confidence in other parts of the world we should be confident. Yet listen in the words of people who actually invest, like Ian Matheson, Chief Executive Officer of the Australasian Investor Relations Association, on a survey of the top 200 ASX companies, said:


In the comments from corporates, obviously reflecting what is being told to them by international investors, there is absolutely no doubt there has been heightened concern about things such as the carbon tax, the MMRT (minerals resource rent tax), growing industrial dispute activity and sovereign risk generally. That has been going on for 12 months now.


I think that is a bit generous.


John Stanhope, former Telstra CFO, said on 17 May, 'So people looking outside of Australia think we are a sovereign risk because of the uncertainty created by policy fluctuation.' Bernie Ridgeway, managing director of Imdex was quoted in the West Australian—these are all this month—saying: 


You're taking a previously blue chip jurisdiction for investment (Australia) and we're turning into something where we've got sovereign risk and uncertainty.


David Knox, chief executive of Santos and chairman of Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said: 


My clear message to the Australian Government is: do not create uncertainty.


Instead provide our investors with the confidence in Australia as a stable fiscal and regulatory region—allow us to stay competitive.


The list goes on, with Christoffe de Margerie, Total chairman and chief executive. Why do people say this? This is a list of Gillard government broken promises and changes to policy since the 2010 election—none larger than: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government that I lead.'


Everyone in Australia and around the world knows that was a solemn pledge from the Prime Minister and it has been broken. That is an example of sovereign risk writ large. There are others. The Prime Minister promised community consensus on taxing carbon and broke that promise. She promised to cut company tax and was going to stick with it, but broke that promise. She promised a $500 standard deduction on tax returns, broke that promise. She promised foreign aid increases, said they were absolutely committed to meeting those goals by 2015, and broke that promise. You would remember the 50 per cent discount on interest income, another broken promise. The green buildings tax break was changed. Increased defence spending, broken. Reinvesting defence budget savings, another broken promise. Sparing the Public Service from budget cuts, broken. Private health insurance rebate changes, broken. Gambling reform and the agreement with Andrew Wilkie, broken. Consulting clubs on gambling reforms, broken. A new era of openness and transparency, broken. Onshore processing generally, broken. Processing refugees at Curtin, broken. Processing refugees at RAAF Base Scherger, broken. An onshore processing centre on East Timor, broken. A citizens assembly, broken. Cash for clunkers, mining tax royalties, BER costings—all good recommendations, as is the solar credit scheme. Delay of the national curriculum, reform of health and hospitals, a tax summit by 30 June, asylum seekers to Malaysia, the Pacific solution hypocrisy, budget neutrality of the carbon tax—it goes on and on and on. I have another 30 broken promises.


You wonder why there is sovereign risk. You wonder why there is confusion out there. It is the words and deeds of this government that are creating unnecessary sovereign risk for Australia. (Time expired)

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:25):  It is a truism in politics that we get our own arguments but we do not get to have our own facts. Any discussion of the state of the Australian economy has to rest on basic facts. Let us start with a couple. Only rarely in the post-war era have unemployment, inflation and the cash rate all been below five per cent. We are in one of those moments right now. Fact No. 2: not once in the Howard or Fraser governments, about 20 years in office, was there one single year where government spending was cut in real terms. Yet as Stephen Koukoulis has pointed out, Labor governments have cut real spending in five years since the mid-1980s.


Cutting real spending is not easy. It requires making some pretty tough decisions, but we have done it when the times have demanded it. We have also increased government spending when the times have demanded that. That is what Keynes taught us in the teeth of the Great Depression: when there is a big drop in private demand, governments should step in to fill the gap. But those opposite think that governments should never go into debt. They have an anti-debt strategy.


We have heard already in this debate about those opposite having a different attitude when it comes to their private affairs than they do in their public affairs. Privately those opposite are buying mining shares, while publicly they are talking about the collapse of the mining industry. Privately those opposite take on debt. They do so for a perfectly good reason. They take on mortgages early in their lives and pay them off later in their lives. As Richard Dennis pointed out in a column in today's Australian Financial Review, debt is not a villain and Australia's debt is among the lowest in the developed world.


Those opposite are playing a dangerous game with confidence. Business confidence is not created by government. Business confidence is the responsibility of all. It is the responsibility of business leaders—and I have to say that some business leaders could have exercised a little more responsibility over recent months in maintaining the business confidence that benefits them as well. Business confidence is also the responsibility of those opposite. All of us have a responsibility to speak in terms of facts when it comes to the Australian economy.


We are putting in place a carbon tax because we know that is the right way of taxing non-renewable resources that can only be taken out of the ground once. These resources are not owned by any individual, but are mined thanks to the agreement of the Australian people. We are putting in place a price on carbon pollution that will see Australia's emissions cut by five per cent by 2020. That cut could have been put in place two years earlier, had those opposite stuck with their then leader or had the Greens voted with those Liberal senators who defied their new leader and voted for the CPRS legislation. Yesterday in this House the member for Melbourne took issue with some facts that I had placed on the record, that by voting against the CPRS package the Greens were responsible for an extra 10 million tonnes of carbon pollution, the equivalent of annual emissions of two million cars. The member for Melbourne said that somehow my comments 'exercised gall' and such actions would not have resulted in a better outcome for the planet. But that is not the case. We have very clear modelling that had the Greens or the Liberals supported carbon pricing legislation two years earlier we would have gotten fewer emissions.


We have a price on carbon pollution now and it is a price we had to put on. We are acting early. Those opposite would have us put our heads in the sand on every economic reform. They would have us put our heads in the sand on the minerals resource rent tax, carbon pricing and good economic investments.

Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (16:30):  The sugarcane harvest is scheduled to begin in the Bundaberg and Childers districts in my electorate early in this coming month, and it is marked by more optimism than we have had around the sugar industry in more than a decade. Queensland produces 95 per cent of Australia's raw sugar, and around 85 per cent of Queensland's raw sugar is sold on the world market. The resurgence seen in the Australian sugarcane industry in recent years, driven by a burgeoning Asian market hungry for Australian sugar, is welcome news for an industry that has been belted from pillar to post by weather and poor prices in recent years.


The sugar industry is a cornerstone of many Queensland regional communities, none more so than in my electorate of Hinkler, which includes both the Millaquin and Bingera mills in Bundaberg and the Isis Central Sugar Mill at Childers. The Millaquin mill is scheduled to begin crushing on 17 or 18 June and anticipates crushing approximately 1.5 million tonnes over a 20-week period. This year the Bundaberg Sugar company has spent $15 million upgrading the facility located at East Bundaberg and has installed a new bagasse silo, a bagasse handling facility and a fifth mill train to enhance the crushing. The work has been undertaken as part of the final phase of Bundaberg Sugar's $40 million overhaul of its flagship processing plant.


Meanwhile, the Isis Central Sugar Mill is looking to create history this season by crushing a record tonnage, estimated to be 1.41 million tonnes, dependant, as always, on weather conditions. Crushing at the Isis mill is scheduled to begin on 13 June and will provide employment for the district's seasonal workers for 23 weeks. So, as you can see, there will be 20 weeks of activity at one mill and 23 weeks at the other—significant seasonal work in my electorate.


As mentioned before, the sugar industry has been battling adverse weather conditions. Last year, a lot of the sugar along the coast was knocked over in the cyclones. Other cane suffered excessive flooding. Some of it had wet feet for too long. Some of it was so soggy it could not be harvested. But this year, thankfully, especially around Bundaberg and Isis, we seem to be having better conditions all around. We have been able to handle fungal conditions over recent years. One particular disease, sugarcane smut, which was detected on a Childers farm in 2006, is now largely under control. Since then, farmers have worked hard to eradicate the disease and inhibit its return by planting smut resistant varieties of cane, including the very successful Q183 along with Q240, Q245 and Q242. The resilience of these varieties to disease, which has the potential to cause immeasurable damage to the sugar, is matched only by the resilience of the canefarmers in my electorate, who are leading citizens in our community. Many of those growers will this weekend participate in one of the state's biggest sugarcane displays, at the Gin Gin Show, which is in the neighbouring electorate of Flynn, home to my colleague the member for Flynn, Ken O'Dowd.


The sugarcane industry extends from the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, along the full length of the Queensland coast, right up to Mossman at the start of the cape. It provides a tremendous amount of economic stimulus for the state. It is the core, as I said, of many rural communities and it is part of the culture of Queensland. I wish the growers and millers a very successful season.

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:30):  I rise today to speak about Mr Tadashi Yamamoto, who, sadly, passed away on 15 April this year at the age of 76. Mr Yamamoto was born on 11 March 1936 in Tokyo. He initially studied at Rokko Senior High School before transferring to Komaba High School, from which he graduated in 1953. He attended Sophia University in Tokyo, where he studied philosophy, and then continued his undergraduate education at St Norbert College in Wisconsin and received a Master of Business Administration from Marquette University, Wisconsin, in 1962. In 1966, he married Chiyoko Aikawa, and in the following years they had four sons and later eight grandchildren.


Mr Yamamoto was the founder and President of the Japan Centre for International Exchange, JCIE, a non-government, not-for-profit organisation founded to develop and encourage Japan's contribution to the international community and communication between non-government leaders in different countries. The founding of this organisation was considered a revolutionary concept in Japan at the time. Described as a catalyst for and a facilitator of exchange for a better society and world through communication, cooperation and friendship, Mr Yamamoto dedicated his life to strengthening Japan's international relations and addressing global challenges using non-governmental foreign exchange programs.


Mr Yamamoto achieved a great deal during his 40 years as president of JCIE. I would particularly like to note his many initiatives to promote and support exchange programs for young political leaders. His philanthropy in this area had a direct influence in Australia. In 1992, JCIE entered into an exchange partnership with the Australian Political Exchange Council to provide learning experiences and developmental opportunities through regular exchanges. It is for Japanese and Australian young political leaders. From the outset, the exchanges were viewed by participants as highly valued opportunities to gain an in-depth understanding of the host country and particularly its political system. This program has also made possible and fostered communication, understanding and friendship between young leaders of Australia and Japan.


Mr Yamamoto and his staff at JCIE have sponsored 11 delegations of Japanese young political leaders to Australia since 1992 and have hosted 19 delegations for Japan. JCIE has also conducted a young political leaders exchange program with the USA. This year saw the 24th visit from Japan to the US and the 28th visit of the US delegation to Japan. Mr Yamamoto saw the establishment of the Trilateral Commission in 1973, an annual non-governmental forum of 350 leaders from Europe, North America and Japan which aims to promote mutual understanding and closer cooperation between nations. In 2000, the commission expanded its membership beyond Japan to other Asian countries, among them a number of ASEAN countries including Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. Mr Yamamoto made an enormous contribution to international relations in Japan. He facilitated an increased understanding and trust between nations with his strong belief in common humanity. He was a world ambassador and was regarded by many to be a true internationalist.

Mr Snowdon:
  Why not ask a series of them and then I will respond to them?




Mr ROBERT:
  I am happy to do that. Minister, the budget reveals cuts of $1.6 billion in equipment acquisitions in the Defence Capability Plan. Can you outline—or, if you cannot, can you take it on notice—what these cuts are, the strategic rationale for those cuts, why those and not others, and what the impact of those cuts will be? Likewise, there is $1.3 billion in cuts from the approved major capital acquisition program. Again, what are the cuts, what was the strategic rationale for those as opposed to others and what will the impact be? There is $400 million that has been taken from ADF housing over the forward estimates. Can you outline exactly where those cuts are coming from and the impact in terms of housing? There is $1.2 billion in cuts from the major capital facilities program. Again, what are these cuts and what impact will these cuts have on personnel?

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:05):  I have a question to the minister, but I will make a few comments first. The commitment by the government to commit 12 future submarines to be assembled in South Australia is welcome news for my local constituents. I have to commend the former Premier, Mike Rann, and Kevin Foley, the former defence industries minister, for having the foresight to make South Australia a defence state. It is their foresight that has led to a situation where in South Australia we clearly have—I will let the minister and the Federation Chamber know—the capacity to complete this project. As a very proud South Australian I say that there have been a lot of defence projects which have been very successfully delivered in South Australia and that this one will be no exception.


I was also very pleased with the government's recent decision, which was announced in May, to commit $214 million on the first stage of the Future Submarine Project. This was certainly welcome news. There has been discussion about this for a long time, and it was very pleasing for my local electorate to be given the certainty about it from this government. Unfortunately, no such commitment has been made by the opposition. I know it is not the member on the other side; I know he would love to build the submarines in South Australia. Unfortunately, the member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition will not commit to that. That is very concerning and, I think, does put some uncertainty in the project.


From the government's point of view I am pleased to see that there is the commitment for this. It builds on, I note, the 2009 white paper, which outlined the government's commitment to acquire 12 new future submarines to be assembled in South Australia. I am very pleased that that commitment has been forthcoming with the announcement of the first stage. I think that is really important.


The opportunity for South Australia in this project cannot be underestimated. Discussions I have had with the defence industry and with the minister indicate that we are talking about not 10 years or 20 years of investment and economic activity as a result of this project in South Australia but 50 years to 100 years of exciting economic activity.


We have seen with the air warfare destroyer project that certainly South Australia has the capacity in Techport to be able to bring expertise together to deliver on defence projects. In terms of bringing industry together, I think that area in Port Adelaide has really come of age and is ready to deliver. They are very pleased, and, in the conversations that I have had, people have welcomed this commitment by the government.


It is very concerning that the opposition will not commit to this project. It is very concerning that we do not have bipartisan support for it. That fact does cause a lot of uncertainty for people in South Australia and for businesses in South Australia.



Mr Robert interjecting—




Ms RISHWORTH:
  I would call on the opposition to look at it very carefully. As I said, I know the member on the other side's commitment. It is a pity that the member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition do not share his commitment to this. It is very concerning. It would be good if the opposition could come on board with us and make it bipartisan. Certainly that is what people in South Australia want. Unfortunately this is symptomatic of the opposition's neglecting South Australia. Whether on water, on defence spending or on Holdens, really what the opposition leader has been clearly saying to South Australians is that he has no interest in them. But back to the issue at hand. My question to the minister is: can the minister update the chamber on the government's commitment to the future submarine capacity?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  I will call on the member to deal with those questions thus far. I thought we had an outbreak of peace, for a while. But the minister has the call anyway on the questions from the member for Fadden and the member for Kingston.



Honourable members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call and he will be heard in silence. It is a very important portfolio, and I will ask those in the Federation Chamber to hear the minister's answer in silence.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:10):  Let me first go to the general issues which were raised and the specific questions which were raised by the shadow minister. Obviously the decisions were made in the budget process through the ERC process in a timely fashion prior to the budget. As he rightly pointed out, there is $4.45 million worth of savings across the forward estimates, including a contribution of $971 million in 2012-13.


I do want to make a couple of points just so that we understand the nature of these cuts. The contribution will have no adverse effect on operations in Afghanistan, East Timor or the Solomons, and I think that is commonly understood. It will not have any impact on the provision of defence equipment, defence personnel and operations. They will not be adversely affected, as you would expect. There will be no adverse impact on the number of ADF personnel engaged within the services. What we are doing is looking at the impacts of some of the reform—the strategically reform processes—and making sure that the impacts on entitlements to ADF personnel are being minimised. I understand that would be an issue which you will probably raise. I am happy to talk about that in more detail later.


I think I need to make the observation and the point that there has been no fundamental change to our defence budget from a strategic perspective. That is vitally important if we are to understand where we are going here. In 2009-10, the budget for the government for the first time was over $100 million for defence. That was across the forward estimates. In the 2011-12 portfolio additional estimates, the defence budget across the four-year forward estimates period was $103.4 billion. The budget this year is $103.3 billion. This level of funding will maintain Australia's status in the top 15 nations in the world of defence expenditure. We will continue to be the second on the list of military expenditure per capita, with only the United States spending more. So we need to understand that perspective.


The opposition spokesman has asked me about savings through the Defence Capability Plan since the 2009 white paper. I just want to preface this. I do not necessarily want to have a political dialogue which is about animus, but I do still want to make a couple of observations. This is a $5.4 billion save over the forward estimates. It is for a particular reason which is well known to the parliament and the people of Australia: to get us into surplus. We were asked to make a contribution. We are making a contribution, but the significant question—and this is something which I know the opposition spokesperson will take on board, and I would like to think he could tell us what is happening—is: are the opposition committed to these savings? The real question, apart from the dialogue we will have about the capability development plan, is whether or not the opposition are committed to these sort of savings—or are they going to say they are not going to proceed? If they are going to say that, they have got to tell us where the money is coming from. We already know there is a $70 billion black hole. What they need to be able to tell us now is: if they do not want to support these savings measures, where will the money come from? It is a very simple but very important question which needs to be asked. Let me go to the issue of the Defence Capability Plan.


There were 180 capability projects in the 2009-2019 defence capability plan that underpin the 2009 defence white paper. Fewer than 10 projects have been scrapped as a result of revisions to the DCP. The vast majority remain in the program today. (Extension of time granted) Since the 2009 white paper, government has approved over 100 first or second pass and other approvals, including studies, risk reduction activities, capability technology demonstrations and project development funding with a total value of nearly $13.5 billion. This includes the first 14 Joint Strike Fighters, 24 naval combat helicopters, over 900 additional G-wagon trucks, seven CH-47F new Chinook helicopters and two more D model Chinooks, military satellite capabilities, counter IED equipment and systems, new 155 millimetre towed artillery systems, and communication equipment. In 2011 the government made a record 49 approvals of capability projects. The previous record was 37, in 2006. The government has also allocated funding for essential new capabilities not envisaged in the 2009 defence white paper, including the new amphibious heavy lift ship HMAS Choules and the interim humanitarian disaster relief ship MSV Skandie Bergen, two additional C17 heavy lift aircraft for a total of six, and 101 more bushmasters with further orders likely. We remain committed through this budget, and this is apparent in the budget papers, to the core capabilities as outlined in the 2009 defence white paper, including 12 future submarines—I will come to those more specifically in a moment—the Joint Strike Fighter and the replacement for the caribou aircraft.


I will respond to my colleague's questions about the submarines. Earlier this month the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, and the Minister for Defence Materiel, Jason Clare, announced that the government would provide $214 million—and I am sure this will be supported by the opposition—for the next stage of the future submarine project. The funding will go towards further detailed studies and analysis to inform the government's decision on the design of Australia's next submarine. The future submarine project is the biggest and most complex defence project Australia has ever embarked upon. It means work for hundreds of Australian companies and thousands of Australian workers, including boilermakers, welders, electricians, naval architects, engineers and many more.


I have a question again for the opposition. Are they committed to this project? Are they committed to having these vessels built in Australia? We know that the shadow treasurer on Channel 7 during the week of the budget said that they want to see what the benefit is in building the submarines here in Australia rather than getting cheaper versions from overseas. I think it is quite important that we understand, through this discussion we are having here, what the government is committed to and what the opposition is committed to. We have announced these savings, which are big, but at the same time we have made our commitment to the future development of Australian defence capability—including submarines—very clear. Clearly we want to see them built here in Australia, and we have maintained our commitment all along. I ask the opposition, if they can, to tell us what their position is.


The member asked me about defence housing. I would like him to tell us where that has come from. Are you talking about Defence Housing Australia, not the housing for single people that we are providing on bases—




Mr Robert:
 Not for single people. The forward estimates for DHA.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Okay. I will come back to you with an answer on that.

Can you actually spell out exactly what programs, infrastructure or projects those absorbed measures relate to. As the most recent ASPI Cost of defence notes, the SRP is failing to meet its savings objectives in 2010-11. Could you outline why this is the case—why they are not meeting the requirements for savings. Can you also outline what the projected savings are from the SRP over the remaining life of this program. Where will they come from? Can you continue to guarantee that those savings will be reinvested in Defence. In terms of industry, Minister, has your ministry or your ministerial colleagues consulted industry regarding the latest budget cuts? Has any modelling been done on the impacts of these cuts on the industry's capacity to respond to both the downturn in work and the supposed ramp-up of work in two or three years time?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:20):  I will just go to the question of the ASPI paper, which has been referred to by the shadow minister. Let us be very clear: the defence appropriation for 2012-13 is $24.2 billion. In the 2009-10 budget, the government for the first time budgeted over $100 billion for defence across the forward estimates. In this budget, the government has again budgeted over $100 billion for defence across the forward estimates. This includes $21 billion in total capital investment. The level of funding is expected to maintain Australia's status, as I referred to earlier, as number 13 in defence expenditure. I referred also to our per capita contribution, which is second only to the United States. In real dollar terms, we spend far more than any regional neighbour. Also, with the appreciation of the foreign exchange rate, we have been able to purchase the same equipment from overseas for less. Thus, whilst announced savings will be difficult, the defence budget—as you well know—remains at historically high levels. Reprioritisation with defence expenditure has been designed to have minimum impact on the delivery of core defence capabilities.


I note that the opposition seems to support the views expressed in the ASPI paper, which asserts that the government has manifestly placed a higher priority on delivering a surplus than on delivering a stronger Defence Force. It is not an either-or situation. The government remains committed to delivering the core capabilities identified in the 2009 white paper and to delivering one of the most capable defence forces in our region, but global and domestic economic circumstances have changed significantly since that white paper, which I am sure is well understood by the shadow minister but perhaps not so well understood by some of his colleagues.


The effects of the global financial crisis have continued to unfold with unexpected severity and duration since the 2009 defence white paper. In response to this, as we have maintained from the get-go, this government is committed to bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. As was made clear before the budget, Defence had to expect to make a contribution. That contribution has been made. The reprioritisation of defence expenditure has been designed to have a minimum impact on the delivery of core defence capabilities.


Another part of that ASPI report says that clearly it is the government's priority for defence that has fallen rather than its absolute ability to pay. That is simply not the case. The 2009 defence white paper noted that the global financial crisis was the most serious global economic and financial crisis in decades and that its strategic impacts were still unfolding. Since the GFC has continued to have a significant impact on the global economy, following the GFC the defence forces of major developed countries have increased efficiencies and reduced their budgets, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Of course, the other NATO nations in Western Europe have had significant impacts upon their defence budgets. Australia's 2009 defence white paper was completed before the unfolding of these events and the financial circumstances clearly represent a real challenge to the 2013 white paper. In terms of core capabilities, there are some 180 capability projects in the 2009-10 Defence Capability Plan that underpin the 2009 white paper. As I said previously, the vast majority of these remain, with 10 being removed. Most of those 10 have either had their scope reduced or were subsumed by other, related projects or replaced by newer technologies. I said before our commitments in this budget are for the first 14 Joint Strike Fighters, 24 new Navy helicopters, 900 additional G-Wagen trucks, additional Chinooks, military satellite capabilities, counter-IED equipment assistance, towed artillery systems and, of course, communication equipment. In 2011 the government approved a record 49 capability projects. The previous record was 37 in 2006. (Time expired)

 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:26):  The decisions the opposition is requesting have been taken to address changes that have occurred in the department's resources position over the last year which include a range of new cost pressures across the portfolio, including the following priority areas for investment: $700 million for additional investment in Collins-class submarine sustainment, $550 million for information technology remediation activities across Defence, $400 million for improved housing for Australian Defence Force personnel, $330 million for relocation of defence units from Moorebank to Holsworthy to allow development of the intermodal transport hub, $270 million in additional funding for Navy fleet sustainment, $220 million for investment in maintenance and upgrades of the Defence estate, $160 million for fringe benefit tax liabilities, $150 million for enhanced garrison support services and $70 million for further investment and international engagement under the Defence Cooperation Program.


To manage these internal cost pressures Defence has reallocated and reprioritised $2.9 billion. The majority of that $2.9 billion was reallocated from savings in the Defence Capability Plan and the approved major capital investment program, with further savings, predominantly in 2012-13, from across the general department operating budget. These savings from across the general department operating budget include Navy reprioritising its operating activities and reviewing all non-operational activities, including Navy's international program, and Army reducing the use of M113AS4 vehicles and M1A1 Abrams tanks. That some of these vehicles will be placed in temporary storage is well known now. Army will continue to review these fleets to ensure a viable mechanised capability is maintained.


These budget initiatives build on the efficiencies and savings gained through the Strategic Reform Program, including in the areas of capability development, procurement and acquisition, and the strengthening of personnel and institutional capabilities. The reform will be further considered during the development of the 2013 Defence white paper to ensure that, as you would expect, defence spending, in light of the forced posture review, revised Defence Capability Plan and the savings that have already been identified, is calibrated against an up-to-date assessment of our circumstances in both the short and longer terms. It is important that we acknowledge that some hard decisions have been taken in this budget, and we do not shy away from those decisions. I think it is very important also to say that there is no question about us not accepting the need to make changes in the way we do our business, and we are doing that. We have made it very clear that the allocation across the department was being, as I said earlier, reallocated from savings in the Defence Capability Plan and the Approved Major Capital Investment Program with further savings, predominately in 2012-13, from across the general departmental operating budget. It is very clear to us that we have a job to do here to make sure that we operate more efficiently and that we get better outcomes for the dollar we expend, and that has to happen right across the organisation. I do want to commend the organisation for being part of the decision making and for understanding what these responsibilities mean in terms of providing advice to government as to what we might best do to achieve our targets.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (10:30):  In a place that often focuses on the differences between the parties, I think both sides of the chamber agree on one thing and that is that one of the pre-eminent objectives for us in Afghanistan is the protection of our troops and of their wellbeing in Afghanistan. One of the things that I did want to focus on this morning in my question to the minister is what we are doing to protect troops there. I am led to believe that we have undertaken a number of measures in the course of the last year. There is new lighter combat body armour and a new combat uniform, longer range machine guns and upgrades to the Bushmasters. I understand that in the course of the last year we have let out a contract for the manufacture of over 100 new Bushmasters in Victoria and the upgrades to the ones in Afghanistan are designed to make them even more secure. I also see that we have put in place a counter-rocket system in Tarin Kowt to provide additional protection of troops there. Clearly these measures are critical.


In addition to this, a MultiCam camouflage uniform is being trialled to provide troops with even greater levels of concealment across the various terrains within Afghanistan. Obviously that is critical for them there. The new uniform, with its new elbow and knee pads, is designed to reduce soft tissue injuries. The uniform is cooler, it is designed to be worn under the body armour, and it has a padded waistband to make it even more comfortable under webbing or a field pack. And it has more pockets and stretch fabric at the joints.


I said earlier that the upgrade of the Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles will make them even safer. The upgrade will include the installation of protected weapons stations to reduce the exposure of crew operating vehicle-fitted weapons; internal spall liners that provide vehicle occupants with better protection from direct fire and side blasts; and new seating and flooring, giving troops in the vehicle better protection against spinal and lower limb injuries from the blast effects of IEDs. I want to ask, Minister: is there any other research being undertaken to further build on this commitment in terms of protecting our troops? I am wondering if you can outline that to the chamber.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:34):  Can I just say that the measures you have outlined are in fact all accurate. We have, under Colonel Jason Blaine, Diggerworks—which I am sure the shadow minister is aware of—which is a program designed to ensure that we have got the best possible equipment for our men and women who are on deployment doing the business for us in Afghanistan and elsewhere. It has proven to be a very successful program which has led to changes, which largely you have outlined.


You asked me about further research. There is a partnership between the department generally, the army in particular and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, for which I am responsible. That sort of work is ongoing. Whilst I am not at liberty to talk about the sorts of developments that have been produced directly as a result of their research into looking after our troops in Afghanistan, you can rest assured that as a result of the work which is being done by DSTO, particular items have been introduced into the theatre which have provided additional protection in terms of electronic countermeasures for our troops. They are very, very important to us. They are doing a huge amount of work along with those over in Russell involved with the IED taskforce, which is looking at how best to exploit the information we receive from IED events; translating that into methods of operation and providing greater protection for our personnel.


I am very proud of the work which is being done across the defence force, including across the department and all its agencies, in doing all we possibly can to provide for the protection of our personnel. You mentioned the Bushmasters; they are a case in point. A lot of the work which has led to the changes in the way we actually provide these vehicles is a result of research which has been done in the first instance through DSTO. It is very important work. Unfortunately, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation is not widely known outside of the defence community; indeed, in some parts of the defence community even then. It is a real treasure for us. It provides enormous capability advantage to us, unrecognised in the wider community—as I say—and is something which we should all applaud. I thank you for your observations about the work we are doing.


I just want to come back to the opposition shadow minister's question on strategic reform. As you know, the strategic reform program was announced as part of the defence white paper in 2009. It is an ambitious reform program that aims to find $20.6 billion in cost reductions across the decade, 2009-2019, for reinvestment in defence capability. We expect to meet our $1.284 billion target for the 2011-12 financial year. This comes on top of our meeting the $797 million target in 2009-10 and the $1.016 billion target in 2010-11.


But I do want to make clear and have it really understood that the SRP is not just a cost reduction program. It is a decade-long program of reform that is driving a greater understanding of defence business. Its cost drivers have started a culture shift in the organisation. Now the SRP is three years old, and the substance underpinning that program of course change and as a result of changes to the defence-funding profile and further detailed examination of proposed reform activities over the intervening years. The SRP, although achieving its targets, does face challenges. When it was agreed, it was the only major reform initiative within defence. Circumstances have evolved dramatically since. The effects of the global financial crisis, as I said earlier, have been a significant driver for us. At the time of the 2011-12 budget it was determined there would be a $1.6 billion underspend for 2010-11 and $1.3 billion of capital funding to be reprogrammed. This represented significant failure in defence's planning and advising process. (Extension of time granted).


In addition, the defence reform agenda has been expanded to include a number of new and important reforms, including the review of the Defence Accountability Framework, the Black review—as a result of that defence is strengthening its personnel and institutional accountability arrangements; expansion of the use of shared services in defence to increase efficiency; the plan to reform ship repair and maintenance, the Rizzo review; the review into Collins class submarines, the Coles review; the Pathway to Cultural Change, which is enhancing defence culture; and a range of important procurement and capability reforms to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the acquisition of new equipment for the Australian Defence Force have also been implemented. These include reforming defence planning, decision-making processes and performance management; substantially reducing the number of committees in defence; increasing the rigour, contestability and expertise within capability development; and strengthening the Projects of Concern process. We remain committed to the SRP, notwithstanding the $1.9 billion target in 2012-13. We will continue with the strategic reform program activities underway in the lead-up to the 2013 white paper. Defence reform, including how the range of existing reform initiatives will be integrated, will be a major theme of the Defence white paper which was announced by the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence on 3 May. This is something that we are looking at right now. Further details of future strategic reform in defence and how the range of initiatives will be integrated will form part of the 2013 white paper.


I think that adequately deals with the issue of the SRP, and I hope that the opposition understand that we remain committed. I am not sure about you—and that is the question. I go back to what I said originally. We need to understand whether or not the opposition are committed to the savings which we have identified. If not, why not? What are they going to change and how are they going to get the money if they are not? I ask whether or not you are committed to the strategic reform program, as we are, and if not, why not?


I thank my colleague for his question and I say again that we will do all we possibly can to enhance the protection of our troops on overseas operations. That is our first obligation, and it is an obligation which we will continue to meet.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:42):  Labor slashed $5½ billion from defence in the budget—which, considering Wagga Wagga, in my electorate of the Riverina, is a tri-service defence city, is sure to have a great impact. Twenty Army major capital facility projects have been delayed by up to three years, Minister, including the construction of Kapooka's working accommodation. I understand that general running expenses at the Army recruit training centre at Kapooka have been, as a result, reduced by a quarter. Last year, 4,000 recruits went through the base—2,300 regular soldiers and 1,700 Army reserve. The cutbacks mean such things as the commandant, instead of travelling to other bases for important face-to-face talks with other colonels and military chiefs, is now forced to do this by telephone. Is this satisfactory for a base which is so important to our defence capabilities?


Furthermore, the towns of Tumbarumba, Temora, West Wyalong and Uranquinty, in my Riverina electorate, did not have Australian Defence Force personnel or had reduced catafalque parties at the recent Anzac Day observances. This was due to funding cutbacks. Can you give me a guarantee that these regional towns and others will receive very necessary ADF representation for Anzac Day ceremonies and other important services from 2013 and beyond?

Are there any other assets, rotary or fixed, that will have flying hours cut over the forward estimates? The Chief of Navy's brief to his commanders and senior sailors indicates that they will be looking at the constrained use of surface vessels because of the reduction in fuel available to those ships. Could the minister outline what is the reduction of fuel to surface vessels and what programs the Chief of Navy will not be conducting because of the lack of fuel the chief has available to him?


Minister, with respect to the mothballing or putting into storage of M1A1 main battle tanks and M113s, what is the impact on the full supply chain in terms of training, core selection, core skills, crew command courses and the like? What impact will that have on the armoured corps, because of the mothballing of those assets?

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:45):  Minister, I want to thank the government for the transfer of further land adjacent to the RAAF base at Amberley to the Queensland government for the Aerospace and Defence Support Centre. This 22.6 hectares of land has been combined with the 143 hectares already owned by the Queensland government. That will see the transfer of aerospace and defence support industries and companies such as Boeing, currently located at the RAAF base, which will make sure that there are thousands of jobs and the viability of that sector. Over the years, the RAAF base at Amberley has seen a dramatic increase in operational capacity and the number of personnel. 


I notice that there were cutbacks in the budget and I have questions about that. But 24 Super Hornets are located in the area and they are operated by No. 1 and No. 6 squadrons at the RAAF base at Amberley. The Minister for Defence Materiel was with me on the day that four fighter jets were delivered. We have delivered 24 Super Hornets in the past 20 months. Those Super Hornets are particularly important in air-to-air combat, strike targets on land and sea, suppressing enemy air defence and conducting reconnaissance. I notice we are the first country, other than the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. The C17s are also located at the RAAF base at Amberley and they made a big contribution during our assistance missions to Papua New Guinea, Christchurch and Japan. 


I have noticed some media commentary in relation to the cutbacks. My questions relate to the RAAF base at Amberley, particularly the operational capacity of the RAAF base. I know that the government has made a decision to buy the fifth and sixth C17 Globemasters to be based at the RAAF base at Amberley. We welcome that and the military personnel. Ipswich has had military personnel since 1861, when we were not flying planes. I note the cutbacks are mainly in civilian and administrative capacities. Minister, will the cutbacks have any adverse operational impact on the RAAF base at Amberley? Is the government's commitment to the RAAF base at Amberley undiminished? Please update the chamber on the procurement of battlefield airlift aircraft to replace the retired Caribou.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:48):  I will start with my colleague's question and come back to the others. Yes, we can guarantee our ongoing support for the base at Ipswich. It is very important to us, as you well understand. There will be no adverse operational impact. We remain committed in the way you described.


In answer to the question on the C27J, in May a media release from the shadow minister for defence, Senator David Johnston, made a series of assertions about the procurement of the C27J Spartan battlefield airlift aircraft. In his media release, Senator Johnston said:


It appears there was no competitive tender process, no rigorous evaluation, and a billion dollar decision has been based on a quick desk top audit.


With great respect to the member for Fadden, this stands in stark contrast to his words in the parliament on Thursday, 10 May:


… available at a very good price and option, may I commend the minister for a quick and sound decision. It is a very good capability. The loss of the Caribou was quite a loss in terms of short take-off and landing. The C-27J will add significant capability to our arsenal.




Mr Robert:
  It will, and I stand by the comments.




Mr SNOWDON:
  I am pleased you do, but I just want to understand: is that the opposition's position?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! I reiterate all comments are through the chair.




Mr SNOWDON:
  With great respect, through you, to him: I am just wanting an assurance from the shadow minister that the views he has expressed are indeed those of the opposition, because they seem to be in contrast to those of the shadow minister for defence. Let me just put a couple of facts on the table. The government agreed to purchase 10 Alenia C-27J Spartan battlefield aircraft to replace the Caribou aircraft which was retired from service in 2009. Some, like me, with a liking for the Caribou, are a bit sad about that. After a career spanning more than four decades—and I would imagine you were actually transported in one on more than one occasion—




Mr Robert:
  Parachuted out of it.




Mr SNOWDON:
  And you enjoyed every moment.




Mr Robert:
  Loved it.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Very slow but got you there safely. The C27J complements the capabilities of the C130 and the C17 aircraft and has been widely welcomed by the Air Force. You mentioned the two additional C17s that we are purchasing. A competitive down-selection process to the C27J was made following exhaustive assessment by the Department of Defence and DMO, the Air Force, of information provided by manufacturers of the C27J and the C295 aircraft. An equal and same opportunity was given to Airbus Military and Alenia. The decision to acquire the C27J was made by the National Security Committee of cabinet and on the recommendation of the Department of Defence, the DMO and the Air Force, together with formal advice from central line agencies including Treasury and Finance. The response from Senator Johnston then was that there were merits in both C27 and C295 but at $1.4 billion the C27 would cost the taxpayer more than twice as much as the C295. That is untrue. The cost of the C27J and the C295 aircraft are roughly comparable.


What Senator Johnston fails to understand and acknowledge is that the $1.4 billion includes not only the acquisition cost of the aircraft but also the modifications to the aircraft for equipment needed for specific ADF roles, including initial logistics support, testing and certification. These costs would apply to any aircraft platform chosen, including the C295. Senator Johnston said, 'In the eyes of just about every other air force around the world the C295 is not only considered to be the best value for money but also the most effective battlefield airlifter.' Unfortunately, those are not views shared by the Chief of Air Force or the RAAF, who we take our advice from, not the shadow minister. It shows once again that there is a clear disarray in the opposition on defence policy.


In relation to your questions on the ARH and the MRH, there have been some issues around the flying hours for those aircraft. We have had difficulties with the development process but the ARH is now flying and will be supporting full training tasks almost as we speak. The MRH is still undergoing some issues and it will be a while before it will be—

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:54):  I am pleased that the member asked me that question, because it is important that we say very clearly what our policy is. The recreation leave policy for Australian Defence Force members is planned to change from 1 July 2012. The change was proposed to the government by the secretary and the CDF and was announced alongside the 2012-13 budget measures as part of a range of measures considered by defence as part of the Strategic Reform Program. Recreation leave travel was previously provided to single ADF members and consisted of annual Commonwealth funded return travel from the member's posting location to the location of their nominated next of kin. Defence has assessed that the policy is decreasing in relevance in the contemporary ADF and it should come as no surprise that Defence, as it should, continually assesses its personnel policies for relevance and appropriateness in order to implement and fund newer, better or more relevant policies in place of older, more outdated policies that needed review.


Major General Fogarty, head of People and Capability, said on 25 May that, unlike in previous years where single soldiers had to live on base, in the confined barracks environment, many members of the military are now based in communities outside the barracks, and that the benefit has become outdated. He said: 'It has become redundant, and the cost of travel within Australia is a totally different environment today to what it was 40 years ago.' The Chief of Defence Force also stated on 25 May that 'the free airfare for older single people was outdated' and that it was in place when he joined the Army 40 years ago, when salaries were low and airfares were very expensive from such places as Townsville. He said: 'The world has changed since that was introduced. You get cheaper airfares, communications are different and the town is not so isolated anymore.' And, importantly, of course, this measure will have no impact on single members who are posted to remote localities such as Darwin and Cairns, because they will still have an entitlement to remote locality leave travel. There will remain an entitlement of three trips a year for trainees and ADF members under the age of 21 will continue to get the entitlement.


Sometimes we make these decisions, and they are difficult decisions, but they need to be made. In this context it is very clear that we want to continue to continually monitor the entitlements that we provide to our Defence Force members. I am particularly pleased, frankly, that the overall package is such that it attracts such large numbers of people to our defence community. And whilst we have had retention issues previously—that is, people not wanting to leave; retention levels have been very good—we are seeing a bit of a change. I do not expect this particular policy item, this new change, to have any impact on our recruitment of new personnel.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The question is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to. Minister?




Mr SNOWDON:
  Sorry, can I just respond to the member for Blair. My apologies for not responding to you earlier. I will get you some more detail about the cost impacts on your community. I suspect they will be minimal. In fact, I got a bit of work done, which we are doing again at the moment, on what the investment has been in defence communities across the country over the last decade. I am trying to get it now for the current financial year, which will help you. When I have it, I will make it available to you. In terms of catafalque parties, that is a matter for the defence forces themselves.

I think it is a bit cute. We hear constantly in the parliament from the Leader of the Opposition and from all the shadow ministers—in a chorus, really—a negative tirade around what government is doing or not doing. They have rubbished the budget. They have a $70 billion black hole, but they cannot tell us, or will not tell us, whether or not they are committed to the $5.4 billion worth of savings in the defence budget. If you are not committed to these savings, you have an obligation to tell the Australian community what it is you are committed to. If you are not committed to these savings which we have identified, what do you intend to do? How will you fill the $70 billion black hole—to which, if you are not committed to these savings, we can add another $5.4 billion? You have an obligation not only to the Australian community but to the Australian Defence Force to tell them what your intention is. What we do know is that there is confusion, because there are different words coming out of the mouths of the shadow minister for defence and the shadow minister for defence science and personnel. I just say to them: get your act together. Ask the shadow Treasurer—although he will have a conflicting view, it is clear. He wants to buy the submarines from overseas, costing Australian workers' jobs.


We are committed in this budget to extending the purchases that we have outlined in terms of our capability development, and we have invested in excess of $200 million for the further development of the submarines, which we want built in Australia—12 of them, to be built in Adelaide. You would think we would hear from the opposition whether they are committed to that process or not. To this point, we have heard nothing apart from confusion and dissembling. Tell us the truth: are you committed to the $5.4 billion worth of savings we are proposing in this budget or not? If not, itemise which of these items you are not prepared to support and tell us where the savings are coming from.

 (Fadden) (11:02):  The minister asked what the coalition is committed to, and I am more than happy to respond. We are committed to the fair indexation of DFRDB and DFRB pensions. We took it to the 2010 election. In response to that, we then put a private member's bill in, which of course the Labor Party voted against. Then the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, recommitted the coalition a number of months ago at the Bendigo RSL to the position that we will index fairly—in the same way the age pension is indexed—the DFRDB and DFRB pensions. You asked what we are committed to, Minister. That is what we are committed to. My question to you, Minister, is: are you committed? You have asked for the coalition to say upfront right now what we are committed to, and I have just told you what we are going to do. We are committed to it. We will do it in the first year of an Abbott government. Minister, are you committed to the fair indexation of DFRDB and DFRB pensions? Will you commit right now in the House, as you have asked the opposition to do—today, now—to index the DFRDB and DFRB pensions in the same way as the age pension, as you led the veteran community to believe that you would do prior to the 2007 election?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:04):  I am happy to respond to your question, and I will. You cannot jump from the Defence portfolio, where we are identifying $5.4 billion worth of savings, and come at us when I ask you, 'What are you committed to?' with a measure which is going to cost another $175 million—or, in fact, $6.2 billion over time.




Mr Robert:
  Over how long?




Mr SNOWDON:
  Hang on. Not only are you going to expend this amount of money but you are also saying to me indirectly that you do not support the government's saving measures of $5.4 billion. If you do support them, tell us. Tell the Australian community what you support in defence expenditures.




Mr Robert:
  I just did.




Mr SNOWDON:
  All you have said is you do not support the leave travel entitlement. That is all you have said. That leaves another $5.4 billion, and you still have to find the $15 million to pay for it. There is an obligation on the opposition: come clean with the Australian community. Here is the opposition's opportunity to say to us whether or not it supports the government's direction on these savings in the defence budget of $5.4 billion. It is simple: yes or no. And if it does not support them then it should tell us where it is going to get the money from—simple. Not too hard. Very simple. Just do it.


In terms of the military superannuation, let me say to you that the opposition, as we have just heard, have said—and there may be something which they do not quite understand here—that they would index DFRB and DFRDB superannuation payments in the same way as the age pension. Keep that in your mind, Mr Deputy Speaker. The opposition want to equate a superannuation benefit payment for work with an income support. They are trying to equate superannuation—a benefit paid to an employee as a result of their working life—with an income support measure such as the age pension.


Let me go through some detail. Over the 11 years of the previous Howard government, what did they do on the question of the indexation of military superannuation? It is a simple question, and the answer is zero, nought, nothing. They put in place the Podger review to review superannuation. From memory the Podger review gave its report to the then government in March or April of 2007. The government did not release it; they just refused to release the report. They thought, 'Just do the report, give people an idea that we are actually going to try to do something but, in fact, do nothing.'


What we did was proceed to release the review and then go on and do more work, and we have come to the conclusion that it is not appropriate for us to index DFRB and DFRDB superannuation payments and treat them the same as the age pension. We know it is very costly. What is more, the opposition know they cannot afford it. Despite statements by the Leader of the Opposition, by the shadow minister for veterans affairs and by this shadow minister they know it cannot be afforded. Their former finance minister Nick Minchin said very recently that this claim to change indexation was:


… properly rejected by the Howard government, of which I was a member …


…   …   …


There is no inherent logic to the proposition that a public sector employment-related superannuation payment should be indexed in exactly the same fashion as a means-tested welfare benefit in this case, the age pension.


That was the Howard government's position. So what is the difference? All of a sudden we hear these guys telling us that it is appropriate to equate an employment related superannuation payment to the age pension.


Let me just explain what that might mean. (Extension of time granted) I want to give a few case examples so we can compare what it means to be on a military superannuation through DFRDB. A warrant officer who retired in 2010 after 35 years service is estimated to receive a payment without commutation of approximately $54,000 per year. If he or she decided to commute five times the annual payment—and 99.5 per cent of members have commuted the annual payment—then the lump sum would be around $270,000, in exchange for a reduced annual payment of some $40,000 per year. What we are being asked to do here is equate that superannuation payment to the age pension. Are you serious?


A colonel equivalent who retired in 2010 after 35 years service is estimated to receive a payment without commutation of approximately $78,000 per year. If he or she decided to commute five times the annual payment, then the lump sum would be around $390,000 in exchange for a reduced annual payment of some $59,000 per year. Again, are you serious? Are you seriously expecting us, this government, the community, to equate a superannuation payment of $59,000 per year, indexed to CPI, with the age pension? You might tell me what the logic is here. What is the logic of equating a superannuation payment of $59,000 per year to the age pension?


You know, as I know, that those people whose income falls below the threshold can get access, if they meet the appropriate service requirements, to the service pension at age 60 and to the age pension at age 65. Should any of these people, over time, find that their incomes have dropped or that they have made decisions around their lives which mean that their incomes have dropped, then they will get access to the age pension or the service pension, depending on their individual circumstances. I was not aware of this until recently but, in addition, since 1988, DFRDB members have been entitled to a nine per cent productivity benefit, which is available as a lump sum on retirement. So not only can they do the commutation but they also get a nine per cent lump sum productivity benefit on retirement.


The proposition we have before us from the opposition, being trounced around the country at every RSL conference I go to—




An honourable member interjecting—





Mr SNOWDON:
  It is very serious, and I tell the RSL people that we will not be doing it. I am upfront with them.




Mr Robert:
  So are we, and we'll be doing it.




Mr SNOWDON:
  But you are not upfront with the Australian community about how you are going to identify the savings to pay for it or how you are going to identify the savings to pay for the $5.4 billion worth of defence expenditure cuts which we have put into this budget. You have not explained that to us either. You have an obligation, when you go to these meetings, to be straight. The problem is that you are not. People are not silly. They are not going to be confused forever. There will come a day when they will ask you the vital questions and you will not be able to respond to them because you do not have an answer. It is very clear to me that, despite your protestations, in your heart of hearts and indeed, I bet, in the shadow finance minister's heart of hearts, the shadow Treasurer's heart of hearts and, I suspect, in the Leader of the Opposition's heart of hearts, you all agree with Senator Minchin. They agreed with him when they were in the Howard government as members of the cabinet and they agree with him today. Of that I have no doubt. It is just a proposition which is not sustainable.


I say to the opposition: I would think again. The only commitment we have received out of you this morning is a commitment not about what you are going to do about the $5.4 billion worth of defence savings but a commitment—two commitments really—on leave travel entitlements and superannuation indexation for the DFRDB recipients. That is it. I say to you that you need to do a lot more to tell the Australian community about what you intend to do in both the Defence portfolio and the Veterans' Affairs portfolio.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2012-05-31,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:14):  We have only made one commitment, and that is DFRDB indexation. We have made no comment upon defence travel, Minister. I will just update that for the record. On budget night, the minister made much of the government's $17.4 million package to respond to the findings of the Campbell Review of Military Compensation Arrangements. The review's recommendations were tabled by the minister in the House on Wednesday, 23 May. In that statement the minister indicated that 96 of the 108 recommendations were adopted. What he did not say was that the government has delayed the implementation of the major findings of the review until a later date, principally to save money.


In Senate estimates on Tuesday night, the Department of Veterans' Affairs confirmed that recommendations implementing compensation-offsetting reform and major changes to the review and appeal methodology have been delayed by a government decision not to spend any of the announced funding for a further two years. This means that a returned soldier, sailor or airman, or airwoman, will be forced to wait another two years for the government to implement findings fully endorsed by the ex-service community. Minister, why have these been delayed, why wasn't this announced earlier and what are the implications of this delay?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:15):  Further to the issue of superannuation, let me make it clear what the opposition has signed up to: $175 million over the forward estimates; a $1.7 billion fiscal cost over the forward estimates; and $6.2 billion in unfunded liabilities. Those opposite have not seen the connection, or are failing to recognise the connection, between this superannuation scheme and the scheme that other Commonwealth superannuation beneficiaries are on—that is, Commonwealth public servants. If there were to be a change to the indexation in the way in which the opposition subscribes to, as former Senator Minchin pointed out, there will inevitably be a flow-on to all Commonwealth public servants. The costs would be horrendous. It is something that I know the shadow minister for finance and the shadow Treasurer will have deep in their thoughts. This is a commitment that I do not think will be met.



Mr Robert interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  Mate, you have indicated to us that the only observation you have to make about the $5.4 billion saved in Defence is that you have no comment.




Mr Robert:
  This is consideration in detail of your appropriation bill.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Consideration in detail? The detail I want from you is: do you support them or not?




Mr Robert:
  Of your appropriation bill.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Do you support them or not? A very good question. He should just answer the question. Let me make some observations about MRCA, which you have just asked about. The opposition is in no position to criticise the government on our commitment to review MRCA, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which was a Labor Party 2007 election commitment. We have implemented 96 of the 108 recommendations. It is worth pointing out again that, like on the indexation issue, when the opposition were in government they refused to commit to any review of MRCA to ensure it was meeting the needs of our service men and women. They refused to do it. They did virtually nothing for the veterans community in 11 years of government, and their words are not backed up. Now, I am afraid, they are simply playing the politics of it.


Going to recommendation 22.2(a) on multiple-act compensation, this new methodology will apply to all future decisions on and from 1 July 2013. The majority of the veterans affected by the methodology will benefit financially from the new methodology being applied rather than the current one. Any veteran to whom the current methodology applies between now and 1 July 2013 may still benefit from the new methodology when their case is reviewed. The retrospective reviews will commence six months after 1 July 2013—that is, from January 2014. No-one will be disadvantaged by the reviews. Indeed, the majority are expected to benefit by a retrospective adjustment to their compensation for the MRCA accepted conditions. Where the new methodologies apply retrospectively and produce a lower outcome, the current methodology, the existing MRCA compensation, will continue.


The reviews will begin with the oldest case first. All cases since 1 July 2004 that have had the current methodology applied will be reviewed. DVA will identify the cases and actively review them. There will not be any need for the veteran to request a review. The number of retrospective reviews required to be done will not increase after 1 July 2013, because the new methodologies apply to new decisions from that date. As of 1 July 2013, there will be about 1,600 to 1,800 decisions to be reviewed. Many of these reviews, as one would expect, will be complex—they will involve multiple assessments dating to 1 July 2004. Each assessment will have to be recalculated using the new methodology, and it is expected that it will take 2½ years to review all cases. It is not expected that there will be any need for additional medical reviews to allow the new methodology to be applied. The government provided funding to DVA for the conduct of these assessments.


You have asked about the delays in implementation. I make it clear that considerable preparatory work is necessary before DVA can implement the accepted recommendations with an implementation date of 1 July 2013 or later. For some initiatives, system changes are required. There are 20 recommendations that require legislative amendment, instruments and determinations. Implementation of the 53 recommendations involving improvements to benefits systems or processes is a substantial body of work for the department.


On the issue of the single pathway through VRB, recommendations 17.1 and 17.2, the delay in implementation to 1 July 2014—another question that was asked by the shadow minister that was made clear in Senate estimates; I am not quite sure why you are asking the same question again—is to allow sufficient time for the detailed implications of the initiative to be worked through in consultation with all the stakeholders, including ex-service organisations, the legal profession, the Veterans' Review Board, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and others. The government has asked that further work be done and presented back to government in the 2014 budget, with a view to implementation from 1 July 2014. This is a significant and complex change associated with the appeals process. It is very important that enough time be allowed for consideration of all the issues so that the best possible process is available to those who need to have a primary decision review.


In its report the review identified a number of issues associated with the initiative that need to be resolved before implementation. It did not provide a solution to these issues. This work now needs to be done. It would not have been sensible to begin work until the government had made a decision in the 2012 budget to support recommendations 17.1 and 17.2. Do you want me to proceed with the advocacy model?




Mr Robert:
  It is already on the table at Senate estimates?




Mr SNOWDON:
  Yes, most of it is there, mate. That is why I am wondering why you are asking questions.

 (Makin) (11:22):  The defence sector is vital to South Australia, and it is particularly important to my electorate. The RAAF base is located just outside my electorate, so many RAAF personnel live within the electorate. Within my electorate there is also the Defence Teaming Centre, located at Mawson Lakes, where anywhere between 50 and 100 small businesses operate in conjunction with defence contracts that have been won—




Mr Robert:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance: this has now moved on to Veterans' Affairs. It is not a standing defence matter.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am listening to the question. I ask the member to make it relevant to Veterans' Affairs, but I believe we are discussing the portfolio under the banner of Defence.




Mr ZAPPIA:
  I would have thought that, whether it is Veterans' Affairs or Defence, the two matters are related. How you can separate the two is—




Mr Robert:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the appropriation bills have a separate appropriation line for Veterans' Affairs. Under the Federation Chamber list, Veterans' Affairs is a separate line.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am aware of that. I am listening to the member for Makin.




Mr ZAPPIA:
  As I was saying, the defence sector is absolutely vital to my part of the world. I am conscious that there are many industries, including the Techport operations, where the submarines are being built and where a number of Defence personnel are located and work. Over the last couple of years I have had many representations made by veterans and by those officers who have been deployed from Darwin to the RAAF base as part of the new battalion.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask the member for Makin to bring his point back to Veterans' Affairs. We are discussing Veterans' Affairs.




Mr ZAPPIA:
  My question to the minister is: in respect of those soldiers who have been relocated to the RAAF base, can you advise what steps are being taken to ensure that their families are being supported with the relocation and, in particular, what—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Member for Makin will resume his seat. The Member for Fadden on another point of order. 




Mr Robert:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, this an egregious abuse of appropriation—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Makin is talking about the families of those employees—

  Who are not veterans, Mr Deputy Speaker.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:25):  I am happy to respond to the member for Makin's question as it goes to the services we are providing on base for current serving veterans, including the veterans on bases in his community, and the continuum of care and the transitional pathway from the defence community to the veterans community, from uniform to out of uniform and into civilian life. And it is fair to ask the question because it is a very important part of what we are doing. I suggest to the shadow minister, if he is not aware of it—




Mr Robert:
  We are, and we support it.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Thank you. To inform the member for Makin, we have 35 on-base advisory service officers across the country. They are there to provide assistance to men and women in uniform who are currently serving personnel on what we can do for them: what their entitlements are; what they need to do if they are proposing to leave the Defence Force. We are also acutely aware of those people who have been wounded or are ill as a result of action or their service. We are most particularly aware of those people in rehabilitation and what we need to do to make sure that we maintain the requirements for them post their service life. This is all happening on bases around the country.


It is vitally important to the future of the Australian Defence community—to men and women in uniform—that we look after them not only while they are serving our nation overseas, but also when they come home and when they decide to relocate out of the Defence Force. I did some work on this and it is something that I think the shadow minister would be interested in; it is something I have been talking about at RSL conferences around the country. One of the issues for us is to make sure that we are not only supporting serving men and women and their families—which we are bound to do—but also to make sure that we look after those people who retire out of the Defence Force or move on or transition out. But we need to understand who they are.


You get the impression on some occasions that these people join up when they are 19 and stay for life—and of course that is not the case. The median age of the vast bulk of those people who enlist in the Australian Defence Force is around 20; the median age of them leaving the Defence Force is 27. These are not people who have DFRDB or any entitlement to superannuation; these are people in uniform who, the bulk of them, are leaving the Australian Defence Force by the time they are 27. They are the people I am most concerned about.


I know if you are in the Defence Force until you are 45 or 50 or 55, you are being looked after and your family is being looked after. But if you are a member of the Defence Force and you retire out of the Defence Force after two or three tours in Afghanistan, at age 25 or 26 or 27 or 28, then there is a real chance that you might disappear from us. We need to try to inculcate in these serving members the need to stay connected through the Defence Force associations and ex-service organisations such as the RSL so that we can make sure, should something go awry somewhere down the track, that we are looking after them. That is our commitment. I know it is a commitment that is shared by the opposition. Despite the differences we have, and I say this while the shadow minister for veterans' affairs adviser is here—he's a good bloke; he's all right—over issues such as DFRDB and DFRDB superannuation, we are aligned in making sure that we are supporting our veterans and our veterans' community. In conclusion, what I am concerned about is whether or not you support us, whether or not you support the government's proposed savings in this budget. At some time I expect you to tell us.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:30):  The budget finally delivers a funding blueprint for the centenary of Anzac. Whilst it is a long time coming, the government response to one particular initiative is of deep and growing concern. On 18 April the Prime Minister announced $6.5 million for the construction of the Anzac Interpretive Centre to ensure the new centre was up and running by November 2014. The Anzac centre is fully supported by the coalition and, I gather, by the government.


We are concerned the City of Albany has major reservations about the construction of the centre. In its council meeting of 15 May this year it passed a resolution calling for funding security. The council's minutes state that presently the cost estimates for the planning, design and construction of the centre, based on the scoping advice of consultants, is potentially $9 million plus. To date the only confirmed funding for the project is $6.55 million, leaving $5.8 million for construction. A quantity surveyor has estimated the cost of construction at $8 million. The council advises that the construction of this building, from a project management perspective, is a risk. The government funding appears to be $2 million short of what is needed for the Prime Minister's 18 April 2012 commitment to be sustained. We also learned on Tuesday night that the scoping study into the project is yet to be completed and the government's final commitment is based on an old estimate of construction costs. Minister, can you give the community of Albany any commitment that the city will not be left saddled with the cost of completing the Anzac Interpretive Centre?

I want to start on an issue that we have just been discussing in the main chamber, which is the 20th anniversary of the Mabo decision by the High Court. Given the Attorney's words in support of native title today, and given the significance of this anniversary, I am wondering how she can reconcile that with what the government has done in relation to refusing to fulfil the Commonwealth's obligation to fund 75 per cent of all native title compensation settlements. In my home state of Western Australia this is a very significant issue, as it would be for other state governments as well. It really is an enormous betrayal of Indigenous people all around the country. In light of this anniversary and in light of her stated support for native title, I am wondering how she can possibly reconcile this position.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:33):  I was going to ask a fairly similar question in relation to native title. I have a large Indigenous community in my electorate, in Ipswich and the Somerset region. In fact I have an Indigenous school, Hymba Yumba, a new prep to year 12 school. I was down there fairly recently talking about how it could develop. I was also visiting the USQ Indigenous Connections 2012 event for high school kids which took place in Indigenous communities across the whole of the western corridor, through Ipswich and the Somerset region and out towards Toowoomba. That was a good way for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to get pathways to undergraduate degrees. It was great talking to the young people there and seeing what their future goals and aspirations were.


Recently, on 2 March 2012, I addressed the Indigenous Lawyers Association of Queensland on where the government was at and how they could assist by mentoring young Indigenous people across Queensland. I know the president of that association, Josh Creamer. There was a profile of him in the Courier-Mail and he talked about the tabling of the Doing time report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which I chair. He works in native title and Josh and I have talked about this issue on a number of occasions. He talks about the challenges in relation to native title. Minister, I would like to ask a question in relation to this. I understand that back in 2008 it was estimated that, given the rate of resolution, it would take about 30 years to resolve the current and anticipated native title claims. In about 2009 I think the government made a number of reforms to actually promote a speedy resolution of those types of cases. I understand that in the budget there were some announcements in relation to institutional reform to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the judicial system, particularly native title claims. Can you provide information about that particular measure, the anticipated impact and the resolution of those claims? I am happy to relate that back to Josh and his organisation in Queensland.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (11:35):   I thank both members for those questions, and the member for Stirling's indulgence. I did understand the member for Blair was asking a question on a similar topic and thought it might be easiest to take both of them together. Absolutely, the government is confident that it can fully reconcile its support and recognition for the 20-year anniversary which comes this Sunday in celebration of the High Court decision in the Mabo case and then, of course, the Labor government's action to introduce the native title system—mind you we met with enormous opposition from those opposite. I did think that the very brief and fairly churlish comments in the House today indicated that some in the opposition still have an antipathy to native title. That is a shame, when 20 years on we can see that the system is working quite well.


What I think the member opposite is not recognising, and the question the member for Blair asked started to highlight, is that the government has made a decision in this budget which does provide some administrative savings by moving the Native Title Tribunal back into the Federal Court—keeping its own identity but being able to share all of its administrative backroom functions. That amount of money has been invested many, many times over in other Indigenous programs, which are also in this budget but which I have not yet been asked about—for example, the night patrols that are occurring across many communities in the Territory, and the investments in other justice programs which apply across all the country. The reason that this decision was taken is that we had a recommendation from the Skehill review looking at a range of matters in our courts. We had many, many representations from those involved in the native title system, and we have clear evidence in front of us that this system is working. We know how long it would take if we kept on the same trajectory that we were on—with the Native Title Tribunal itself estimating that the current cases could take at least another 30 years to be completed.


Some of the first steps that the previous attorney took have started to bear fruit. For example, in the 16-year period from when the Native Title Act came into force until the end of 2009-10, the Federal Court handed down 86 consent determinations. In just the year-and-a-half following some changes that our government introduced, 43 consent determinations were handed down. Even though this is early in the process, that is a rate five times higher than prior to the reforms that we instituted through the Native Title Amendment Act 2009. These decisions in the budget simply take that a step further. The 2009 amendments allowed the Federal Court to play a much more active role in the speedy determination of matters. This now will be able to be— 




Mr Keenan:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I am waiting to get a response from the Attorney-General to my actual question. She is over three minutes into her five-minute allocated time. I specifically did not ask about native title in general. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Dr Leigh
):  There is no point of order. The member for Stirling will resume his seat. This is consideration in detail; this is not questions without notice or questions on notice. The Attorney-General must speak to expenditure within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Attorney-General is doing that. 




Ms ROXON:
  And I am also addressing the actual budget initiative to which your question went, which was changes to the native title system. I am also going to the member for Blair's question, which I believe I am also entitled to answer. Those changes go directly to the system. If the member wants to ask questions on behalf of his Western Australian colleagues about matters that, 20 years ago, were put by a previous Labor government and rejected by a previous Liberal government, then so be it. Put those questions in question time. They are not a matter for the budget. They are rehashing and revisiting and trying to rewrite history. You need to go back and talk to the previous premier, Premier Court, about why he rejected those offers. 


What is before us at the moment in this budget is a strengthening of the native title system and an ability for us to speed up determinations for the benefit of both native title claimants and those who have interests in using the land in other ways. The government is very proud to be able to recognise this anniversary and improve the system of native title.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (11:40):  The nature of that response really was Orwellian. How the government, in what is the greatest betrayal of Indigenous Australians since the Mabo decision was made 20 years ago, can somehow spin that as being an advancement in native title is, quite frankly, Orwellian. We will move on though to other issues within the portfolio. 


I wanted to ask about the recent interceptions at Cocos Island of illegal boat arrivals, one on 15 May and then another yesterday on 30 May. As members would be aware, there is a limited Border Protection Command presence at Cocos Island, and I understand that these interceptions were made by a single AFP officer. The boats were respectively carrying 63 passengers in the first arrival and 40 passengers in the second arrival. I wanted to confirm when and how the AFP officers became aware of these particular illegal arrivals. Why was the AFP forced to undertake this task and not Border Protection Command, as is obviously appropriate? What risk assessment has been done for illegal arrivals coming to Cocos Island, both for the Australian officers involved and for the asylum seekers themselves? 


I assume this will be to the Minister for Home Affairs. I am not sure how you will be organising it. I wanted to ask whether he believes it is acceptable that the protection of Australian borders relies on a single AFP officer in a rigid inflatable boat, a RIB. Because this has happened on more than one occasion, I wanted to ask him how it was possible for two illegal boat arrivals to essentially just bump into Australian territory before being detected. What provisions have been made on Cocos Island for these continued illegal arrivals, including simple contingencies  such as food, accommodation and other needs? Where are the people being detained on Cocos Island and in what conditions are they being detained? Given that these two arrivals have come within the space of a fortnight and there have been reports of an upsurge in Tamil asylum seekers coming from Sri Lanka, what is the government doing in response to increase our border protection system at Cocos Island?

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:43):  I have some information for the member. If there is any additional information that he would like, I am happy to take that on notice and provide additional information. Just as was the case under the Howard government, boat arrivals at Cocos Island are rare. As was the case under the Howard government, the Australian Federal Police have responsibilities in relation to maritime patrol at Cocos Island, which is why they responded to this recent arrival. 


Appearing before estimates last week, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police said that AFP officers on Cocos Island had a responsibility to assist where they can and were trusted to make operational judgments. The AFP used that judgment and responded using rigid-hulled inflatable boats. The shadow minister made reference to rigid-hulled inflatable boats. I should make the point—it is an important point—that they are the same type of boat that was recommended in the WA coroner's recent report for use at Christmas Island. It is one recommendation that we have accepted and will implement. I think it is one that is supported by the shadow minister and by the shadow minister for immigration. I have had conversations with the shadow minister for immigration about that matter specifically. The AFP provides health and safety information and training to its employees. It provides AFP members with an understanding of potential health effects and the skills and knowledge that enable them to work safely. The Indian Ocean Territories Health Service services the community of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and is responsible for initial screening of irregular maritime arrivals. Border Protection Command provides services such as transferring IMAs from the jetty to Cocos airport for quarantine and health screening. Customs and Border Protection is working with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on arrangements to transfer the irregular maritime arrivals to Christmas Island, where they will undergo initial security and identity checks and their reason for travel will be established.


The shadow minister complained that this has happened more than once. I know that in his press release yesterday he said that it is disgraceful that this situation has been allowed to happen more than once. I should inform him that it happened more than once under the Howard government; it happened twice under the Howard government within a short period of time, so he should reflect upon that when making remarks like that. The Australian Federal Police had responsibility then at Cocos (Keeling) Island, as they do now.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (11:46):  My question is also to the Minister for Justice. As the minister would be aware, I am the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. Since 2009 the committee has been very interested in the application of unexplained wealth as a technique for targeting serious and organised crime. Unexplained wealth represents a relatively new form of criminal asset confiscation where serious and organised criminals who cannot account for their wealth could be held liable to forfeit it. The value of unexplained wealth provisions lies in its ability to undermine the business model of serious and organised crime. The effect is that it removes incentive for participation and puts in doubt the profits that could be otherwise recommitted into furthering other criminal endeavour.


Minister, my committee was very encouraged in 2009 after conducting an international review of unexplained wealth and made recommendations to the government which were agreed to. The Proceeds of Crime Act of 2002 was subsequently amended. But during the bill's rather tortuous passage through the parliament it was so amended that the resulting piece of legislation providing for unexplained wealth became, in our opinion, seriously unworkable—unworkable certainly to the extent of law enforcement. With these provisions being established, which was very much at the vanguard of attacking serious and organised crime, not one prosecution has been mounted since the passage of this legislation. My committee has more recently conducted a review of the legislation, which I know you are aware of. For the purpose of these proceedings, I would like you to explain why you believe it is absolutely essential that we have national unexplained wealth laws and how you see that combating serious and organised crime.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:44):  I thank the member for Fowler for the question and for his excellent report. The work that he and his committee did in the area of unexplained wealth is very important, and if we can get the support of the states and territories for some of the recommendations in that report to create a national unexplained wealth regime then its impact will be very significant. It will mean that we will seize more money off criminals, which will mean more money in the Proceeds of Crime Fund, which ultimately means more money for the budget, which is a good thing. As the member rightly points out, in March his committee released its report into its inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements. It recommended a national approach to unexplained wealth laws to make it more effective than the current regime. That ultimately would require the referral of powers from state and territory jurisdictions. By way of background, the federal government enacted its own unexplained wealth legislation in 2010. Some states and territories—WA, Northern Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia—also have unexplained wealth laws. As the committee's report points out, there are significant differences and limitations in the way the state laws operate. There are also significant constitutional limitations on what the Commonwealth laws can achieve. They can only be used for offences against the Commonwealth. I agree—and I know that the Attorney-General agrees—that there are improvements that can be made in this area.


That is why we have written to the states and territories asking them to refer us the constitutional powers we need to enact the national unexplained wealth laws. We did that in April. In April we raised the issue with the attorneys general across the nation, and we are looking forward to receiving a positive response from the states and territories to this request.


The advice from law enforcement and the findings of the parliamentary committee that the member chaired are clear: strong national unexplained wealth laws are a powerful way of attacking organised crime. National laws will help the federal government and the states and territories. National laws would give organised crime nowhere to hide their assets. Why is this important? It is important, as the member knows, because organised crime is ultimately driven by money, and because it costs the Australian economy more than $15 billion a year. Take away their profits and it reduces the incentive to commit crime. Organised criminals are more afraid of having their wealth seized than they are of spending time in jail. That is why we need these powerful unexplained wealth laws.


Another reason for these new laws is that it makes it easier for law enforcement to seize the assets of criminals. It effectively reverses the onus of proof. It means that people have to prove their wealth was obtained through legitimate sources rather than law enforcement being forced to prove that it was not. Over the past two years we have more than doubled the value of the assets seized, from about $18 million to more than $40 million. So far this year we have almost doubled it again, seizing $75 million. We are taking mansions, Lamborghinis, Ferraris, yachts and so forth, which takes away the incentive for criminals to commit crimes. Just like in the story of Al Capone, you can catch criminals by following the money.


The national laws that the member is talking about will help the federal government and all states and territories to crack down on serious organised crime. It means the Mr Bigs have to prove their wealth was obtained legally, which makes it easier to confiscate their assets. This makes it one of the most effective ways to tackle organised crime. That is why we will be pursuing this issue with the states and territories with a view to creating national laws. To tackle organised crime we have to hit criminals on the street and at the border, but we also have to do it at the hip pocket. These new laws will help to hit criminals where it really hurts—in their hip pocket.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (11:52):   This question will also be to the Minister for Home Affairs. It is in relation to cargo screening. In relation to the budget cuts, from previous budgets, of $58.1 million and the fact that air cargo is going to increase by almost 45 per cent over the forward estimates in this budget, I am wondering if the minister can inform the House what percentage of air and sea cargo is screened and what percentage is physically examined. Has the reduction in air cargo screening resulted in more illegal contraband being smuggled undetected through customs? Referring to the Attorney's media statement this morning on tobacco smuggling, will the minister be able to outline whether this measure will come with additional funding for Customs to screen cargo so they can stop illegal tobacco being smuggled through our borders?


Given that on 14 March a report from the New South Wales Police on the investigation into weapons smuggling undertaken by a criminal syndicate through the Sylvania Waters Post Office highlighted that 220 Glock pistols had been illegally imported into our country by the air mail undetected by Customs, can the minister explain how and why weapons components were able to be imported into Australia in this case and evade the detection of Customs? Can the minister also confirm whether the $4½ million in funding that the government has committed to Task Force Polaris is additional funding, or are the agencies involved expected to find this money in their existing budgets? If that is additional funding, could he point out where in the budget that funding is to be found?

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:54):  I thank the member for his question. I might do it in reverse order. The $4½ million for Polaris is money that has been already allocated to Polaris through the proceeds of crime fund. It is money that was allocated before I became the Minister for Home Affairs. In relation to the weapons that were seized in March, this question gives me the opportunity to provide the member with some additional information which I am sure he is not currently aware of. He would not be aware that in July and in August of last year, Customs seized a number of Glock parts and magazines. The person that was importing those weapon parts had an authorisation for an import permit given to them by the New South Wales police. Customs advised the New South Wales police and they subsequently cancelled the authorisation. Customs and the police then executed search warrants and arrested the man and the matter is now before the courts. I cannot provide to the House additional information on this at this time because it is before the courts, but I ask the shadow minister to reflect very seriously and very carefully on the information that I have just provided.


In relation to the seizure of firearms on 12 April by the New South Wales police, I have got some more information which may be of interest to the House. When they seized the weapons they found information at the scenes in Port Macquarie and in Sydney that indicated that firearms had been illegally imported. The police then provided this information to Customs. Customs have examined the documents and they have advised me that the weapons linked to these documents were indeed illegally imported. These were AR15 semi-automatic military style rifles. The advice of Customs is that indeed the weapons that were linked to these documents were illegally imported. They were illegally imported under the Howard government. So it is to put that information into perspective when understanding this issue. This was at a time when 100 per cent of international mail was X-rayed. It shows the limitations of X-raying. In both these cases of the Glocks and military rifles, X-raying was done. That is why I have said that finding metal gun parts in a box of metal machinery is very difficult. You need to know what you are looking for. That is why I asked for advice from law enforcement agencies. Their advice was that intelligence is the key to seizing drugs or to seizing guns. That is proven by the facts.


The shadow minister asked me about air cargo. I have got for him the following information that he might find instructive. In 2007, the last year of the Howard government, Customs inspected six million air parcels and detected 870 parcels that contained drugs or other prohibited items. In 2011, Customs inspected 1½ million parcels and, by using profiling and intelligence to target the right parcels, they seized 1,741 parcels containing drugs or other prohibited items. In other words, Customs are now seizing double what they were in air cargo under the Howard government. They are seizing double the amount of illegal goods that they were when the member was in government, and that is because of the use of intelligence and targeting. The more intelligence that law enforcement agencies have the more drugs and the more guns they seize, whether it is on the street or at the border. That is why I then asked officials that report to me whether in the budget we should be increasing investment in screening, as the shadow minister proposes, or investing in intelligence. They all said we should be investing in intelligence. That is why I have established an intelligence and targeting team inside Customs, because that is the way to seize guns. It is the same model that we have applied to drugs and it comes with a Customs officer who is now embedded inside the New South Wales Police Force, and the advice to me is that is a model that we should be implementing, not just there but across the country. It is about information sharing and agencies working more closely together. It is also why in the budget you see money allocated to a forensics facility for the Australian Federal Police. That will get involved in things like firearm tracing and so forth. The approach that I have taken here is to listen to the facts and listen to the experts, and I encourage the shadow minister to do the same.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (11:59):  I want to briefly address the question that was directed to me on the changes to the penalties for tobacco smuggling. We are, of course, concerned when any illicit product is coming across our borders. I need to put on the record that we do not share the view that the tobacco industry has that this is a huge problem in Australia, but any amount of illegal product coming in is obviously a concern. It is a concern both on the health front because people smoke this product and because it is essentially defrauding Australian taxpayers of money that would otherwise be paid as excise to the government and be provided for in the budget.


These offences have not had their penalties updated for a long time. They are not commensurate with other offences of fraud against the Commonwealth. That is why the announcement has been made today, on World No Tobacco Day. The question went directly to whether or not there are any additional resources being provided. No, there are not for this particular initiative. The same work that is done in detecting illicit tobacco will continue but we will be able to enforce a much stricter regime and harsher penalties, including that those involved in this illicit trade could end up in jail for up to 10 years. It is about having a proper disincentive and us tackling tobacco across all fronts.

I have been through Customs warehouses and they all smell of tobacco as you go through. There was mention of the report that had been prepared. It was paid for by the tobacco industry but it was done by an independent body. If the Attorney does not believe the scope of the activity as outlined within that report then would she care to outline to the House how serious she believes this problem is. How serious is this crime in Australia and what are the costs to the Australian community? If they do differ from what is contained in that report, could she let us know how.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (12:01):  Certainly, I am happy to provide that. I do not have the table in front of me, but I can provide the details that have been made public in the past—and we are happy to make them public—of Customs seizures. They do continue to identify tobacco that is being brought illegally into Australia and we, of course, prosecute people for doing that. The changes that have been announced go to what penalties apply when that happens.


There has been a longstanding dispute between the industry and the government about the extent of this problem. It may well be a dispute that is inevitably going to continue. By its nature, illicit trade means that you cannot always perfectly measure how much is being brought in, but we have a range of different things for measuring it. We have Customs material and household drug surveys. All of them show a far smaller incidence of this than the tobacco industry's own reports. I have said on the record many times before, and I am not ashamed to say it again, that the tobacco industry do not have a good record when it comes to the way they use data and research. In fact, they have a shameful record. So it is fair enough, I think, for me, the government and the public to take with a grain of salt this sort of data that they rely on.


Nevertheless, this change that was announced today, which does not have a separate provision in the budget, is something that the tobacco industry themselves have been calling for. It is in their interests and in the Commonwealth's interests to make sure that, if tobacco is going to be bought and consumed in Australia, the proper taxes are paid and that the proper health warnings are in place. Our government is determined to do everything it can to reduce the number of people who want to participate in that activity.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (12:03):  We know that Australia is, generally speaking, a wonderful place for most children. But—while the majority of kids who are lucky enough to grow up in Australia benefit from the high quality of our health and education systems and from the opportunities that exist in a free, safe and democratic society—it must be acknowledged that kids within certain demographics face very different prospects indeed. It is in recognition of that fact that I join with UNICEF and the Australian children's coalition of organisations in welcoming the government's announcement of the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner.


As the chair of the UNICEF parliamentary association, this gives me particular satisfaction and I was glad to move a successful motion at the ALP national conference last year on this issue, while noting that the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner has been a longstanding commitment of the Labor Party and the Attorney-General herself. In addition, as a former UN staff member, someone with a keen interest in human rights and a member of the newly established Joint Committee on Human Rights, it is wonderful to see the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner, which responds to the specific recommendation of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that a national human rights institution include within its structure an identifiable commissioner specifically for children's rights. The creation of a National Children's Commissioner is not before time, and it is vital to driving efforts to establish a level playing field for all Australia's children.


To give you an idea of the challenges and obstacles that our most vulnerable children face, I refer to the Listen to children report published by the Australian Child Rights Taskforce last year. It found, for instance, that if you were born into an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander family you were three times more likely than other Australians to die before reaching adulthood. You are also 24 times more likely to be in jail before you turn 17 and almost 10 times more likely to be in out-of-home care. It found that, of the 105,000 homeless people in Australia, 50,000 are under the age of 24, and our out-of-home care system established to look after our most vulnerable children is not in good repair. Children in out-of-home care have increased by 51.5 per cent since 2005. We are not sure why this is happening in Australia, because Australia collects no comprehensive data on these children.


The children in these categories remain underacknowledged and let down by our current policies and public services, and it is for them that a National Children's Commissioner will be of most significance. An appropriately resourced National Children's Commissioner will give Australian kids a voice at the national level and bring attention to issues of neglect, abuse and discrimination. An effectively resourced national advocate for children will offer a powerful focus for hearing children's voices, especially on the subjects of youth justice, child protection, Indigenous health outcomes and homelessness.


The commissioner will have an important role in monitoring, reviewing and commenting on laws, policies, services standards and practices that affect young Australians. As part of the Australian Human Rights Commission, such a position will have the mechanisms to receive and investigate complaints of breaches of children's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child through the implementation of child-specific complaints system. It will be able to assist in and drive law reform and policy development and develop consultation mechanisms that encourage the participation of children. An effective commissioner will collaborate and coordinate with the community and business sectors to develop and strengthen community understanding of the issues and experiences of children, and have the power to intervene in court proceedings involving the rights of children and young people.


The commissioner must advocate for effective data collection on children's health, wellbeing, development and participation and, of course, all of these tasks and functions will depend on appropriate resources. In the past there have been too many instances where a lack of coordinated response by governments and their departments have allowed children and young people to suffer. Youth homelessness and the health and education of Indigenous young people are two obvious examples. We really need bipartisan support for the role of National Children's Commissioner to ensure that the outcomes for children are effective. The commissioner will, of course, have guaranteed independence from government and it should be a matter of common ground to support a properly resourced commission.


This is a welcome and exciting announcement, but the hard work of implementation is ahead of us. My question, then, to the Attorney-General is: how is this budget set up to put the needs of Australian kids front and centre of the development of government policies and programs now and into the future?

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (12:08):  I thank the member for Freemantle for her question on something that she has passionately advocated for throughout her professional career and for which she was most recently able to make a change to the Labor Party platform—something that we are now acting on in this budget.


As the member mentioned, it is something that I also have a strong and long personal attachment to from my position as the shadow minister for children and youth many years ago. More than 10 years ago, in fact, we first announced a policy proposing a National Children's Commissioner, and it gives me great pleasure that, in the budget, we have now dedicated finances to be able to make this a reality. It is an unusual situation to have an extra, separate budget line item rather than simply an increase to the Human Rights Commission's budget. That is because we are conscious of the issues that the member has raised: to make sure that we have sufficient resources and dedicated resources. I know the commission is very excited about this additional formal responsibility being added to its remit.


We have proposed the legislation that will be able to establish this, and though we have not yet had an indication we hope that we will have an indication of support from the opposition. We will make it clear that a National Children's Commissioner has certain responsibilities and does not have others. Those certain responsibilities are to make sure that there is a particular focus on those who, as the member for Fremantle has mentioned, are vulnerable and disadvantaged. Many, many children in Australia have wonderful lives. When you look around the world, Australia is one of the best countries for a child to be born in; however, there are children in Australia who do not get the benefits of that. This commissioner will have particular responsibilities to make sure that those disadvantaged groups in particular are focused on.


I also flag that, unlike other proposals that have been floating around—for example, the proposal by the Greens party—our proposal is that the commissioner will not have a complaint-handling role dealing with individual children, nor will the commissioner take on child protection matters or family law matters for individuals, nor act as a legal guardian. It is important to emphasise that there are other bodies that fulfil those roles. We want this to be an opportunity to advocate for systematic reforms and improvements for children across disadvantaged groups. It is very important that we match the responsibilities to the resources available. An undertaking which required the National Children's Commissioner take on those additional roles would, of course, need to be resourced well above the current proposal, and would duplicate many of the responsibilities for children that lie with other agencies.


I am very excited that this is in the budget. I think it is an important step forward for children. I look forward to having an indication—hopefully sometime soon—from the opposition that is something that they will support. There will, of course, be a debate in the parliament when the legislation is introduced and, after that, an opportunity for us to recruit and employ the first ever National Children's Commissioner.

 (Stirling) (12:13):  I want to ask the Minister for Home Affairs about the process of issuing media releases and informing the Australian public about illegal boat arrivals.


My colleague in the other place Senator Abetz asked some questions about this during the estimates process and we did get some very comprehensive information back from the government. That information told us that Customs reports a boat arrival to the minister's office within about six hours, on average, and that the average time it took the minister's office to issue a publicity release was just over 15 hours—about double that time.


I want the minister to inform the House about how this process works. Has Customs ever formally requested that the minister's office not issue a public media release until the boat has been intercepted, or is it up to the minister's office as to when this release is issued?


According to information that we have been provided with, there have been at least 10 instances where there was a delay of two to four days before informing the public about a boat arrival. I want an explanation as to why that would happen.


I also want him to explain the process of issuing of a media release in relation to the detection of illegal boat arrivals: Once detected, who informs the minister's office? Who is notified? What is the chain of communication and, ultimately, who gives final approval for the release? Is it the minister who gives this final approval?

My office is informed when Border Protection Command are aware of a boat. The release is not issued until the boat has been intercepted and the information in that release can be confirmed. From time to time, we will be told that a boat has been detected, and that from the air it can be determined that there might be 30 or 40 people on the boat, but the release is not issued until an interception has occurred and we can confirm those numbers to provide the information that you receive in the press release. That is, I think, the appropriate course of action to make sure that the information that is provided to you and to the media is as accurate as it could possibly be.


You asked who ultimately approves the release—me. It is my name at the top and it is my obligation to make sure that the information is accurate. I cannot speak for previous ministers, but I am assuming that that is the practice that they adopted in the past: to make sure that a statement is issued only once the boat has been intercepted and all of that information can be properly and accurately provided.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (12:14):  Again, my question is to the Minister for Justice. I know the minister is very familiar with my electorate, having himself grown up there. In fact, his mother and father are still constituents of mine; hopefully happy constituents. Apart from being the most multicultural electorate in the whole country, one of the things that really distinguishes my electorate is the number of families. The minister will no doubt recall some 12 years ago areas at the centre of my electorate, particularly around Cabramatta, were very much the destination or the distribution points for drugs and illegal firearms. As a matter of fact, the communities were terrorised in those days by organised crime gangs as they ran these illegal operations around the streets of south-west Sydney. 


It is very concerning that of the 24 shootings that have occurred this year, the vast majority of those have occurred in Western Sydney—a number of them in my electorate and, indeed, in the minister's electorate. I know that this is putting extraordinary pressure on local families. Many think there has got to be a greater police presence. Our police are doing a wonderful job on the streets of south-west Sydney. I personally stay in regular contact with the commanders of the Green Valley police, Cabramatta police, Fairfield police and the Liverpool police. I have a fair understanding about what our police are doing out there. I am wondering whether the minister could outline to the House how these weapons are coming onto our streets? The fact is that there have been 24 shootings and it is having such an effect on local families, who want to bring up their children in safety. Having these headlines appear out there is something which is certainly deleterious for the whole community. Minister, if you would outline to the House your view about where these weapons are coming from?

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (12:17):  I thank the member for Fowler for his question and his interest in this matter.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitti
ng suspended from 12:17 to 12:31





Mr CLARE:
  Once again I thank the member for Fowler for his question. We both have seats, and live, in Western Sydney. We see this up close and understand the impact it is having on our constituents. What is happening, effectively, is a war between rival bikie gangs fighting over drugs and turf, and our communities are in the middle of that fight. There is a real concern, a justified concern, that a stray bullet is going to hit an innocent person and that an innocent person could be killed. That is why in February I ordered a national investigation, headed up by the Australian Crime Commission, into the illegal firearms market. Last month they provided their interim findings, which show that there is a very large local black market made up of tens and tens of thousands of illegal firearms—more than 10,000 illegal handguns alone. A lot of these guns are 10, 20 or 30 years old and they do not have a use-by date. Two of the guns that have been seized in the last year were more than 100 years old and are still working.


This black market is made up of firearms that criminals get from crooked dealers, firearms that were not surrendered or registered after the Port Arthur massacre, firearms that are made or reactivated by backyard operators and thousands of firearms stolen from legitimate owners. In New South Wales alone, 7,000 guns have been stolen by criminals in the last 12 years and not recovered. That is 7,000 unsolved gun crimes and 7,000 guns in the hands of criminals. We saw evidence of this on Channel 7's news recently, a report that contained information from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research in New South Wales. The report revealed a nearly 20 per cent jump in the number of firearms stolen in New South Wales alone in the past 12 months—640 firearms stolen in the past year, most of them in Western Sydney, including 112 pistols, 56 revolvers and 339 shotguns. There were 1,706 firearms stolen in New South Wales in the past three years and, across the country, more than 7,000 firearms have been stolen in the last five years. The most recent example of this came just yesterday. New South Wales police reported eight pistols and eight rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition, stolen from a property near Baradine in the electorate of the member for Parkes. We also face the problem of firearms disappearing from state databases when people move interstate or die. The advice of CrimTrac is that about 1,400 weapons a year fall off the register and into the grey market.


The final report of the Australian Crime Commission will be considered by police ministers next month. At that meeting we will consider a raft of recommendations covering firearms, criminal reforms and other areas. Australia already has some of the toughest gun laws in the world, but there are a number of areas where we can improve upon them. I am working very closely with Mike Gallacher, the New South Wales police minister, on developing a plan to take to this meeting in four weeks time which includes the rollout of the IBIS system right across the country. IBIS does ballistics analysis of firearms that are seized from criminals. It is the sort of testing that can link firearms to previous crimes. At the moment New South Wales and the Federal Police have the system, but it does not exist across the rest of the country. I believe, and Mike Gallacher believes, in the need to roll it out nationwide. There is a lot more we need to do. Police need intelligence on who the shooters are, where the weapons are and what they are being used for. That means breaking down the wall of silence, the fear that exists in our communities of dobbing somebody in, the fear of retribution. It means making weapons harder to steal and easier for them to be seized by law enforcement. It also means tougher firearms laws and the rollout across the country of tracing technology like IBIS. Delivering these reforms will require us to all work together, and I am determined to get it done. Over the next few weeks, I will be travelling the country and meeting with police ministers to make sure that we deliver the reforms that we have to when we meet in June. That is what the people of Western Sydney expect of us and that is what we must deliver.


Proposed expenditure agreed to.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Minister, are you happy to answer one question at a time?




Mr Snowdon:
  Why not ask a series of them and then I will respond to them?




Mr ROBERT:
  I am happy to do that. Minister, the budget reveals cuts of $1.6 billion in equipment acquisitions in the Defence Capability Plan. Can you outline—or, if you cannot, can you take it on notice—what these cuts are, the strategic rationale for those cuts, why those and not others, and what the impact of those cuts will be? Likewise, there is $1.3 billion in cuts from the approved major capital acquisition program. Again, what are the cuts, what was the strategic rationale for those as opposed to others and what will the impact be? There is $400 million that has been taken from ADF housing over the forward estimates. Can you outline exactly where those cuts are coming from and the impact in terms of housing? There is $1.2 billion in cuts from the major capital facilities program. Again, what are these cuts and what impact will these cuts have on personnel?

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:05):  I have a question to the minister, but I will make a few comments first. The commitment by the government to commit 12 future submarines to be assembled in South Australia is welcome news for my local constituents. I have to commend the former Premier, Mike Rann, and Kevin Foley, the former defence industries minister, for having the foresight to make South Australia a defence state. It is their foresight that has led to a situation where in South Australia we clearly have—I will let the minister and the Federation Chamber know—the capacity to complete this project. As a very proud South Australian I say that there have been a lot of defence projects which have been very successfully delivered in South Australia and that this one will be no exception.


I was also very pleased with the government's recent decision, which was announced in May, to commit $214 million on the first stage of the Future Submarine Project. This was certainly welcome news. There has been discussion about this for a long time, and it was very pleasing for my local electorate to be given the certainty about it from this government. Unfortunately, no such commitment has been made by the opposition. I know it is not the member on the other side; I know he would love to build the submarines in South Australia. Unfortunately, the member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition will not commit to that. That is very concerning and, I think, does put some uncertainty in the project.


From the government's point of view I am pleased to see that there is the commitment for this. It builds on, I note, the 2009 white paper, which outlined the government's commitment to acquire 12 new future submarines to be assembled in South Australia. I am very pleased that that commitment has been forthcoming with the announcement of the first stage. I think that is really important.


The opportunity for South Australia in this project cannot be underestimated. Discussions I have had with the defence industry and with the minister indicate that we are talking about not 10 years or 20 years of investment and economic activity as a result of this project in South Australia but 50 years to 100 years of exciting economic activity.


We have seen with the air warfare destroyer project that certainly South Australia has the capacity in Techport to be able to bring expertise together to deliver on defence projects. In terms of bringing industry together, I think that area in Port Adelaide has really come of age and is ready to deliver. They are very pleased, and, in the conversations that I have had, people have welcomed this commitment by the government.


It is very concerning that the opposition will not commit to this project. It is very concerning that we do not have bipartisan support for it. That fact does cause a lot of uncertainty for people in South Australia and for businesses in South Australia.



Mr Robert interjecting—




Ms RISHWORTH:
  I would call on the opposition to look at it very carefully. As I said, I know the member on the other side's commitment. It is a pity that the member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition do not share his commitment to this. It is very concerning. It would be good if the opposition could come on board with us and make it bipartisan. Certainly that is what people in South Australia want. Unfortunately this is symptomatic of the opposition's neglecting South Australia. Whether on water, on defence spending or on Holdens, really what the opposition leader has been clearly saying to South Australians is that he has no interest in them. But back to the issue at hand. My question to the minister is: can the minister update the chamber on the government's commitment to the future submarine capacity?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  I will call on the member to deal with those questions thus far. I thought we had an outbreak of peace, for a while. But the minister has the call anyway on the questions from the member for Fadden and the member for Kingston.



Honourable members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call and he will be heard in silence. It is a very important portfolio, and I will ask those in the Federation Chamber to hear the minister's answer in silence.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:10):  Let me first go to the general issues which were raised and the specific questions which were raised by the shadow minister. Obviously the decisions were made in the budget process through the ERC process in a timely fashion prior to the budget. As he rightly pointed out, there is $4.45 million worth of savings across the forward estimates, including a contribution of $971 million in 2012-13.


I do want to make a couple of points just so that we understand the nature of these cuts. The contribution will have no adverse effect on operations in Afghanistan, East Timor or the Solomons, and I think that is commonly understood. It will not have any impact on the provision of defence equipment, defence personnel and operations. They will not be adversely affected, as you would expect. There will be no adverse impact on the number of ADF personnel engaged within the services. What we are doing is looking at the impacts of some of the reform—the strategically reform processes—and making sure that the impacts on entitlements to ADF personnel are being minimised. I understand that would be an issue which you will probably raise. I am happy to talk about that in more detail later.


I think I need to make the observation and the point that there has been no fundamental change to our defence budget from a strategic perspective. That is vitally important if we are to understand where we are going here. In 2009-10, the budget for the government for the first time was over $100 million for defence. That was across the forward estimates. In the 2011-12 portfolio additional estimates, the defence budget across the four-year forward estimates period was $103.4 billion. The budget this year is $103.3 billion. This level of funding will maintain Australia's status in the top 15 nations in the world of defence expenditure. We will continue to be the second on the list of military expenditure per capita, with only the United States spending more. So we need to understand that perspective.


The opposition spokesman has asked me about savings through the Defence Capability Plan since the 2009 white paper. I just want to preface this. I do not necessarily want to have a political dialogue which is about animus, but I do still want to make a couple of observations. This is a $5.4 billion save over the forward estimates. It is for a particular reason which is well known to the parliament and the people of Australia: to get us into surplus. We were asked to make a contribution. We are making a contribution, but the significant question—and this is something which I know the opposition spokesperson will take on board, and I would like to think he could tell us what is happening—is: are the opposition committed to these savings? The real question, apart from the dialogue we will have about the capability development plan, is whether or not the opposition are committed to these sort of savings—or are they going to say they are not going to proceed? If they are going to say that, they have got to tell us where the money is coming from. We already know there is a $70 billion black hole. What they need to be able to tell us now is: if they do not want to support these savings measures, where will the money come from? It is a very simple but very important question which needs to be asked. Let me go to the issue of the Defence Capability Plan.


There were 180 capability projects in the 2009-2019 defence capability plan that underpin the 2009 defence white paper. Fewer than 10 projects have been scrapped as a result of revisions to the DCP. The vast majority remain in the program today. (Extension of time granted) Since the 2009 white paper, government has approved over 100 first or second pass and other approvals, including studies, risk reduction activities, capability technology demonstrations and project development funding with a total value of nearly $13.5 billion. This includes the first 14 Joint Strike Fighters, 24 naval combat helicopters, over 900 additional G-wagon trucks, seven CH-47F new Chinook helicopters and two more D model Chinooks, military satellite capabilities, counter IED equipment and systems, new 155 millimetre towed artillery systems, and communication equipment. In 2011 the government made a record 49 approvals of capability projects. The previous record was 37, in 2006. The government has also allocated funding for essential new capabilities not envisaged in the 2009 defence white paper, including the new amphibious heavy lift ship HMAS Choules and the interim humanitarian disaster relief ship MSV Skandie Bergen, two additional C17 heavy lift aircraft for a total of six, and 101 more bushmasters with further orders likely. We remain committed through this budget, and this is apparent in the budget papers, to the core capabilities as outlined in the 2009 defence white paper, including 12 future submarines—I will come to those more specifically in a moment—the Joint Strike Fighter and the replacement for the caribou aircraft.


I will respond to my colleague's questions about the submarines. Earlier this month the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, and the Minister for Defence Materiel, Jason Clare, announced that the government would provide $214 million—and I am sure this will be supported by the opposition—for the next stage of the future submarine project. The funding will go towards further detailed studies and analysis to inform the government's decision on the design of Australia's next submarine. The future submarine project is the biggest and most complex defence project Australia has ever embarked upon. It means work for hundreds of Australian companies and thousands of Australian workers, including boilermakers, welders, electricians, naval architects, engineers and many more.


I have a question again for the opposition. Are they committed to this project? Are they committed to having these vessels built in Australia? We know that the shadow treasurer on Channel 7 during the week of the budget said that they want to see what the benefit is in building the submarines here in Australia rather than getting cheaper versions from overseas. I think it is quite important that we understand, through this discussion we are having here, what the government is committed to and what the opposition is committed to. We have announced these savings, which are big, but at the same time we have made our commitment to the future development of Australian defence capability—including submarines—very clear. Clearly we want to see them built here in Australia, and we have maintained our commitment all along. I ask the opposition, if they can, to tell us what their position is.


The member asked me about defence housing. I would like him to tell us where that has come from. Are you talking about Defence Housing Australia, not the housing for single people that we are providing on bases—




Mr Robert:
 Not for single people. The forward estimates for DHA.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Okay. I will come back to you with an answer on that.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:19):  Minister, can you spell out the total value of absorbed measures that Defence is being required to take on, apart from the $5.4 billion in cuts? 


Can you actually spell out exactly what programs, infrastructure or projects those absorbed measures relate to. As the most recent ASPI Cost of defence notes, the SRP is failing to meet its savings objectives in 2010-11. Could you outline why this is the case—why they are not meeting the requirements for savings. Can you also outline what the projected savings are from the SRP over the remaining life of this program. Where will they come from? Can you continue to guarantee that those savings will be reinvested in Defence. In terms of industry, Minister, has your ministry or your ministerial colleagues consulted industry regarding the latest budget cuts? Has any modelling been done on the impacts of these cuts on the industry's capacity to respond to both the downturn in work and the supposed ramp-up of work in two or three years time?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:20):  I will just go to the question of the ASPI paper, which has been referred to by the shadow minister. Let us be very clear: the defence appropriation for 2012-13 is $24.2 billion. In the 2009-10 budget, the government for the first time budgeted over $100 billion for defence across the forward estimates. In this budget, the government has again budgeted over $100 billion for defence across the forward estimates. This includes $21 billion in total capital investment. The level of funding is expected to maintain Australia's status, as I referred to earlier, as number 13 in defence expenditure. I referred also to our per capita contribution, which is second only to the United States. In real dollar terms, we spend far more than any regional neighbour. Also, with the appreciation of the foreign exchange rate, we have been able to purchase the same equipment from overseas for less. Thus, whilst announced savings will be difficult, the defence budget—as you well know—remains at historically high levels. Reprioritisation with defence expenditure has been designed to have minimum impact on the delivery of core defence capabilities.


I note that the opposition seems to support the views expressed in the ASPI paper, which asserts that the government has manifestly placed a higher priority on delivering a surplus than on delivering a stronger Defence Force. It is not an either-or situation. The government remains committed to delivering the core capabilities identified in the 2009 white paper and to delivering one of the most capable defence forces in our region, but global and domestic economic circumstances have changed significantly since that white paper, which I am sure is well understood by the shadow minister but perhaps not so well understood by some of his colleagues.


The effects of the global financial crisis have continued to unfold with unexpected severity and duration since the 2009 defence white paper. In response to this, as we have maintained from the get-go, this government is committed to bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. As was made clear before the budget, Defence had to expect to make a contribution. That contribution has been made. The reprioritisation of defence expenditure has been designed to have a minimum impact on the delivery of core defence capabilities.


Another part of that ASPI report says that clearly it is the government's priority for defence that has fallen rather than its absolute ability to pay. That is simply not the case. The 2009 defence white paper noted that the global financial crisis was the most serious global economic and financial crisis in decades and that its strategic impacts were still unfolding. Since the GFC has continued to have a significant impact on the global economy, following the GFC the defence forces of major developed countries have increased efficiencies and reduced their budgets, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Of course, the other NATO nations in Western Europe have had significant impacts upon their defence budgets. Australia's 2009 defence white paper was completed before the unfolding of these events and the financial circumstances clearly represent a real challenge to the 2013 white paper. In terms of core capabilities, there are some 180 capability projects in the 2009-10 Defence Capability Plan that underpin the 2009 white paper. As I said previously, the vast majority of these remain, with 10 being removed. Most of those 10 have either had their scope reduced or were subsumed by other, related projects or replaced by newer technologies. I said before our commitments in this budget are for the first 14 Joint Strike Fighters, 24 new Navy helicopters, 900 additional G-Wagen trucks, additional Chinooks, military satellite capabilities, counter-IED equipment assistance, towed artillery systems and, of course, communication equipment. In 2011 the government approved a record 49 capability projects. The previous record was 37 in 2006. (Time expired)

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:26):  The decisions the opposition is requesting have been taken to address changes that have occurred in the department's resources position over the last year which include a range of new cost pressures across the portfolio, including the following priority areas for investment: $700 million for additional investment in Collins-class submarine sustainment, $550 million for information technology remediation activities across Defence, $400 million for improved housing for Australian Defence Force personnel, $330 million for relocation of defence units from Moorebank to Holsworthy to allow development of the intermodal transport hub, $270 million in additional funding for Navy fleet sustainment, $220 million for investment in maintenance and upgrades of the Defence estate, $160 million for fringe benefit tax liabilities, $150 million for enhanced garrison support services and $70 million for further investment and international engagement under the Defence Cooperation Program.


To manage these internal cost pressures Defence has reallocated and reprioritised $2.9 billion. The majority of that $2.9 billion was reallocated from savings in the Defence Capability Plan and the approved major capital investment program, with further savings, predominantly in 2012-13, from across the general department operating budget. These savings from across the general department operating budget include Navy reprioritising its operating activities and reviewing all non-operational activities, including Navy's international program, and Army reducing the use of M113AS4 vehicles and M1A1 Abrams tanks. That some of these vehicles will be placed in temporary storage is well known now. Army will continue to review these fleets to ensure a viable mechanised capability is maintained.


These budget initiatives build on the efficiencies and savings gained through the Strategic Reform Program, including in the areas of capability development, procurement and acquisition, and the strengthening of personnel and institutional capabilities. The reform will be further considered during the development of the 2013 Defence white paper to ensure that, as you would expect, defence spending, in light of the forced posture review, revised Defence Capability Plan and the savings that have already been identified, is calibrated against an up-to-date assessment of our circumstances in both the short and longer terms. It is important that we acknowledge that some hard decisions have been taken in this budget, and we do not shy away from those decisions. I think it is very important also to say that there is no question about us not accepting the need to make changes in the way we do our business, and we are doing that. We have made it very clear that the allocation across the department was being, as I said earlier, reallocated from savings in the Defence Capability Plan and the Approved Major Capital Investment Program with further savings, predominately in 2012-13, from across the general departmental operating budget. It is very clear to us that we have a job to do here to make sure that we operate more efficiently and that we get better outcomes for the dollar we expend, and that has to happen right across the organisation. I do want to commend the organisation for being part of the decision making and for understanding what these responsibilities mean in terms of providing advice to government as to what we might best do to achieve our targets.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (10:30):  In a place that often focuses on the differences between the parties, I think both sides of the chamber agree on one thing and that is that one of the pre-eminent objectives for us in Afghanistan is the protection of our troops and of their wellbeing in Afghanistan. One of the things that I did want to focus on this morning in my question to the minister is what we are doing to protect troops there. I am led to believe that we have undertaken a number of measures in the course of the last year. There is new lighter combat body armour and a new combat uniform, longer range machine guns and upgrades to the Bushmasters. I understand that in the course of the last year we have let out a contract for the manufacture of over 100 new Bushmasters in Victoria and the upgrades to the ones in Afghanistan are designed to make them even more secure. I also see that we have put in place a counter-rocket system in Tarin Kowt to provide additional protection of troops there. Clearly these measures are critical.


In addition to this, a MultiCam camouflage uniform is being trialled to provide troops with even greater levels of concealment across the various terrains within Afghanistan. Obviously that is critical for them there. The new uniform, with its new elbow and knee pads, is designed to reduce soft tissue injuries. The uniform is cooler, it is designed to be worn under the body armour, and it has a padded waistband to make it even more comfortable under webbing or a field pack. And it has more pockets and stretch fabric at the joints.


I said earlier that the upgrade of the Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles will make them even safer. The upgrade will include the installation of protected weapons stations to reduce the exposure of crew operating vehicle-fitted weapons; internal spall liners that provide vehicle occupants with better protection from direct fire and side blasts; and new seating and flooring, giving troops in the vehicle better protection against spinal and lower limb injuries from the blast effects of IEDs. I want to ask, Minister: is there any other research being undertaken to further build on this commitment in terms of protecting our troops? I am wondering if you can outline that to the chamber.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:34):  Can I just say that the measures you have outlined are in fact all accurate. We have, under Colonel Jason Blaine, Diggerworks—which I am sure the shadow minister is aware of—which is a program designed to ensure that we have got the best possible equipment for our men and women who are on deployment doing the business for us in Afghanistan and elsewhere. It has proven to be a very successful program which has led to changes, which largely you have outlined.


You asked me about further research. There is a partnership between the department generally, the army in particular and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, for which I am responsible. That sort of work is ongoing. Whilst I am not at liberty to talk about the sorts of developments that have been produced directly as a result of their research into looking after our troops in Afghanistan, you can rest assured that as a result of the work which is being done by DSTO, particular items have been introduced into the theatre which have provided additional protection in terms of electronic countermeasures for our troops. They are very, very important to us. They are doing a huge amount of work along with those over in Russell involved with the IED taskforce, which is looking at how best to exploit the information we receive from IED events; translating that into methods of operation and providing greater protection for our personnel.


I am very proud of the work which is being done across the defence force, including across the department and all its agencies, in doing all we possibly can to provide for the protection of our personnel. You mentioned the Bushmasters; they are a case in point. A lot of the work which has led to the changes in the way we actually provide these vehicles is a result of research which has been done in the first instance through DSTO. It is very important work. Unfortunately, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation is not widely known outside of the defence community; indeed, in some parts of the defence community even then. It is a real treasure for us. It provides enormous capability advantage to us, unrecognised in the wider community—as I say—and is something which we should all applaud. I thank you for your observations about the work we are doing.


I just want to come back to the opposition shadow minister's question on strategic reform. As you know, the strategic reform program was announced as part of the defence white paper in 2009. It is an ambitious reform program that aims to find $20.6 billion in cost reductions across the decade, 2009-2019, for reinvestment in defence capability. We expect to meet our $1.284 billion target for the 2011-12 financial year. This comes on top of our meeting the $797 million target in 2009-10 and the $1.016 billion target in 2010-11.


But I do want to make clear and have it really understood that the SRP is not just a cost reduction program. It is a decade-long program of reform that is driving a greater understanding of defence business. Its cost drivers have started a culture shift in the organisation. Now the SRP is three years old, and the substance underpinning that program of course change and as a result of changes to the defence-funding profile and further detailed examination of proposed reform activities over the intervening years. The SRP, although achieving its targets, does face challenges. When it was agreed, it was the only major reform initiative within defence. Circumstances have evolved dramatically since. The effects of the global financial crisis, as I said earlier, have been a significant driver for us. At the time of the 2011-12 budget it was determined there would be a $1.6 billion underspend for 2010-11 and $1.3 billion of capital funding to be reprogrammed. This represented significant failure in defence's planning and advising process. (Extension of time granted).


In addition, the defence reform agenda has been expanded to include a number of new and important reforms, including the review of the Defence Accountability Framework, the Black review—as a result of that defence is strengthening its personnel and institutional accountability arrangements; expansion of the use of shared services in defence to increase efficiency; the plan to reform ship repair and maintenance, the Rizzo review; the review into Collins class submarines, the Coles review; the Pathway to Cultural Change, which is enhancing defence culture; and a range of important procurement and capability reforms to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the acquisition of new equipment for the Australian Defence Force have also been implemented. These include reforming defence planning, decision-making processes and performance management; substantially reducing the number of committees in defence; increasing the rigour, contestability and expertise within capability development; and strengthening the Projects of Concern process. We remain committed to the SRP, notwithstanding the $1.9 billion target in 2012-13. We will continue with the strategic reform program activities underway in the lead-up to the 2013 white paper. Defence reform, including how the range of existing reform initiatives will be integrated, will be a major theme of the Defence white paper which was announced by the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence on 3 May. This is something that we are looking at right now. Further details of future strategic reform in defence and how the range of initiatives will be integrated will form part of the 2013 white paper.


I think that adequately deals with the issue of the SRP, and I hope that the opposition understand that we remain committed. I am not sure about you—and that is the question. I go back to what I said originally. We need to understand whether or not the opposition are committed to the savings which we have identified. If not, why not? What are they going to change and how are they going to get the money if they are not? I ask whether or not you are committed to the strategic reform program, as we are, and if not, why not?


I thank my colleague for his question and I say again that we will do all we possibly can to enhance the protection of our troops on overseas operations. That is our first obligation, and it is an obligation which we will continue to meet.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:42):  Labor slashed $5½ billion from defence in the budget—which, considering Wagga Wagga, in my electorate of the Riverina, is a tri-service defence city, is sure to have a great impact. Twenty Army major capital facility projects have been delayed by up to three years, Minister, including the construction of Kapooka's working accommodation. I understand that general running expenses at the Army recruit training centre at Kapooka have been, as a result, reduced by a quarter. Last year, 4,000 recruits went through the base—2,300 regular soldiers and 1,700 Army reserve. The cutbacks mean such things as the commandant, instead of travelling to other bases for important face-to-face talks with other colonels and military chiefs, is now forced to do this by telephone. Is this satisfactory for a base which is so important to our defence capabilities?


Furthermore, the towns of Tumbarumba, Temora, West Wyalong and Uranquinty, in my Riverina electorate, did not have Australian Defence Force personnel or had reduced catafalque parties at the recent Anzac Day observances. This was due to funding cutbacks. Can you give me a guarantee that these regional towns and others will receive very necessary ADF representation for Anzac Day ceremonies and other important services from 2013 and beyond?

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:45):  Minister, I want to thank the government for the transfer of further land adjacent to the RAAF base at Amberley to the Queensland government for the Aerospace and Defence Support Centre. This 22.6 hectares of land has been combined with the 143 hectares already owned by the Queensland government. That will see the transfer of aerospace and defence support industries and companies such as Boeing, currently located at the RAAF base, which will make sure that there are thousands of jobs and the viability of that sector. Over the years, the RAAF base at Amberley has seen a dramatic increase in operational capacity and the number of personnel. 


I notice that there were cutbacks in the budget and I have questions about that. But 24 Super Hornets are located in the area and they are operated by No. 1 and No. 6 squadrons at the RAAF base at Amberley. The Minister for Defence Materiel was with me on the day that four fighter jets were delivered. We have delivered 24 Super Hornets in the past 20 months. Those Super Hornets are particularly important in air-to-air combat, strike targets on land and sea, suppressing enemy air defence and conducting reconnaissance. I notice we are the first country, other than the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. The C17s are also located at the RAAF base at Amberley and they made a big contribution during our assistance missions to Papua New Guinea, Christchurch and Japan. 


I have noticed some media commentary in relation to the cutbacks. My questions relate to the RAAF base at Amberley, particularly the operational capacity of the RAAF base. I know that the government has made a decision to buy the fifth and sixth C17 Globemasters to be based at the RAAF base at Amberley. We welcome that and the military personnel. Ipswich has had military personnel since 1861, when we were not flying planes. I note the cutbacks are mainly in civilian and administrative capacities. Minister, will the cutbacks have any adverse operational impact on the RAAF base at Amberley? Is the government's commitment to the RAAF base at Amberley undiminished? Please update the chamber on the procurement of battlefield airlift aircraft to replace the retired Caribou.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:48):  I will start with my colleague's question and come back to the others. Yes, we can guarantee our ongoing support for the base at Ipswich. It is very important to us, as you well understand. There will be no adverse operational impact. We remain committed in the way you described.


In answer to the question on the C27J, in May a media release from the shadow minister for defence, Senator David Johnston, made a series of assertions about the procurement of the C27J Spartan battlefield airlift aircraft. In his media release, Senator Johnston said:


It appears there was no competitive tender process, no rigorous evaluation, and a billion dollar decision has been based on a quick desk top audit.


With great respect to the member for Fadden, this stands in stark contrast to his words in the parliament on Thursday, 10 May:


… available at a very good price and option, may I commend the minister for a quick and sound decision. It is a very good capability. The loss of the Caribou was quite a loss in terms of short take-off and landing. The C-27J will add significant capability to our arsenal.




Mr Robert:
  It will, and I stand by the comments.




Mr SNOWDON:
  I am pleased you do, but I just want to understand: is that the opposition's position?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! I reiterate all comments are through the chair.




Mr SNOWDON:
  With great respect, through you, to him: I am just wanting an assurance from the shadow minister that the views he has expressed are indeed those of the opposition, because they seem to be in contrast to those of the shadow minister for defence. Let me just put a couple of facts on the table. The government agreed to purchase 10 Alenia C-27J Spartan battlefield aircraft to replace the Caribou aircraft which was retired from service in 2009. Some, like me, with a liking for the Caribou, are a bit sad about that. After a career spanning more than four decades—and I would imagine you were actually transported in one on more than one occasion—




Mr Robert:
  Parachuted out of it.




Mr SNOWDON:
  And you enjoyed every moment.




Mr Robert:
  Loved it.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Very slow but got you there safely. The C27J complements the capabilities of the C130 and the C17 aircraft and has been widely welcomed by the Air Force. You mentioned the two additional C17s that we are purchasing. A competitive down-selection process to the C27J was made following exhaustive assessment by the Department of Defence and DMO, the Air Force, of information provided by manufacturers of the C27J and the C295 aircraft. An equal and same opportunity was given to Airbus Military and Alenia. The decision to acquire the C27J was made by the National Security Committee of cabinet and on the recommendation of the Department of Defence, the DMO and the Air Force, together with formal advice from central line agencies including Treasury and Finance. The response from Senator Johnston then was that there were merits in both C27 and C295 but at $1.4 billion the C27 would cost the taxpayer more than twice as much as the C295. That is untrue. The cost of the C27J and the C295 aircraft are roughly comparable.


What Senator Johnston fails to understand and acknowledge is that the $1.4 billion includes not only the acquisition cost of the aircraft but also the modifications to the aircraft for equipment needed for specific ADF roles, including initial logistics support, testing and certification. These costs would apply to any aircraft platform chosen, including the C295. Senator Johnston said, 'In the eyes of just about every other air force around the world the C295 is not only considered to be the best value for money but also the most effective battlefield airlifter.' Unfortunately, those are not views shared by the Chief of Air Force or the RAAF, who we take our advice from, not the shadow minister. It shows once again that there is a clear disarray in the opposition on defence policy.


In relation to your questions on the ARH and the MRH, there have been some issues around the flying hours for those aircraft. We have had difficulties with the development process but the ARH is now flying and will be supporting full training tasks almost as we speak. The MRH is still undergoing some issues and it will be a while before it will be—

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:54):  I am pleased that the member asked me that question, because it is important that we say very clearly what our policy is. The recreation leave policy for Australian Defence Force members is planned to change from 1 July 2012. The change was proposed to the government by the secretary and the CDF and was announced alongside the 2012-13 budget measures as part of a range of measures considered by defence as part of the Strategic Reform Program. Recreation leave travel was previously provided to single ADF members and consisted of annual Commonwealth funded return travel from the member's posting location to the location of their nominated next of kin. Defence has assessed that the policy is decreasing in relevance in the contemporary ADF and it should come as no surprise that Defence, as it should, continually assesses its personnel policies for relevance and appropriateness in order to implement and fund newer, better or more relevant policies in place of older, more outdated policies that needed review.


Major General Fogarty, head of People and Capability, said on 25 May that, unlike in previous years where single soldiers had to live on base, in the confined barracks environment, many members of the military are now based in communities outside the barracks, and that the benefit has become outdated. He said: 'It has become redundant, and the cost of travel within Australia is a totally different environment today to what it was 40 years ago.' The Chief of Defence Force also stated on 25 May that 'the free airfare for older single people was outdated' and that it was in place when he joined the Army 40 years ago, when salaries were low and airfares were very expensive from such places as Townsville. He said: 'The world has changed since that was introduced. You get cheaper airfares, communications are different and the town is not so isolated anymore.' And, importantly, of course, this measure will have no impact on single members who are posted to remote localities such as Darwin and Cairns, because they will still have an entitlement to remote locality leave travel. There will remain an entitlement of three trips a year for trainees and ADF members under the age of 21 will continue to get the entitlement.


Sometimes we make these decisions, and they are difficult decisions, but they need to be made. In this context it is very clear that we want to continue to continually monitor the entitlements that we provide to our Defence Force members. I am particularly pleased, frankly, that the overall package is such that it attracts such large numbers of people to our defence community. And whilst we have had retention issues previously—that is, people not wanting to leave; retention levels have been very good—we are seeing a bit of a change. I do not expect this particular policy item, this new change, to have any impact on our recruitment of new personnel.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The question is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to. Minister?




Mr SNOWDON:
  Sorry, can I just respond to the member for Blair. My apologies for not responding to you earlier. I will get you some more detail about the cost impacts on your community. I suspect they will be minimal. In fact, I got a bit of work done, which we are doing again at the moment, on what the investment has been in defence communities across the country over the last decade. I am trying to get it now for the current financial year, which will help you. When I have it, I will make it available to you. In terms of catafalque parties, that is a matter for the defence forces themselves.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:00):  I will just respond very quickly. I think it is a bit cute. We hear constantly in the parliament from the Leader of the Opposition and from all the shadow ministers—in a chorus, really—a negative tirade around what government is doing or not doing. They have rubbished the budget. They have a $70 billion black hole, but they cannot tell us, or will not tell us, whether or not they are committed to the $5.4 billion worth of savings in the defence budget. If you are not committed to these savings, you have an obligation to tell the Australian community what it is you are committed to. If you are not committed to these savings which we have identified, what do you intend to do? How will you fill the $70 billion black hole—to which, if you are not committed to these savings, we can add another $5.4 billion? You have an obligation not only to the Australian community but to the Australian Defence Force to tell them what your intention is. What we do know is that there is confusion, because there are different words coming out of the mouths of the shadow minister for defence and the shadow minister for defence science and personnel. I just say to them: get your act together. Ask the shadow Treasurer—although he will have a conflicting view, it is clear. He wants to buy the submarines from overseas, costing Australian workers' jobs.


We are committed in this budget to extending the purchases that we have outlined in terms of our capability development, and we have invested in excess of $200 million for the further development of the submarines, which we want built in Australia—12 of them, to be built in Adelaide. You would think we would hear from the opposition whether they are committed to that process or not. To this point, we have heard nothing apart from confusion and dissembling. Tell us the truth: are you committed to the $5.4 billion worth of savings we are proposing in this budget or not? If not, itemise which of these items you are not prepared to support and tell us where the savings are coming from.

Then the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, recommitted the coalition a number of months ago at the Bendigo RSL to the position that we will index fairly—in the same way the age pension is indexed—the DFRDB and DFRB pensions. You asked what we are committed to, Minister. That is what we are committed to. My question to you, Minister, is: are you committed?

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:04):  I am happy to respond to your question, and I will. You cannot jump from the Defence portfolio, where we are identifying $5.4 billion worth of savings, and come at us when I ask you, 'What are you committed to?' with a measure which is going to cost another $175 million—or, in fact, $6.2 billion over time.




Mr Robert:
  Over how long?




Mr SNOWDON:
  Hang on. Not only are you going to expend this amount of money but you are also saying to me indirectly that you do not support the government's saving measures of $5.4 billion. If you do support them, tell us. Tell the Australian community what you support in defence expenditures.




Mr Robert:
  I just did.




Mr SNOWDON:
  All you have said is you do not support the leave travel entitlement. That is all you have said. That leaves another $5.4 billion, and you still have to find the $15 million to pay for it. There is an obligation on the opposition: come clean with the Australian community. Here is the opposition's opportunity to say to us whether or not it supports the government's direction on these savings in the defence budget of $5.4 billion. It is simple: yes or no. And if it does not support them then it should tell us where it is going to get the money from—simple. Not too hard. Very simple. Just do it.


In terms of the military superannuation, let me say to you that the opposition, as we have just heard, have said—and there may be something which they do not quite understand here—that they would index DFRB and DFRDB superannuation payments in the same way as the age pension. Keep that in your mind, Mr Deputy Speaker. The opposition want to equate a superannuation benefit payment for work with an income support. They are trying to equate superannuation—a benefit paid to an employee as a result of their working life—with an income support measure such as the age pension.


Let me go through some detail. Over the 11 years of the previous Howard government, what did they do on the question of the indexation of military superannuation? It is a simple question, and the answer is zero, nought, nothing. They put in place the Podger review to review superannuation. From memory the Podger review gave its report to the then government in March or April of 2007. The government did not release it; they just refused to release the report. They thought, 'Just do the report, give people an idea that we are actually going to try to do something but, in fact, do nothing.'


What we did was proceed to release the review and then go on and do more work, and we have come to the conclusion that it is not appropriate for us to index DFRB and DFRDB superannuation payments and treat them the same as the age pension. We know it is very costly. What is more, the opposition know they cannot afford it. Despite statements by the Leader of the Opposition, by the shadow minister for veterans affairs and by this shadow minister they know it cannot be afforded. Their former finance minister Nick Minchin said very recently that this claim to change indexation was:


… properly rejected by the Howard government, of which I was a member …


…   …   …


There is no inherent logic to the proposition that a public sector employment-related superannuation payment should be indexed in exactly the same fashion as a means-tested welfare benefit in this case, the age pension.


That was the Howard government's position. So what is the difference? All of a sudden we hear these guys telling us that it is appropriate to equate an employment related superannuation payment to the age pension.


Let me just explain what that might mean. (Extension of time granted) I want to give a few case examples so we can compare what it means to be on a military superannuation through DFRDB. A warrant officer who retired in 2010 after 35 years service is estimated to receive a payment without commutation of approximately $54,000 per year. If he or she decided to commute five times the annual payment—and 99.5 per cent of members have commuted the annual payment—then the lump sum would be around $270,000, in exchange for a reduced annual payment of some $40,000 per year. What we are being asked to do here is equate that superannuation payment to the age pension. Are you serious?


A colonel equivalent who retired in 2010 after 35 years service is estimated to receive a payment without commutation of approximately $78,000 per year. If he or she decided to commute five times the annual payment, then the lump sum would be around $390,000 in exchange for a reduced annual payment of some $59,000 per year. Again, are you serious? Are you seriously expecting us, this government, the community, to equate a superannuation payment of $59,000 per year, indexed to CPI, with the age pension? You might tell me what the logic is here. What is the logic of equating a superannuation payment of $59,000 per year to the age pension?


You know, as I know, that those people whose income falls below the threshold can get access, if they meet the appropriate service requirements, to the service pension at age 60 and to the age pension at age 65. Should any of these people, over time, find that their incomes have dropped or that they have made decisions around their lives which mean that their incomes have dropped, then they will get access to the age pension or the service pension, depending on their individual circumstances. I was not aware of this until recently but, in addition, since 1988, DFRDB members have been entitled to a nine per cent productivity benefit, which is available as a lump sum on retirement. So not only can they do the commutation but they also get a nine per cent lump sum productivity benefit on retirement.


The proposition we have before us from the opposition, being trounced around the country at every RSL conference I go to—




An honourable member interjecting—





Mr SNOWDON:
  It is very serious, and I tell the RSL people that we will not be doing it. I am upfront with them.




Mr Robert:
  So are we, and we'll be doing it.




Mr SNOWDON:
  But you are not upfront with the Australian community about how you are going to identify the savings to pay for it or how you are going to identify the savings to pay for the $5.4 billion worth of defence expenditure cuts which we have put into this budget. You have not explained that to us either. You have an obligation, when you go to these meetings, to be straight. The problem is that you are not. People are not silly. They are not going to be confused forever. There will come a day when they will ask you the vital questions and you will not be able to respond to them because you do not have an answer. It is very clear to me that, despite your protestations, in your heart of hearts and indeed, I bet, in the shadow finance minister's heart of hearts, the shadow Treasurer's heart of hearts and, I suspect, in the Leader of the Opposition's heart of hearts, you all agree with Senator Minchin. They agreed with him when they were in the Howard government as members of the cabinet and they agree with him today. Of that I have no doubt. It is just a proposition which is not sustainable.


I say to the opposition: I would think again. The only commitment we have received out of you this morning is a commitment not about what you are going to do about the $5.4 billion worth of defence savings but a commitment—two commitments really—on leave travel entitlements and superannuation indexation for the DFRDB recipients. That is it. I say to you that you need to do a lot more to tell the Australian community about what you intend to do in both the Defence portfolio and the Veterans' Affairs portfolio.

 (Fadden) (11:14):  We have only made one commitment, and that is DFRDB indexation. We have made no comment upon defence travel, Minister. I will just update that for the record. On budget night, the minister made much of the government's $17.4 million package to respond to the findings of the Campbell Review of Military Compensation Arrangements. The review's recommendations were tabled by the minister in the House on Wednesday, 23 May. In that statement the minister indicated that 96 of the 108 recommendations were adopted. What he did not say was that the government has delayed the implementation of the major findings of the review until a later date, principally to save money.


In Senate estimates on Tuesday night, the Department of Veterans' Affairs confirmed that recommendations implementing compensation-offsetting reform and major changes to the review and appeal methodology have been delayed by a government decision not to spend any of the announced funding for a further two years. This means that a returned soldier, sailor or airman, or airwoman, will be forced to wait another two years for the government to implement findings fully endorsed by the ex-service community. Minister, why have these been delayed, why wasn't this announced earlier and what are the implications of this delay?

 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:15):  Further to the issue of superannuation, let me make it clear what the opposition has signed up to: $175 million over the forward estimates; a $1.7 billion fiscal cost over the forward estimates; and $6.2 billion in unfunded liabilities. Those opposite have not seen the connection, or are failing to recognise the connection, between this superannuation scheme and the scheme that other Commonwealth superannuation beneficiaries are on—that is, Commonwealth public servants. If there were to be a change to the indexation in the way in which the opposition subscribes to, as former Senator Minchin pointed out, there will inevitably be a flow-on to all Commonwealth public servants. The costs would be horrendous. It is something that I know the shadow minister for finance and the shadow Treasurer will have deep in their thoughts. This is a commitment that I do not think will be met.



Mr Robert interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  Mate, you have indicated to us that the only observation you have to make about the $5.4 billion saved in Defence is that you have no comment.




Mr Robert:
  This is consideration in detail of your appropriation bill.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Consideration in detail? The detail I want from you is: do you support them or not?




Mr Robert:
  Of your appropriation bill.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Do you support them or not? A very good question. He should just answer the question. Let me make some observations about MRCA, which you have just asked about. The opposition is in no position to criticise the government on our commitment to review MRCA, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which was a Labor Party 2007 election commitment. We have implemented 96 of the 108 recommendations. It is worth pointing out again that, like on the indexation issue, when the opposition were in government they refused to commit to any review of MRCA to ensure it was meeting the needs of our service men and women. They refused to do it. They did virtually nothing for the veterans community in 11 years of government, and their words are not backed up. Now, I am afraid, they are simply playing the politics of it.


Going to recommendation 22.2(a) on multiple-act compensation, this new methodology will apply to all future decisions on and from 1 July 2013. The majority of the veterans affected by the methodology will benefit financially from the new methodology being applied rather than the current one. Any veteran to whom the current methodology applies between now and 1 July 2013 may still benefit from the new methodology when their case is reviewed. The retrospective reviews will commence six months after 1 July 2013—that is, from January 2014. No-one will be disadvantaged by the reviews. Indeed, the majority are expected to benefit by a retrospective adjustment to their compensation for the MRCA accepted conditions. Where the new methodologies apply retrospectively and produce a lower outcome, the current methodology, the existing MRCA compensation, will continue.


The reviews will begin with the oldest case first. All cases since 1 July 2004 that have had the current methodology applied will be reviewed. DVA will identify the cases and actively review them. There will not be any need for the veteran to request a review. The number of retrospective reviews required to be done will not increase after 1 July 2013, because the new methodologies apply to new decisions from that date. As of 1 July 2013, there will be about 1,600 to 1,800 decisions to be reviewed. Many of these reviews, as one would expect, will be complex—they will involve multiple assessments dating to 1 July 2004. Each assessment will have to be recalculated using the new methodology, and it is expected that it will take 2½ years to review all cases. It is not expected that there will be any need for additional medical reviews to allow the new methodology to be applied. The government provided funding to DVA for the conduct of these assessments.


You have asked about the delays in implementation. I make it clear that considerable preparatory work is necessary before DVA can implement the accepted recommendations with an implementation date of 1 July 2013 or later. For some initiatives, system changes are required. There are 20 recommendations that require legislative amendment, instruments and determinations. Implementation of the 53 recommendations involving improvements to benefits systems or processes is a substantial body of work for the department.


On the issue of the single pathway through VRB, recommendations 17.1 and 17.2, the delay in implementation to 1 July 2014—another question that was asked by the shadow minister that was made clear in Senate estimates; I am not quite sure why you are asking the same question again—is to allow sufficient time for the detailed implications of the initiative to be worked through in consultation with all the stakeholders, including ex-service organisations, the legal profession, the Veterans' Review Board, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and others. The government has asked that further work be done and presented back to government in the 2014 budget, with a view to implementation from 1 July 2014. This is a significant and complex change associated with the appeals process. It is very important that enough time be allowed for consideration of all the issues so that the best possible process is available to those who need to have a primary decision review.


In its report the review identified a number of issues associated with the initiative that need to be resolved before implementation. It did not provide a solution to these issues. This work now needs to be done. It would not have been sensible to begin work until the government had made a decision in the 2012 budget to support recommendations 17.1 and 17.2. Do you want me to proceed with the advocacy model?




Mr Robert:
  It is already on the table at Senate estimates?




Mr SNOWDON:
  Yes, most of it is there, mate. That is why I am wondering why you are asking questions.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:22):  The defence sector is vital to South Australia, and it is particularly important to my electorate. The RAAF base is located just outside my electorate, so many RAAF personnel live within the electorate. Within my electorate there is also the Defence Teaming Centre, located at Mawson Lakes, where anywhere between 50 and 100 small businesses operate in conjunction with defence contracts that have been won—




Mr Robert:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance: this has now moved on to Veterans' Affairs. It is not a standing defence matter.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am listening to the question. I ask the member to make it relevant to Veterans' Affairs, but I believe we are discussing the portfolio under the banner of Defence.




Mr ZAPPIA:
  I would have thought that, whether it is Veterans' Affairs or Defence, the two matters are related. How you can separate the two is—




Mr Robert:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the appropriation bills have a separate appropriation line for Veterans' Affairs. Under the Federation Chamber list, Veterans' Affairs is a separate line.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am aware of that. I am listening to the member for Makin.




Mr ZAPPIA:
  As I was saying, the defence sector is absolutely vital to my part of the world. I am conscious that there are many industries, including the Techport operations, where the submarines are being built and where a number of Defence personnel are located and work. Over the last couple of years I have had many representations made by veterans and by those officers who have been deployed from Darwin to the RAAF base as part of the new battalion.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask the member for Makin to bring his point back to Veterans' Affairs. We are discussing Veterans' Affairs.




Mr ZAPPIA:
  My question to the minister is: in respect of those soldiers who have been relocated to the RAAF base, can you advise what steps are being taken to ensure that their families are being supported with the relocation and, in particular, what—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Member for Makin will resume his seat. The Member for Fadden on another point of order. 




Mr Robert:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, this an egregious abuse of appropriation—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Makin is talking about the families of those employees—





Mr Robert:
  Who are not veterans, Mr Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Fadden will resume his seat.




Mr ZAPPIA:
  I will finish on this point, Mr Deputy Speaker. In some cases those members will remain in South Australia once they leave the Defence Force, so it is of interest to them to understand what support measures are in place with their relocation.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (11:25):  I am happy to respond to the member for Makin's question as it goes to the services we are providing on base for current serving veterans, including the veterans on bases in his community, and the continuum of care and the transitional pathway from the defence community to the veterans community, from uniform to out of uniform and into civilian life. And it is fair to ask the question because it is a very important part of what we are doing. I suggest to the shadow minister, if he is not aware of it—




Mr Robert:
  We are, and we support it.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Thank you. To inform the member for Makin, we have 35 on-base advisory service officers across the country. They are there to provide assistance to men and women in uniform who are currently serving personnel on what we can do for them: what their entitlements are; what they need to do if they are proposing to leave the Defence Force. We are also acutely aware of those people who have been wounded or are ill as a result of action or their service. We are most particularly aware of those people in rehabilitation and what we need to do to make sure that we maintain the requirements for them post their service life. This is all happening on bases around the country.


It is vitally important to the future of the Australian Defence community—to men and women in uniform—that we look after them not only while they are serving our nation overseas, but also when they come home and when they decide to relocate out of the Defence Force. I did some work on this and it is something that I think the shadow minister would be interested in; it is something I have been talking about at RSL conferences around the country. One of the issues for us is to make sure that we are not only supporting serving men and women and their families—which we are bound to do—but also to make sure that we look after those people who retire out of the Defence Force or move on or transition out. But we need to understand who they are.


You get the impression on some occasions that these people join up when they are 19 and stay for life—and of course that is not the case. The median age of the vast bulk of those people who enlist in the Australian Defence Force is around 20; the median age of them leaving the Defence Force is 27. These are not people who have DFRDB or any entitlement to superannuation; these are people in uniform who, the bulk of them, are leaving the Australian Defence Force by the time they are 27. They are the people I am most concerned about.


I know if you are in the Defence Force until you are 45 or 50 or 55, you are being looked after and your family is being looked after. But if you are a member of the Defence Force and you retire out of the Defence Force after two or three tours in Afghanistan, at age 25 or 26 or 27 or 28, then there is a real chance that you might disappear from us. We need to try to inculcate in these serving members the need to stay connected through the Defence Force associations and ex-service organisations such as the RSL so that we can make sure, should something go awry somewhere down the track, that we are looking after them. That is our commitment. I know it is a commitment that is shared by the opposition. Despite the differences we have, and I say this while the shadow minister for veterans' affairs adviser is here—he's a good bloke; he's all right—over issues such as DFRDB and DFRDB superannuation, we are aligned in making sure that we are supporting our veterans and our veterans' community. In conclusion, what I am concerned about is whether or not you support us, whether or not you support the government's proposed savings in this budget. At some time I expect you to tell us.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:30):  The budget finally delivers a funding blueprint for the centenary of Anzac. Whilst it is a long time coming, the government response to one particular initiative is of deep and growing concern. On 18 April the Prime Minister announced $6.5 million for the construction of the Anzac Interpretive Centre to ensure the new centre was up and running by November 2014. The Anzac centre is fully supported by the coalition and, I gather, by the government.


We are concerned the City of Albany has major reservations about the construction of the centre. In its council meeting of 15 May this year it passed a resolution calling for funding security. The council's minutes state that presently the cost estimates for the planning, design and construction of the centre, based on the scoping advice of consultants, is potentially $9 million plus. To date the only confirmed funding for the project is $6.55 million, leaving $5.8 million for construction. A quantity surveyor has estimated the cost of construction at $8 million. The council advises that the construction of this building, from a project management perspective, is a risk. The government funding appears to be $2 million short of what is needed for the Prime Minister's 18 April 2012 commitment to be sustained. We also learned on Tuesday night that the scoping study into the project is yet to be completed and the government's final commitment is based on an old estimate of construction costs. Minister, can you give the community of Albany any commitment that the city will not be left saddled with the cost of completing the Anzac Interpretive Centre?

There is no additional money we can provide. The Albany community and the Western Australian government need to look at how they might get additional funding for the project.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (11:32):  I look forward to taking this hour to quiz the Attorney-General and the Minister for Home Affairs on issues within the portfolio. I want to start on an issue that we have just been discussing in the main chamber, which is the 20th anniversary of the Mabo decision by the High Court. Given the Attorney's words in support of native title today, and given the significance of this anniversary, I am wondering how she can reconcile that with what the government has done in relation to refusing to fulfil the Commonwealth's obligation to fund 75 per cent of all native title compensation settlements. In my home state of Western Australia this is a very significant issue, as it would be for other state governments as well. It really is an enormous betrayal of Indigenous people all around the country. In light of this anniversary and in light of her stated support for native title, I am wondering how she can possibly reconcile this position.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:33):  I was going to ask a fairly similar question in relation to native title. I have a large Indigenous community in my electorate, in Ipswich and the Somerset region. In fact I have an Indigenous school, Hymba Yumba, a new prep to year 12 school. I was down there fairly recently talking about how it could develop. I was also visiting the USQ Indigenous Connections 2012 event for high school kids which took place in Indigenous communities across the whole of the western corridor, through Ipswich and the Somerset region and out towards Toowoomba. That was a good way for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to get pathways to undergraduate degrees. It was great talking to the young people there and seeing what their future goals and aspirations were.


Recently, on 2 March 2012, I addressed the Indigenous Lawyers Association of Queensland on where the government was at and how they could assist by mentoring young Indigenous people across Queensland. I know the president of that association, Josh Creamer. There was a profile of him in the Courier-Mail and he talked about the tabling of the Doing time report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which I chair. He works in native title and Josh and I have talked about this issue on a number of occasions. He talks about the challenges in relation to native title. Minister, I would like to ask a question in relation to this. I understand that back in 2008 it was estimated that, given the rate of resolution, it would take about 30 years to resolve the current and anticipated native title claims. In about 2009 I think the government made a number of reforms to actually promote a speedy resolution of those types of cases. I understand that in the budget there were some announcements in relation to institutional reform to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the judicial system, particularly native title claims. Can you provide information about that particular measure, the anticipated impact and the resolution of those claims? I am happy to relate that back to Josh and his organisation in Queensland.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (11:35):   I thank both members for those questions, and the member for Stirling's indulgence. I did understand the member for Blair was asking a question on a similar topic and thought it might be easiest to take both of them together. Absolutely, the government is confident that it can fully reconcile its support and recognition for the 20-year anniversary which comes this Sunday in celebration of the High Court decision in the Mabo case and then, of course, the Labor government's action to introduce the native title system—mind you we met with enormous opposition from those opposite. I did think that the very brief and fairly churlish comments in the House today indicated that some in the opposition still have an antipathy to native title. That is a shame, when 20 years on we can see that the system is working quite well.


What I think the member opposite is not recognising, and the question the member for Blair asked started to highlight, is that the government has made a decision in this budget which does provide some administrative savings by moving the Native Title Tribunal back into the Federal Court—keeping its own identity but being able to share all of its administrative backroom functions. That amount of money has been invested many, many times over in other Indigenous programs, which are also in this budget but which I have not yet been asked about—for example, the night patrols that are occurring across many communities in the Territory, and the investments in other justice programs which apply across all the country. The reason that this decision was taken is that we had a recommendation from the Skehill review looking at a range of matters in our courts. We had many, many representations from those involved in the native title system, and we have clear evidence in front of us that this system is working. We know how long it would take if we kept on the same trajectory that we were on—with the Native Title Tribunal itself estimating that the current cases could take at least another 30 years to be completed.


Some of the first steps that the previous attorney took have started to bear fruit. For example, in the 16-year period from when the Native Title Act came into force until the end of 2009-10, the Federal Court handed down 86 consent determinations. In just the year-and-a-half following some changes that our government introduced, 43 consent determinations were handed down. Even though this is early in the process, that is a rate five times higher than prior to the reforms that we instituted through the Native Title Amendment Act 2009. These decisions in the budget simply take that a step further. The 2009 amendments allowed the Federal Court to play a much more active role in the speedy determination of matters. This now will be able to be— 




Mr Keenan:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I am waiting to get a response from the Attorney-General to my actual question. She is over three minutes into her five-minute allocated time. I specifically did not ask about native title in general. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Dr Leigh
):  There is no point of order. The member for Stirling will resume his seat. This is consideration in detail; this is not questions without notice or questions on notice. The Attorney-General must speak to expenditure within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Attorney-General is doing that. 




Ms ROXON:
  And I am also addressing the actual budget initiative to which your question went, which was changes to the native title system. I am also going to the member for Blair's question, which I believe I am also entitled to answer. Those changes go directly to the system. If the member wants to ask questions on behalf of his Western Australian colleagues about matters that, 20 years ago, were put by a previous Labor government and rejected by a previous Liberal government, then so be it. Put those questions in question time. They are not a matter for the budget. They are rehashing and revisiting and trying to rewrite history. You need to go back and talk to the previous premier, Premier Court, about why he rejected those offers. 


What is before us at the moment in this budget is a strengthening of the native title system and an ability for us to speed up determinations for the benefit of both native title claimants and those who have interests in using the land in other ways. The government is very proud to be able to recognise this anniversary and improve the system of native title.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (11:40):  The nature of that response really was Orwellian. How the government, in what is the greatest betrayal of Indigenous Australians since the Mabo decision was made 20 years ago, can somehow spin that as being an advancement in native title is, quite frankly, Orwellian. We will move on though to other issues within the portfolio. 


I wanted to ask about the recent interceptions at Cocos Island of illegal boat arrivals, one on 15 May and then another yesterday on 30 May. As members would be aware, there is a limited Border Protection Command presence at Cocos Island, and I understand that these interceptions were made by a single AFP officer. The boats were respectively carrying 63 passengers in the first arrival and 40 passengers in the second arrival. I wanted to confirm when and how the AFP officers became aware of these particular illegal arrivals. Why was the AFP forced to undertake this task and not Border Protection Command, as is obviously appropriate? What risk assessment has been done for illegal arrivals coming to Cocos Island, both for the Australian officers involved and for the asylum seekers themselves? 


I assume this will be to the Minister for Home Affairs. I am not sure how you will be organising it. I wanted to ask whether he believes it is acceptable that the protection of Australian borders relies on a single AFP officer in a rigid inflatable boat, a RIB. Because this has happened on more than one occasion, I wanted to ask him how it was possible for two illegal boat arrivals to essentially just bump into Australian territory before being detected. What provisions have been made on Cocos Island for these continued illegal arrivals, including simple contingencies  such as food, accommodation and other needs? Where are the people being detained on Cocos Island and in what conditions are they being detained? Given that these two arrivals have come within the space of a fortnight and there have been reports of an upsurge in Tamil asylum seekers coming from Sri Lanka, what is the government doing in response to increase our border protection system at Cocos Island?

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:43):  I have some information for the member. If there is any additional information that he would like, I am happy to take that on notice and provide additional information. Just as was the case under the Howard government, boat arrivals at Cocos Island are rare. As was the case under the Howard government, the Australian Federal Police have responsibilities in relation to maritime patrol at Cocos Island, which is why they responded to this recent arrival. 


Appearing before estimates last week, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police said that AFP officers on Cocos Island had a responsibility to assist where they can and were trusted to make operational judgments. The AFP used that judgment and responded using rigid-hulled inflatable boats. The shadow minister made reference to rigid-hulled inflatable boats. I should make the point—it is an important point—that they are the same type of boat that was recommended in the WA coroner's recent report for use at Christmas Island. It is one recommendation that we have accepted and will implement. I think it is one that is supported by the shadow minister and by the shadow minister for immigration. I have had conversations with the shadow minister for immigration about that matter specifically. The AFP provides health and safety information and training to its employees. It provides AFP members with an understanding of potential health effects and the skills and knowledge that enable them to work safely. The Indian Ocean Territories Health Service services the community of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and is responsible for initial screening of irregular maritime arrivals. Border Protection Command provides services such as transferring IMAs from the jetty to Cocos airport for quarantine and health screening. Customs and Border Protection is working with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on arrangements to transfer the irregular maritime arrivals to Christmas Island, where they will undergo initial security and identity checks and their reason for travel will be established.


The shadow minister complained that this has happened more than once. I know that in his press release yesterday he said that it is disgraceful that this situation has been allowed to happen more than once. I should inform him that it happened more than once under the Howard government; it happened twice under the Howard government within a short period of time, so he should reflect upon that when making remarks like that. The Australian Federal Police had responsibility then at Cocos (Keeling) Island, as they do now.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (11:46):  My question is also to the Minister for Justice. As the minister would be aware, I am the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. Since 2009 the committee has been very interested in the application of unexplained wealth as a technique for targeting serious and organised crime. Unexplained wealth represents a relatively new form of criminal asset confiscation where serious and organised criminals who cannot account for their wealth could be held liable to forfeit it. The value of unexplained wealth provisions lies in its ability to undermine the business model of serious and organised crime. The effect is that it removes incentive for participation and puts in doubt the profits that could be otherwise recommitted into furthering other criminal endeavour.


Minister, my committee was very encouraged in 2009 after conducting an international review of unexplained wealth and made recommendations to the government which were agreed to. The Proceeds of Crime Act of 2002 was subsequently amended. But during the bill's rather tortuous passage through the parliament it was so amended that the resulting piece of legislation providing for unexplained wealth became, in our opinion, seriously unworkable—unworkable certainly to the extent of law enforcement. With these provisions being established, which was very much at the vanguard of attacking serious and organised crime, not one prosecution has been mounted since the passage of this legislation. My committee has more recently conducted a review of the legislation, which I know you are aware of. For the purpose of these proceedings, I would like you to explain why you believe it is absolutely essential that we have national unexplained wealth laws and how you see that combating serious and organised crime.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:44):  I thank the member for Fowler for the question and for his excellent report. The work that he and his committee did in the area of unexplained wealth is very important, and if we can get the support of the states and territories for some of the recommendations in that report to create a national unexplained wealth regime then its impact will be very significant. It will mean that we will seize more money off criminals, which will mean more money in the Proceeds of Crime Fund, which ultimately means more money for the budget, which is a good thing. As the member rightly points out, in March his committee released its report into its inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements. It recommended a national approach to unexplained wealth laws to make it more effective than the current regime. That ultimately would require the referral of powers from state and territory jurisdictions. By way of background, the federal government enacted its own unexplained wealth legislation in 2010. Some states and territories—WA, Northern Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia—also have unexplained wealth laws. As the committee's report points out, there are significant differences and limitations in the way the state laws operate. There are also significant constitutional limitations on what the Commonwealth laws can achieve. They can only be used for offences against the Commonwealth. I agree—and I know that the Attorney-General agrees—that there are improvements that can be made in this area.


That is why we have written to the states and territories asking them to refer us the constitutional powers we need to enact the national unexplained wealth laws. We did that in April. In April we raised the issue with the attorneys general across the nation, and we are looking forward to receiving a positive response from the states and territories to this request.


The advice from law enforcement and the findings of the parliamentary committee that the member chaired are clear: strong national unexplained wealth laws are a powerful way of attacking organised crime. National laws will help the federal government and the states and territories. National laws would give organised crime nowhere to hide their assets. Why is this important? It is important, as the member knows, because organised crime is ultimately driven by money, and because it costs the Australian economy more than $15 billion a year. Take away their profits and it reduces the incentive to commit crime. Organised criminals are more afraid of having their wealth seized than they are of spending time in jail. That is why we need these powerful unexplained wealth laws.


Another reason for these new laws is that it makes it easier for law enforcement to seize the assets of criminals. It effectively reverses the onus of proof. It means that people have to prove their wealth was obtained through legitimate sources rather than law enforcement being forced to prove that it was not. Over the past two years we have more than doubled the value of the assets seized, from about $18 million to more than $40 million. So far this year we have almost doubled it again, seizing $75 million. We are taking mansions, Lamborghinis, Ferraris, yachts and so forth, which takes away the incentive for criminals to commit crimes. Just like in the story of Al Capone, you can catch criminals by following the money.


The national laws that the member is talking about will help the federal government and all states and territories to crack down on serious organised crime. It means the Mr Bigs have to prove their wealth was obtained legally, which makes it easier to confiscate their assets. This makes it one of the most effective ways to tackle organised crime. That is why we will be pursuing this issue with the states and territories with a view to creating national laws. To tackle organised crime we have to hit criminals on the street and at the border, but we also have to do it at the hip pocket. These new laws will help to hit criminals where it really hurts—in their hip pocket.

In relation to the budget cuts, from previous budgets, of $58.1 million and the fact that air cargo is going to increase by almost 45 per cent over the forward estimates in this budget, I am wondering if the minister can inform the House what percentage of air and sea cargo is screened and what percentage is physically examined. Has the reduction in air cargo screening resulted in more illegal contraband being smuggled undetected through customs? Referring to the Attorney's media statement this morning on tobacco smuggling, will the minister be able to outline whether this measure will come with additional funding for Customs to screen cargo so they can stop illegal tobacco being smuggled through our borders?


Given that on 14 March a report from the New South Wales Police on the investigation into weapons smuggling undertaken by a criminal syndicate through the Sylvania Waters Post Office highlighted that 220 Glock pistols had been illegally imported into our country by the air mail undetected by Customs, can the minister explain how and why weapons components were able to be imported into Australia in this case and evade the detection of Customs? Can the minister also confirm whether the $4½ million in funding that the government has committed to Task Force Polaris is additional funding, or are the agencies involved expected to find this money in their existing budgets? If that is additional funding, could he point out where in the budget that funding is to be found?

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:54):  I thank the member for his question. I might do it in reverse order. The $4½ million for Polaris is money that has been already allocated to Polaris through the proceeds of crime fund. It is money that was allocated before I became the Minister for Home Affairs. In relation to the weapons that were seized in March, this question gives me the opportunity to provide the member with some additional information which I am sure he is not currently aware of. He would not be aware that in July and in August of last year, Customs seized a number of Glock parts and magazines. The person that was importing those weapon parts had an authorisation for an import permit given to them by the New South Wales police. Customs advised the New South Wales police and they subsequently cancelled the authorisation. Customs and the police then executed search warrants and arrested the man and the matter is now before the courts. I cannot provide to the House additional information on this at this time because it is before the courts, but I ask the shadow minister to reflect very seriously and very carefully on the information that I have just provided.


In relation to the seizure of firearms on 12 April by the New South Wales police, I have got some more information which may be of interest to the House. When they seized the weapons they found information at the scenes in Port Macquarie and in Sydney that indicated that firearms had been illegally imported. The police then provided this information to Customs. Customs have examined the documents and they have advised me that the weapons linked to these documents were indeed illegally imported. These were AR15 semi-automatic military style rifles. The advice of Customs is that indeed the weapons that were linked to these documents were illegally imported. They were illegally imported under the Howard government. So it is to put that information into perspective when understanding this issue. This was at a time when 100 per cent of international mail was X-rayed. It shows the limitations of X-raying. In both these cases of the Glocks and military rifles, X-raying was done. That is why I have said that finding metal gun parts in a box of metal machinery is very difficult. You need to know what you are looking for. That is why I asked for advice from law enforcement agencies. Their advice was that intelligence is the key to seizing drugs or to seizing guns. That is proven by the facts.


The shadow minister asked me about air cargo. I have got for him the following information that he might find instructive. In 2007, the last year of the Howard government, Customs inspected six million air parcels and detected 870 parcels that contained drugs or other prohibited items. In 2011, Customs inspected 1½ million parcels and, by using profiling and intelligence to target the right parcels, they seized 1,741 parcels containing drugs or other prohibited items. In other words, Customs are now seizing double what they were in air cargo under the Howard government. They are seizing double the amount of illegal goods that they were when the member was in government, and that is because of the use of intelligence and targeting. The more intelligence that law enforcement agencies have the more drugs and the more guns they seize, whether it is on the street or at the border. That is why I then asked officials that report to me whether in the budget we should be increasing investment in screening, as the shadow minister proposes, or investing in intelligence. They all said we should be investing in intelligence. That is why I have established an intelligence and targeting team inside Customs, because that is the way to seize guns. It is the same model that we have applied to drugs and it comes with a Customs officer who is now embedded inside the New South Wales Police Force, and the advice to me is that is a model that we should be implementing, not just there but across the country. It is about information sharing and agencies working more closely together. It is also why in the budget you see money allocated to a forensics facility for the Australian Federal Police. That will get involved in things like firearm tracing and so forth. The approach that I have taken here is to listen to the facts and listen to the experts, and I encourage the shadow minister to do the same.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (11:59):  I want to briefly address the question that was directed to me on the changes to the penalties for tobacco smuggling. We are, of course, concerned when any illicit product is coming across our borders. I need to put on the record that we do not share the view that the tobacco industry has that this is a huge problem in Australia, but any amount of illegal product coming in is obviously a concern. It is a concern both on the health front because people smoke this product and because it is essentially defrauding Australian taxpayers of money that would otherwise be paid as excise to the government and be provided for in the budget.


These offences have not had their penalties updated for a long time. They are not commensurate with other offences of fraud against the Commonwealth. That is why the announcement has been made today, on World No Tobacco Day. The question went directly to whether or not there are any additional resources being provided. No, there are not for this particular initiative. The same work that is done in detecting illicit tobacco will continue but we will be able to enforce a much stricter regime and harsher penalties, including that those involved in this illicit trade could end up in jail for up to 10 years. It is about having a proper disincentive and us tackling tobacco across all fronts.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (12:01):  I will be very brief; I just want to follow up on what the Attorney was saying in relation to tobacco smuggling. I have been through Customs warehouses and they all smell of tobacco as you go through. There was mention of the report that had been prepared. It was paid for by the tobacco industry but it was done by an independent body. If the Attorney does not believe the scope of the activity as outlined within that report then would she care to outline to the House how serious she believes this problem is. How serious is this crime in Australia and what are the costs to the Australian community? If they do differ from what is contained in that report, could she let us know how.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (12:01):  Certainly, I am happy to provide that. I do not have the table in front of me, but I can provide the details that have been made public in the past—and we are happy to make them public—of Customs seizures. They do continue to identify tobacco that is being brought illegally into Australia and we, of course, prosecute people for doing that. The changes that have been announced go to what penalties apply when that happens.


There has been a longstanding dispute between the industry and the government about the extent of this problem. It may well be a dispute that is inevitably going to continue. By its nature, illicit trade means that you cannot always perfectly measure how much is being brought in, but we have a range of different things for measuring it. We have Customs material and household drug surveys. All of them show a far smaller incidence of this than the tobacco industry's own reports. I have said on the record many times before, and I am not ashamed to say it again, that the tobacco industry do not have a good record when it comes to the way they use data and research. In fact, they have a shameful record. So it is fair enough, I think, for me, the government and the public to take with a grain of salt this sort of data that they rely on.


Nevertheless, this change that was announced today, which does not have a separate provision in the budget, is something that the tobacco industry themselves have been calling for. It is in their interests and in the Commonwealth's interests to make sure that, if tobacco is going to be bought and consumed in Australia, the proper taxes are paid and that the proper health warnings are in place. Our government is determined to do everything it can to reduce the number of people who want to participate in that activity.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (12:03):  We know that Australia is, generally speaking, a wonderful place for most children. But—while the majority of kids who are lucky enough to grow up in Australia benefit from the high quality of our health and education systems and from the opportunities that exist in a free, safe and democratic society—it must be acknowledged that kids within certain demographics face very different prospects indeed. It is in recognition of that fact that I join with UNICEF and the Australian children's coalition of organisations in welcoming the government's announcement of the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner.


As the chair of the UNICEF parliamentary association, this gives me particular satisfaction and I was glad to move a successful motion at the ALP national conference last year on this issue, while noting that the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner has been a longstanding commitment of the Labor Party and the Attorney-General herself. In addition, as a former UN staff member, someone with a keen interest in human rights and a member of the newly established Joint Committee on Human Rights, it is wonderful to see the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner, which responds to the specific recommendation of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that a national human rights institution include within its structure an identifiable commissioner specifically for children's rights. The creation of a National Children's Commissioner is not before time, and it is vital to driving efforts to establish a level playing field for all Australia's children.


To give you an idea of the challenges and obstacles that our most vulnerable children face, I refer to the Listen to children report published by the Australian Child Rights Taskforce last year. It found, for instance, that if you were born into an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander family you were three times more likely than other Australians to die before reaching adulthood. You are also 24 times more likely to be in jail before you turn 17 and almost 10 times more likely to be in out-of-home care. It found that, of the 105,000 homeless people in Australia, 50,000 are under the age of 24, and our out-of-home care system established to look after our most vulnerable children is not in good repair. Children in out-of-home care have increased by 51.5 per cent since 2005. We are not sure why this is happening in Australia, because Australia collects no comprehensive data on these children.


The children in these categories remain underacknowledged and let down by our current policies and public services, and it is for them that a National Children's Commissioner will be of most significance. An appropriately resourced National Children's Commissioner will give Australian kids a voice at the national level and bring attention to issues of neglect, abuse and discrimination. An effectively resourced national advocate for children will offer a powerful focus for hearing children's voices, especially on the subjects of youth justice, child protection, Indigenous health outcomes and homelessness.


The commissioner will have an important role in monitoring, reviewing and commenting on laws, policies, services standards and practices that affect young Australians. As part of the Australian Human Rights Commission, such a position will have the mechanisms to receive and investigate complaints of breaches of children's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child through the implementation of child-specific complaints system. It will be able to assist in and drive law reform and policy development and develop consultation mechanisms that encourage the participation of children. An effective commissioner will collaborate and coordinate with the community and business sectors to develop and strengthen community understanding of the issues and experiences of children, and have the power to intervene in court proceedings involving the rights of children and young people.


The commissioner must advocate for effective data collection on children's health, wellbeing, development and participation and, of course, all of these tasks and functions will depend on appropriate resources. In the past there have been too many instances where a lack of coordinated response by governments and their departments have allowed children and young people to suffer. Youth homelessness and the health and education of Indigenous young people are two obvious examples. We really need bipartisan support for the role of National Children's Commissioner to ensure that the outcomes for children are effective. The commissioner will, of course, have guaranteed independence from government and it should be a matter of common ground to support a properly resourced commission.


This is a welcome and exciting announcement, but the hard work of implementation is ahead of us. My question, then, to the Attorney-General is: how is this budget set up to put the needs of Australian kids front and centre of the development of government policies and programs now and into the future?

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (12:08):  I thank the member for Freemantle for her question on something that she has passionately advocated for throughout her professional career and for which she was most recently able to make a change to the Labor Party platform—something that we are now acting on in this budget.


As the member mentioned, it is something that I also have a strong and long personal attachment to from my position as the shadow minister for children and youth many years ago. More than 10 years ago, in fact, we first announced a policy proposing a National Children's Commissioner, and it gives me great pleasure that, in the budget, we have now dedicated finances to be able to make this a reality. It is an unusual situation to have an extra, separate budget line item rather than simply an increase to the Human Rights Commission's budget. That is because we are conscious of the issues that the member has raised: to make sure that we have sufficient resources and dedicated resources. I know the commission is very excited about this additional formal responsibility being added to its remit.


We have proposed the legislation that will be able to establish this, and though we have not yet had an indication we hope that we will have an indication of support from the opposition. We will make it clear that a National Children's Commissioner has certain responsibilities and does not have others. Those certain responsibilities are to make sure that there is a particular focus on those who, as the member for Fremantle has mentioned, are vulnerable and disadvantaged. Many, many children in Australia have wonderful lives. When you look around the world, Australia is one of the best countries for a child to be born in; however, there are children in Australia who do not get the benefits of that. This commissioner will have particular responsibilities to make sure that those disadvantaged groups in particular are focused on.


I also flag that, unlike other proposals that have been floating around—for example, the proposal by the Greens party—our proposal is that the commissioner will not have a complaint-handling role dealing with individual children, nor will the commissioner take on child protection matters or family law matters for individuals, nor act as a legal guardian. It is important to emphasise that there are other bodies that fulfil those roles. We want this to be an opportunity to advocate for systematic reforms and improvements for children across disadvantaged groups. It is very important that we match the responsibilities to the resources available. An undertaking which required the National Children's Commissioner take on those additional roles would, of course, need to be resourced well above the current proposal, and would duplicate many of the responsibilities for children that lie with other agencies.


I am very excited that this is in the budget. I think it is an important step forward for children. I look forward to having an indication—hopefully sometime soon—from the opposition that is something that they will support. There will, of course, be a debate in the parliament when the legislation is introduced and, after that, an opportunity for us to recruit and employ the first ever National Children's Commissioner.

Mr KEENAN

 (Stirling) (12:13):  I want to ask the Minister for Home Affairs about the process of issuing media releases and informing the Australian public about illegal boat arrivals.


My colleague in the other place Senator Abetz asked some questions about this during the estimates process and we did get some very comprehensive information back from the government. That information told us that Customs reports a boat arrival to the minister's office within about six hours, on average, and that the average time it took the minister's office to issue a publicity release was just over 15 hours—about double that time.


I want the minister to inform the House about how this process works. Has Customs ever formally requested that the minister's office not issue a public media release until the boat has been intercepted, or is it up to the minister's office as to when this release is issued?


According to information that we have been provided with, there have been at least 10 instances where there was a delay of two to four days before informing the public about a boat arrival. I want an explanation as to why that would happen.


I also want him to explain the process of issuing of a media release in relation to the detection of illegal boat arrivals: Once detected, who informs the minister's office? Who is notified? What is the chain of communication and, ultimately, who gives final approval for the release? Is it the minister who gives this final approval?

 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (12:13):  I thank the member for his question. I am not sure what it has got to do with the budget, but I am happy to answer it anyway.


My office is informed when Border Protection Command are aware of a boat. The release is not issued until the boat has been intercepted and the information in that release can be confirmed. From time to time, we will be told that a boat has been detected, and that from the air it can be determined that there might be 30 or 40 people on the boat, but the release is not issued until an interception has occurred and we can confirm those numbers to provide the information that you receive in the press release. That is, I think, the appropriate course of action to make sure that the information that is provided to you and to the media is as accurate as it could possibly be.


You asked who ultimately approves the release—me. It is my name at the top and it is my obligation to make sure that the information is accurate. I cannot speak for previous ministers, but I am assuming that that is the practice that they adopted in the past: to make sure that a statement is issued only once the boat has been intercepted and all of that information can be properly and accurately provided.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (12:14):  Again, my question is to the Minister for Justice. I know the minister is very familiar with my electorate, having himself grown up there. In fact, his mother and father are still constituents of mine; hopefully happy constituents. Apart from being the most multicultural electorate in the whole country, one of the things that really distinguishes my electorate is the number of families. The minister will no doubt recall some 12 years ago areas at the centre of my electorate, particularly around Cabramatta, were very much the destination or the distribution points for drugs and illegal firearms. As a matter of fact, the communities were terrorised in those days by organised crime gangs as they ran these illegal operations around the streets of south-west Sydney. 


It is very concerning that of the 24 shootings that have occurred this year, the vast majority of those have occurred in Western Sydney—a number of them in my electorate and, indeed, in the minister's electorate. I know that this is putting extraordinary pressure on local families. Many think there has got to be a greater police presence. Our police are doing a wonderful job on the streets of south-west Sydney. I personally stay in regular contact with the commanders of the Green Valley police, Cabramatta police, Fairfield police and the Liverpool police. I have a fair understanding about what our police are doing out there. I am wondering whether the minister could outline to the House how these weapons are coming onto our streets? The fact is that there have been 24 shootings and it is having such an effect on local families, who want to bring up their children in safety. Having these headlines appear out there is something which is certainly deleterious for the whole community. Minister, if you would outline to the House your view about where these weapons are coming from?

ng suspended from 12:17 to 12:31





Mr CLARE:
  Once again I thank the member for Fowler for his question. We both have seats, and live, in Western Sydney. We see this up close and understand the impact it is having on our constituents. What is happening, effectively, is a war between rival bikie gangs fighting over drugs and turf, and our communities are in the middle of that fight. There is a real concern, a justified concern, that a stray bullet is going to hit an innocent person and that an innocent person could be killed. That is why in February I ordered a national investigation, headed up by the Australian Crime Commission, into the illegal firearms market. Last month they provided their interim findings, which show that there is a very large local black market made up of tens and tens of thousands of illegal firearms—more than 10,000 illegal handguns alone. A lot of these guns are 10, 20 or 30 years old and they do not have a use-by date. Two of the guns that have been seized in the last year were more than 100 years old and are still working.


This black market is made up of firearms that criminals get from crooked dealers, firearms that were not surrendered or registered after the Port Arthur massacre, firearms that are made or reactivated by backyard operators and thousands of firearms stolen from legitimate owners. In New South Wales alone, 7,000 guns have been stolen by criminals in the last 12 years and not recovered. That is 7,000 unsolved gun crimes and 7,000 guns in the hands of criminals. We saw evidence of this on Channel 7's news recently, a report that contained information from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research in New South Wales. The report revealed a nearly 20 per cent jump in the number of firearms stolen in New South Wales alone in the past 12 months—640 firearms stolen in the past year, most of them in Western Sydney, including 112 pistols, 56 revolvers and 339 shotguns. There were 1,706 firearms stolen in New South Wales in the past three years and, across the country, more than 7,000 firearms have been stolen in the last five years. The most recent example of this came just yesterday. New South Wales police reported eight pistols and eight rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition, stolen from a property near Baradine in the electorate of the member for Parkes. We also face the problem of firearms disappearing from state databases when people move interstate or die. The advice of CrimTrac is that about 1,400 weapons a year fall off the register and into the grey market.


The final report of the Australian Crime Commission will be considered by police ministers next month. At that meeting we will consider a raft of recommendations covering firearms, criminal reforms and other areas. Australia already has some of the toughest gun laws in the world, but there are a number of areas where we can improve upon them. I am working very closely with Mike Gallacher, the New South Wales police minister, on developing a plan to take to this meeting in four weeks time which includes the rollout of the IBIS system right across the country. IBIS does ballistics analysis of firearms that are seized from criminals. It is the sort of testing that can link firearms to previous crimes. At the moment New South Wales and the Federal Police have the system, but it does not exist across the rest of the country. I believe, and Mike Gallacher believes, in the need to roll it out nationwide. There is a lot more we need to do. Police need intelligence on who the shooters are, where the weapons are and what they are being used for. That means breaking down the wall of silence, the fear that exists in our communities of dobbing somebody in, the fear of retribution. It means making weapons harder to steal and easier for them to be seized by law enforcement. It also means tougher firearms laws and the rollout across the country of tracing technology like IBIS. Delivering these reforms will require us to all work together, and I am determined to get it done. Over the next few weeks, I will be travelling the country and meeting with police ministers to make sure that we deliver the reforms that we have to when we meet in June. That is what the people of Western Sydney expect of us and that is what we must deliver.

 (Bradfield) (13:11):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the recent report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the collapse of Trio Capital. This report has found that over 6,000 Australia superannuation and other investors were defrauded of $176 million in the Trio scandal. 


The committee began its inquiry last year on my suggestion after I was approached by a number of constituents who had lost money in the collapse of Trio. This fraud began in late 2003 when an existing reputable funds manager was taken over by those involved in the fraud, but it took almost six years before the regulators—the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission—intervened to shut down Trio's operation. 


It is very concerning that it took the regulators so long to act and it is equally concerning that it took some observations by an alert industry participant, Mr John Hempton of Bronte Capital, before the regulators were spurred into action. It is also concerning that APRA gave evidence to the committee that it had carried out a number of prudential reviews of Trio Capital between 2004 and 2009 but that none of these prudential reviews triggered the regulatory intervention which ultimately occurred—a point which was expressly conceded by officials of APRA before the committee. 


The committee was surprised to discover that there is presently no ongoing criminal investigation into this fraud. One person has been jailed: Mr Shawn Richard. He appears to have been the local foot soldier of what was a scheme that appears to have been masterminded by an international criminal syndicate. Mr Jack Flader, a former US lawyer—formerly resident in Hong Kong and now believed to be resident in Thailand—is suspected of having been the mastermind. Mr Flader is known to have had a long involvement with securities fraud in other parts of the world.
