"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2002-08-29,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, Senator Mason, I present the report of the committee on the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000 [2002] and three related bills, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
This report considers four individual pieces of legislation originally proposed in 2000—three Private Senators' Bills, two introduced by Senator Andrew Murray and one by Senator the Hon John Faulkner, and the provisions of a Private Member's Bill introduced by the Hon Mr Kim Beazley MP. The bills cluster around the core themes of probity in public affairs and public confidence in the institutions of government. They relate, in particular, to the standards expected of parliamentarians, ministers and, in some instances, their staff, in exercising their official duties, to the accessing of parliamentary benefits and to the conduct of advertising campaigns. 
The broad object of the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000 [2002] is that the Commonwealth Parliament should take responsibility for establishing its own standards of conduct and adopt an ethics regime for members and ministers that would have as its cornerstone a workable and enforceable code of conduct. 
The Committee supports this object and the proposed establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to develop a code of conduct and establish mechanisms to set and monitor standards of behaviour. It does not believe, however, that legislation is required at the outset. Instead, it considers that a more logical and workable approach would be to develop an ethics regime incorporating separate codes of conduct for parliamentarians and ministers and then to consider the need for legislation to ensure their enforcement. 
The Committee considers that commitment from members of parliament to a code of conduct and a willingness to see it succeed are essential precursors to this process. It is only with the commitment of the Prime Minister of the day in conjunction with the Leader of the Opposition that the effective development, implementation and enforcement of a code of conduct could work. The Committee supports establishment of a joint committee to facilitate dialogue and as an appropriate body to draft a code of conduct. 
It also supports, in principle, the appointment of a Commissioner for Ministerial and Parliamentary Ethics to develop and implement an education program for members of parliament about ethics in public life and to advise them on the proposed code of conduct. 
While supporting the proposed advisory role, the Committee has difficulties with the investigative role that is also proposed for the Commissioner. It is concerned about:
·	whether it is appropriate for an independent Commissioner to adjudicate on the conduct of members of parliament; 
·	the potential conflict of interest for the Commissioner in advising on, and investigating breaches of, the code of conduct; 
·	the absence of review or appeal provisions for decisions by the Commissioner; and
·	the need for adequate recognition of the unique positions of ministers and the Prime Minister in Australia's system of government. 
The Committee recommends that Parliament establish a joint parliamentary committee to inquire into and develop a code of conduct for members of parliament for adoption by both Houses of Parliament. It further recommends that the Committee draft a separate code of conduct for ministers. This should include a code of practice for the making of government appointments by ministers, and should take account of the position held by the executive in the Commonwealth parliamentary system of government.
The Committee fully supports the intention of the Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements Bill 2000 [No. 2] to put in place measures that would promote transparency and accountability in the use of parliamentary entitlements and allowances through adequate monitoring and scrutiny. It is not convinced, however, that an independent Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements should be established in the first instance, and recommends that the Bill not proceed in its current form.  
The Committee considers that there are opportunities within the current framework to improve accountability in the use of parliamentary entitlements. These would not only assist members of parliament to observe the rules governing the use of their benefits, but also provide the public with information on the nature of the entitlements, on how they are used and for what purposes. 
The Committee considers that the Auditor-General could be given a more active role in auditing the use of parliamentary entitlements. In addition, the Committee considers that the Government could take steps to: 
·	improve and simplify guidelines on entitlements and their use;
·	clarify and improve information available to members of parliament to enable them to better account for expenditure;
·	improve levels of disclosure by publicly reporting more comprehensive statistics on the costs and patterns of expenditure on parliamentary entitlements; 
·	undertake regular internal audit and review of the system administering parliamentary entitlements; and
·	report back to Parliament on progress made in implementing measures identified in ANAO reports on parliamentary entitlements. 
The Electoral Amendment (Political Honesty) Bill 2000 [2002] proposes amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to prohibit the printing, publication or distribution of misleading electoral advertising. The Committee considers it irrefutable that statements made to voters should, as far as possible, be accurate and not misleading, in order that voters can make informed decisions when casting their votes. Whether and how this should be subject to formal regulation rather than relying on the political process is, however, more controversial. 
The Committee's main concerns centre on the practical implications of the Bill. It concluded that further consideration of several issues was needed before the Bill proceeds or is reintroduced in an amended form. These include:
·	the proposal to regulate political advertising in an election period but not other strategies by which political parties seek to persuade voters to support them; 
·	the need to ensure a prompt response to complaints; 
·	the need to prevent misuse of the legislation for the purposes of achieving political advantage; 
·	the proposal for criminal rather than civil remedies for breaches of the Act; and 
·	the extent to which it is appropriate to seek to regulate political discussion. 
The Committee considers that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters could take a more active role in scrutinising political advertising during election campaigns. While no penalty would result from this process, the resultant public exposure of impropriety in a JSCEM report could have the effect of changing undesirable practices. 
The Committee's chief concern with Part 2 of the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000 [2002] is the role and function of the proposed Government Publicity Committee. Among the problems with this proposed model is the potential for the offices of the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman, as members of the committee, to become embroiled in political controversy. Such an outcome would be counter productive, particularly if it were to undermine the confidence of both the public and the Parliament in the impartiality and independence of both offices.
Other difficulties with the proposed Government Publicity Committee include: 
·	the mechanism for appointing the third member of the Committee;
·	the Ombudsman's uncertain jurisdiction in relation to Commonwealth contractors;
·	the unlimited power of delegation proposed for the Ombudsman and Auditor-General;
·	the lack of a review mechanism for committee decisions; and
·	constitutional issues regarding the proper role of the courts in relation to the proposed committee's decisions.
The Committee therefore does not support the introduction of Part 2 of the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000 [2002]. 
The Committee heard more serious concerns regarding the Government Advertising (Objectivity, Fairness and Accountability) Bill 2000. These referred, in particular, to the proposed creation of a serious criminal offence defined by reference to vague and uncertain guidelines, and the appropriateness of the courts traversing matters which are essentially political in nature. For these reasons, the Committee also opposes the introduction of the Government Advertising (Objectivity, Fairness and Accountability) Bill 2000. 
The Committee considers, however, that regulation of the political content of government advertising must be improved, in the face of public criticism. It found that the present guidelines on government advertising offer no guidance to departments or ministers on the avoidance of political content in government advertising campaigns. 
Under the present system, the ministry itself (through the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications) determines what constitutes responsible use of the ministerial office in relation to government advertising, and decisions about content and presentation style rest with the Executive. 
As a minimum the Committee considers that the Guidelines for Australian Government Information Activities: Principles and Procedures should include a clear statement of the fundamental principle that government information programs should not be, or be liable to misrepresentation as being, party political. 
Further, the Committee is not persuaded that amending guidelines for government agencies alone will provide sufficient safeguards against the expenditure of public funds on advertising that promotes party political interests. It accepts that these are essentially political matters and that, consequently, it is for Parliament as a whole to examine, decide and issue detailed guidelines on what is appropriate. 
Therefore, while not supporting the two bills on government advertising, the Committee considers it would be appropriate for this matter to be referred to the proposed Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on a Code of Conduct for Ministers and Other Members of Parliament, for further consideration and development of appropriate guidelines. The guidelines proposed by the Auditor-General and the JCPAA, in combination with evidence received during this inquiry, should be used as a basis for developing a detailed set of standards. 
I should like to thank my fellow committee members who have worked on these bills for their constructive approach to issues that are complex but central to the democratic system which we serve and strive to promote. I should also like to thank the legion of Senate committee staff who, during the 39th Parliament and this Parliament, have assisted the committee's deliberations on these bills and preparation of its report.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-08-29,"—I rise to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. This government's record in relation to higher education has been abysmal in ensuring that the higher education area has received enough funding. They have not been able to ensure that the rate and type of funding for higher education has been maintained. When we look at the debacle in funding for government schools and non-government schools we find that the government are unable to ensure that education is well supported in this country and that they have not been able to turn their minds at all well to progressing the matter.  
The government have dealt with higher education poorly. Let us look at what they should be doing. They need to consider, as Senator Carr has indicated a number of times in this chamber, both the current funding and the recurrent funding for higher education in the short to medium term to ensure that there are places for our students in universities and that there are places for all of the faculties— for law and the higher sciences, including research and development. However, they need to ensure not only that those at the higher end of the market of the educational institutions are looked after but also that funding is dispersed across all of the education institutions so that Australia can enjoy diversity of educational outcomes and that there are sufficient places not only in law, medicine and the higher sciences but also in the social sciences. It is imperative that these matters are progressed and dealt with. 
This government has not been able to deal with these matters in an effective and logical manner. We should be able to look at the government's record and say, `Has it been able to distribute the funds well?' Clearly, the answer is no. The government has not been able to deal with this higher education area in the required manner. On the other hand, the Liberal Party comes up with a think tank on a whole range of areas, but it does not look at the real needs of universities, the needs of the students, the needs of professors and the teachers within the universities to ensure that we rank higher in terms of our university status across the country. Australia is not maintaining its position as it should; it is slipping globally. Australian universities, as I understand, have slipped in the ranking of national and international prestige, and it is not good enough. This government should take heed and ensure that the ranking of Australian universities does not slip, that it is not put in jeopardy by this government and that the education institutions have standing both nationally and internationally to ensure that the educational outcomes are effective and meaningful and also relevant to business needs, relevant to research and development needs and relevant to a raft of social and economic imperatives. Instead, we find that this government is really failing students, teachers and professors in the higher education area.
The higher education bill is, as I have said, a funding amendment bill. That gives us the opportunity to talk about this issue and at least to encourage this government to deal with higher education in a more meaningful and exact way. What we find, however, is that they are not doing that. It is extremely disappointing to me as a Queenslander to find that the international standing of the Queensland University of Technology— which is based in Brisbane and is an excellent university; I studied both a Bachelor of Business in part and a Bachelor of Laws at that university—may slip. If this government's funding is not continued and not supported, and if these matters are not addressed in a proper and appropriate way, then institutions such as that, which have world and critical acclaim, may slip. That would not be good enough. The University of Queensland is also an excellent place for higher learning, research and development. This government has to understand and accept that this issue does need to be addressed in a meaningful and appropriate way to ensure that that university maintains its world-leading status in the higher learning area.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-08-29,"—I rise to speak on the legislation before the Senate, the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002. In doing so, I recognise that there are many members of this parliament, and indeed many members of this Senate, who have been the beneficiaries of the great higher education system that has existed in this country, particularly since the Whitlam era of the 1970s. If one cares to look at the Parliamentary Handbook and look at the tertiary qualifications of many members of parliament, one will find that many of them obtained their tertiary qualifications following the great changes made to our tertiary education system by Gough Whitlam's government.  
It is an interesting fact that if you go through the list of the Howard government ministry, dominated as we know by lawyers—around 70 per cent or more of the frontbench are lawyers; I stand to be corrected as to the actual figure but it certainly is of that magnitude—many of those ministers obtained their tertiary qualifications under the free university education system introduced by Gough Whitlam. It is ironic that those persons, who obtained their qualifications as a result of the great system of free tertiary education introduced by Gough Whitlam, are now part of a government that has consistently, since 1996, sought to undermine those great social changes in tertiary education brought about by a previous Labor government. I will come back to what this government has done to tertiary education in the six-odd years that it has been in government. 
I acknowledge that I was a beneficiary of the tertiary education system and the changes brought about by the Whitlam government when I was fortunate enough to study at university in the 1970s and, again, in the 1980s. That was a time when Gough Whitlam, under his magnificent government, ensured that access to tertiary education would be based upon equity—not on privilege, not on how much money your family had, but on equity. It recognised that talented young people in this country, no matter what socioeconomic background they came from, should be able to leave school and go on to obtain the necessary tertiary qualifications. As I said, if you go through the list of ministers of this government you will find many of them were direct beneficiaries of those great education reforms. 
But what do we see today? We see a higher education system that is almost in crisis, because what has this government done since it came to office? One of the first things it did when it came to office in 1996, with its slash and burn fetish that it had for the government's budget, was to cut over $3 billion from universities. We can all remember Senator Vanstone, who was then the minister for education and at that time in the cabinet, adopting an approach to finding cuts in education which was like that of Tom Collins in the novel Such is Life—`Pick a number, any number; 10 per cent sounds okay. We will cut education funding by 10 per cent.' `Such is life,' as Tom Collins said. Unfortunately, for the lives of many students since then it has got tougher and tougher. Indeed it has become impossible for many young people to access higher education in this country today.
Funding in the amount of $3 billion has been cut from universities. TAFE funding has been cut by $240 million. The amount of HECS repayments collected has increased. Funding in the amount of $170 million has been slashed from rural and regional universities, at a time when rural and regional Australia has been under increasing pressure because of the decline in the agricultural export base of this country. There have also been other pressures on rural and regional areas.
One of the great things that rural and regional Australia had going for it was the regional universities that were established and supported by the previous Labor governments under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. We put regional universities on the map. We raised their status and ensured that new facilities were built. One of the great pleasures I had when we were in government was attending the opening of the Southern Cross University campus at Coffs Harbour. What did this government do to rural and regional Australia? It took $170 million from those universities. You have to wonder where the National Party was when those decisions were being made. 
There have been huge cuts and neglect in the area of research investment. Indeed, the Chief Scientist on one occasion condemned this government's approach, because we were the only advanced Western nation in which investment in R&D was going backwards. 
That is the situation that has occurred in higher education under this government over the last six years. It is a disgrace that ministers of this government who were the beneficiaries of the great Labor education reforms, as I said, who were able to obtain their university degrees largely at no cost to themselves, are now putting an ever increasing cost burden on students and the families of children who wish to attend university. 
Recently, it has emerged that people in Australia pay amongst the highest study costs in the world. An international comparison of tuition fees and living expenses conducted by the International Comparative Higher Education Finance and Accessibility Project has found that Australian students and their families pay more to attend public university than students in Britain, the United States, Europe, New Zealand and Japan. Indeed, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for education, Jenny Macklin, has pointed out, since 1996 the contribution that Australian students make to the cost of their education has risen by 85 per cent. I repeat: there has been an 85 per cent increase in the costs that Australian students and their families have to bear in order to obtain an education.
One has to ask the question: what is it that motivates a government in this day and age, when education is increasingly important not just to students seeking to obtain qualifications and subsequent employment but to the very future of our nation, to attack the higher education system? Frankly, I have never been able to fathom it, other than to believe that this government, in its slashing and burning of government programs and, wherever possible, shifting the focus to user pays and the private sector, does not see any distinction between education policy and any other area of public policy. We see it in health, where it promotes the private sector and cuts funding to public hospitals. It props up private health insurance funds to the tune of billions of dollars while doing nothing about the decrease in bulk-billing. Equally, we are seeing this policy in the area of public education and tertiary education.
That brings me to this specific legislation. Whilst a number of the matters contained in these bills are not necessarily controversial, there is one proposal in particular about which the opposition is greatly concerned— that is, the proposal contained in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 to extend the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, PELS, to four additional higher education providers. This is a controversial move because at this time the government is in the midst of a wide ranging inquiry into the provision of higher education in this country. What is of great concern is that the measure contained in this bill which extends that scheme to four additional education providers that do not currently come within the ambit of the scheme could potentially pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry. The government has failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. I want to quote from the minority report of the Labor senators on the inquiry into this bill conducted by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. The minority report states:
One measure, however, has potentially profound implications for the future of higher education financing policy in Australia: the proposal to extend access to the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS) to four additional higher education providers that are not currently listed on Table A or Table B of HEFA's Section Four.
The threshold issue here is the Government's declared rationale in singling out these four institutions for favoured treatment in access to PELS, especially in the light of the current inquiry underway in higher education. This wide-ranging Commonwealth Government inquiry is considering, among other matters, the desirability of, and possible mechanisms for providing public subsidies to the 80 or 90 private providers of higher education in Australia. In this context, it is argued by Labor senators that a decision to extend access to the public subsidy inherent in PELS to a select group of private providers should be carefully considered: many stakeholder groups in the higher education sector have argued that such a move would pre-empt the outcome of the current review and, notwithstanding contrary possible outcomes to that process, would pave the way for future extension of Commonwealth subsidies to private higher education institutions.
I will interpose there. Our concern here is that, in the midst of its overall and wide ranging inquiry, this government is pre-empting the outcome of that inquiry by taking a decision through the bill to specifically provide access to the public subsidy that is contained within the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to a limited number—four— of private higher education providers. Further, this excellent minority report of the Labor senators states: 
The Government in its report identifies a number of issues that have arisen in the context of the current Inquiry. The first is the question of whether or not public subsidies should be provided to private higher education providers. In this Minority Report by Labor Senators it will be argued, first, that clear evidence has been presented to the Committee to the effect that a public subsidy is attached to the provision of access to PELS. If access to this scheme is made available to the four private providers listed in this context in the current bill, then it follows that these providers, as well as their postgraduate students availing themselves of PELS, will benefit from a significant taxpayer subsidy.
In public policy, a foundation principle is this: where public subsidies are provided, there must be public accountability.
It will be argued that these four providers are not currently subject to a level of public scrutiny and accountability arrangements that is comparable with the requirements attached to public subsidies going to public higher education institutions. This matter is also identified in the Government's report. In addition, these providers are not subject to the same legal regime in areas such as discrimination and industrial relations.
It is a lengthy quote, but it is an excellent summary of the concerns that the opposition has about this legislation. If honourable senators take the time to read the rest of the minority report, it outlines in some detail the basis for the findings that I have just referred to.
To sum up, one of the major concerns we have with this legislation is that through this bill this government is, firstly, potentially pre-empting the outcome of its own wide ranging public inquiry into higher education. The fact that it is making decisions like that during the midst of a full inquiry raises a serious concern about its approach to higher education funding. Secondly, this bill extends the operation of a public subsidy which is contained within the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to a select and discrete group of private higher education providers. Thirdly—and this is the particularly important point—these four providers do not have the same public scrutiny and accountability requirements placed upon them as those that are placed upon public and other institutions that receive access to the funding under PELS. These four providers are not subject to the same legal requirements that apply to other institutions in areas such as discrimination and industrial relations.
When you put all that together, once more you see this government's bias towards the private sector. I do not say that the private sector in education or in the health industry should not be supported; the opposition have never said that. But what we do say is that the primary responsibility of government is to the public sector. It should not be undermining the public sector in education as it has been doing for six years, and at the same time it should not be providing special consideration to private providers.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2002-08-29,"—In speaking to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002, there are a number of areas that I would like to address. I will make some specific comments about the bill, but first I would like to point out that higher education in Australia finds itself in dire straits, a result of sustained cuts and poorly allocated resources by the coalition government. This government has shown its contempt for the value of higher education and the contribution to society that higher education makes, and so it should be stated that any proposed legislation or amendments from the government in this area need to be treated with suspicion and examined carefully lest, Honourable Senators, we be unwitting accomplices in a further degeneration of such a key sector of our society.
The importance of higher education to society cannot be underestimated. The ALP has always recognised that an educated and skilled population brings social and economic benefits to all areas of the community. An educated population is a prosperous one, and so higher education must be made accessible to the whole community so that all can benefit. Unfortunately, this view is not shared by the current government. Since 1996 we have witnessed an endless stream of cuts to the funding of all tertiary institutions, a misallocation of ever decreasing resources and, perhaps more insidiously, a commitment to the privatisation of the higher education sector.
The litmus test of an effective and efficient higher education sector is how widely accessible it is to the community and whether the educational services provided are of the highest quality. Privatisation, along with the continual decrease in funding, has ensured that this government has failed both fundamental aspects of the test that I have just outlined. Let me refer to the first budget of this government in 1996. In 1996, several hundred million dollars were cut in one stroke from higher education funding. Since then—six years later—not a lot has changed. Cumulatively $3 billion has been slashed from the sector, the HECS liability for all students has increased, the HECS repayment thresholds have decreased, and research and development funding has also decreased. Not only are undergraduate students suffering from these cuts; those students who want to go into postgraduate study find that there are scant resources available to them. 
But the problems run even deeper than these appalling cuts to government funding that I have just referred to. The coalition has also forced universities to accept fee paying students, a situation that has resulted in those with the ready cash often being prioritised in their entry to university over those who need to rely on HECS to study. Universities have started reorganising their operations to attract such full fee paying students, those students being, of course, more lucrative to the institutions than those that depend on HECS to attend to study. The peripheral costs imposed on students also continue to increase. Universities now rely on ancillary fees as a source of income. Youth Allowance and Austudy and Abstudy payments continue to be insufficient to support students. As a consequence, students have to work long hours as casuals or part-time employees to be able to afford to attend university and to support themselves.
During my time as a lecturer at the University of Adelaide, over a period of eight years I witnessed departments, schools and faculties wilt under these funding pressures. I had students coming to me and begging for leniency over their study because they could not make ends meet without working far too many hours. I taught students a degree that was being devalued and undermined by the lack of resources that the university could dedicate to it. All this was because the government penny-pinched with higher education. In fact, the University of Adelaide, my former employer, serves as a good example of how higher education is being eroded by the government's funding arrangements. This university, regarded as being a prestigious `sandstone university' with a proud history in law, medicine and the liberal arts, has been forced to cut these once fundamental courses and now actively pursues the private dollar in the areas of science and engineering to balance its budget. In fact, it now draws only slightly more than 40 per cent of its total income from public funding—and, after all, it is a public university.
We all know that a tertiary education brings long-term benefits to the community, yet it is equally true that failing to provide accessible quality tertiary education for the community brings long-term costs. These long-term costs are now starting to be recognised by groups around the country. Research organisations constantly call for more funding and only recently, as my Labor colleague Tanya Plibersek pointed out last week in the House of Representatives, scientists highlighted, during National Science Week last week, the impending social costs which will result from the government's myopia over higher education funding. The cuts to science funding will not be noticed this year or even next year, but the deeper cuts will be noticed in years to come.
To my mind, the bill that we have before us today, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002, does nothing at all to address any of the higher education sector issues that I have briefly been mentioning. Instead, it will further erode the accessibility of our education system. My concerns with the bill revolve around two major areas. First, it sets a precedent for other private institutions beyond the four institutions named in the legislation to seek access to the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, or PELS, and ultimately to other public funds. Secondly, the legislation does not include any measures to ensure that the private providers meet quality assurance and accountability levels comparable with those of public institutions. 
The four private institutions included in this legislation—Bond University, Melbourne College of Divinity, Tabor College and the Christian Heritage College—are just four of over 80 private higher education providers in Australia. The legislation outlines very little by way of specification as to why these four institutions were chosen. The government has said little on why these specific four were chosen. In his second reading speech, the minister indicated:
The extension of PELS to these four institutions levels the playing field for competition in fee-paying postgraduate coursework degrees and further extends opportunities for institutions to provide and students to undertake fee-paying postgraduate coursework.
Yet what the minister does not say is that the courses offered at these four institutions are not exclusive; other institutions also offer equivalent courses. The government has no real reasons for selecting these four institutions above others. The real agenda of this government is to establish a precedent for further extending public funds to other private institutions. What the minister really wants is a playing field where only the rich are kicking goals and the rest of society, the people most in need of accessible education, are reduced to watching from the sidelines. Pretty soon, they will not even be able to get through the stadium gates.
The other major concern that I have with this legislation is the lack of accountability and quality assurance measures that these institutions are submitted to. Currently, these private institutions are not subject to the same scrutiny over their policies or outcomes. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 will allow them access to public funding; therefore, it should also include measures that ensure accountability and reporting processes that are consistent with public universities. Similarly, this legislation should ensure that the quality of the courses undertaken at the private institutions matches those of public universities. I am not in any way suggesting that the quality standards are currently below those of public universities, but simply that regulation is needed to ensure that money is not simply being thrown at private providers whose standards may not be the same as those of public universities.
My Senate colleagues Senator Carr and Senator Crossin have articulated amendments which I believe will strengthen the quality assurance, accountability and reporting requirements of the four providers as stated in the minority report of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee on this piece of legislation. I urge members to support these amendments. The state of higher education in this country is in disarray, and all this government can do is put up shoddy, ad hoc legislation like this bill.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-08-29,"—I rise also to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002, which is a bill that reflects this government's ideological creep towards not so much a user-pays model as a students-and-their-parents pay model for higher education funding. The arrival of the higher education system at this end point, so desired by those opposite, will further entrench the sons and daughters of the privileged in their positions in society via a university education at the expense of the disadvantaged who, since the days of the Whitlam government, have enjoyed the ability to take higher education, regardless of their social or economic circumstances. The Howard government's ideologically driven model for higher education will impact particularly on rural students who, as we know from the work of Professor Margaret Alston, grow up in households which enjoy an average income considerably below the national average.
As the previous speaker, Senator Kirk, said, and I am sure others have said, this bill provides for the extension of the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme—PELS as it is known——to four additional institutions: Bond University, Melbourne College of Divinity, Tabor College in Adelaide, South Australia, and the Christian Heritage College. This gives students at these institutions access to postgraduate study loans on the same basis as other students, but it does not make the institutions eligible for public funding. The bill updates the funding amounts provided for in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. It also provides additional funding for the establishment of a graduate diploma in environment and planning at the University of Tasmania, with six associated scholarships. The bill adjusts funding levels in the Higher Education Funding Act and the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to permit the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU access to the funding schemes of the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council. Finally, the bill provides for an additional funding cap for the Australian Research Council competitive research schemes in 2006, consistent with the current budget forward estimates so that the minister can approve ARC grants for a period of four years. There is also a technical amendment to correct previous drafting errors in HEFA. 
I note that, even in that regard, the financial commitment to university operations has been reduced by $14 million through an allowance for the revision of the estimates of the HECS repayments receipts for the year. I endorse Senator Carr's comments in this regard that this characterises a record of negligence by this government, continued by the current minister. I endorse the comments that Senator Carr makes about Mr Nelson going around the country and pretending to be the friend of universities, while actually championing the cause of harming the sector. The claim that the government is putting less money into the system because there is more private money coming into the system is based on the assumption that I started with, and that is that students and their parents are paying more. The government is therefore trying to redistribute responsibility for the funding of education away from the public purse, away from government, and on to students in a way that will see a rapid and dramatic increase in the cost of higher education for students and their parents. We know that the government is actively pursuing the prospect of extending the real rate of interest of HECS. One wonders what that will cost students.
I want to focus my attention on one particular area in which this government's funding—or lack of it—for the higher education sector is impacting on rural communities and particularly on the veterinary sector. I noted in question time yesterday that Senator Ian Macdonald thought he would make a couple of cheap points on the basis of the launch of the opposition's discussion paper on rural veterinarians and a stronger livestock industry. To obtain what he thought was a cheap point, he chose to misrepresent what we are actually saying in relation to this sector. You see, we are trying to make a very serious point about a problem which will face a very valuable sector of the Australian economy. Senator Macdonald said that I had claimed that there was a lack of students wanting to be vets. In fact, that is not what I said: I said there was a lack of students willing or able to take up livestock practice, due largely to education funding cuts by the Howard government. There is quite a difference, but one would have to say that Senator Macdonald never let the facts get in the way of a cheap laugh.
—That's not fair!
—That is quite fair. In fact, Senator, that is exactly what he was trying to do, as I have just demonstrated, because he said that I said there was a lack of students wanting to be vets when the reality is that there are so few places and the scores are so high that the students who are likely to be vets and who want to be in livestock practices cannot get in. That is the reality.
What do we know about the veterinary sector? Firstly, we know that, over all, undergraduate enrolments are increasing but, according to the deans of various universities, students are coming from the cities. Studies have shown that, if a student comes from a rural background, after 10 years they are twice as likely to remain in rural practice. We also know that postgraduate enrolments in this area have fallen steadily over the last five years, and that is an area that this bill is trying to enhance. But in the veterinary sector—a sector which the minister himself said yesterday attracts people who have to get a score higher than the score necessary to get into medicine—the number of students seeking to go into postgraduate enrolments is falling. One would have thought, given the student body that these students are being drawn from, and given their scholastic achievements, that you would not see a fall and that you would actually see an increase as the number of students who try to get into these courses drove the scores even higher because there are so few places. 
We also find that one in five students in these courses is there on a fee-paying basis as an overseas student. These are required, of course, in order to fund the vet schools in the absence of adequate Commonwealth funding. I think one has to assume the majority of overseas students go home to practise. We only graduate about 300 students per year, and that is including overseas students. But, based on the average—there are 2,476 rural vets at the moment, according to information that I have been able to gather, and their average age is about 50—we need around 165 graduates a year going into rural practices just to hold the numbers. This is not for any improvement but just to hold the numbers.
So we see the opposition presenting a serious attempt to create discussion in a policy area which, frankly, is suffering because of this government's lack of financial commitment to a very important sector of the economy. What has this government done? It made some promises at the last election: it pledged to address the problem by holding an industry workshop and conducting an inquiry into the problems of the industry, based on the outcome of the workshop; and it put forward a proposal to have bonded scholarships valued at the princely sum of $2 million over five years. We had a workshop in February this year. It made some proposals after significant delays by the Prime Minister's office which caused much frustration to industry participants. The study that was promised is at last under way. However, its report, originally expected by the industry in August—obviously, that is not going to happen—has fallen back to November, a delay that I think is fully attributable to the Prime Minister's apparent opinion that this was not an issue of national import and a testament to the impotence of the agriculture minister in regard to his cabinet colleagues. So that is the sort of problem we have. When we looked at the issue of bonded scholarships, promised at budget estimates earlier this year when I asked questions of the government about precisely what they were doing with regard to the model that they would use to apply the promised $2 million over five years, they were still working on it. Six months after the election, they had no idea what they were going to do.
Of course, yesterday we saw some criticism of the opposition in this area again by Senator Macdonald. His response to the part of our discussion paper where we talk about training more vets to help with postborder protection was that it was worth a chuckle because it would take staff away from the front line. Secondly, he said that postborder protection is in fact a measure that is the responsibility of the state government. Of course, it is a function of this government's mantra that everything is the state's responsibility that he says that, but the fact of the matter is that the lack of vets generally, whether it is a state or federal responsibility, means that we cannot have an adequate postborder security function in terms of monitoring and controlling disease once it has passed our borders. During the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom imported vets from all over the world to deal with its problems. A lot of Australian vets went to the United Kingdom, where they earned much better money than they do here. The problem is that some of those vets will not come back.
If we do not have an adequate program to train veterinary surgeons who are likely to work in rural and regional Australia, then industries which leverage billions of dollars of exports for this country will be denied the opportunity to maintain their relative disease-free status and the probability of the introduction of dangerous diseases and the spread of existing diseases will be heightened. That is why this is a very serious area and why the way that this government funds higher education is a very important issue for rural Australia and the veterinary community. That is why Senator Macdonald's cheap shot yesterday—which, as I said earlier, did not accurately reflect our policy decision— was quite irresponsible. It was quite irresponsible because he was trying to belittle a serious attempt at policy discussion in this country on an area which impacts on a significant part of the rural economy. 
In relation to our discussion document, I was visited in my office earlier this week by Professor Reuben Rose, Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Science from the University of Sydney, and Professor Lonnie King, Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine from Michigan State University. Both gentlemen congratulated the opposition on having made a serious attempt to canvass a proper discussion of an important policy area which is relevant to rural communities. It is not just relevant to Australia. Professor King indicated that these are the sorts of issues that need to be discussed, and are being discussed, in his own country and that there are other issues which he is prepared to assist with, in terms of expanding a proper policy on the development of veterinary science resources for the livestock industries in this country.
I come back to this piece of legislation. It is, yet again, a model in which this government seeks to go down the line of transferring responsibility away from the public purse and onto the private purse—and therefore onto students and parents, driving away from university people who are not financially well-endowed enough to afford it. It is said in relation to veterinary science that about 80 per cent of the students who attend the faculty at Sydney University live on the North Shore of Sydney. What is the chance that a significant number of those young people will decide to set up their practices in rural Australia? Studies show—this is not my opinion—that that is not very likely. We now have a model where there are a limited number of places. Demand is driven by the number of people who want to get into those places. Those who do not have the scores, and who can afford to, can pay. Those who do not get the scores, but have the aptitude and the ability to complete the course and are likely to work in the livestock industries—an important economic sector for this country— cannot get into Sydney University. They cannot afford to go there; their parents cannot afford to pay for them.
Who is missing out? They are missing out, but the country is also missing out. The country is missing out because, as our ageing rural veterinary population retires, we will not have the replacements for them. That is why we are pursuing a serious set of policy discussions. We want to have a proper policy on this. The government made some promises before the last election. They have been very tardy in delivering on those but, frankly, the information that we are gathering indicates that that very limited response will not be enough to correct the problem that this country will face. So I am very pleased to see that we have the serious attention of the real players in this sector. The cheap political points from Senator Macdonald will disappear, as they were destined to, within a day or two. The reality is that we will have a policy which has the support of the business sectors in rural Australia and the education sector, and maybe the government will eventually have to pick it up.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-08-29,"—Universities have been able to rely on a strong and undiminished commitment of public funding from the government. Both Commonwealth funding and places are increasing over the forthcoming triennium. The government is also currently delivering a significant injection of funding through the Backing Australia's Ability initiative and other measures. The benefits of that package are already being enjoyed by universities. In total, Backing Australia's Ability commits an additional $3 billion over five years for science, research and innovation. It includes an additional $1.5 billion for the university sector. The government's policies in recent years have facilitated the transition from a highly dependent sector to one that is more independent of government, having a broader funding base, greater flexibility and more autonomy.
However, as senators are aware, the government is committed to a review of higher education to examine ways in which we can build on the strengths of the sector, increase diversity and recognise the special role of institutions. The Crossroads paper includes a frank discussion of some of the options available in Australia. These options are now open for debate. A well-educated and skilled work force that embraces lifelong learning is essential for Australia's economic growth. As part of its commitment to lifelong learning, the government announced the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme in 2001 as part of Backing Australia's Ability. The scheme, which commenced in 2002, encourages extended participation in education and helps Australians update their skills and acquire new skills. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 provides for the extension of PELS to four additional institutions: Bond University, Melbourne College of Divinity, Tabor College and Christian Heritage College. 
This measure fulfils an election commitment of the government and was announced in the budget. It gives students at these institutions access to postgraduate study loans on the same basis as other students but does not make the institutions eligible for public funding. We estimate that some 2,200 students will benefit over the next four years. A new graduate diploma in environment and planning at the University of Tasmania will advance the cause of environmental sustainability by helping to address the growing demand for professionals versed in the complexities of integrated social, economic and environmental planning. The course will also allow Tasmanians interested in local environmental planning issues to stay in Tasmania rather than having to relocate to the mainland.
These bills will assist institutions to streamline their administration. We are proposing to simplify the acquittal requirements for Commonwealth grants so that universities will not have to comply with different requirements for different types of grants. The requirement for institutions to send a notice of liability to overseas fee-paying students will be removed under the bills. There is currently no requirement to send liability notices to domestic fee payers. The government think it is best left to each institution to determine such administrative processes. We are also proposing to streamline the administration of ARC grants and the provision of expert advice to the ARC board. The minister will be able to formally approve research grants for a period of four years rather than the two currently allowed by the act, thus reducing the amount of paperwork involved in administering grants and also providing certainty to grant holders.
The ARC board will be able to create advisory committees—other than those specifically involved in advising on funding allocations—without the approval of the minister, thus streamlining the processes for the ARC board to acquire expert advice. The bills will permit the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University to access the competitive funding schemes of the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council. The measure is part of the ongoing efforts of this government to create a more strategic and internationally competitive research system in Australia. The bills provide for internal transfer of funding amounts between sections of HEFA that will enable the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU to participate in the government's performance-based block research funding schemes. This is also an important step in building a more integrated and competitive higher education research system.
The bills contain a number of technical amendments. Funding amounts are varied to reflect revised estimates for HECS liabilities. This variation has no effect on the level of funding provided to institutions. Funding for the Commonwealth's contribution to superannuation costs is increased in line with revised estimates of the Commonwealth superannuation liability, and provision is made for an advance of operating grants to the University of Adelaide and subsequent repayments. Minor technical amendments to the bills change two sections of HEFA to reflect changes in taxation legislation. They amend the name of Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education in schedule 1, which is currently listed as Batchelor College. They also remedy two minor drafting errors in HEFA. I thank honourable senators for their contributions.

HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-08-29,"—The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2002 Budget Measures) Bill 2002 before the Senate today has three central amendments. Two of them concern technical adjustments to the legislation affecting war widows— namely, bringing into line the provision of backdating so that widows are not disadvantaged when they transfer to the income support supplement from Centrelink benefits and, secondly, the regularisation of an oversight in the original drafting affecting the inclusion of a non-pensioner's partner's income in the means test. Both of these are straightforward and are supported by the opposition. The key issue in relation to the bill, however, is the proposal to index the income support supplement—otherwise known as the `frozen rate'—as well as the service pension paid to war widows in their own right as veterans. In addressing the issues, I would also like to explore and set out for the benefit of the Senate—and for the veteran community— some of the issues within the policy framework for war widows. I do this deliberately because it seems to me that policy in relation to widows is pretty ad hoc and is full of inconsistencies and inequity. 
Let me say at the outset that I do not propose to retrace the full history of the war widows pension, but some perspective is necessary to explain why we have come to this proposal today and to correct the cheap political shot of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the time of the introduction of the bill—namely, that this bill will `end Labor's freeze on the war widows income support supplement' and `end Labor's unfair treatment of our special war widows'. This is pretty rich coming from this government, whose term with respect to the veterans portfolio has seen a total stagnation of policy and a process of stalling and avoidance in the face of growing discontent within the veteran community. It also clearly demonstrates the policy vacuum we are facing with the Howard government on veterans policy because there is not the slightest inkling evident that this proposal forms part of any context with or overall view on war widows.
By way of brief background, the war widows pension was first provided for in the War Pensions Act 1914. It seems that it may have been paid as compensation for war loss and not as income support or as income maintenance, which were available under the Old Age and Invalids Act 1908; hence the pension has never been subject to any means test. Nevertheless, dependence on the veteran has long been the test. This, of course, is a test of financial support, not one of emotional or personal loss. It is, in fact, the single biggest confounding issue which pervades policy on war widows pensions and it is one which this government has compounded rather than simplified, which I will address later.
As recorded in the Bills Digest on this matter, there has been much debate about the appropriate level of the war widows pension. It is interesting to note that until 1952 it was linked to the rate of pay of the rank of the deceased veteran. The standard rate was introduced in 1972, but there has been continuing controversy about the rationale for the payment of pensions to widows, the linkage with the social security systems of income support and other allowances, the existence of a few myths and legends, and the overall pragmatic view taken regardless of principle and policy that everything depends on the budget at the end of the day. The latter, it would seem, is the only common factor when considering all the idiosyncrasies of the war widows pension. It continues to this very day with the Howard government's own special anomalies—as it likes to call them. 
The policy with respect to war widows entitlements is very complex. It is also confusing, contradictory and unfair—all of which is the product of years of ad hockery. Let me give the Senate some examples by turning to compensation, income support or recognition. Although many assert that the war widows pension is compensation for the loss of a loved one, this is not clear. I suggest that we may be splitting hairs somewhat. It certainly is compensation for personal loss, but it is also compensation for loss of income earning capacity of the deceased veteran— or, by another description, income support. Originally, it was both. But changes over the years seem to have been driven more by the economic factor rather than the non-economic factor.
Certainly, if we look at subsequent policy formulation, we see that it has been treated as income support—firstly, because it was cancelled on remarriage, which ended dependency and, secondly, because the current government changed the indexation to match the policy applying to the age pension—that is, indexation by CPI or 25 per cent of MTAWE, whichever is the lesser. This form of indexation is, as far as I am aware, restricted to income support pensions so that they keep pace with the standard of living, as opposed to CPI, which applies to allowances and compensation, which are indexed by CPI only to keep pace with the cost of living. Yet it remains tax free and is not means tested— millionaires are fully entitled to claim—both of which are taken as signs that the pension is a right as a form of recognition for personal loss.
The decision in 1986 to limit widows' access to the war widows pension as well as the full rate of social security benefits, although expressed as a budget saving initiative, clearly was motivated by the notion that the widows pension was indeed a substantial form of income support, and that access to other forms of income support benefits should be limited—hence the frozen rate, as it is termed, and now the ISS, as it has become. From that time forward, widows were unable to access a range of income support benefits available under the Social Security Act, including the Jobsearch allowance, Newstart, sickness allowance or other special benefits.
I turn to dependency and marriage. Notwithstanding the above comments, and consistent with the attitude that the widows pension is a right, the cancellation of the pension on remarriage was removed prospectively in 1984 and retrospectively last year. Yet you do not have to be legally married: if you establish that there was a marriage-like relationship, that will suffice. However, separation is not a disqualification for legal marriage but it is for nonlegal relationships. So not only do we have complete policy confusion and contradiction as to the purpose of the war widows pension, but also we have substantial inconsistency and unfairness. 
We also have a conundrum to which there are quite a few widows who want an answer, because despite remarriage no longer being a disqualification, a widow is still not entitled to claim if she remarried prior to 1984 and never claimed, or if an application had been formally rejected on the grounds of remarriage prior to 1984. That is, the widow must have been in receipt of payment as a war widow to have it restored. If you had a claim rejected or never applied, there is nothing to restore.
Divorce results in immediate termination of eligibility. This, of course, produces the very common situation of a long suffering woman who divorces her veteran husband, perhaps after many difficult years of marriage, sometimes for her own safety, only to find that it is the veteran's new partner who is entitled to the full pension on his death. Yet if she had simply separated, her right would have been preserved. As I understand it, this can result in two widows pensions being paid—one to the original separated wife and the other to any new de facto partner. 
The notion of dependency also applies to children and, as we know, there is attached to the widows pension what is called a `domestic allowance' of $25 which, as I understand it, had its origins as a payment for children. It is not indexed but it has survived whether or not there are children being cared for. Because of this it is regarded by many as an intrinsic part of the war widows pension but, due to its history, it is treated separately and is not indexed. In the interests of simplification it would be better integrated into the whole pension and indexed. Certainly, in the face of family payments also available from Centrelink, it would seem to be a total anachronism in policy terms but it has nevertheless survived.
It is a great pity that the policy construct for war widows is so difficult because Australia as a nation has always honoured and respected the pain and loss of a loved one in war, and we have always honoured the promise to care for those left behind, commensurate with the values of the time. Those values, of course, have not changed but community circumstances have. The circumstances of 1914-18, which set the war widows pension in place, are simply no longer relevant. We do have a modern scheme, the Military Compensation Scheme, which does reflect these circumstances but, because of dual eligibility in limited circumstances, the two schemes interact, and interact badly. There are a number of issues here to which I will return in due course.
Having made that comment in passing, and having set out some of the factual background, let me return to the primary purpose of the bill—the indexation of the ISS. Whatever the intent may have been in 1986 to terminate war widows' access to social security benefits, and to freeze the rate then being paid, it is clear that unrestricted access to two streams of benefits—one from the VEA and the other from the Social Security Act—was difficult to justify in policy terms or in budgetary terms, simply because it contained an element of dual payment.
There should be no doubt, however, that we on this side fully support the notion that war widows are entitled to a level of compensation and support, in the event of the loss of their partner in the defence of the nation, over and above their peers, most of whom are on the age pension. This has been longstanding community policy, regardless of the fact that the probability of death from war-caused injuries diminishes rapidly with time, to a level now where many widows who are unsuccessful in establishing war causation feel aggrieved. It is clear now, though, that with the passing of time the difference between those war widows without extensive other income and their age pension peers is now an appropriate one and that indexation in the manner proposed in the bill is also appropriate. It is for that reason that Labor supports the bill. 
Although incomplete, for reasons I will mention in a moment, it is in part also good policy. It reflects the respect and care promised to veterans that their loved ones would be looked after but does not treat them purely as an element within the welfare field. It recognises war widows as a special category of Australians to whom we all owe a debt and with a fixed additional benefit over their age/widowed peers. The decision not to amend the Social Security Act in the same way, and to thereby transfer widows to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, is similarly supported. We agree that wherever possible veterans should be serviced in a holistic way by the one responsible agency. Our support for this bill, however, should not be taken as an indication that all is well in the matter of care for war widows. There are some outstanding issues which need attending to.
The first, which has long been an issue for Legacy and the War Widows Guild, is the inclusion of rent assistance within the frozen rate. There are approximately 8,800 war widows renting privately and 4,300 renting publicly, with an unknown number not in receipt of income support whose accommodation details are unknown. Those renting privately, unlike anyone else in the community in comparable financial circumstances, can get no rent assistance at all. If we accept, as we do, that the erosion of the value of the ISS has now declined to a level where the combined value of the ISS and the war widows pension appropriately reflects the status of widows, the continuing inclusion of rent assistance within it becomes a new anomaly—to use the government's own hackneyed descriptor. What is more, it affects and discriminates against the most needy.
Then there is the nonpayment of ISS to widows who live overseas. Why they should be selected for such special discrimination is unknown, but there would seem to be little justification for it, except as a money saving device. Next, I repeat the point that I have made to most of the annual congresses of ex-service organisations in the last two months: namely, the plight of veterans' widows who are under 57 years of age and have no children. It is amazing that the needs of these women have gone unattended for so long when, in the last six years, over $2½ billion has been added to the veterans budget.
Take the case of a widow of a TPI who, we can assume, has cared for her husband for the term of their marriage—in some cases with accompanying harmful behaviour— with a long dependence on veterans benefits and has therefore been unable to accumulate savings and own a house or many other material assets of value and who, on his death, would be entitled only to the war widows pension and unable to get even Newstart from Centrelink. Such a person's income would fall from a joint value in excess of $1,400 per fortnight to just $446 per fortnight, and she would lose her concession card as well. It is ironic that, if she were in good health, she would in fact be $20 per fortnight better off if she did not seek the widows pension and the gold card but accepted the service pension at the single rate, rent assistance and Newstart, even with its harsh means test.
There may be up to 1,600 widows in this category and, no doubt, a reasonable proportion will fit the example I have just cited. Yes, they may have the gold card, but it is of no value if they healthy and it certainly does not buy the groceries. I mention this example not only because a small number of widows are doing it tougher than all of the others but also because it shows just how complex the issues are, simply because no attempt has ever been made to make the war widows pension mesh properly with the social security system.
The key point, though, is that this bill before us today effectively reverses the approach taken in 1986, which we should agree ought to be applied to all of the other limitations imposed at that time. For example, why should a young, healthy widow, with or without children, be precluded from access to Newstart and all the supporting training programs that go with it? Why should she be denied access to these other benefits simply because she is a war widow who, we now accept as a result of this bill, is entitled to a fixed means test benefit over and above that paid to her peers? This bill would have been an ideal opportunity to have done so and, if my numbers are right, it would cost very little—possibly less than the mobile phone bill for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. 
Earlier in this speech I raised the question of whether we, as a parliament, could continue to consider the maze of complexity surrounding the war widows pension against the needs of women in modern society, and I suggested that it might be timely to draw a line to `grandmother' the existing policy, especially given that there is a modern equivalent. As I understand the government's proposal for a new single military compensation scheme, due to the differences between the two schemes and the differing values of the VEA pension and the MCRS lump sum, particularly for the younger widows, a choice ought to be offered on which widows could decide, on receipt of financial advice, depending on their financial circumstances.
As we know, lump sums are very attractive to young widows, as they provide the capital for them to re-establish their lives. But by choosing the lump sum over a pension they may, over their life, lose out simply because the pension, as a tax free, indexed and non-means tested benefit, is worth more. This is not a fair choice and, given the grudging acceptance now being given by the government to structured settlements, the question must now surely be why the new military compensation scheme cannot also offer a benefit with perhaps a minimum pension to provide ongoing income support and prevent dissipation as well as a lump sum, with the mix to be negotiated on financial advice but at the same time using actuarial advice to ensure that the benefit taken is no less than that currently available.
I make this suggestion in clear recognition that the government is in the throes of drafting a new scheme but also in recognition that what I have said today clearly illustrates that the continuation of the current war widows pension under the VEA is simply not viable, particularly for the new generation of the ADF. It is full of injustice for those currently entitled and simply should not be extended. Moreover it is of the utmost importance, when considering the form of war widows benefit in the future, that the policy rationale be stated clearly and in terms consistent with the totality of veterans policy and with an eye to the social security safety net as well. The government must clearly delineate those portions which are compensatory for loss and those which are of an income support nature, based on the current superannuation scheme. As one homogeneous scheme, linkages with the VEA and all of the offsetting which now bedevils ex-service personnel and veterans must be avoided at all costs.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-08-29,"—I would like, if I may, to make some further comments on Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. It is worth noting that the Veterans' Entitlements Act is a very complex and difficult piece of legislation to come to grips with simply because it effectively contains over 80 years of law dealing with the care and recognition of veterans throughout a period of enormous change in Australian society. In this period we have had two major world conflagrations, the second of which saw Australia attacked directly for the first time, with mass mobilisation. Since then we have served with the United Nations in Korea and the British during the Malayan crisis, in the Indonesian confrontation, and with the US in Vietnam, the Gulf and now Afghanistan. We have also joined with the UN in a wide range of peacekeeping missions all around the world, the last of which has been in East Timor. 
In this time, society has changed enormously, and you do not have to look very far in the veterans jurisdiction to find examples of discriminatory or contradictory policies which appear to have arisen more by budgetary considerations than by any principle of equity or consistency. Because of this complexity, it is therefore not the least bit surprising that from time to time we are presented with amendments such as those in this bill which are corrections to outcomes unforeseen at the time of the original legislation. In fact, one could well conclude that it is time that we drew a line and started again, which I understand the government is planning by the drafting of a new military compensation scheme. But the trouble is that the current act will continue to operate while ever there are people alive with entitlements granted by it. No doubt, we will continue to see complex amendments coming into the parliament to fix an unintended shortcoming or, more to the point, to provide consistency with the Social Security Act where there seems to be a capacity to overlook the linkages with the Veterans' Entitlements Act far too often.
Going beyond the context of the bill then, its provisions are largely of the nature I have described, although I must say that they are so numerous and detailed that it is almost impossible to make reference to all of them. In the majority of amendments the changes proposed are of a purely technical nature and are necessary to clarify or to make terminology consistent. In some cases there have been oversights where people have been affected unintentionally and, so again, corrections need to be made. It is worth noting that in some cases the bureaucracy does seem to be able to manage by way of ex gratia payments or simply by turning a blind eye. For this reason alone, the law needs to be corrected, though this is long overdue. We have no quibble with this type of amendment, and so I will not go through the detail as it is set out in the explanatory memorandum.
Before proceeding to make some specific remarks on a few items in the bill, however, I wish to make a point about the government's attitude to this legislation and, indeed, to other legislation where ministers' second reading speeches and explanatory memorandums seem to regard the legislative process as a rubber stamp—that it is all too complex to explain and that any policy implications should be swept under the carpet and ignored. This bill is a good case in point because there are a number of serious policy and administrative issues which are simply not referred to.
The first policy issue arises, in fact, with the very first amendment proposed in this bill, as set out in schedule 1, which deals with changes to the income support supplement for war widows and widowers. These amendments, in essence, are simply to correct drafting omissions made at the time the income support supplement was legislated, both in the Social Security Act and in the Veterans' Entitlements Act, in that the policy being applied at the time was that war widows' access to social security benefits was severely limited. Those in payment for the ISS thereafter were to have no access to benefits, including the disability support pension, unemployment benefits—now known as Newstart—or any other benefit. All rates payable at the time were frozen.
We have no quibble with the need to make sure that the intended policy is correctly provided for in the legislation—and hence this long list of drafting amendments—but what we must make clear right now is that the policy itself is flawed and is, in fact, being reversed in part by other legislation currently before the parliament. Here I refer to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2002 Budget Measures) Bill 2002, which was dealt with just a few moments ago. Yet nowhere in the minister's second reading speech for either bill is this referred to—nor is mention made that the second bill effectively reverses in part the policy basis of the ISS as it was introduced.
Whatever the reasons behind the 1986 amendments which have brought us to this bill today, we in the Labor Party agree that war widows enjoy a traditional place in Australian veterans law whereby their unique loss is worthy of recognition, in addition to their separate needs for support from the social security system. It should be noted, however, that in supporting the bill we also agree with the government that, given the history of the war widows pension and the linkage with the social security system, there should be a trade-off when it comes to income support. It is not appropriate that war widows should have full access to both. 
However, there is more to it than this because this bill seeks to alter only one part of the suite of 1986 measures. In short, we can see no logical reason why war widows in receipt of a war widows pension, which recognises the death of their husband due to war-caused injury or disease, should not be able to access benefits other than the ISS, particularly Newstart with which comes access to training and the work force. We accept it should be fully means tested, but to change only part of the 1986 policy, as indexation of the ISS does, is to continue the attitude that war widows should have no access to any other program. This is, in fact, a penalty for all war widows under the age of 57 and should not be tolerated.
Putting that major point of criticism aside, however, we accept that, for technical reasons alone, the amendments in schedules 1 and 2 of the bill are necessary to correctly express this flawed policy in the Social Security Act and the Social Security (Administration) Act. Schedule 3 of the bill amending the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Act also contains technical amendments to definitions of `in care', which are supported and therefore need no elaboration beyond that set out in the explanatory memorandum. Schedule 4 contains a minor amendment worthy of note in that it corrects an earlier amendment providing for the removal of rent assistance to those sharing public housing which is already subsidised. This effectively closes that loophole and is supported, as it was in the first instance. Schedule 5 also makes a minor amendment to give effect to an earlier amendment transferring carers' allowances from the VEA to the Social Security Act. This amendment corrects another misdescription to allow that to happen and is similarly supported. Schedule 6 contains a wide range of technical amendments to correct previous misdescriptions, invalid references and incorrect expressions. These do not warrant further comment.
There are no policy implications except on two specific matters which I need to mention. The first of these is item 51, which corrects an inconsistency within the VEA whereby third-party compensation paid to a widow is treated differently within two separate sections of the act, in that there is a difference in the way the cause of death is described. The original provision of the act was that, where there is a third-party settlement to a widow for the death of her husband—for example, from a car accident—the widow's pension was offset in full or in part. A later amendment to another section incorrectly limited this offset to a death which was defence caused. This clearly was inconsistent and contrary to policy, and so now needs to be rectified.
The second is a provision to be inserted into a number of sections of the act, allowing for the easier incorporation of non-legislative external documents or other delegated legislation into statutory instruments governing the operation of some benefit schemes in the VEA. I refer here specifically to items 20, 55, 59, 63, 66 and 68. These amendments provide that changes made in external instruments will flow through automatically to the VEA where relevant thus avoiding the need for separate regulatory processes on every occasion. 
This may seem to be a practical proposal to reduce the amount of work and the need for subordinate legislation, but my concerns are twofold. First, this is a device with little precedent, yet it has not been acknowledged at all in the minister's second reading speech, nor is it dealt with adequately in the explanatory memorandum. At face value these amendments appear vague, referring to external documents `existing from time to time' and to those which might `not yet exist'. In terms of the scrutiny of delegated legislation the parliament must in every instance be aware of and approve, even by default, changes to regulation and delegated authority, particularly for budgetary consequences, and also ensure that policy is not being altered by stealth. Second, the automatic provision for flow-on from one instrument or external document to another within the Veterans' portfolio is something to be watched carefully. I draw the attention of the clerks and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee to this matter for ongoing scrutiny and consideration. Accordingly, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the specific advice provided to me by the minister, dated 23 April 2002, as a matter of record. 
Leave granted.

Senator Mark Bishop
Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Senator Bishop
VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2002
I refer to the meeting on 12 April 2002 between our advisers and departmental officers that included a discussion about the above Bill. At that meeting some concern was expressed relating to seven items in Schedule 6 to Bill. Items 20,55,58,59,63 and 68 of Schedule 6 all deal with the proposed inclusion of a power in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 that would enable the incorporation of documents in legislative instruments.
I am advised that the above provisions have given rise to some concern regarding the scope of the proposed power and the manner in which it would be exercised. A Paper was promised to outline further details of the practical effect of the proposed power.
Please find attached a copy of a Paper which outlines the intended operation of the proposed power and identifies the types of documents that are likely to be specified in the disallowable instrument. I trust that the Paper is of assistance is addressing any concerns.
Yours sincerely

Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002
An Explanation of “Incorporation by Reference” Provisions
Background
1. The purpose of this Paper is to provide additional information on a number of clauses contained in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 (`the Bill'). Those clauses have already been explained in the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies the Bill.
2. The impetus for this document arose out of concerns being expressed by the veteran community about the clauses in question. It is anticipated that this document will be widely published to all interested parties in an attempt to address any concerns and to ensure that any debate is fully informed.
What clauses are we talking about?
3. The clauses in the Bill that have apparently given rise to some concern can loosely be described as “Incorporation by Reference” provisions. There are seven of these clauses in the Bill. They all have the same purpose which is to enable certain Instruments made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (`the VEA') to be able to incorporate documents in force from time to time.
4. The clauses involved are all contained in Schedule 6 to the Bill and involve:
·	item 20—which amends section 29 of the VEA which deals with the “Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions”;
·	item 55—which amends section 90 of the VEA which deals with the “Treatment Principles”;
·	item 58—which amends section 90A of the VEA which deals with the “Repatriation Private Patient Principles”;
·	item 59—which amends section 91 of the VEA which deals with the “Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme”;
·	item 63—which amends section 105 of the VEA which deals with the “Vehicle Assistance Scheme”;
·	item 66—which amends section 115B of the VEA which deals with the “Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme”; and
·	item 68—which amends section 117 of the VEA which deals with the “Veterans' Children Education Scheme”.
Why do we want to incorporate documents into Instruments?
5. Usually legislation is self-contained and set out in one text. But if all the relevant aspects of a piece of legislation were contained in the one document it could become unwieldy and virtually impossible to use. To overcome these problems it is often convenient to set out brief items in the body of the legislation and refer to the more detailed items as being contained in other documents. This practice is known as incorporation by reference.
6. An example of the above practice is where other legislation is referred to in the primary document. For example, the “Treatment Principles” made under section 90 of the VEA incorporate by reference the Medicare Benefits Schedule made under the Health Insurance Act 1973. A further example is where an Australian Standard is being referred to in legislation. The relevant legislation will say that an object or good is to comply with AS 12345, but the legislation will not contain the full text of the Australian Standard because it is voluminous. The document containing the detailed requirements of the standard will not be included in the legislation.
7. By referring to other documents in the main body of the legislation, the legal principle is that these other documents then become incorporated by reference into the main body of the legislation and become part of the legislation. This is a standard legislative procedure that is utilised in many pieces of legislation and is currently used in Instruments made under the VEA.
8. However, while it is permissible for Instruments to incorporate documents by reference, there is a rule that, generally speaking, such external documents are “frozen in time”. Thus, if an Instrument refers to Australian Standard 12345 then only the terms of that Standard as they existed at the time the relevant Instrument was made are incorporated into the Instrument. This results in any subsequent amendment to the Standard not being part of the Instrument. In order to make the amended Standard part of the Instrument, the Instrument would need to be amended to refer to the new amended Standard. The rule governing the incorporation of documents into Instruments is contained in section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (`the AIA')
9. The primary reason for the rule relating to the incorporation of documents is that the law should be certain and if Instruments refer to documents that keep changing then those affected by the Instrument might have difficulty in learning of those changes (see Chapters 22 and 24 in “Delegated Legislation in Australia” by Pearce and Argument, 2”d Edition, Butterworths).
The rule in the AIA can be very inconvenient in some circumstances
10. The AIA recognises that the rule can operate negatively and hinder effective administration so it provides an override mechanism. It allows for a Statute to provide that an Instrument made under the Statute can incorporate documents in force from time to time (ie. amended) and that is what is proposed to be done to the VEA by this Bill. Put simply, the purpose of the provisions of the Bill under discussion is to override section 49A of the AIA which prohibits Instruments from incorporating non-legislative documents in force from time to time.
Will veterans be disadvantaged in any way?
11. Veterans will NOT be disadvantaged by these provisions. Repatriation Law is not regulatory law in the sense that the activities of veterans are regulated. Rather; Repatriation Law mainly regulates the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) and the Repatriation Commission in their dealings with veterans meaning that Repatriation Law is more an internal-working tool for DVA/Commission than a body of rules that veterans must observe. Thus, if an incorporated document is amended and becomes part of an Instrument, it is highly unlikely that a veteran will be disadvantaged in some way because he or she does not have immediate access to the changed document.
12. In addition, the invariable practice of both DVA and the Commission is to ensure that information relating to eligibility and entitlements is widely published. Accordingly, if the Instrument was to include a reference to a document that was not widely available, DVA would undertake to make the document available through either an office of the Department or through the Department's Internet Site.
What about service providers?
13. Unlike veterans, service providers are regulated by Repatriation Law and would need to know about changes to incorporated documents. However, it is not envisaged that any difficulties will arise in this regard and this assumption is based on current DVA arrangements. Under these arrangements, service providers are notified promptly of any changes that affect them and the system works well. This is particularly the case as most service providers also have contractual obligations with DVA and the Commission. These contracts and service agreements contain mechanisms for the notification and variation of the terms of the agreements. Unless these mechanisms are complied with, any such variation would not be legally effective. 
How could the public generally be aware of changed incorporated documents?
14.A11 of DVA's legislation, including Instruments, are available on the DVA Internet Home Page and consideration is being given to providing links on that page to documents incorporated in DVA Instruments so that a member of the public will always have access to a changed incorporated document.
What other pieces of legislation incorporate documents in force from time to time?
15. Other legislation which enables the incorporation of non-legislative documents that are in force from time to time include:
·	Public Service Act 1999 (section 23)
·	Radiocommunications Act 1992 (section 314A)
·	Telecommunications Act 1997 (section 589)
What are the VEA Instruments that will incorporate documents in force from time to time?
16. Only the following seven Instruments identified in the Bill will be able to incorporate non-legislative documents in force from time to time. These Instruments are all made by the Commission, approved by the Minister and are required to be tabled before both Houses of the Parliament. The Instruments are:
·	The Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions made under section 29 of the VEA;
·	The Treatment Principles made under section 90 of the VEA;
·	The Repatriation Private Patient Principles made under section 90A of the VEA;
·	The Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme made under section 91 of the VEA;
·	The Vehicle Assistance Scheme made under section 105 of the VEA; 
·	The Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme made under section 115B of the VEA; and
·	The Veterans' Children Education Scheme made under section 117 of the VEA.
What sort of documents will be incorporated from time to time in these Instruments?
17. At present it is envisaged that only two of the abovementioned Instruments will incorporate non-legislative documents in force from time to time. However, it is considered that the other Instruments should also have that facility to incorporate such documents.
18. The two Instruments that are currently proposed to incorporate documents in force from time to time are the Treatment Principles and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
19. The Treatment Principles are intended to incorporate at least the following documents as in force from time to time:
·	the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, being the standard for assessing post-traumatic stress disorder. Paragraph 2.4.2A currently only incorporates the 4h Edition;
·	Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth, the Repatriation Commission and the Australian Medical Association Ltd setting out, among other things, doctor's fees. Currently only the MOU of 10 December 1995 is incorporated;
·	Notes for Local Medical Officers setting out the terms for doctors' contracts with the Repatriation Commission. Currently only the Notes of December 1995 are incorporated (see paragraph 4.1.2);
·	Dental Officer Scheme setting out the terms for dentists' contracts with the Repatriation Commission. Currently only the conditions in force at 1 June 1993 are incorporated (see paragraph 5.1.2);
·	Dental Schedules setting out the dental services that may be provided to veterans etc (see paragraph 5.2.1);
·	Guidelines for the Provision of Community Nursing Care which contain the standards of care to be provided. Currently only the Guidelines in force at 1 May 2001 are incorporated (see paragraphs 7.3.2 and 7.3.5);
·	The Schedule of Prescribable Items for optometrical services (see paragraph 7.4.2);
·	Rehabilitation Appliance Schedule setting out the appliances that may be provided to veterans etc to assist with their rehabilitation;
·	The Schedule of Prescribable Items for visual aids (see paragraph 11.4.1);
20. The Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is intended to incorporate at least the following documents as in force from time to time:
·	Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits for Approved Pharmacists and Medical Practitioners dated 1 February 2002 setting out, among other things, notices to doctors and pharmacists; 
·	Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule dated 1 February 2002 setting out the Pharmaceutical Benefits that may be prescribed and supplied to veterans etc.
How would the Instruments refer to the incorporated documents?
21. It is envisaged that the Treatment Principles and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would be amended in a manner similar to that described in Attachment A. In essence, the incorporated document would need to be identified with sufficient certainty to enable each document and its contents to be readily identified.
How do you incorporate a document that “does not yet exist”?
22. This power would be used to incorporate a draft or interim document before it has been formally made. For example, in relation to Australian Standards, there is a process that must by followed before a new Standard is said to formally exist. Interim Standards can exist that are yet to be formally made by Standards Australia. Similarly, in relation to the Medicare Benefits Schedule, DVA has been made aware of some recommendations made by the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee to amend the Medicare Benefits Schedule to include a new item. The Commission may wish to include the new item for treatment to veterans prior to its inclusion in the Medicare Benefits Schedule. The terms of the proposed amendment contained in the Bill would enable this to be actioned.
23. The common law rules relating to “uncertainty” impact on the exercise of this power. Clearly the Commission could not make an Instrument that referred to a document that could not be identified or the terms of which could not be ascertained. The incorporated document would need to be identified with some degree of detail and be made available to the public. This would be achieved through either direct publication by DVA or via the DVA Internet Site.
Conclusion
24. The circumstances involving the relevant DVA Instruments are such that it is appropriate for the rule in section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to be overridden. Those circumstances being:
·	the need to provide new services to veterans quickly without having to amend the relevant Instrument to refer to an updated incorporated document;
·	the fact that Repatriation Law does not regulate the activities of veterans etc meaning that they are unlikely to be disadvantaged by not being aware of changed incorporated documents;
·	the effective arrangements in place for informing service-providers (who are regulated by Repatriation Law) of changed incorporated documents; and
·	the proposal to publicise incorporated documents on DVA's Internet Site.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-08-29,"—In closing the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, I refer to that last matter. The advice has been incorporated without any objection from the government but it does refer to amendments that are not currently in the bill before this chamber. As I understand it, these amendments were withdrawn in the House of Representatives earlier this week. So the advice can clutter up the Hansard but it is not relevant to the bill before this chamber at the present time.
With that apart, I thank Senator Bishop for his contribution. I notice that he has some criticisms about the process. I would be absolutely confident that all of the amendments proposed were done so by the minister, who, as I said earlier, is a very capable, able, compassionate minister, and the work she has done would have been in consultation with all of the stakeholders. I was going to say that I am sure that all other parties in the chamber with an interest in this matter would have been fully briefed either by the minister's office or by the department at request, but the document just referred to would obviously confirm that. Anyone who has an interest in this bill, including all of the stakeholders, would be fully aware of all of the terms and the impact that they have on the bill. With those comments, I thank the Senate for its support for the bill.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-08-29,"—I will keep my remarks brief. The Australian Democrats will not be opposing the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Amendment Bill 2002. We acknowledge that this bill confirms the practice of the last three years—that Commonwealth agencies, including CSIRO, the Australian National University and ANSTO, are liable for licence charges imposed by ARPANSA. However, while the Democrats will accede to the government's request that this legislation be treated as non-controversial, the bill does draw attention to some issues on which my colleague Senator Allison and I would like to briefly touch.
In 1998 ARPANSA was given the responsibility for regulating and licensing nuclear installations and radiation sources. However, we are aware that a number of agencies have raised concerns—directly with us and with others—that the regulatory process has become more bureaucratic and legalistic and that the technical capacity has diminished. It has been put to us that in some instances licence costs have risen five- to tenfold. I think we all recognise that when the regulator is expected to charge licences at full cost recovery there may be a perception of a conflict of interest between information sought and charges determined.
I also understand that there may be deficiencies in timely processing of licences such that some activities may be carried out while technically unlicensed due to delays. There are delays, in some instances, of up to two years in the processing of licensing applications or renewals. I am sure that the minister and all members of the chamber would be concerned to hear that due to such delays you actually have processes being undertaken while licences have not been approved. Of course, it can be expected that organisations that are regulated may not be entirely happy in all circumstances with the regulator. I suspect that is a fact of life. Nevertheless, we do not believe that these concerns are trivial, because they are being voiced by organisations that we consider are quite credible. 
I doubt that anyone in this chamber would dispute the need for careful regulation of nuclear and radiation facilities, practices, research and development. Obviously, that is something that the Australian Democrats have expressed concerns about on many occasions over the years. It is worth remembering that the object of the act, of ARPANSA, is to protect the health and safety of people and to protect the environment from harmful effects of radiation—all good objectives. In view of these concerns, and also because this regulatory framework has been in place for some years now, the Democrats believe that it is appropriate for a cool-headed examination of ARPANSA's licensing processes.
There are, of course, a number of options available to the Senate, including, for instance, a referral to a committee. Before the government gasps at that suggestion, I will say that on balance the Democrats believe a better option, a good option, is to request that the Australian National Audit Office audit ARPANSA's licensing processes. We are confident, and I am sure that all in this chamber would be confident, that the ANAO's professional and independent eye is well suited for such an examination. Accordingly, I move the second reading amendment standing in my name and urge all senators to support the amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate notes concerns with the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency's licensing processes and requests the Australian National Audit Office audit the agency's:
(a)	process and method of determining licence applications; 
(b)	scheduling and renewing;
(c)	setting of licence charges;
(d)	extent of unlicensed activities resulting from delays in licence processing; and
(e)	the impact of delays, if any, on research and development in Australia.
The amendment essentially asks for ARPANSA's licensing processes to be audited by the ANAO. I commend that amendment to the Senate, as I do, of course, the amendment to be moved by Senator Allison to this legislation.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (LICENCE CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-08-29,"— The opposition is supporting the thrust of Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Amendment Bill 2002. The opposition will support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Stott Despoja today. Perhaps I should briefly explain why that is the case. The matters that she raises go to the issue of ARPANSA's role in the licensing processes, which of course has a direct impact on the Lucas Heights reactor. A construction licence has been granted for that reactor, and it will of course require an operating licence. The second reading amendment expresses an opinion that ARPANSA should not issue an operating licence until such time as there has been a resolution of the issue of the storage of intermediate level nuclear waste generated by the reactor itself.
The nature of ARPANSA is that it is an independent statutory authority, and therefore I think it is inappropriate that there be an approach whereby a prescription in those terms be issued by this chamber. However, it is important to note that Dr John Loy, the CEO of ARPANSA, has recently indicated that, in his view, there should not be an operating licence granted for the new reactor at Lucas Heights until there has been substantial progress towards the resolution of the waste issue. That is an entirely appropriate response. Dr Loy's statements are absolutely consistent with his general responsibilities in regard to the health and safety of the people of this country.
 (Senator McLucas)—Senator Allison, are you standing on a point of order?
—Madam Acting Deputy President, it is not exactly a point of order, but I did want to point out to Senator Carr that I think he is speaking on the second second reading amendment, on mine. That may be okay, but I just point this out to him.
—You are talking about Senator Allison's amendment rather than Senator Stott Despoja's.
—My apologies. I have the wrong Democrat senator moving the amendment. I understand that that could be a difficulty at this time. I indicate my support for the amendment that I have been referring to. As this is so-called non-controversial legislation, I am anxious to deal with some other matters as well. We are supporting the amendment on the basis that we acknowledge that ARPANSA is an independent statutory authority and that the chief executive officer has indicated his concern about the failure to deal with the waste issue. We are concerned that there are substantial matters to be resolved. The recent dispute in South Australia with the South Australian government highlights the difficulties in regard to the lower level waste, let alone the questions that are now emerging about the failure of the federal government to have a nuclear waste strategy across Australia. So on those bases we accept the amendment.
—What are you doing with Senator Stott Despoja's amendment?
—It would be a good idea if I actually had a look at it before I tell you that.
—Well, that means you're agin it; so that's good.
—I thought you told us you would be supporting it.
—We cannot do business like this.
—Senator Stott Despoja, the opposition will be supporting that amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (LICENCE CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-08-29,"—I think Senator Carr has made most of the remarks that I would have made on behalf of the Democrats. I did intend to be very brief, in any case. The first of my amendments should be familiar to the ALP, since I think it was the opposition that raised it in the first place. It is important that the government listen to the chief executive officer of ARPANSA and that we have some idea of how we are going to deal with the spent fuel, how we are going to turn it into reasonable waste form. As Senator Carr says, this government's strategy on waste with regard to Lucas Heights is pretty much a shambles. That, in our view, should all have been dealt with well before we got to the point of granting a construction licence or anything else on Lucas Heights. 
Clearly, we have a proposal from the government for low level waste which is not accepted by the state government in South Australia and is certainly contrary to the Democrats' view of what should happen with low level waste. So we again use this opportunity to point out to the government that this is not good practice and we would like to see a strategy put in place that we can all agree with. The safety, storage and transportation of nuclear materials associated with the new reactor need to be resolved. The Democrats very much want to see the government resolve those matters before operating licences are issued. I do not think we can make that point more strongly than we have done in the past. This is an important second reading amendment, and I urge senators to support it.
 (Senator McLucas)—Senator Allison, I understand you are foreshadowing your amendment, to be discussed after Senator Stott Despoja's amendment.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-08-29,"—I can understand the philosophical bent of the movers of the two amendments and of Senator Carr and some of his colleagues, and it is all very interesting in a debating, chatty sort of way. But this bill is actually about the collection of fees and charges from Commonwealth agencies that ARPANSA regulates. Other issues are not really relevant to this bill even though they might, as I say, be interesting for a debate or chat at some time. Consequently, the government will not support either of the second reading amendments.
Senator Stott Despoja's amendment requests the Australian National Audit Office to audit ARPANSA's licensing processes. The government is of the view that the basis for this proposal is flawed. ARPANSA received some 137 applications for licences, 80 of these were made during the first few months of operation of the new regulatory system, and 109 licences have now been issued. Given this licensing workload, priorities needed to be applied to the consideration of licence applications. The government considers that these priorities were decided fairly and appropriately. The government also considers that the level of ARPANSA's fees reflects its policy of full cost recovery. This approach is realistic, and I emphasise that it is what was expected when the ARPANSA bill was passed by the parliament. Given that the basis for this audit proposal is flawed, the government cannot support the second reading amendment. However, this is not to say that the government does not support the scrutiny of the processes of regulatory bodies such as ARPANSA. The government does not object to the ANAO undertaking an audit of ARPANSA in the future if the Audit Office identifies the need for such an audit.
The government also opposes the second reading amendment to be moved by Senator Allison. The amendment seeks to interfere with ARPANSA's regulatory oversight of the replacement research reactor. The licensing process used by the CEO of ARPANSA to consider matters such as those raised in the amendment was actually agreed to by the Senate when it passed the ARPANSA act. We see that the Democrats are now not prepared to accept the decision made under the act, and I regret to say that the Labor Party appears to be in the same position. As the Senate is aware, the CEO of ARPANSA has issued a facility licence for the construction of the replacement research reactor. The CEO gave consideration to the issues of spent fuel management and radioactive waste management in reaching his decision to issue the licences. 
Consistent with the regulatory approach taken in the act, these issues will continue to be monitored and considered by the CEO of ARPANSA as and when necessary. I emphasise that this bill simply involves minor clarification of the powers of ARPANSA to collect fees and charges, and I commend the bill to the Senate. I indicate that, because of time constraints, we will not be dividing on the second reading amendments but, again, I emphasise that the government opposes both of them.
 (Senator McLucas)—The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Stott Despoja be agreed to.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-08-29,"—The purpose of the Plant Breeder's Rights Amendment Bill 2002 is to amend the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 to clarify the rights of plant breeders in certain circumstances where public interest restrictions are imposed. The provisions of the bill also enhance the access of breeders to the Plant Breeder's Rights Scheme and improve the administration of the act and the scheme.
While the opposition supports the bill, I will seek clarification on a number of points in the committee stage of the debate. I have advised the minister of the issues I wish to raise. The amendments contained in this bill are predominantly administrative and include a significant clarification to section 18 of the act. Section 11 of the act establishes the right of breeders to disallow certain acts of production and other activities in relation to a plant variety. Section 18 was designed to acknowledge public interest concerns regarding the limitations that breeders can place on the use of their propagating material. For example, it is not in the public interest to allow breeders to prevent the making of food staples such as bread from grain. However, the current section 18 has been interpreted such that it has denied plant breeders the right to deny any normal commercial activity in respect of their propagating material. This was not the intention of the legislation and, accordingly, the bill provides for the deletion of section 18 and the insertion of a new section that allows for certain defined public interest restrictions.
The new provisions provide that a breeder is able to exercise his or her right of authorisation of acts under section 11 except where the right is restricted by Commonwealth, state or territory legislation. Where such restrictions apply, equitable remuneration must be paid to the breeder—a provision that is consistent with Australia's obligations under the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 1991. The bill also clarifies the power of the minister under section 49 to impose conditions on existing and proposed breeders' rights on public interest grounds. The Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 is based on Australia's membership of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 1991. This is a United Nations multilateral agreement establishing an internationally harmonised regime for exclusive intellectual property relating to new plant varieties. The act is a form of patent legislation that coexists with other laws. The evolution of this legislation commenced in the 1970s and has been the subject of public debate over many years. The Fraser government attempted to push a plant varieties scheme through the parliament in 1981. That scheme was considered deficient. It was left to the Senate to work through many of the unresolved issues—a situation not unfamiliar to senators under the current coalition government. 
The issue of plant breeders' rights was then the subject of an exhaustive inquiry by the then Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources, the committee handing down its report in May 1984. It recommended that a plant varieties rights scheme be established and that legislation be drafted to conform with the 1978 UN convention relating to new varieties of plants. The committee also recommended that the then Department of Primary Industries closely examine all the evidence that was critical of the original bill. The end result of that proper and exhaustive process was the enactment of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. That act enabled plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants they developed. It was designed to stimulate plant breeding in Australia for both our domestic industries and export.
Despite the exhaustive consultation that preceded the passage of this legislation through the parliament, significant uncertainty about the impact of the scheme remained in some sections of the community. Concerns remained about the impact on the developing world, management of worldwide plant genetic resources, the ownership of essential food resources, market structures and basic consumer interests. There is a not dissimilar debate under way in relation to the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture. While there is a general view that the potential benefits of GMOs are considerable, there is significant concern that the potential risk of GMO use might outweigh those benefits. I will come back to the matter of GMO policy and the mismanagement of the issue by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, shortly.
Proprietary rights are designed to provide plant breeders, both public and private, with a means of recouping some of the development costs incurred in the breeding of new plant varieties. Plant breeders' rights are exclusive commercial rights to a registered variety of seed and are a form of intellectual property similar to patents and copyright. The Plant Breeder's Rights Scheme seeks to encourage innovation and give innovators legal protection from commercial exploitation of their products by other parties. It is an essential protection for an industry that drives domestic industry development and generates export income of $100 million per annum. Ongoing innovation in the seeds industry, driving the development and commercialisation of new seed varieties, is the key to sustaining our major rural industries. We must innovate or perish.
The recently formed Australian Seeds Authority is a nonprofit organisation established to manage seed certification and accreditation in Australia. The establishment of the Australian Seeds Authority is an important step in the evolution of the Australian seed industry and will underpin development of this emerging rural industry. In addition to seed certification, the Australian Seeds Authority is responsible for matters relating to international seed trade and the development and implementation of an industry-wide quality assurance system. I acknowledge the work of the Grains Council of Australia, the Seed Industry Association of Australia, state governments and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in its establishment.
A few weeks ago, I described the Howard government as `genetically uncoordinated' in its approach to the regulation of gene technology. The Gene Technology Regulator is currently considering applications for the commercial release of GM canola. It is not appropriate for me to use this debate to comment on matters before the regulator, but I do want to note the inconsistent approach of the government to matters of seed technology management. Last year, the minister for agriculture announced a three-year project to examine the feasibility of segregating GM products across supply chains. The problem for Mr Truss and Australian agriculture is that this issue needs to be addressed long before Mr Truss's study delivers any findings. While Mr Truss pretends this matter can wait until long after he has been removed from his portfolio, state governments, industry and the community must grapple with these complex issues now. In this respect, I want to commend the Gene Technology Grains Committee for the work it has done in developing draft guidelines on the incorporation of GM technology into Australian farming systems. The Plant Breeder's Rights Scheme was introduced to promote investment, innovation and development in the Australian seed industry. The leadership demonstrated by previous governments in this area ought to be replicated in the area of gene technology today. 
I have some questions relating to the impact of Australia's international treaty obligations on the Australian seed industry, questions that go to the heart of the regime managed by the Plant Breeder's Rights Act as amended by the bill before the Senate. My questions concern the decision taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, to sign the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at the UN food and agriculture summit on world hunger in Rome this year. Can the minister advise whether this treaty requires Australian farmers to pay the United Nations a share of profits from crops grown from seeds stored in a global seed bank? Does the treaty establish a worldwide seed saver network designed to protect biodiversity and give developing countries access to new seed varieties? As the government refused to sign this treaty between 1996 and 2001, what was the basis of Mr Truss's change of mind in June this year? According to an article in the Australian on 10 June this year, the minister had a number of concerns about the transfer of genetic assets under the treaty but decided it was better to be involved to protect Australia's interests. Can the minister advise the Senate of the details of those concerns?
The same press article reported that the United States and Japan have refused to become parties to the treaty. Has the minister made himself aware of the position of the United States and Japan and, if so, what is the position of these major seed technology innovators? It appears that decisions will be made by the United States and Japan about a range of seed technology issues outside the architecture of the treaty. Clearly, Australia's involvement in the consideration of these issues by the United States and Japan will be limited. Can the minister explain the decision making processes under the treaty and the opportunities for signatories to have input into those processes?
I am also interested in the treaty's royalty program. I understand that, at the time of signing the treaty, the royalty details were not established. Have the details of the royalties and how they will be distributed yet been determined? If so, what are the details? Mr Truss is reported as saying that Australian plant breeders will profit from the new system because they can access foreign crops from the seed bank. I assume that they will have to pay for that access and I seek advice on how that access will work. I trust that the minister at the table who responds to the second reading debate—whoever it is—will assist me in better understanding the operation of Australia's seed technology regime by seeking answers to the queries that I have raised.
However, I am pleased to indicate Labor's support for improvements to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act that will clarify breeders' rights, enhance access to the Plant Breeder's Rights Scheme and improve its administration. I have previously foreshadowed my desire to seek clarification on some technical aspects of the amendments and I will do so at the next stage of the debate. I am advised that the Australian Democrats are proposing some amendments to the bill. We have not yet had an opportunity to see the detail of those amendments, but we will consider them when they are available.

Can the minister confirm that the 805 Squadron was commissioned in February 2001 with 26 personnel with the responsibility of operating the Seasprite helicopters?

As he would be aware, I have already asked him for authority to visit the centre. But the question remains: why do we have an operational squadron without access to any helicopters in which to fly? It seems a pretty basic question that the minister has not answered. Minister, I would also like you to confirm that the government has withheld only $720,000 out of a contract of $800 million to Kaman. Is this the government's version of getting tough with the supplier when they have clearly failed to deliver in accordance with the $1 billion contract? Surely withholding only $720,000 is not putting the sort of pressure on that will give some value to taxpayers over this highly bungled contract.

He would have also told the Senate about the work that the squadron is doing, because, as I recall it, I set that out in the answer to him. There is considerable work in relation to the development of the aircraft—most of which are now already at Nowra—and the fitting of the various weapon systems and so forth. I would best suggest that he visits the establishment and speaks to the military personnel that are engaged in doing that work.

I haven't had that analysis done yet and until I do have that done I'm not going to suggest what should happen in relation to the charges.
Given the analysis by the Reserve Bank, how can the Howard government justify refusing to empower the ACCC to monitor bank fees and protect consumers from bank greed?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Banking: Fees</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-08-29,"—I thank the senator for the question. This government is committed to enhancing competition and information disclosure in the financial sector to ensure that bank fees and charges are kept to the absolute minimum necessary and that consumers are able to make well-informed decisions. That is what it is all about. Through the Financial Services Reform Act, the government introduced a both harmonised and improved regulatory regime for consumer protection and disclosure in the financial services industry. As you would all know, the reforms have been in place since March this year and they ensure effective disclosure to consumers at the point of sale of a financial product, as well as ongoing product disclosure, so that consumers can make comparisons and make up their own minds about what financial institution they are going to do business with.
RBA figures released in a bulletin last year found that, while aggregate bank fees have continued to grow strongly, reductions in net interest margins in recent years have exceeded the increases in the banks' fee income. There are a number of initiatives under way that have been examining bank fee disclosure issues. That is in marked contrast, of course, to Labor's policy on banks. The policy that Senator Conroy took to the election seemed to be to bundle up something from the ABA and to run out and release it about three hours before the ABA released their policy. It seemed to be a great exercise in plagiarism, as best I could tell.
On 26 June this year, ASIC released a disclosure guide on what constitutes good fee disclosure practices on transaction accounts offered by banks, credit unions and building societies, and on 26 March 2001 the ABA announced a proposed industry standard for a basic banking account, specifying the minimum basic level of service fee for the holders of Commonwealth government pensioner, health care and seniors concession cards. In addition, the RBA recently reported that most banks provide a basic account with low or no fees. The Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities has released a report on bank fees on both electronic and telephone transactions. 
Of course, the government will continue to work with banks and to encourage competition in the financial services sector. As we previously said, and as the Treasurer has said, we will consider acting if there is any evidence of anticompetitive practices by the banks in their dealings either with the small business sector or indeed with other consumers. To date the government have not received any evidence to warrant an ASIC investigation into the lending practices of banks towards small business. The government will continue to work with the industry sector to ensure that bank fees are transparent, that consumers have choice and that banks continue to offer a range of products so that consumers can choose where they want to bank.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Banking: Fees</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,answer

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-08-29,"—On 27 August Senator Carr asked me a question without notice and I undertook to provide further information. I seek leave to incorporate that additional information in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
The Minister for Education, Science and Training has provided the following additional information in relation to the question asked by Senator Carr.
The Minister has initiated a review of higher education to examine ways in which we can enhance Australian higher education and build on its strengths and increase diversity. The Minister has made no secret of the fact that there are challenges facing the higher education sector. While the Government does not agree that there is a crisis in the sector, it recognizes that there are areas where reform is necessary. It's just a shame that the Opposition does not want to be part of this review process.
Operating result of the sector
The financial position of the higher education sector remains strong. The sector operating result has been improving in the past two years. The figures quoted by Senator Carr are no secret— these are publicly available in a number of forms, through institutions' annual reports and the Higher Education Triennium Report. After declining from $555 million in 1997 to $287 million in 1999, the aggregate operating result has increased remarkably with figures of $320 million in 2000 and preliminary figures of $464 million in 2001.
It should be noted that the comparison of four year averages of the operating result to that of a single year can be very misleading. Universities, like any other organisations, may report operating deficits from time to time, and comparing the operating result for one year with another or even with averages do not provide adequate information of a university's financial health. The Department uses a range of financial indicators for monitoring the financial health of public universities and relying on one or two indicators to draw conclusions about the financial health does not provide the whole story.
Operating revenues and expenses of the sector
Between 1991 and 2000, the revenue rose by 71 per cent and the expenses (before adjustments) rose by 89 per cent, not the 91 per cent quoted by Senator Carr. The question of removing capital funding as a revenue source is irrelevant as the capital funding was fully rolled into the operating grants in 1996 and treated as a recurrent funding.
The invitation to the Labor Party to constructively participate in the current debate is still open. We are yet to see any reasonable contribution from the Opposition on these matters and Senator Carr's performance would indicate that things aren't likely to change.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Education: University Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-08-29,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
The Prime Minister has now acknowledged that the family payments system is undergoing a major crisis. Of course, right in the middle of that crisis is the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone. Today in question time, as she has tried to do in every other question time, she sought to defend the family payments system which the government introduced as part of the GST. What sort of a system is it that slugs families with significant debts when those families do the right thing and immediately advise Centrelink of their changed earnings? Centrelink requires people receiving family payments to advise them when their circumstances change. Many families are doing that; they are complying with those requirements, yet they are incurring large debts at the end of the financial year— amounts which are being taken out of their tax refunds without any notice.
The minister might adopt the approach of smearing individuals who find themselves in these situations through no fault of their own, but the fact remains that these families do everything the government asks of them—they follow the advice of the government and Centrelink—and they are still facing financial difficulties. This would not be a problem, Mr Deputy President—and I congratulate you on your appointment to the position; I think this is the first opportunity I have had to do so—if the minister actually understood the system and then took steps to fix it. But Senator Vanstone does not understand the system and she has no willingness really to fix it.
Let us ask the question: who designed the system? You would think that it was designed by officials of the department administered by the minister, the Department of Family and Community Services, who are people—you would think—who would understand what is happening in the international arena with regard to family policy. But, of course, that was not the case. This system was designed by the Treasury boffins who were responsible for putting together the GST and the ANTS package. The Treasurer's tax reform task force dreamed up and developed this system. Belatedly, one person was seconded to that task force from the Department of Family and Community Services to have an input, but it was too little too late. We now have a situation where this policy suits the budgetary and financial interests of this government and makes the families pay the price. Currently, as we know, there are some 650,000 families in this country who have incurred debt.
The average debt per family is $850. We have a total of half a billion dollars of debt just for this year alone. The minister says that this is not really a significant problem. But I remind the minister that this is more than one in every three families. Surely the minister is not trying to suggest that all of these families are trying to manipulate or defraud the system. Of course they are not. But this minister, in answers to questions in this chamber, paints pictures of people who may deliberately delay informing Centrelink of their changed circumstances and who are somehow seeking to gain some benefit upfront and then pay it off at a slower rate. 
The system is not working, and it is not working because—notwithstanding the requirements on families to provide the information to Centrelink, which they do—Centrelink and this minister cannot get their act together and administer the system properly. The compliance figures provided by Centrelink show, for instance, in comparing this system with that of the previous family allowance system, that in 1999-2000 only 51,832 debts were detected. That compares with some 757,000 under this current system.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2002-08-29,"—Mr Deputy President, I also have not had the opportunity to address you in your new capacity, so may I lend my congratulations to you on your election. I wish to take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, to the questions asked of her by Senator Conroy concerning entity taxation. The proposition asserted by Senator Conroy's questions in criticism of the government's policy on entity taxation could hardly have been more misconceived. The government, after an extensive process of consultation with small business, with tax experts and, in particular, with the government's own Board of Taxation, withdrew its original exposure draft bill on entity taxation so as to enable the Board of Taxation to have another look at the matter and to recommend approaches to the taxation of trusts that did not have a deleterious effect on small businesses and on other commercial entities which operate through trust structures.
Senator Conroy, as the shadow minister for financial services and regulations, should perhaps have known better. But the fact is that the vast majority of Australian small businesses, in particular—though not exclusively—businesses in primary industries, conduct their affairs through trusts, and there is absolutely nothing invidious about that. But Senator Conroy comfortably settled back into the old class war rhetoric in his question suggesting that any business that carries on its business through a trust structure was involved in some sort of tax avoidance. 
As you know, the most common way in which small businesses in this country are financed is by families that borrow against their own assets, against the family home, in order to provide the working capital for that business, and then they conduct that business through a corporate trustee. Commonly the members of the family are the directors of the corporate trustee and income received by the corporate trustee on behalf of the business is then distributed to shareholders and to family members. That is the way in which family businesses have conducted their affairs in Australia from time immemorial. It is almost universally the structure through which family farms and primary producers conduct their small businesses, and it is very commonly—although not universally—the way in which small businesses operated by tradespeople and small retailers and small venture capitalists conduct their business.
Yet to hear Senator Conroy and the tone of his question to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, you would think that it is a mode of tax avoidance. It is nothing of the sort. It has never been suggested by the Commissioner of Taxation or by the Board of Taxation that that is otherwise than an entirely legitimate way to structure a business, an entirely legitimate way in which to distribute income received by that business to those concerned and, in particular, where it is a family business, to distribute income to family members.
Where is the proposal at the moment? Let me tell you. After the original exposure draft was reviewed the stakeholders had a look at it and it was not proceeded with. The matter went back to the Board of Taxation. The Board of Taxation, having recommended that the bill not proceed in its then existing form, is currently engaged on a report to the government on the taxation of trusts, and that report will be received soon. The main point of the report, we expect, is that it will recommend a crackdown on specific species of avoidance that may be engaged in by corporate trustees that conduct businesses and are the point at which taxation is levied rather than adopt a one size fits all model which will impact adversely on all forms of small businesses which conduct their affairs through a corporate trustee.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2002-08-29,"—I rise to take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone. One thing that concerns me about this debate as it has unfolded is the way the government, and the minister in particular, seem to believe the propaganda which they have been running along this line. They would like to have us think that the people who are in receipt of this benefit are wallowing in money and are receiving this benefit so that they can save money to take overseas holidays or buy a second house or a second car. The recipients of this benefit need this money to meet their day-to-day living commitments. They are people who live from day to day and week to week. They need this benefit to meet the most basic of bills and to survive in our community on the most basic of living standards. We have a system which deprives people, at the one time in a year when they get their tax cheque, of an opportunity to use that money to pay for some of the things that they need, whether it be the payment of school fees or whether it be to replace household appliances. Attempts to justify this stripping are clearly false.  
Last year, the minister argued that there ought not to be this stripping of tax returns. In fact, the minister waived up to $1,000 per recipient if there was an incorrect calculation of the benefit—and, of course, at that time there was an election in the wind. So what has happened in 12 months? What was happening then was clearly a `cash for votes' situation where the government saw the need to be generous in their terms. They wanted to be reasonable and they thought that it was proper for people not to have their tax cheques stripped in this manner at that time. But the election comes and goes and what we see then is a government returning to their mean policies and trying to, again, take this money from some of the people who need it.
It is extraordinary that the minister would suggest—as she did on Lateline on Tuesday night—that $500 is really not that much money for a family. How out of touch can the minister possibly be? It may not be much money to the minister but to many families who live day to day it is an enormous amount of money. It can put petrol in the car for a number of months; it can pay their car registration. The system punishes people who in fact follow the rules. It is a flawed system and a system that fails to recognise the realities of life for low-income families. People find it very difficult to calculate in advance their total income for the year. It is a difficult process when we have in our community increasing part-time employment and the casualisation of labour. It is immensely difficult for people at the low-income end to determine what their income is going to be for the whole year. As Senator Collins rightly pointed out yesterday, under a Labor government there was the ability to have a variation of 10 per cent when calculating those amounts. That took a lot of people out of the unfortunate situation in which people are forced to be at the present time. 
The minister's own department has admitted that only 77,000 families claim these payments through the tax system. The other 1.9 million claim it as a fortnightly benefit through Centrelink. Why do they do this? Because they need the money on a fortnightly basis to raise their kids. This point was made amply clear by Ms Helene Weston-Davey on ABC news last night—and she was right. The system punishes families even when they follow the rules. It does not give support to families when they need it. As Ms Weston-Davey said, what was she supposed to do—ring the minister and ask for $50 a week when she wasn't working at the start of the year and needed the money to feed her kids? This government expects these families to have a psychic ability that allows them to predict future increases in income due to overtime or increases in their base salary. It is simply not good enough. This system should be designed to provide welfare, not work against people as is happening now.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-08-29,"—What we have seen today in question time and during question time on previous days is ample evidence of the lack of leadership in the Australian Labor Party and an absolute lack of any policies from the Australian Labor Party—in fact, not only a lack of policies but total confusion. In relation to the taxation of trusts, the Australian Labor Party, which did nothing about trusts for 13 years, did virtually nothing about tax avoidance. In fact, it did very little about tax reform at all during its 13 years.
—Don't be ridiculous! Tell us about the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme that John Howard presided over as Treasurer under Fraser. 
—Of course, you can always get a bite from Senator Cook when you reflect on the appalling economic management record of the Keating government of which he was a member. I always enjoy baiting Senator Cook. You just have to talk about the Keating government's failures in tax policy. The previous Prime Minister when he was Treasurer did not even put his own tax return in for a number of years. That is how much he cared about compliance with the tax system! So this government, which has done more to reform the tax system than any government in the history of Australia, is attacked by the hypocrites opposite—
—Senator Ian Campbell, I think you should withdraw that remark. That was an imputation.
—Mr Deputy President, I withdraw. Those opposite who do one thing one day and the opposite the next seek to accuse the government of not taking action. This government got rid of the massive tax rorting and abuse of the R&D syndication scheme, which Senator Cook was so proud of—one of the greatest tax rorts in Australian history. Billions of dollars were rorted through that system. In 1997, the government brought in a range of other anti-avoidance measures. In 1998 and 1999 we moved against trust losses and non-commercial loans to shareholders, artificially created capital losses and introduced the final package of measures to prevent trading and franking credits and dividend streaming.
We introduced the biggest tax reform in Australian history with the implementation of the new tax system—opposed root and branch by this mob opposite, who would not know a policy if they fell over it. Of course, Mr Deputy President, as you know, in the seat of Kalgoorlie, the candidate was working out of Senator Cook's office. The candidate was running around, stirring up the mass marketed scheme participants. The former Assistant Treasurer, George Gear, while campaigning for Labor candidates, was saying that participants in the mass marketed schemes were being treated harshly by this mean-spirited government. Of course, after the election, what did they do? They came in here and called them all tax cheats. This government will be tough on people who cheat the tax system, and we will be tough on people who cheat the welfare system. We will treat them with equal force under the law. If you want to cheat the tax system, whether you have got a white collar or a blue collar, this government will be tough on you, because we will stand up for the average Australians in the PAYG system who pay their taxes day in and day out, and ensure that the tax system has integrity.
We have seen hypocrisy on trusts and tax avoidance from those opposite, and hypocrisy and double standards on mass marketed schemes. We have seen the same sort of hypocrisy again this week in relation to bank fees. This government gave the Reserve Bank of Australia the power and the policy tools to take action in relation to interchange fees and credit card fees. And what is Labor doing now? It is carping and criticising again. The only policy we have seen on banking from Labor Party members was a policy that was stolen and plagiarised from the Australian Banking Association at about this time last year. Their shadow spokesman had a private briefing from the ABA; he stole and plagiarised large chunks of that policy, republished it as ALP policy and passed it off as his own.
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I think that may be a reflection on another senator. I would ask him to withdraw it.
—I ask you to withdraw that, Senator Campbell. An imputation of theft should not be made as it reflects on a senator.
—I withdraw. Quite frankly, when you plagiarise and take large chunks of someone else's document, pass it off as Australian Labor Party banking policy and then choose to release it the day before the Banking Association release their own policy, it is tantamount to theft.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-08-29,"—I want to note Senator Hill's response to a question I asked him today about the Seasprite helicopter project. It was very helpful that the minister was able to provide some further information. The first point to make is that we now know that the oldest of the helicopters will be arriving after its 40th birthday. We won't be able to have the 40th birthday celebration for the helicopter next year because it won't be delivered until 2005. It will have completed more than 30 years service in the US Navy but it will be taken on board by us as a new helicopter. 
We knew already that this project was going to cost us in excess of $1 billion and that delivery would be five years late. Most of the $1 billion has already been paid over to the supplier but we won't be getting the helicopters until five years later, in the years 2005 and 2006. So $900 million of taxpayers' money has already been paid over to the Kaman Aerospace Corporation for the supply of the helicopter but we have not as yet been able to take delivery of those helicopters because of problems with the contracts.
The minister today added to the Yes, Minister farce. When the minister was asked about this, his defence of the contract was, `But the contract will be completed within budget.'
—Go and have a look at the helicopters.
—Your answer today was that it will be completed within budget. Five years late, $900 million of Australian taxpayers' money paid over for nothing, yet you dare to say, `But it's within budget.' Yes, it is within budget; we have received nothing for it, but we have not paid one cent more than we should have! We paid $900 million for nothing but it is totally within budget! That is a very good point to make, Minister, and I am sure the producers of Yes, Minister will want you on the show, because it was like a classic scene from the show. 
Another classic scene: we now have a fully crewed service centre at Nowra. We have mechanics, buildings—a beautiful service centre. We also learnt today that we have the 805 Squadron—a whole squadron of the Air Force—dedicated to this task of flying the helicopters. So, in a classic scene from Yes, Minister, the minister says, `Yes, we've got a squadron down there ready to go. We've got the service centre. We've paid out more than $900 million for it. What haven't we got? We haven't got the helicopters. We've got the blokes to fly them, we've got the service centre; it's all running perfectly. It's within budget. It's running perfectly because we've got a perfectly good helicopter squadron and service centre and we've paid perfectly good Australian taxpayers' money. There's only one thing missing; I don't know why you quibble about it: we haven't got the helicopters.' 
We decided to purchase 40-year-old helicopters, pulled out of the desert store because nobody else wanted them, and for which we paid a cool $1 billion of taxpayers' money. And the minister says, `It'll be completed within budget. It's all going marvellously. The only problem is we don't have the helicopters.' We have a helicopter squadron, a helicopter service centre—a system that is running perfectly. The Yes, Minister hospital episode does come to mind—a classic Yes, Minister episode concerning a hospital without patients. What we have here is the Australian equivalent. We have the helicopter squadron without helicopters. We have new hangars and all sorts of things, but we do not have the helicopters. If it were not for the expenditure of $900 million of taxpayers' money, it would be funny.
—We have got the helicopters. Go and look at them.
—You told me you would not take delivery of the helicopters but, if that has changed, I would be interested to see them. So $900 million of taxpayers' money has been spent, and the minister says it is within budget. What about the opportunity cost? What could we have done with that $900 million during the last five years? What about the schools, hospitals and disability services that we could have paid for? This American contractor has had our money for the last five years while we sit and look at the beautiful squadron, beautiful hangars and beautiful service centres.
The other point I would like to refer the minister to is the Kaman calendar. I got a copy of the 2002 Kaman calendar the other day. In January they have a photo of the New Zealand helicopters, which were bought at the same time as Australia's helicopters and are in service. Guess what is in April? In April there is the nonexistent Australian helicopter. Why is it in April? It is an April 1st joke. The Australian helicopter: $900 million—paid for, not delivered. The Egyptians have got theirs. The New Zealanders have got theirs. We are the only ones who cannot buy a helicopter. We pay out good money but we cannot buy a helicopter. We deserve better answers as to why we have got a squadron and a service facility but we do not have helicopters. The minister might sit there and smile, but I think Australians are pretty angry about this; they want some answers.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-08-29,"—I want to re-extend my invitation to Senator Evans to go down to Nowra to inspect the Super Seasprite helicopters. All but one of the fleet are there in their hangar being worked on in terms of, as I said in question time today, the completion of the systems and preparation for their operational roles by, in effect, about half a squadron of naval personnel. They are there for the specific purpose of ensuring that, when the full system capability is completed and they can be taken by Navy, they can become immediately operational. In fact, we are hopeful—I know senators would want to know this—that we will be able to take them at an earlier date and commence training without their full capabilities. That will depend upon the next critical assessment of the systems integration, which will take place in about March of next year.
What Senator Evans did not say is that what went wrong with this contract was basically that a major subcontractor responsible for the systems integration failed to deliver. I do not know what Senator Evans would want the government to do. I suspect he thinks we should spend years and years in the courts and give away the capability. The government were more interested in ensuring that the contract got put back in order with new subcontractors in order that the full capability would be delivered.
We recognise that it will be delivered late, which is actually not all that unusual with military contracts, but we still want the helicopters with their full capabilities, because that is what is needed to enhance the Anzac frigates. As Senator Evans knows, they will be equipped with both Penguin missiles and torpedoes, they will have state-of-the-art capabilities and, in effect, they will be new aircraft. They certainly have some parts of the original aircraft structure but they have been substantially rebuilt with all new systems, new engines and so on, which is also not unusual for procurement of military assets.
They are an aircraft that are smaller than the Seahawks. They have advantages that the Seahawks do not have. They will have armaments that the Seahawks do not have. They will be an extremely capable aircraft and Navy is still enthusiastic about the prospect of including them within the fleet. The government ensured that new subcontractors were put in place to overcome the systems problems. It renegotiated the contract so that payments now better reflect the state of development of the asset. As I said, all but one of the aircraft have been delivered to Nowra and are being worked on by the Navy squadron that has been put down there for that specific purpose.
—Have you or have you not taken delivery of them?
—Navy people are working on those aircraft as we sit here in this chamber.
—Who owns the helicopters?
—We have paid quite a lot of money.
—You said you had not taken delivery of them.
—There are a number of formal steps that are still to be taken and the Navy is in the process of further development of the assets.
—You said you had not taken delivery of them; now you are saying you have. Which is it?
—Calm down. He is answering the question. 
—He is having a bit of fun and I can understand that. When you are in opposition, it gets depressing and you look for any opportunity to have a laugh, and it is possible to have a laugh at a contract that has had four or five years delay—that is not a good story in itself—but what is more important is that the aircraft are delivered with full capability and meet the task for which they were designed.
—You are obviously going to take them without full capability; that is what you are saying.
—The aircraft taken by New Zealand is not the same aircraft taken by Australia. The Australian aircraft has vastly improved capabilities. Yes, Australia could have taken a less capable aircraft and got it earlier, but Australia actually wanted a more capable aircraft and that is what we will be delivered. I think that the important thing is that the government has been prepared to face up to this contract, get it back in order so that it will deliver the full capability and sort out the financial aspects, which I believe had shortcomings, and the outcome can still be a good one for the defence of Australia.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-08-29,"— by leave—At the request of Senator Coonan, I will read a short statement from her relating to notice of motion No. 126 standing in the name of Senator Sherry, proposing an order for the production of documents relating to applications for financial assistance for superannuation funds where Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd was trustee. The response from Senator Coonan reads:
Following the Senate's order yesterday—

I called for and have received copies of the advices requested. The documents are lengthy and detailed and in some instances relate to individual funds and their financial circumstances. Releasing the advice from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority raises questions of public interest and the privacy of those superannuation funds referred to in the documents.
I have the documents under consideration to identify what the government may be in a position to make public. However, I am not in a position to comply with the order today.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-08-29,"— by leave—At the request of Senator Coonan, I will read a short statement from her relating to notice of motion No. 127 standing in the name of Senator Sherry, proposing an order for the production of the report presented to the government by the Superannuation Working Group. The response from Senator Coonan reads:
On 2 October 2001, the government released for public consultation an issues paper titled `Options for Improving the Safety of Superannuation'. The paper identifies various measures that might be implemented to ensure that the prudential framework for superannuation is as effective as it should be and provides the level of safety expected for the superannuation savings of Australians.
The Superannuation Working Group was requested by cabinet to undertake the consultation process in relation to the issues paper and to report to government by the end of March 2002. The report has been received by the government and is being examined and considered. The report itself and any measures the government may propose to implement to improve prudential safety of superannuation will be considered by cabinet. At this stage, the report is clearly part of the deliberative process of government.
I accept the need for the Senate to access certain information if it is to perform its proper functions. I understand and believe in the important principles of transparent democracy and accountability. I am also aware of my responsibilities as a minister and the need to consider whether disclosure of information would be contrary to the public interest. There is a balance to be struck which properly addresses the tension between these competing principles.
Having considered these principles and responsibilities in the circumstances at hand, I have determined, on balance, that it is not in the public interest for the Superannuation Working Group report to be laid on the table at this time. However, I can inform the Senate that I expect to make the Superannuation Working Group report, as well as the government's response, publicly available after the deliberative processes of the government are complete.
Governments of different persuasions have sought many times in this parliament, in the interest of good governance, to protect the confidentiality of documents that form part of the deliberative process of government. As former Senator Gareth Evans told this chamber in December 1993: `The truth of the matter is that executive governments from time immemorial have claimed some degree—not a complete degree—of immunity from scrutiny of their internal processes in order to enable decision making to take place in an orderly way, and allow communications to pass between ministers and policy issues to be addressed in a way that is not necessarily the subject of intense public scrutiny at the time that that decision making process is still under way.' After careful consideration, I believe that it is not appropriate for the report of the Superannuation Working Group to be released at this stage, prior to its consideration by the cabinet.
The government is committed to and encourages consultation and debate. Good policy making benefits from input from those with a genuine interest in achieving good outcomes. The original issues paper was released by the government and underwent a comprehensive consultation process. Submissions to the Superannuation Working Group were also made public. When the deliberative processes of the government are complete, it is, as I said, my expectation that the report will be released. I believe my decision in this matter is consistent with the past practices of this government and the conduct of the previous Labor government.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION WORKING GROUP: REPORT</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1,speech

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE ENVIRONMENT, COMMUNICATIONS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE ARTS REFERENCES COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO ABC BOARD APPOINTMENTS
The final report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee Inquiry into ABC Board appointments, entitled Above Board? Methods of Appointment to the ABC Board was tabled on 25 September 2001.
Report by the Chair
Recommendation 1
The Chair recommends that the method of Board appointments be altered to embrace a system characterised by the principles of merit and transparency, in order to deal with the widespread public perception that appointments to the ABC Board are made on the basis of political affiliation rather than on merit alone.
Not agreed.
The process of selecting ABC Board members is in accordance with the requirements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. The Government does not consider there is any compelling reason to alter it. 
The ABC Act requires non-executive Directors other than the staff-elected director to be appointed by the Governor-General for a period not exceeding 5 years. Under section 12(5) of the ABC Act, a person may not be appointed to the Board:
“unless he or she appears to the Governor-General to be suitable for appointment because of having had experience in connection with the provision of broadcasting services or in communications or management, because of having expertise in financial or technical matters, or because of having cultural or other interests relevant to the oversight of a public organization engaged in the provision of broadcasting services.”
The Chair's report fails to support the statement that there is a “widespread public perception” that ABC Board appointments are made on the basis of political affiliations. The Government notes that the majority of submissions to the inquiry were form letters from members of the Friends of the ABC and may not be representative of the wider community.
Recommendation 2
The Chair strongly recommends the retention of the staff-elected director
Agreed.
There has been no consideration of the removal of the position of staff-elected director. 
Recommendation 3
The Chair recommends that appointees to the ABC Board should have a demonstrated commitment to the principles of public broadcasting.
Not agreed.
Under section 12(5) of the ABC Act, a person may not be appointed to the Board:
“unless he or she appears to the Governor-General to be suitable for appointment because of having had experience in connection with the provision of broadcasting services or in communications or management, because of having expertise in financial or technical matters, or because of having cultural or other interests relevant to the oversight of a public organization engaged in the provision of broadcasting services.”
It is not clear from the Chair's recommendation how a “demonstrated commitment to the principles of public broadcasting” would be satisfied. The willingness to serve on the ABC Board is in itself demonstration of a commitment to public broadcasting. 
Recommendation 4
The Chair recommends, in relation to the ABC National Advisory Council:
·	that the Board appoint a member to perform a National Advisory Council liaison function.
·	That the ABC Advisory Council shall meet four times per year at times which reflect the schedule of the ABC Board
Not agreed.
Under section 11(9) of the ABC Act, the ABC Board determines the manner in which an Advisory Council is to perform its functions and the procedure relating to meetings of that Advisory Council. Section 11(12) states that the Board must have regard to any advice received from the ABC Advisory Council (ABCAC).
The Government believes that it is appropriate for the ABC Board to determine the functions of the ABCAP as well as the manner in which communications between the Board and the ABCAC occur.
Recommendation 5
The Chair recommends that formal selection criteria be developed for positions on the ABC Board and reflect the criteria already established under the ABC Act. The selection criteria should be drafted by an independent agency such as the Public Service Merit Protection Commission.
Not agreed.
Section 12(5) of the ABC Act specifies the criteria for appointment as an ABC Board Director. The Government cannot see the benefit in having another agency draft the selection criteria, particularly when, as the recommendation states, they would be based on those already in the ABC Act. 
Recommendation 6
The Chair recommends that vacancies on the ABC Board should be advertised through the national press, and through ABC services, including radio, television and online. 
Recommendation 7
The Chair recommends that the Minister cannot approve the appointment of a member to the ABC Board if the person has not made a formal application.
Recommendation 8
The Chair recommends that all applicants, as part of their formal application, make clear their political affiliation. 
Not agreed.
Information on the ABC Board and expiration dates of members is currently available from the ABC website. The Minister receives letters recommending potential Board members on a year-round basis and therefore is aware of a wide field of potential candidates.
The Minister seeks agreement from potential Directors to be nominated for appointment before they are recommended to the Governor-General. Requiring the Minister to approve only those who have put forward formal applications may exclude some excellent candidates. 
Requiring Board members to disclose political affiliations presents a privacy issue, especially as section 12(5) of the ABC Act does not make political affiliations a relevant criterion for appointments. It is also not clear how “political affiliations” is defined nor what period of time should be covered by a disclosure. The declaration of political affiliations may have the reverse effect to that predicted by the Chair, by bringing the issue of affiliation to the fore in the consideration of any candidate for the Board and providing a basis to discriminate against candidates.
Advertising ABC Board vacancies and requiring applications would lead to a large number of applications and would require a significant commitment of resources to process and assess. The Government believes this commitment of resources to be unnecessary, considering the processes described above which are currently in place. The Minister has the option of advertising for candidates if he or she feels that there is not a sufficient pool of candidates. 
Recommendation 9
The Chair recommends that:
·	an independent selection panel shortlist applications, and forward a list of at least two candidates to the Minister, together with the candidates' applications and declarations of political affiliation.
·	the shortlist of candidates, together with a summary of their qualifications against the selection criteria and their statement of political affiliation, be public.
·	the Minister should not be obliged to select any of the candidates recommended by the selection panel. However, the Minister must not select a candidate who has not first been scrutinised by the independent selection panel.
Not agreed.
The Government believes that this recommendation would create a cumbersome process which, as discussed in the Labor Senators' minority report, undermines the concept of Ministerial accountability to Parliament. A number of issues surrounding this recommendation are not clear, for example the manner in which the “independent selection panel” would be convened or how privacy issues regarding the publication of candidates' applications would be addressed.
This recommendation would implement a selection process significantly different from that for other Government bodies. There is no convincing rationale for this difference in the report.
Recommendation 10
The Chair recommends that:
·	at the first meeting of the ABC Board every year, the Board shall elect a Chair and Deputy Chair.
·	the ABC Board shall hold a public Annual General Meeting, at which all Board members shall be present.
·	The ABC Board shall publish greater information in relation to their activities, including summaries of Board Minutes. This may be achieved via publication on the ABC Board website.
Not agreed.
The first part of this recommendation develops an unworkable and potentially damaging model for the operation of the ABC Board. The requirement for an annual election of the Chair is potentially divisive and destabilising, with no clear benefits. 
The Government has committed to encouraging the ABC to be more responsive to the needs and views of its audiences, particularly in relation to content and programming matters. However, the ABC is already accountable to Parliament through its annual reports and appearances before Senate Committees and the Senate Estimates process. The Government does not consider the introduction of another layer of accountability, as outlined in the second part of the recommendation, through an annual general meeting, would enhance the transparency and accountability of the ABC beyond its current level. 
The publication of ABC Board minutes, even in summary form, as suggested in the third part of the recommendation, has the potential to be damaging to the ABC. Given the ABC operates in a highly competitive broadcasting environment, commercial confidentiality is at times necessary and, in particular, in relation to commercial links with external parties. 
Recommendation 11
This recommendation covers the legislative changes required to give effect to a model implementing the previous recommendations.
Not agreed.
As the Government does not support any of the recommendations made by the Chair, it does not believe there is any requirement for legislative change.
Report by Government Senators
The Government supports the views expressed in the Government Senators' report. In particular the Government supports the view that the inquiry has not clearly established that there is a problem with the current approach to Board appointments, nor that there is a strong argument for differentiating the method of appointing ABC Board Directors from the approach taken for other Commonwealth agencies.
The Government also agrees with the doubts expressed by the Government Senators regarding the representative nature of most of the submissions received by the inquiry.
Report by Labor Senators
The Government notes that the Labor Senators have pointed out that it is not clear that any changes to the appointment system would remove the perceived problem of politicisation. The Government does not agree with the Labor Senators' assertion that more investigation of options is required, as no clear case for the need for change is put forward.
The Government agrees with a number of the criticisms of the Chair's report which are advanced by the Labor Senators, although it disagrees with the need for the establishment of selection criteria. The criteria suggested by the Labor Senators, such as “breadth of vision”, are vague and subjective and their use would not, in the Government's opinion, enhance the selection process for ABC Board members.
Additional Comments by Senator Bob Brown, Australian Greens
Most of the recommendations in Senator Brown's comments are dealt with above.
With respect to Senator Brown's recommendation that the British model of appointment should be adopted to appoint ABC Board Directors, the Government notes that there continues to be criticism of the politicisation of the BBC Board. The Government does not consider that the UK model offers particular advantages to the ABC.
The Government also does not see any reason to change the current staff representation on the ABC Board.
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO REPORT 42 OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES
“Who's Afraid of the WTO? Australia and the World Trade Organization”
The Government thanks the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for its consideration of Australia's engagement with the WTO reviewed in the 42nd Report.The Report makes twenty-one recommendations relating to Australia's interaction with the WTO. The Government response to these recommendations is provided below.
Recommendation 1
EVALUATION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF TRADE
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commission multi-disciplinary research to evaluate the socio-economic impact of trade liberalisation in Australia since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in 1994 (paragraph 1.96).
The Government shares the Committee's view that it is important to provide assessments of the actual results of trade liberalisation in explaining to the wider community the benefits of these policies. 
As noted in the Committee's Report, the Government has undertaken studies that demonstrate how trade generates wealth, creates employment, raises living standards, provides consumers with access to high quality products and provides business with a source of new ideas and innovation. Those analyses have, for example, estimated the proportion of jobs in Australia as a whole, and in regional areas, that depend on trade; and demonstrated that exporting firms on average afford their employees significantly better wages and conditions than non-exporting firms. 
The Government will continue to explore ways of undertaking such evaluations to enable the public to make better informed assessments of the benefits of trade and the impact of trade liberalisation. As part of this effort, ABARE and other relevant Government agencies will continue to use their economic modelling tools to analyse trade liberalisation initiatives, including sector specific initiatives such as agricultural trade reform. 
However, it should be noted that retrospective quantitative analyses isolating the total economic impact of trade liberalisation over a given period would be a complex matter. To attempt to differentiate the impact of trade liberalisation since 1994 from other factors, such as currency movements, ongoing structural reforms to the Australian economy and the Asian economic crisis would be both difficult and expensive. This notwithstanding, the overall consensus of most studies is that removing trade barriers globally, including in Australia, lifts living standards and delivers gains for Australia and the world economy. This conclusion holds across a wide range of assumptions about national economic behaviour and model types. 
Recommendation 2
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT
The Committee recommends that prior to entering any future WTO commitments, the Commonwealth Government assess whether structural adjustment measures are available and appropriate to alleviate any adverse socio-economic impacts of such actions (paragraph 1.115).
Structural adjustment considerations are a key part of the Government's economic and employment policies. In addition, industry consultations are an important element of the Government's approach to trade negotiations and the implications on Australian industry of any new WTO commitments would be fully taken into account in establishing negotiating objectives. In this context, the need for any structural assistance measures would be fully assessed by the Government. 
Changes flowing from multilateral trade negotiations, such as phased tariff reductions, are by their nature unlikely to lead to rapid adjustment consequences. Changes have generally occurred over a period of time, allowing industry adjustment to take place gradually rather than rapidly and unexpectedly. Also, it is important to consider the net benefits from trade agreements in terms of increased access to export markets that may offset any negative impacts on particular sectors. 
It should also be noted that, in recognition of the fact that increased trade liberalisation necessitates economic change, WTO rules do not limit a government's capacity to provide genuine structural adjustment support. 
The Government has introduced sector specific programs to assist with structural adjustment associated with tariff reductions and other changes to border protection. The $750 million Post-2000 Assistance Package for the Textile Clothing and Footwear (TCF) industry, for example, is aimed at increasing the international competitiveness of Australia's TCF industry and includes support for restructuring activities in TCF-dependent regional communities. In agriculture also, Australia provides structural adjustment assistance. Such programs include Farmbis, Farm Help (formerly the Farm Family Restart Program) and the Dairy Industry Adjustment Package (DIAP). One program within the DIAP is the Dairy Regional Adjustment Programme (Dairy RAP), which assists dairy-dependent communities by supporting business investment and community infrastructure development.
More broadly, the government addresses labour market disadvantage through funding Job Network, a network of community, private and public providers which deliver employment services in Australia in areas such as job matching, job-search training, intensive assistance for the most disadvantaged unemployed, and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. The Government also funds a number of other general labour market and regional assistance programs which assist the unemployed and other disadvantaged people, including Work for the Dole projects, Community Development Employment Projects and the Regional Assistance Programme.
Recommendation 3
COMMUNITY INFORMATION
The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade review all existing Commonwealth Government community information programs about international trade to ensure that the facts of trade liberalisation and the World Trade Organisation are addressed in a coordinated and well-targeted manner. Specifically, the Minister should:
ensure that such programs present consistent messages across the whole of government;
ensure that such programs are delivered in a way that reaches their target audiences;
work with State and Territory governments and industry groups to develop complementary programs and to maximise the impact and reach of such programs; and
encourage industry sectors to undertake their own education programs in coordination with government trade information initiatives (paragraph 2.83).
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has been assessing ways of enhancing coordination of information activities on international trade, and to improving the targeting of messages. An important step in this direction has been the establishment in the Department's Trade Development Division of a new Trade Advocacy and Outreach Section to strengthen and sharpen the focus of the Government's promotion of the benefits of trade to the Australian community. The Minister for Trade announced the creation of this new unit on 29 November 2001 as one of a number of measures to strengthen and sharpen the resources dedicated to trade policy within DFAT. The Trade Advocacy and Outreach Section will address the issues raised in the recommendation and report to the Minister on further steps to enhance community information programs.
The Government already consults extensively with State and Territory governments and with industry groups on promoting the benefits of trade. Enhanced cooperation in this area has been discussed both in the National Trade Consultations and at meetings of the Trade Policy Advisory Council. The Government will continue to develop information programs cooperatively with State and Territory governments and with business. 
Recommendation 4
AUDIT OF INTERNET SITE
The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade ensure that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade undertake an audit of its WTO internet site, with a view to improving access to information about the benefits of trade liberalisation, the role of the WTO system, dispute cases, and ongoing negotiations (paragraph 2.91).
These recommendations are consistent with recent changes already implemented by the DFAT. The Department undertook a thorough audit and updating of the trade related information on the DFAT website in the first half of 2001. The trade material was enhanced and revamped through the design of a new `trade portal', which has made the site considerably easier to access. The portal provides a single entry point on trade issues from the website's home page. It arranges material according to integrated and readily comprehensible themes (e.g. country, industry sector, issue). The section on the WTO, explaining its role as well as the state of negotiations and dispute cases, has also been streamlined. There is a wide array of material on the benefits of trade liberalisation under the section on trade policy and the benefits of trade, including a sub-section on trade and regional Australia. 
Recommendation 5
COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION AT WTO MINISTERIAL MEETINGS
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government invite NGO members of the WTO Advisory Group to participate as community representatives on the official Australian delegation to the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Doha in November 2001 (paragraph 2.118).
Prior to the release of the Committee's report, the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, extended an invitation to all WTO Advisory Group members to join Australia's official delegation for Doha in June 2001. In response to Mr Vaile's invitation, the following members attended: Ms Maureen Barron, Chair, Australian Film Commission; Mr Mitchell Hooke, Chief Executive, Australian Food and Grocery Council; Mrs Cathy McGowan, Australian Women in Agriculture; Mr Mark Paterson, Chief Executive, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI); Mr Leigh Purnell, Executive Director, Australian Industry Group (AIG); and Mr Jim Redden, Policy Director, Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA).
Recommendation 6
PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government propose the establishment of a Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Trade Liberalisation to monitor and review the impact of trade agreements on Australia, opportunities for trade expansion, and trade negotiation positions developed by the Government (paragraph 2.129).
While it is a matter for the Parliament to decide what Committees it wishes to establish, the Government is not convinced that the establishment of a separate Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Trade Liberalisation is necessary. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and its Trade Sub-Committee already has a mandate to review and examine developments in the international trade environment and Australia's trade policies. The Government would welcome increased scrutiny by the JSCFADT of its trade policy priorities, including the WTO.
It should also be noted that the Minister for Trade reports annually to Parliament on trade policy through the Trade Objectives and Outcomes Statement (TOOS). The Statement presents a comprehensive account of the Government's trade efforts affecting all markets and sectors over the past year and its objectives for the coming year. This includes its approach to new trade agreements and initiatives, opportunities for trade expansion, and trade negotiation positions developed by the Government. The Government would welcome more discussion in Parliament, including by relevant Committees, of the policies and programs outlined in the Statement.
Recommendation 7
ANNUAL REVIEW OF WTO POLICY
The Committee recommends that the proposed Joint Standing Committee on Trade Liberalisation undertake an annual review of Australia's WTO policy, including negotiating positions, current or proposed dispute cases, compliance, and structural adjustment (paragraph 2.130).
The same considerations would apply as for recommendation 6. The Government would welcome regular debate on and scrutiny of Australia's policy towards the WTO either by the JSCFADT or otherwise in Parliament, but does not believe creation of a separate Committee is necessary for this purpose. 
Recommendation 8
OFFICE OF TRADE ADVOCATE
The Committee recommends that an Office of Trade Advocate be established within the portfolio of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Office of Trade Advocate should have responsibility for:
·	community education programs about trade liberalisation and the WTO;
·	supporting the development of proposed WTO negotiating positions, including consultation with Sectoral Advisory Committees (recommendation 9);
·	management of Australia's participation in WTO dispute cases, including the use of private sector legal practitioners where appropriate (recommendation 10);
·	promoting access for small and medium-sized Australian industries to the Government's WTO disputes enquiry point;
·	consultation mechanisms with State/Territory governments (recommendation 16); and
·	assessment of new structural adjustment and other industry assistance programs to ensure their compliance with WTO Agreements (paragraph 2.181).
DFAT recently strengthened and restructured the resources within the Department dedicated to trade policy and negotiations. The measures announced by the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, on 29 November 2001, noted above in response to Recommendation 3, included the establishment of an Office of Trade Negotiations with responsibility for all aspects of Australia's trade negotiations including the recently launched round of WTO multilateral trade negotiations and bilateral trade initiatives such as the ongoing free trade agreement negotiations with Singapore. 
This initiative is in line with broader efforts to strengthen overall staff resources devoted to trade policy work in the Department, which have been boosted by 27 per cent over the last three years. The consolidation of strengthened staff resources in an integrated Office of Trade Negotiations with responsibility for the full range of Australia's trade negotiating agenda will increase the effectiveness of Australia's work in this important area. The number of senior level negotiators in Canberra and Geneva has also been boosted substantially.
The Office of Trade Negotiations will also continue to pursue vigorously Australia's trade rights through the WTO dispute settlement system. DFAT strengthened its capacity to handle dispute settlement activity through the creation of a WTO Trade Law Branch at the beginning of 2001. The WTO Trade Law Branch is part of the new Office of Trade Negotiations.
The WTO Trade Law Branch, and the Department more generally, engage very actively in dialogue with exporters and industry groups to ensure they are aware of their WTO rights as well as the full range of WTO issues. For example, Meat and Livestock Australia—which was closely involved in both the US/lamb and ROK/beef disputes in the WTO—endorsed the Department's approach of creating and leading task forces for the management of disputes as an effective way of bringing together the specialised WTO expertise of the Department with the market knowledge of the industry to advance Australian interests. The WTO Trade Law Branch will also continue to seek to raise awareness among small and medium-sized enterprises of the opportunity they have to access WTO remedies for market access difficulties. The Department is examining ways to make the WTO disputes enquiry point more accessible to SMEs, and will continue to highlight that there are no fees for officials' services when accessing the enquiry point. 
The Minister for Trade also announced on 29 November 2001 the establishment of the Trade Development Division within DFAT. This division will be responsible for Australia's regional trade strategy through APEC, the development of a closer economic partnership with ASEAN, trade finance and economic issues, and the development of new bilateral and regional trade initiatives such as the recently commenced scoping study on a free trade agreement with Thailand. As noted in response to Recommendation 3, Trade Development Division will include the new Trade Advocacy and Outreach Section, which will strengthen and sharpen the focus of the Government's promotion of the benefits of trade to the Australian community, including community education programs about trade liberalisation and the WTO.
Both the Office of Trade Negotiations and Trade Development Division will be closely involved in consultative mechanisms with the States and Territories and with industry groups. This includes the Trade Policy Advisory Committee, the National Trade Consultations and the WTO Advisory Group. In addition, the Government will be seeking to enhance consultative mechanisms with specific industry sectors that have an interest in the WTO or bilateral trade negotiations. 
In addition to the trade policy work undertaken by the Office of Trade Negotiations and the Trade Development Division, the Department's four geographic divisions and global network of overseas posts will continue to place a high priority on trade policy issues including pursuing vigorously bilateral market access initiatives on behalf of Australian business.
Recommendation 9
SECTORAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES
The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade establish a series of sectoral advisory committees on multilateral trade, to include representatives from all major Australian exporting industries.
The committees should also provide for consultations with representatives of environment, labour, human rights and community groups, when such issues are material to their deliberations.
The sectoral advisory committees should meet at least biannually and prepare reports to the Trade Minister on sectoral priorities for Australia's trade policy, WTO negotiations and issues of WTO compliance (paragraph 2.226).
The Government recognises that, now a new WTO Round has been agreed, enhanced consultation with industry, other community groups and State Governments is a key priority. Active consideration is being given to the most appropriate structure. As noted in response to Recommendation 8, the Government will be seeking to enhance consultative mechanisms with specific industry sectors that have an interest in the WTO or bilateral trade negotiations. Some of these mechanisms are already in place (e.g. with respect to agriculture), and the Government will be engaging with the relevant sectoral bodies to examine whether or how to strengthen existing consultative processes. There may be a need to establish new bodies for other sectors, now that the WTO round is under way. Such consultative bodies will perform the role of sectoral advisory committees of the kind outlined in the Committee's recommendation. 
As noted above, the Government already has a range of formal and informal consultation channels on WTO-related issues, notably the Trade Policy Advisory Council, the Agricultural Trade Consultative Group and the WTO Advisory Group. The latter includes representatives from industry, community NGOs, academics and the union movement, and is the peak industry/NGO consultative body on WTO-related matters. Its role in providing the Government with expert advice on Australia's interests relevant to the WTO will take on new importance during the course of a round. DFAT also conducts separate regular consultations with NGO groups interested in trade issues. The National Trade Consultations also provide an opportunity for industry and States/Territories to put forward views on trade policy priorities.
The Senior Executive of DFAT also holds regular meetings with heads of industry associations to discuss trade policy issues. The Department's Market Access Facilitators provide another channel for close contact with exporting industries.
Austrade also consults broadly with representatives from key industry sectors through its Export Advisory Panels (EAP). The Panels have provided guidance and advice to key industry players on the strategic approaches Austrade has adopted to assist Australian companies pursue international business in their industry sectors. At present there are five panels covering the industry sectors of agribusiness, automotive, ICT, infrastructure and mining. 
The officials-level Standing Committee on Treaties (SCOT) provides an additional mechanism for regular Commonwealth-State consultations on trade issues. 
Recommendation 10
EXPERT LEGAL PANELS
The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade establish a WTO advisory panel of legal advisers with trade expertise from the private profession and from academia. The legal advisory panel would:
·	provide advice about the WTO compliance of domestic policies and programs, associated risks and in relation to breaches and possible dispute actions by Member countries; and
·	constitute a panel of legal experts in trade issues upon which the Government can draw to supplement and augment the resources of Commonwealth agencies, when required (paragraph 2.227).
The Department believes the establishment of a separate advisory panel, with the range of functions proposed by the Committee, would have a number of limitations. First, and particularly in relation to compliance issues, there is a need to avoid potential conflicts of interest and confidentiality issues, including at Cabinet and commercial level. Advice on compliance typically requires a considerable amount of detail to be provided on, for example, the financial and other aspects of specific projects in order to assess fully the WTO implications, and this requires strict confidentiality provisions. 
A second, and related, point is that the provision of WTO legal advice is an ongoing process and one that is often carried out within very tight timeframes. It could be both expensive and time-consuming to have such matters referred to an external panel for consideration. In the compliance area, for example, advice is often provided in parallel with the development of a specific program or project over a lengthy period of time. The Department encourages this approach to ensure that WTO issues are addressed as part of the program/project design. The involvement of a panel of legal experts in such cases could inhibit this process and divert Departmental resources away from core functions. 
A third issue concerns the importance of ensuring that trade law services are provided within a broader policy context. A feature of the current arrangements is the integration of legal advice with policy advice and recommendations. This reflects the reality of the trade law field, including Australia's broader policy objectives in the WTO. But the main aim in this approach is to ensure that advice to Ministers reflects fully Australia's national interests. It would appear unlikely that an advisory panel of the kind proposed would be able to present a similar national interest perspective. 
Finally, the expert panel proposal appears to have arisen in part from a perception that the Commonwealth's trade law resources need to be augmented. This fails to recognise fully the expansion in the resources dedicated to WTO legal work in DFAT. As outlined in Recommendation 8, DFAT established the WTO Trade Law Branch at the beginning of 2001 to strengthen the Department's legal capacity with regard to WTO dispute settlement and compliance. The WTO Trade Law Branch draws on the assistance of a wide range of agencies depending on the subject matter. That includes policy and technical expertise from agencies such as Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia and the Australian Customs Service. In addition, advice is also sought from the Attorney-General's Department on international legal issues. 
In general, the Departmentis supportive of other agencies, companies or industry groups engaging external WTO legal expertise and will maintain its existing practice of working with such advisers to achieve outcomes that are in Australia's overall national interest. The Department also keeps open the possibility of seeking external legal advice on a case-by-case basis. 
Recommendation 11
LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PARTICIPATION
The Committee recommends that Minister for Trade examine the feasibility of a secondment program between private practice lawyers and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
The secondment program should allow at least two lawyers from private practice to spend a period of rotation in DFAT, and conversely for two DFAT officials to spend a period of rotation in private legal practice; in order to broaden their understanding of the operations of the dispute settlement system and the demand for private sector advice on WTO compliance and risk management (paragraph 2.228).
These recommendations are consistent with current practice. DFAT supports the objective of broadening and deepening understanding of the WTO dispute settlement system in the private sector. A lawyer from a private legal firm was seconded to the WTO Trade Law Branch for a short term assignment in 2001 and a DFAT officer will take up a secondment with a legal firm in 2002. The Department is looking at the possibility of further secondments.
Recommendation 12
AGRICULTURE
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government take a leadership role, acting with like-minded countries, to advance agricultural trade reform through the Cairns Group and with developing countries, to push for a new negotiating round in the WTO and to seek improved market access opportunities for Australia's agriculture and food industries (paragraph 2.273).
These recommendations are consistent with current policy practice. Australia's leadership of the Cairns Group contributed in no small measure to the ambitious mandate on agriculture in the Ministerial Declaration agreed at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha. This was an excellent result for Australia. The Government fully intends that Australia continues its leadership role and expand and enhance its outreach activities with like-minded and developing countries.
The Doha Declaration committed WTO Members to ambitious negotiations in the three key areas of agricultural reform: substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support. Throughout the meeting in Doha, the Cairns Group, chaired by Trade Minister Vaile, performed strongly and cohesively in pushing for the inclusion of these negotiating objectives. We have worked closely with key developing countries, including Egypt, India, Pakistan and Kenya, to highlight the benefits of agricultural trade reform by conducting and participating in regional seminars, inviting influential Ministers to Cairns Group meetings and supporting our overseas missions in outreach activities. The Cairns Group also worked closely with the United States in the lead-up to Doha and US Trade Representative Zoellick and Secretary of Agriculture Veneman attended the Cairns Group Ministerial meeting in Uruguay in October 2001.
In addition to negotiating stronger rules for agricultural trade through the agriculture negotiations, the recent WTO accession negotiations for China and Taiwan will provide new market access opportunities for Australia's agriculture and food industries. The Government will continue to pursue market access opportunities bilaterally and through the negotiations of free trade agreements and trade and investment facilitation agreements currently under consideration. 
Recommendation 13
DISPUTE SETTLEMENT UNDERSTANDING
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government take a proactive role in review of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, in particular:
·	to advocate a more responsive timeframe for compliance and enforcement; and
·	to identify opportunities for more effective use of the mediation and conciliation provided in Article 5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding to assist with appropriate and timely compliance with rulings (paragraph 2.293).
These recommendations are consistent with current practice. Australia is taking an active role in the review of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). The main issues relate to the authorisation, exercise and surveillance of retaliation rights and compliance. What constitutes a reasonable timeframe for compliance and enforcement will vary according to circumstances. Problems with timeframes frequently relate less to the implementation period than to the duration of the litigation period. 
Australia has an interest in ensuring that timeframes for the conduct of dispute proceedings and for implementation are fair and equitable. It should be noted that in some instances, reductions in procedural timeframes for litigation could disadvantage Australian companies with an interest in a particular dispute, for example if such proposals were to deny rights of appeal or limit Australia's capacity to pursue its interests in a case effectively. At the same time, shorter timeframes for resolution are possible if the parties to a dispute agree on a basis for settlement.
Australia supports bilateral resolution as the most expeditious means of dispute resolution. Wherever feasible, the Government will continue to seek a mutually acceptable resolution to complaints as an alternative to legally adjudicated processes in the WTO. The Government is also ready to consider the arbitration alternatives of the DSU, such as those of Article 5 and 25. Recourse to such alternatives, however, requires agreement between the parties to a dispute, which may not always be forthcoming.
Recommendation 14
QUARANTINE
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with State and Territory governments and the community:
·	develop written policy guidelines and operational procedures that describe Australia's `Appropriate Level of Protection' for quarantine; and
·	that the guidelines involve benchmarks for determination of environmental factors and the application of the Precautionary Principle (paragraph 2.326).
The current Biosecurity Australia Guidelines for Import Risk Analysis provide a practical approach for AFFA officers, risk analysts and stakeholders to the application of risk management against Australia's Appropriate Level of Protection (ALOP). This is done using a risk estimation matrix which has been adapted from the Australia-New Zealand Standard on risk management.
Although Australia's existing ALOP statement has been confirmed by a WTO dispute settlement panel as being sufficiently detailed to meet our obligations under the SPS Agreement, the Commonwealth is examining with the State and Territory Governments the possibility of developing a more detailed statement on ALOP.
The Government believes, however, that there is no need to refer to the precautionary principle when describing Australia's ALOP which already incorporates a cautious and highly conservative approach. The recommendation, and the discussion in the Report, does not take into account the difference between exercising precaution (as reflected in Australia's ALOP) and invoking the precautionary principle.
Separately, the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and its associated regulations and administration already include guidelines on the application of the precautionary principle. Biosecurity Australia and Environment Australia work together to ensure that protection of the environment is appropriately addressed in animal and plant import risk analyses, including through shared assessments of weediness and pest potential. These issues were also the subject of considerable discussion in relation to the risk assessments undertaken by the Gene Technology Regulator (who issues licences for all uses of GMOs). 
Recommendation 15 
WTO COMPLIANCE
The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade (in consultation with other relevant Ministers) devise a WTO compliance checklist to be used by all Ministers and their officials when developing new industry support programs (paragraph 2.356).
This recommendation is consistent with current practice. DFAT has provided, and makes readily available, an outline of current WTO rules relating to subsidies and investment incentives. This outline provides details on measures that would be inconsistent with WTO obligations. It also provides guidance on WTO jurisprudence and the types of factors that are typically examined by WTO dispute settlement panels in determining whether industry support measures constitute prohibited subsidies. DFAT also conducts seminars tailored to deal with issues relating to subsidies, investment incentives and other compliance issues.
Recommendation 16
COMMONWEALTH/STATE CONSULTATIONS
The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade ensure that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade places a high priority on consulting with State and Territory Governments on trade related matters. The relationship between the Commonwealth and State governments should involve:
·	regular, at least annual, ministerial level meetings;
·	inclusion of State and Territory representatives on WTO consultation taskforces, where special understanding or expertise can be brought to bear; and
·	inclusion of State and Territory representatives on official WTO delegations, where special understanding or expertise can be brought to bear and where there is a willingness on the part of the State or Territory governments to recognise over-riding international obligations (paragraph 2.370).
The high priority the Government places on consulting with State/Territory Governments is reflected by existing regular consultation on trade matters, principally through the National Trade Consultation process, where Ministers meet annually and senior officials meet twice yearly intersessionally, as well as through ongoing bilateral discussions on specific issues. State/Territory Government representatives had the opportunity to put forward views on the WTO during consultations held in capital cities in June/July 2001. Some State/Territory agencies have established inter-departmental committees to coordinate exchanges with the Commonwealth on WTO-related issues. As part of its Parliamentary obligations, the Government consults with State/Territory Governments in preparing responses to all Parliamentary Committees, including the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.
DFAT proposes to continue its practice of including State/Territory government representatives on WTO dispute task forces, if requested. In WTO disputes involving a complaint against a State/Territory measure, the Department would also continue to invite State/Territory government representative/s to join the official delegation to WTO dispute hearings. 
The Government will examine the merits of including State and Territory representatives on official WTO delegations, in cases where special understanding or expertise can be brought to bear, and where meeting arrangements make this practical.
Recommendation 17
TRADE, ENVIRONMENT AND MULTI-LATERAL ENVIRONMENT AGREEMENTS
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government use its position on the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) to urge the CTE to bring forward clear proposals for resolution of the issue of potential conflicts in obligations under different multilateral agreements (paragraph 3.110).
WTO Ministers agreed at Doha to negotiations on the relationship between WTO rules and specific trade obligations in multilateral environment agreements (MEAs). Ministers also agreed to negotiate on procedures for regular information exchange between MEA Secretariats and relevant WTO committees. Australia will be participating in these negotiations with a view to supporting practical measures for advancing trade and environmental policy priorities, while guarding against outcomes that could lead to trade protectionist measures. 
The question of the coherence between the provisions of MEAs and WTO obligations is a complex one. The exceptions language in the GATT/WTO (Article XX of GATT 1994), which applies to environmental measures, has been interpreted by a number of dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body. Overall, the WTO dispute settlement system has shown itself capable of taking into account appropriate environmental concerns.
Recommendation 18 
REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government ensure that Australia continues to actively participate on the WTO Committee on Regional Trade Agreements, and pursue Regional Trade Agreements that will result in enhanced market access and broader economic gains for Australia if those benefits cannot be advanced expeditiously through other mechanisms (paragraph 3.134).
These recommendations are consistent with current policy. The Government will continue to participate actively in the WTO's Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA). The CRTA has a key role to play in ensuring the transparency of regional trade agreements (RTAs) and promoting their strict adherence to WTO rules. This function is likely to grow in importance with the proliferation of RTAs around the world and it is in Australia's interest that the potential for trade diversion arising from these agreements be kept to a minimum. The Government welcomes the decision taken by WTO Ministers in Doha to undertake negotiations aimed at clarifying and improving disciplines and procedures under the WTO rules on RTAs. The Government will take an active part in these negotiations.
The Government also agrees with the Committee's recommendation that Australia pursue RTAs that result in better market access for Australia. The Government pursues an integrated multilateral, regional and bilateral approach to trade policy and it is the Government's policy to consider RTAs if they would deliver substantial gains to Australia that could not be achieved in a similar timeframe by other means. Furthermore, the Government believes that RTAs that are comprehensive in scope and coverage can complement our wider multilateral objectives. Consistent with this policy, the Government is currently pursuing a number of regional trade initiatives including negotiations with Singapore for an FTA, a joint scoping study on a possible FTA with Thailand, a possible FTA with the US, continuing work on a Closer Economic Partnership between AFTA and CER, and separate initiatives with Korea and Japan to strengthen economic relations. 
Recommendation 19
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government through its membership of the Cairns Group identify barriers to participation of developing countries in the WTO, and develop strategies as appropriate to assist developing countries to make full use of the WTO and the DSU to further their trading interests (paragraph 3.178).
This recommendation is consistent with current policy. Australia, as chair of the Cairns Group, has been leading the Group's outreach activities to developing countries. The Cairns Group, 14 members of which are developing countries, has assisted other developing countries enhance their participation in the WTO agriculture negotiations, and further their trading interests through the agricultural reform agenda. This has been done through technical assistance, seminars and information-sharing.
Australia is also active in discussions within the WTO to ensure that the needs of developing countries are adequately addressed and is involved in a range of initiatives providing technical assistance and capacity building to developing countries to support their participation in the WTO and to gain benefits from trade. In 2000-01, Australia provided approximately $A25 million in trade-related technical assistance for developing countries.
In addition, Australia has taken a leading role in APEC on WTO capacity building, most notably through the development of programs designed to increase the ability of APEC developing economy members to participate in WTO negotiations.
Recommendation 20
ASIA-PACIFIC WTO CENTRE
The Committee recommends that at the Doha WTO Ministerial Meeting, and at future WTO meetings, the Commonwealth Government advocate the establishment of an Asia-Pacific Regional Centre of the WTO.
The Asia-Pacific Regional Centre would serve as a venue for WTO negotiations and dispute hearings, and as a training centre for developing countries within the region to build their capacity for WTO advocacy (paragraph 3.182).
The Government does not perceive a need for a separate Asia-Pacific regional centre for the WTO. WTO Member countries in the Asia/Pacific region have been active participants in the WTO dispute settlement system since its establishment in 1995. These countries have not shown any unwillingness to participate in disputes because of the need to travel to Geneva. Creation of a separate WTO regional centre could also duplicate a substantial range of training and capacity building programs to assist developing countries provided through APEC and bilateral and multilateral aid programs, including through Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Commonwealth Trade and Investment Access Facility (TIAF).  
In response to the needs of developing countries, and particularly non-resident members, the WTO has enhanced the design and delivery of its technical assistance and capacity building programs. At the 4th Ministerial Conference, members also agreed to develop work programs to examine issues relating to the trade of small economies. Economic and technical cooperation activities in APEC also assist members address structural, policy and administrative bottlenecks and establish the conditions for growth and development. For example, through the APEC Support Program, Australia has supported small, high-impact activities by Australian Government departments and statutory authorities aimed at enhancing developing member economy participation in APEC. An example of country specific activities is the training Australia has provided for Chinese officials, focusing on APEC issues and international policy on trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation, and economic cooperation.
Through the ASEAN-Australia Development Cooperation Program, Australia is assisting the ASEAN Secretariat provide regional economic policy advice to ASEAN members and supported a workshop on competition policy for ASEAN countries to enhance operational capacity in competition policy development and implementation, and explore the viability of a regional resource centre on competition policy.
Through the Commonwealth Trade and Investment Access Facility, Commonwealth countries are being assisted to identify and manage the potential economic and social impacts of trade and investment liberalisation and participate in the WTO and other key international trade and investment agreements.
A separate WTO regional centre would seem to provide little additional benefit. The Government would prefer to see additional funds used for expanded technical capacity building managed through the WTO in Geneva.
Recommendation 21
HUMAN RIGHTS AND LABOUR ISSUES
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government continue to seek support to establish a forum outside the World Trade Organisation to discuss  to promote core labour standards, comprising key international organisations including the WTO, the International Labour Organisation, the World Bank and the United Nations (paragraph 3.202).
Australia has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation (ILO) as the pre-eminent international body to promote labour standards. In that regard, it has indicated broad support for an ILO proposal for the formation of a World Commission of Eminent Persons, under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General, which would prepare a major report on the social dimensions of globalisation with a view to setting out appropriate policies.
The recent Doha Ministerial Declaration reaffirmed the declaration made at the WTO Singapore Ministerial Conference regarding internationally recognised core labour standards, and took note of work underway in the International Labour Organisation on the social dimension of globalisation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,26,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-08-29,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I seek leave to speak on the government's response to the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee inquiry into ABC board appointments, entitled Above Board? Methods of appointment to the ABC board.
Leave granted.
—The minister's response to the Senate committee report on methods of appointments to the ABC board is as disappointing as it is late. This committee reported in September last year and it has taken the minister a year to decide to reject all of its recommendations for change. The Democrats initiated this inquiry into ABC board appointments because of the serious concern about the politicisation of ABC board appointments. During Labor's 13 years in office, they made 26 board appointments, which included a former Labor Premier, a former disendorsed Liberal senator and minister, four trade union activists, four advisers to Labor governments and the Labor Party's former party pollster. These appointments were so blatant that the then shadow minister, one Senator Alston, in 1994 said:
That will come as a great disappointment to all those who are looking to the government to take this opportunity to make appointments to the board on the basis of merit and to boost the community standing and reputation of the ABC ... This blatant board stacking exercise endangers the independence and integrity of the ABC and has the potential to do grave danger to Australia's international reputation. 
My, how things change. The ABC's historian, Professor Ken Ingliss, has told this committee:
Most of the directors appointed since the Howard government took office have been formally or informally identifiable as supporters of the Coalition ... In the narrow sense of party political appointments of people known to be close or sympathetic to the government of the day, I think there is more of that now than there has been at any time between 1983 and 1995.
It is worth noting that the current ABC board includes Michael Kroger, a former Victorian Liberal president; Ross McLean, a former Liberal federal MP; Donald McDonald, a friend of the Prime Minister; Judith Sloan, a long-time conservative adviser to Liberal governments; and Leith Boully, a former Country Liberal Party member. Until recently, its managing director was a former Young Liberals president, Jonathan Shier. In anyone's language it is hard to describe such a board as `genuine and impartial', to use Senator Alston's 1994 benchmark.
The committee chair's report made some excellent recommendations to overcome the bias inherent in ABC appointments. It recommends that board appointments be based on merit and transparency, that directors be expected to have a commitment to public broadcasting, that formal selection criteria be developed, that vacancies be advertised, that an independent selection panel shortlist applicants, that political affiliations be declared and that the chair be elected by the board rather than be appointed by the minister. This package of reforms broadly follows a practice put in place by the British government.
Unbelievably, the minister has rejected all of these recommendations, arguing that it would create a `cumbersome process' and that `there is no compelling reason to alter it'. Yes, I agree: it will be a more cumbersome process than a minister getting on the phone to some Liberal Party hack and offering an ABC board sinecure. But it will be a better process. Yes, of course, the minister would see no compelling reason to change the process when he has done more than any other minister in history to stack the ABC board with political mates. This government has also, remember, cut the ABC's funding by $55 million. It attacks its independence at every opportunity and it stacks its board with mates just to make sure.
Where does Labor stand in all this? Senator Bishop's report saw merit in selection criteria and the advertising of vacancies, he called for further investigation into the merits of alternative processes for selecting appointments and he called for an increase of funding as `the most important means of ensuring the independence of the ABC'. More recently in May, shadow minister Lindsay Tanner said, `Labor will be exploring means of improving the ABC board appointments process to end the appointment of political stooges to the ABC board.' Let us hope that, unlike Senator Alston, Labor's spokesman carries that commitment into government. The ABC is an Australian institution and it needs the best possible leaders to fulfil its role impartially and in the public interest. The Democrats will continue to agitate for an ABC that represents all of us, not just the Liberal Party's chosen few.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,26,1,speech

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2002-08-29,"—During the parliamentary break, I took the opportunity to have a look around Australia to see for myself the effects of the crippling drought that is affecting much of our country. On the journey from Sydney to Brisbane it was very clear that along the coast the drought has not had a particular effect, but travelling back through Broken Hill to my home state of South Australia it was very clear that in western New South Wales and in the pastoral zone of South Australia there is a very terrible drought, which is gripping many of our farm families. In fact, we have had the lowest rainfall for 100 years, and 82 per cent of the state of New South Wales is now in the grip of a worsening drought.
It is estimated that there could be an almost total wheat crop failure in New South Wales, which is one of our key grain exporting states, unless a significant amount of rain falls very soon. At this point, our thoughts are with Senator Heffernan and his family in Junee, where there has been no rain for many, many months and his family are feeling the effects of a very poor season. The winter crop failures could cost Queensland $2 billion, and Australian farmers' incomes are actually forecast to drop by 40 per cent. GrainCorp has revised down its forecast in New South Wales by 1.5 million tonnes in the last month. In Western Australia, the receival estimates are fading rapidly because of the continuing dry conditions and they are likely to drop one million tonnes from the estimated range of just three weeks ago. In Queensland, the forecast two weeks ago was that receivals would fall below 900,000 tonnes, which is a 40 per cent drop from the historical average. In my own state of South Australia conditions are still patchy and farmers are still hoping that some rains will enable crops to be sown. But, increasingly, it now appears that large areas of my state will also fail to complete a harvest this year.
This is a time when those of us who follow the rural sector closely are thankful for the farm management deposits which were introduced by our government in 1999. I am very pleased to see that 23,000 Australian farmers have now contributed a total of $1.2 billion to those farm management deposits. I heard the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, describe them quite appropriately in the other place as `financial haystacks'. Many of those farm families will be dipping into those financial haystacks as the drought tightens its grip on this country. Queensland has the highest investment in farm management deposits— $294 million—and we are all very thankful for that. The grain industry has invested $207 million in farm management deposits, and the beef industry—which of course is feeling the effects of the drought, particularly in Queensland and northern New South Wales—has invested $188 million.
When drought strikes in our country we also think of the difficult circumstances that affect farmers when they try to apply for exceptional circumstances relief payments. This has been a very difficult issue for federal and state governments for many years. It was only a couple of years ago, I recall, that exceptional circumstances payments were refused for floods, fires, an insect plague and frost right across Australia almost at the same time, which led some of us to wonder what had to happen on a farming property for the circumstances to be considered exceptional.
One of the difficulties of exceptional circumstances, as I see it, is the very name of the program. Many farm families are currently in exceptional circumstances—they have had little rain in their area for 100 years—and yet the declaration of exceptional circumstances is still at the whim of state governments, which have to trigger the programs to start with. It is up to the state governments in the first instance to provide assistance to farmers in drought, and once they have made the declaration that the drought is an exceptional circumstance then EC will apply. But it has always been a very hoary chestnut.
One of the other things I noticed during my 8, 000 kilometre drive—the sort of drive you take, Senator Macdonald—
—8,000 kilometres!
—was the amount of road kill. It was extraordinary! There were pigs, goats, hundreds of emus and, of course, the usual kangaroos. This led to an even more hazardous situation where wedge-tailed eagles on the road eating road kill and unable to take off quickly provided quite a difficult road hazard. In many years of country driving I do not recall ever having seen road kill in such proportions as we unfortunately have on our highways at the moment. The inland route from Brisbane down to Adelaide via Broken Hill is littered with road kill. It is very dangerous and also very tragic—these animals seeking a little green feed on the side of the road and paying the highest price as a result. 
The lowering rainfall is undoubtedly going to have an effect on our wheat prices. It was very good to see so much bunker storage, particularly in north-western New South Wales where we clearly have good stockpiles of wheat, which will stand us in good stead as the prices increase as a result of poor seasons in the United States, Canada, India and some of the other grain-producing countries. In fact, I understand that only eastern and western Europe are having a reasonable grain season. So, whilst we are going to have a difficult season, thankfully the pool prices are likely to be higher. Thankfully, also, we have a situation now where wheat is being unloaded in Iraq. The difficulties that we had in Iraq just a week or so ago appear to have been resolved and, as of last week, wheat was being unloaded and a number of other shipments were either near or in the ports. So farmers can rest assured that the very important wheat exports to Iraq will not be affected. 
Tonight we are enjoying some soft early spring rain here in Canberra, but my thoughts, and I am sure those of many of my colleagues in the Senate, go out to those farm families who are living on properties where it has not rained for two years. We hope that the rain that is coming to Canberra tonight is actually spreading through the south-western area of New South Wales that is so badly hit by the worsening drought.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Drought</title>,Adjournment,35,1,speech
