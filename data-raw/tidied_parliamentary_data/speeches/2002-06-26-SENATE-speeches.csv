"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—The opposition will be supporting the question before the chair. I do, however, seek from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, when he responds to this debate, a commitment in relation to the way the chamber will deal with valedictory speeches for retiring senators. Madam President, you would recall that last week the opposition gave up general business time because of our concerns about the pressure of the program and the fact that we were well aware that many senators would want to contribute to a valedictory debate tomorrow for retiring senators. That general business time last week was appropriately spent on government business and I think was effectively utilised then.
Eight senators are retiring from the Senate and tomorrow will be their last sitting day as senators. The opposition have given a commitment to government and other senators in the chamber that, again, we would forgo general business time in this regard for valedictory speeches tomorrow. I ask the Manager of Government Business to give a commitment that, in relation to that valedictory debate—which the motion before the chair contemplates coming forward no later than 4.30 p.m. tomorrow and concluding by 8 p.m.—arrangements will be made in the chamber to allow each of our retiring senators to use the time between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. tomorrow evening to make a 15-minute valedictory speech and prior to that, from as early as possible after question time to when we are able to get on to valedictory speeches, allow those senators who wish to speak about their retiring colleagues an opportunity to do so in a valedictory speech with a 10-minute time limit.
I think this will give some certainty to all those who want to participate in the debate. It will give certainty to retiring senators and seems, I think most senators would agree—I hope all senators would agree—a very sensible way of dealing with the significant number of valedictory speeches for retiring senators that we have on this occasion. So my only request, as we deal with this important matter, is to ask the Manager of Government Business to give a commitment that the way I have outlined this matter being dealt with tomorrow is also agreed to by the government so we can give that level of certainty to all senators in the chamber who wish to participate in valedictory speeches but particularly, in this instance, to our eight colleagues who are retiring.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—I oppose this motion. It is an outcome of very sloppy management of government business by this government. For example, I point to the period after the valedictories to the late Prime Minister John Gorton, Monday week ago, when the House of Representatives sat but the Senate did not. We had some hours of opportunity there to deal with matters which are listed now and we did not. We also see on this list a number of pieces of legislation, such as the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002, which could hardly be said to be urgent. Madam President, you will certainly know that the first of those has been a matter for discussion in the Senate on a number of occasions over the last several years.
The list includes the International Criminal Court Bill 2002. That is very important legislation which the Greens are keen to see go through. I asked the government yesterday to ensure that that legislation is available for us to consider today. It would be totally inappropriate for that to arrive in the Senate to be discussed and decided upon by the Senate tomorrow. Why do we not have the bill? There was a long period of delay while the government made up its mind on the matter. But the parliament making up its mind on the matter is more important still. It is going to be by the good grace of the Senate that that legislation gets through, if it does. We are all aware that it is important that Australia ratify the International Criminal Court treaty so that there is Australian input into the formulation of the first bench of that court with the potential for Australian judges to be on that bench. If we do not ratify it in time that will not happen. Again, the delay is of the government's making. 
The penalty for the delay is the Senate's to wear. I do not believe a number of these pieces of legislation have been dealt with properly or can be considered properly by the Senate with reference to the community. We are not just a rubber stamp. We are a house of review, and part of that review requires that we have the opportunity to consult the community about the legislation we are dealing with. If we are going to deal with bills which have not been adequately looked at by members, let alone the community, in the next 36 or 48 hours, it is well nigh impossible to get to the community in that time.
What is the problem here? The problem is the government. If on each occasion at the end of a session like this, we just say, `Oh, well, the government is being dilatory. It is being disorganised. It has been unable to get its act in order. The Senate will pick up the tab for that,' then we become part of the problem as well. The government has to do much better than this. I do not agree with the process of concentrating on important pieces of legislation like this when everybody is tired and the great impulse is to get home without giving these pieces of legislation the consideration they deserve.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-26,"—I have made similar speeches in relation to similar motions already this year. Nonetheless, my views about this need to be put on the record. At the end of this week, the Senate will have sat for a grand total of 21 sitting days since we rose in September, before the last election. In that nine-month period, we have had 21 sitting days, one of which was used for a condolence motion for the former Prime Minister and another was the opening of parliament. So, in effect, we have had 19 sitting days in which we have been considering legislation. That is completely inadequate given the number of pieces of legislation that we have dealt with in that very short number of days.
Once again, because of the government's plan of sitting so few days, we are being required to pass a ridiculous number of pieces of legislation in that short time frame. Looking at the list, without having counted them beforehand, there are over 19 bills when you separate them all out. So we have had 19 sitting days in the year to date in which to consider legislation and now we are being asked to put through 19 or more bills. Some of these bills are in packages, I acknowledge, but we have 19 or more bills to pass in one or two days before the recess.
As I have said before when speaking to these sorts of motions, the government is treating the Senate and the parliament with contempt. If we continue to agree to these sorts of procedures, I guess that is no more than we deserve. If you are treated with contempt and you accept it, the chances are you will keep getting treated with contempt. This is completely unacceptable as any sort of genuine process of considering legislation. 
It needs to be emphasised that considering legislation is not just a process that we all have to go through because that is what the Constitution tells us we have to do. Legislation actually affects people's lives, sometimes in enormous ways. I do not even know the content of some of these bills, but some of those I know of, such as the Migration Legislation Amendment (Procedural Fairness) Bill 2002—which seeks to remove procedural fairness, I might add—could have enormous impact on people's lives. Yet, we are being forced to push them all through in what every reasonable person would have to acknowledge is a completely unsatisfactory way. It is an atrocious process that, once again, I assume, we are now going to engage in. Given that the majority of the Senate keep agreeing to this atrocious process, no doubt the government will think that it is appropriate and okay to continue to utilise such processes. The government are undermining the whole purpose of the parliament and they are putting the parliamentary and political processes into disrepute. I do not really need to remind senators here that they are already in a fairly high stage of disrepute and that these sorts of things will only increase that.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-06-26,"—I indicate that One Nation also will be opposing the motion, not in the sense that the government does not have the right to vary the business of the government but in the strict sense not only of our opposition to the package of bills referred to as the terrorism bills but also of what we now have with the Senate being asked to consider the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 and the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002. The government had circulated a draft in confidence prior to last night, but that draft in confidence was only 147 pages. When we actually looked at the legislation that was released onto the system at nine o'clock last night, we saw that that bill is now 247 pages. That is a huge addition even to the draft in confidence bill. There has been no time to consult with the people of Queensland, yet the government expects us to pass this motion and to bring on these two bills to which there is clearly considerable opposition from the public.  
The total number of bills that we are being asked to consider in the remainder of today and tomorrow is 26. That is 26 bills in two sitting days. I do not believe anyone in this chamber would even be able to sit down and physically read the bills, let alone debate them in a meaningful way in two days.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-06-26,"—I would like to respond to a number of points. Firstly, I will respond to the substantive points raised by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. The government concurs with the idea put forward by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in relation to the handling of the valedictory debate on Thursday afternoon. I have asked the Government Whip, Senator Paul Calvert, to confer with the Opposition Whip to put together a speakers list so that we can achieve that end.
Just to reiterate the point and have it on the record, that will be to ensure that the eight retiring senators—and I am sure it must be some sort of record to have literally over 10 per cent of the Senate moving out at one time; I do not recall that occurring before—
—The last time was pre 1949.
—That was slightly before I was aware of things in the Senate. Anyway, there are eight senators going, and that will divide the time between six o'clock and eight o'clock very neatly into 15-minute slices for the retiring senators. Then I would ask our whips to get together and arrange a speakers list for the period tomorrow commencing no later than 4.30, but potentially as early as straight after question time, depending on the dynamics of question time, and going up until six o'clock, for all other senators to make their contribution to the valedictory debate. That will ensure that we have a worthwhile and inclusive debate between question time and eight o'clock tomorrow night to deliver valedictories for the eight retiring senators. 
The other point I would like to make, in response to matters raised by the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, Senator Joseph Ludwig, is that there are on the list circulated and in my amendment a number of so-called non-controversial bills, or `Thursday lunchtime bills', which we have sought agreement to debate. Bills where there is no agreement will be put off until after winter, to the spring sittings, as I think they are officially called. Any bills which we cannot get agreement to debate as non-controversial bills will be put off to the spring sittings.
I would also like to reiterate that the Senate will be sitting tonight—and I appreciate the cooperation of all senators in sitting tonight to keep going through this heavy program—and that there will be divisions and quorums. It will be necessary for whips, and any senators who are attending the charity function sponsored by the press gallery that is taking place in the building, to make special arrangements to make sure their beepers can be heard. It is very important that people support the important charities sponsored by the press gallery mid-winter ball. It is also important that any votes that take place in the Senate have a full roll-up. 
I also make a couple of responses in relation to comments made by Senator Brown and Senator Bartlett. Firstly, there is no doubt that the record will show that the Senate will not sit as many days this year as it has in some other years. But there are a number of factors. If you look back through the record, you see that the Senate—and the House of Representatives, for that matter— sit significantly fewer days in any election year. In recent history, the Senate sat for only 59 days in 1990, 53 days in 1993, 57 days in 1998 and 52 days last year. This year has had that slightly compounded in that we had the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting hosted in Australia, which is a very rare occurrence. Honourable senators would know that that very important international event would have occurred last year, and we had actually rescheduled last year's sittings to accommodate the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Brisbane. We had rearranged the sitting schedule, as we normally do, not only because of CHOGM but also because Her Majesty was in Australia. Generally the parliament would not sit at that time unless Her Majesty was actually addressing the parliament. That was an unusual event. Basically there has been a confluence of two significant things occurring that have truncated the days available for the Senate to sit.  
Some people have said that the Senate should have come back earlier. I did an analysis of the commencement dates for Senate sittings after elections and generally the Senate does resume slightly later than normal after an election. There are often good reasons for that: you are actually swearing in a new government and you are bringing new ministers in. If you look at the dates of the commencement of Senate sittings in post-election periods, the date that we came back this year was in the median. They are often later than normal for lots of good reasons. Anecdotally, talking to senators on the cross benches—I did not speak to everyone; I bumped into people in airports over the Christmas summer recess and I spoke to people from the Australian Labor Party and my own colleagues—I did not have anyone call me up or speak to me and say that the government was being dilatory by not calling the parliament back earlier. I think everyone, if they are frank, would say that, after a very heavy year and a very busy election, having the Senate come back one week earlier did not seem to be the desire of anyone. I am not putting words into other people's mouths. Perhaps Senator Bartlett or Senator Brown were very keen to come back a week earlier. The point I am making is that there are some extraordinary circumstances as to why the Senate has sat fewer days.
It has got into the popular media that the Senate has not been sitting for very long but we do ourselves a disservice, whether we are government senators or non-government senators, to take away the estimates days. We say, `The Senate is not sitting,' and we let this get into the ether and become part of the received wisdom. The reality is that the Senate has already sat for at least 14 days doing estimates this year. As all of us know who are involved in the process—whether you are a minister or a member of the committee, a government or a non-government senator, or whether you are part of the staff of the Senate—the estimates process is probably the most intense period of scrutiny of the government in the Senate's procedures. I do not think we do ourselves as an institution a service to say, `We've only sat X number of days.' The reality is we have already done 14 days of Senate estimates. I do not think anyone involved in that process would think it is anything other than very hard work over very long days. It involves most of the Australian Public Service, almost all of the Senate and of course the clerks and other support staff in the Senate for this quite intensive work. It is, from anyone's point of view, some of the most constructive work that a house of review can do to hold the executive government to account. I think it is entirely appropriate to put those days in because traditionally, prior to the establishment of the Senate estimates processes, the days that were allocated to Senate estimates would have been Committee of the Whole days where you would have spent extensive time in the Senate as a whole examining the estimates contained in the annual budget. I still remember those days when I first arrived here in 1990 where you would have an entire box full of advisers. You would be basically asking through the minister the same sort of questions you ask in estimates, hour after hour after hour. It was a very inefficient process. The estimates process, although it takes a long time, is a good process. 
I conclude that point by saying that when you add in the estimates days, which I think it is appropriate to do, the Senate will have sat for 73 days in 2002, which is certainly within the field. We will obviously be sitting a lot more in the second half of this year than we have in the first half, for obvious reasons. The first half of the year is very hard to schedule. You have Easter that moves around, you have the commencement and you have a range of problems, and when CHOGM is interspersed it is very hard to design a sitting program. And no-one came to me with any other suggestions.  
In relation to the valedictory day for the late Sir John Gorton, we made a decision that we would stick by the protocol which has been laid down for, as I understand it, all of the previous condolences for prime ministers. Some people suggested that we should do the condolences and then return to their business in the evening. I, for one, insisted that we would abide by the protocol. I think that Australia should ensure that our prime ministers from all parties are paid the respect they are due, and the very least the Senate can do is stick by the protocol. I do not think anyone should argue about that. I commend my amendment and the motion to the Senate.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order as to procedure. The motion that we have before the chamber at the moment lists the Migration Legislation Amendment (Procedural Fairness) Bill 2002 as being subject to the exemption from the bills cut-off order, that is, standing order 111, which clearly says under (5)(b) that if a bill:
... is received from the House of Representatives and was introduced in that House in the same period of sittings ...
it can be entered only by a motion for leave. My point of order is that the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 and the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 should also be subject to that same bills cut-off order.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—There is no point of order. It would be a matter for the Senate to decide if it came before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-06-26,"—by leave—It only needs to be said, and I will go through this briefly, that parliament did sit a week later, that estimates was scheduled during the House of Representatives which then meant the House of Representatives had a number of extra sitting weeks—I think three in all—when the Senate did not sit. This meant that, in terms of the legislative program, the Senate was out of sync. In that sense, more legislation was able to be passed through the House of Representatives as they had more time, which then brought about a logjam towards the end of the Senate sitting session. There was of course CHOGM, which did cause a delay in the program, but there was the opportunity to come back after Easter for an additional week. The government did not take that up, and it needs to be highlighted that the program is in the hands of the government. The government does determine the program and the weeks of sittings. The Senate has not sat for sufficient time in this sitting period in relation to other sitting periods. It is necessary for the government to take the responsibility and at least make it clear that the program is their responsibility. In terms of it getting its program through, the opposition does extend the courtesies of attempting to at least meet the available time frames, as put by the government. However, it is a matter that I think Senator Campbell should take on board: that in speaking to the motion that was before us today he should not stretch the friendship.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-06-26,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you to revisit your ruling on my point of order, because the motion that we are debating at the moment clearly says that the Senate shall not rise until it has finally considered the bills listed below. My understanding of section 111 is that, either at the point when the bill is introduced or now, it would be correct for that bill to be exempt subject to standing order 111, and I ask you to revisit your decision.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—My decision stands, Senator Harris. The Senate is the proper place to consider that and it is not a point of order. The Senate will decide. The question is that the motion as amended by Senator Ian Campbell be agreed to.
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—The amendments currently before the chair are two amendments that I have moved on behalf of the opposition. We are dealing with one of the most crucial elements of this important package of legislation because we are dealing with the issue of proscription. This, probably more than any other provision in these bills, has caused a very significant amount of community debate. I was indicating last night that the government now proposes a regime with a definition of `terrorist organisation' that has three alternative limbs. Let me briefly just mention again what those limbs are: limb 1 is an organisation found by a court to be engaged in a terrorist act; limb 2 is an organisation which is the subject of a decision by the United Nations Security Council that it is an international terrorist organisation; and limb 3 is an organisation which the Attorney-General is satisfied, on reasonable grounds, is engaged in a terrorist act. It is true that, in relation to the second and third limb of the government's proposed regime, those limbs require the Attorney-General to make a regulation and those regulations do not take effect until the disallowance period has expired.
The opposition has consistently expressed its grave concerns that the government's approach still includes an executive direction to proscribe organisations. The capacity for parliament to disallow any regulation nominating a suspected terrorist organisation does very little to ameliorate the concerns that were identified by the Senate committee and that were identified more broadly in the community. While the government maintains that regulations would only be made on the basis of sufficient publicly available information, Professor George Williams has put a very cogent case, and I would like to quote his words:
Parliament is not the right forum for an independent review of a decision to ban an organisation.
Professor Williams went on to say:
Parliament is neither a fair nor a sensible place to review volumes of sensitive national security information. It does, of course, include people from an attorney-general's own party, who will likely support the decision on party grounds. The idea of a political and partisan debate on whether to ban an organisation and to criminalise its members is deeply disturbing. Review by parliament and not by a court may actually prevent an immediate response to an emergency situation.
It is worth reflecting on that contribution to the public debate by Professor Williams. We go further: we say it is also unlikely that the courts would accept a merits review of a proscription decision where parliament had not exercised its right to disallow the relevant regulation.
The opposition is of the view that the third limb of the government's regime—that is, the one where the Attorney-General is satisfied on reasonable grounds that an organisation is engaged in a terrorist act—of defining a terrorist organisation is essentially the same as the government's previous proposal for an executive proscription regime. Mind you, the previous proposal only contained the suggestion of an executive proscription regime. That proposal remains unacceptable to the opposition and we are moving for it to be deleted. We do not support giving such wide powers, such arbitrary powers, to any minister of any government. We say, as we have said consistently, that such powers are open to abuse. 
While we do have a very strong in-principle objection to executive proscription, we have said that we are prepared to accept listing of an organisation declared to be a terrorist organisation by the United Nations Security Council. I want to point out to the committee that there is a fundamental need in the war against terrorism to have international cooperation. We say that in the same way that this parliament and the Australian people should expect Australia to cooperate with the United Nations committee processes in relation to human rights issues, whether it is refugee or environmental issues or the whole raft of other important questions, Australia should cooperate as best as we can with the international community and the United Nations effort to target and destroy terrorist organisations. This is an international struggle, and if the international community through the United Nations Security Council declares an organisation to be a terrorist organisation we do accept that such an organisation should be banned.
I know that some would like to pick and choose which United Nations processes they like and which United Nations processes suit them, but the fact is that when it comes to matters of international importance—and I have mentioned some: the treatment of refugees, global warming is a very good example or the fight against international terrorist organisations—the authority and strength of the United Nations is undermined when you pick and choose. We should not accept a situation where we pick and choose between declarations of the United Nations because at the end of the day either we consider ourselves part of the international community or we do not. The opposition is unashamed about cooperating with the United Nations in the international fight against terrorism.
We say that the hard-headed and effective approach for Australia to take is to cooperate with the United Nations to tackle organisations that the United Nations itself has identified as international terrorist organisations. We also say that it is proper, in Australian law, to define terrorist offences and let the police, the intelligence services and the courts do their job. We believe that this will assist the whole international community to act swiftly against terrorist organisations listed by the United Nations Security Council—the best and most well-known example of which, of course, is Al-Qaeda and its associated entities.
Having said that, the challenge remains for this parliament to get the balance right. At the end of this week—which is the end of this sitting period of the Senate—comparisons will be drawn between the amended bills that pass this parliament and the original bills that the government tried to rush through the parliament in March. I believe that the difference between the bills we pass in their very significantly amended form and the bills that were originally introduced by the government is really the difference between Australia remaining a civil society and it crossing the threshold to become a police state. That is a very dangerous threshold to cross. This Senate Committee of the Whole should not contemplate doing so.
I am not sure whether there is a realisation, in the broader community, of the enormity of the challenge that this parliament tackles in getting the balance right in our domestic law response to terrorism. All parliamentarians have received many letters, emails and communications on this issue. I am not sure that, in the broader community, there is an understanding of the scale of the changes being made to this package of legislation, but I am now certain that there is a growing awareness of the dangers of the original bills.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—I want to pick up on a couple of things that Senator Faulkner has just said because, in effect, I do not think that they are correct. It has been said that, according to the wishes of the United Nations Security Council, proscription is at the heart of this matter. First of all, let me make it clear that Security Council resolution 1373 does not call for proscription of organisations; it calls for suppression of their finances. These are very different things. If proscription of organisations is involved in that resolution, let us see it; it has not happened. Yet here we are dealing with proscribing organisations in Australia. 
Secondly, this request for the suppression of the financing of organisations has not come from the United Nations General Assembly; it has not dealt with it. This request has come from the Security Council. There are 15 members of the Security Council, five of whom are permanent. Those permanent members are China, the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Russia. The permanent members have a veto on any substantive resolution being considered by the council, but here the government is arguing that Australia should not have a veto on the same matter. So China can say, `We veto financial suppression of this organisation as requested by another member of the Security Council,' but the government is saying that Australia should not have that power. If the five big powers plus four of the other 10 members at any given time—nine of the 15—vote for a suppression of financing, the government says that Australia should rubber-stamp it.
The Greens view is that this parliament should consider that matter. If we were to allow the amendments the government requires, we would hand across to the Attorney-General—that is, the executive of the day—the ability to consider whether it would follow the wish of the Security Council to suppress the finances of an organisation. This legislation is not saying that the executive in Australia must endorse what the UN Security Council says; it is leaving that decision to the executive in Australia. We submit that the parliament must have that power; it does not have to be—and should not be— directed by the UN Security Council, where countries like China and Russia have a veto and we do not. I go back to what I was saying at the outset: the Greens oppose proscription of organisations in Australia.
There are very strong powers in this country to track down criminals and people plotting criminal activity including terrorism and to apprehend them and to incarcerate them. But at the heart of this legislation is a move to proscribe organisations in Australia, to ban them. It again needs to be brought to the table that when given the opportunity to do just that through a referendum the Australian people said no. This was on the one great occasion where there was an opportunity for people to ban an organisation in Australia, the Communist Party. Then it was seen as traitorous, as violent, as supporting Stalin—with everything that went along with that—and as supporting the wrong side in the Korean War, in which Australian personnel were fighting and in which many lost their lives. The Australian people did not say no because they supported the Communist Party—they did not, in the main. They said no because they supported the freedoms and the transparent and open democracy that we have here in this country. They overrode the politicians, both the Menzies government and the Labor Party of the day, who had voted for that proscription, that banning of the Communist Party. The Australian people said no. I must accord due praise to the late Dr Evatt, who by the time it came to the referendum led the argument against the proscribing of the Communist Party. In this legislation we have the politicians overruling the ability of the people to make such a determination. There is no other historical guide for us but that the Australian people do not accept proscription of organisations because it runs counter to a free and open democracy.
Let us remember the other argument that when you ban organisations you send them underground; you do not eliminate them. Anybody who studies history knows that. What is more, you send underground the more clever and, if they are keen on violence, the more dangerous elements of an organisation and make them more difficult to track. This legislation should be aimed at individuals who are planning or who carry out terrorism—murder, destruction, bloodshed. Banning organisations of itself will not do that. In fact, it may make it much harder to track down such individuals.
Let us not be misled by the idea that the United Nations is an arbiter here. In this matter the United Nations is sidelined effectively by the Security Council, which is a club of five powerful countries with the ability to veto the listing of any organisation for financial suppression. Should Australia not have that power? If this were a resolution and a matter that went through the General Assembly of the United Nations, we Greens might think a bit differently about it. There are at least the makings there of a global democratic input in terms of `one nation, one vote', but the Security Council is not democratic and it is not global. If the five countries on that council have a right to veto, so should this country. And the proper place for a veto is in this parliament. It is not with the executive. 
We support Labor's amendments here because they make a component of this legislation less bad, but we should not be having proscription at all. It is not with the Australian sentiment and it should never be left in the hands of the executive. That just compounds a wrong move being made, I suggest, by this parliament if it were to agree to it at the behest of this government. This government brought in draconian legislation. We are trying to fix it in bits and pieces, and I submit we cannot successfully do that. The legislation should be thrown out. At the heart of our concerns about this legislation is the ability of the Attorney-General, that is the executive—and remember the Attorney-General can delegate this power to any other minister; that is here in the bill—to proscribe organisations in this country. That is very dangerous and counter to the concept of a functioning democracy. We should be removing at least that component of this dangerous legislation.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—It is an important principle in this debate to consider whether we can pick and choose what elements of our international obligations we accept and what elements we do not accept. When we look at this issue in relation to the United Nations Security Council, let us go back to UN Security Council resolution 1373. It states:
2. Decides also that all States shall:
...	...	...
(e) Ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice and ensure that, in addition to any other measures against them, such terrorist acts are established as serious criminal offences in domestic laws and regulations and that the punishment duly reflects the seriousness of such terrorist acts ...
That is part of United Nations Security Council resolution 1373. That is the international community placing obligations on all its member states, of which Australia is one. In the view of the Labor Party, we take such obligations seriously. We always have taken our international obligations seriously—in fact, the Labor Party played a role in the founding of the United Nations—because we have always seen that the community of nations is the best hope for peace in the world. Labor has also always accepted that this entails not merely passive support but active participation in combating threats to international peace and security. In this case we have a responsibility both to protect Australian citizens and to ensure that Australia is not used in any way for illegal attacks on other countries. They are our obligations. 
We have obligations, of course, to those who live in this country and we have obligations to the international community in relation to the international threats that terrorism brings. The United Nations was formed at a time when the world had just been through the Second World War, a cataclysm greater than the crisis we now face. Think of the principle on which the United Nations is based: that member states resolve their differences peacefully and come to one another's aid if attacked. International terrorism is a relatively new threat to the international community, and the United Nations Security Council has called on its member states to act to eliminate that threat. The Labor Party has always taken a view that we should do what we can as a nation to support UN peacekeeping forces. Australia has a proud record in relation to our support for UN peacekeeping operations. As far as the Labor Party are concerned, we are not ashamed to say that we support proper participation in combating this new and real threat that we as a nation face and the international community faces. 
It is illogical to suggest that the UN Security Council can decide on collective military action against an aggressor but cannot determine whether an organisation is or is not a terrorist organisation. This legislation, if it is amended, will allow the government to act swiftly against organisations identified by the United Nations as terrorist organisations but to act only in relation to those organisations, with no executive proscription regime. In relation to those organisations identified by the United Nations Security Council, it will allow the safeguard of parliamentary approval in each instance. If this legislation is amended, we will give the Australian government all the powers it requires to fulfil our obligations under United Nations resolutions on combating terrorism. That does not mean that the provisions of the original bill in any sense are acceptable to the Labor Party.
The Attorney-General, in introducing the original bills, described them as containing `extraordinary new powers'. Those are the Attorney-General's words, and those words are certainly right. Has the government demonstrated that there is a level of threat that justifies such extraordinary new powers? Could a level of threat ever justify an executive proscription regime? You have to look at the role conservative governments have played in relation to proscription regimes: conservative governments have a track record of using proscription powers for political purposes.
One of the issues in relation to proscription powers is that they will never be a flexible response to terrorist organisations. Terrorist organisations, as we all know, are very difficult to pin down and identify. Terrorist organisations in the modern world do change their form and do change their names. One of the great weaknesses of any executive proscription regime is that you will never have an up-to-date list. It would not be possible to achieve that; no-one could. That is one of the many reasons that a bipartisan parliamentary committee rejected such a regime. We in the Labor Party say, and have said consistently: keep the focus on the terrorists and on the acts of terrorism; come up with a proposal that targets the terrorists. We have always said that the best way to define `terrorist' and `terrorist organisation' is just with the usual dictionary definitions—what everyone understands to be the case. Those who engage in such abominable activity are the people who should be targeted in our laws in this country. That is why the Labor Party is so strongly proposing these amendments to this bill.
In saying that we want to keep the focus on the terrorists and on the terrorist organisations, we also say that that is achievable and that you can define a terrorist organisation. Instead of accepting the government's executive proscription regime, this parliament is now setting about the task of itself defining `terrorist organisation' so that involvement in the work or activities of a terrorist organisation becomes a question of fact. If you do that, you take the politics out; if you do that, involvement in terrorist activity is determined by the courts. That is a far superior way to deal with the real problem of terrorism and the real issues of security that we face with the threat of international terrorism.
I think it is fair to say that, of all the issues that are contained within this package of bills, the issue of a proscription regime has caused more concern than any other. I believe that what the Labor Party proposes in its alternative to an executive proscription regime—and to all the weaknesses that such a regime contains—has great strength in putting together legal mechanisms that target the terrorists, that target those who intend to hurt and kill for political leverage. That is what this should be about. As I said last night, let us not have any truck with legislation that tries to criminalise what people think; let us go after the real terrorists, the perpetrators of terrorist activity. That is why I so strongly commend Labor's approach to this chamber.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I will be short, because I know we want to be out of here fairly smartly. I must say that I have great admiration for the people from Senate transport who get us here of a morning and who send us home of a night: Michael Kenning and Ian Miller, whom you would know, Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot. They are always pleasant when they send the cars to get us. 
What I want to say about this proscription issue is this: basic to our being, if you like, as citizens is the right to free association. That comes out in a lot of ways. Organisations, in a sense, are not the problem; it is the people in the organisation. I think Senator Faulkner pointed this out quite lucidly and so did Senator Brown. It is the people that we have got to get at. The other problem with proscribing anything is this: once you proscribe one organisation it becomes a precedent for proscribing the next organisation. There is that great statement about the Nazis: 
First they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for the communists and I did not speak out because I was not a communist. 
Then they came for the Trade Unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. 
Then they came for the Catholics and I did not speak out because I was not a Catholic. 
Then they came for me and by then there was no one left to speak out for me. 
The problem is that, once you proscribe any organisation, the community gets used to it. I have before me the Telecommunications Interception Act 1979. When I first arrived in this parliament that was quite a thin act. It allowed ASIO to tap phones. That ability was then extended to the Australian Federal Police, an organisation for which, as I have said over the last few days, I have a lot of admiration, particularly in respect of drugs. The act has expanded ever since.
What happens with legislation is that it creeps. You cannot look at legislation simply in terms of what is happening now; you have to look at what might happen later on. Once you proscribe one organisation, people say, `That's how things are done; that's how our community is conducted; that's how the affairs of a society go forward.' What was put in as an exception originally becomes a precedent for more and more power to be given to the executive, and that is a real problem. I wanted to take the opportunity to put on record my agreement with everybody else—the proscription regime is a regime that should be rejected. Senator Faulkner has stated that on behalf of the Australian Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—The matter at the heart of this is the proscription of organisations, the like of which we have not seen in Australia before. I have pointed repeatedly to the rejection of the proscription of the Communist Party back in 1951 as an indication of how Australians thought on that occasion after a very informed debate. We see this potential for proscription of organisations as a real matter for concern. The United Nations Security Council have not requested it; they have requested financial crippling of organisations. This potential starts to change the nature of our democracy to a defensive democracy moving towards a proscription of not only organisations but also a whole brace of democratic freedoms which are important to our country. 
We see it as such an important matter that we believe the people should have a say in it—if it is going to go ahead. If we are going to fundamentally change the right of organisations to exist in our society and allow the government of the day to not only proscribe organisations but also nominate the agent for indicating which organisations should be proscribed to be the Security Council—not the General Assembly—then, effectively, organisations which none of the five permanent members of the Security Council have vetoed can be vetoed at the behest of some future Security Council directive to the Australian government or parliament.
We are involved in an extremely fraught process here. I reiterate that terrorism has to be tackled and criminals have to be tackled and brought to book at worst and prevented at best, and we have very strong legislation to do that in our country. But proscribing of organisations is not going to help that; it is actually going to help defeat the purpose of tracking down terrorists because they will go underground.
 I ask the government: with our democracy right into the future at stake and having had the people of Australia reject proscription of organisations on the one occasion on which they have been able to, will the government put this matter to a referendum? Does it have the assuredness to go back to the people of Australia 51 years after they rejected proscription of the Communist Party and say, `Give us the authority to ban any organisation that we believe is a terrorist organisation'? In the lead-up to such a referendum, we will again get an informed debate. Will the government put its trust in the people of Australia to endorse what is happening here? 
If you put this to a referendum the Greens will support you. Let us have a democratic judgment on this matter. The functioning of this country as a democracy in an age where terrorism has reared its ugly head is at stake. Will you put your trust in the people? Do you have trust in your own argument? Do you really believe—are you confident—that the people of Australia will support you in taking the power to yourself without reference to the parliament, as you would have it, to ban organisations? Do you really believe that they are going to risk allowing the executive of this government or any future government to ban organisations under the tenets of this law, which is wide open to banning organisations which have a political difference with the government? That is the question: will the government consider a referendum on this matter?",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—I will deal with the last point first. The government does not think a referendum is appropriate in this matter. The government has been elected to look after the interests of Australia, and this is clearly a matter which is in the interests of Australia. There is a security threat, which everyone knows has arisen as a result of events last year, and we are required to act quickly. A referendum is not the way to deal with this matter, and the package of legislation that we have here is an appropriate response to meet the threats which have been posed to Australia.
I will touch on another point that Senator Brown raised earlier. He mentioned what is in fact the third limb of the government's proposal—that is, you could have a listing of an organisation which is triggered by a decision of the Security Council of the United Nations. He complained that Australia would not have a veto in that situation and that really the Security Council was a smaller section of the United Nations and did not provide for that wider process. What Senator Brown misses is that, in the government's proposal, even though the Security Council might make a decision in relation to an organisation, subsection 3(c) still requires the minister to be satisfied that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act. It is listed quite squarely there. Those criteria have to be met as well. If that is not enough, at the end of the day you have a disallowance by the parliament. So you do have a veto, in effect, which can be exercised by Australia via the parliamentary process. What Senator Brown is saying is that in this process there is no chance for Australia to say no. Well, there is, and it is contained in the third limb in subparagraph (c) of our proposal under the new definition of `terrorist organisation'.
In relation to the opposition, a point was made—and I think I understood it correctly—that, if there was not a disallowance of a regulation, a court would not be inclined to judicially review the actions of the minister. It is certainly the government's view that judicial review remains open regardless of whether any action has been taken by the parliament. In fact, we say that in our proposal you have two tiers of protection. You have the protection of the parliament and the protection of a judicial review if that is sought, and it can be sought. So we say that, whilst these are extraordinary powers, there are strong protections in this proposal.
Senator Brown also talked yesterday—and it is relevant to this debate in relation to the opposition's proposals—about the process of the Security Council. I undertook to get back to him with further information. I am advised that the process for listing persons and entities in relation to the United Nations Security Council asset freezing list under the relevant Security Council resolution is as follows. Any country can nominate a person or entity for listing. Any other country can object. Disagreements are then resolved by negotiations between countries. As I said yesterday, in practice this means that, without broad international consensus, a particular listing will not go forward. The list of entities and/or persons that has been produced by the Security Council to date were identified by the Security Council committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 of 1999 concerning Afghanistan. It was based on information provided by member states as falling under one of the categories in paragraph 4(b) of resolution 1267 and paragraph 8(c) of resolution 133 of 2000. This list will continue to be revised by the committee with information from member states as necessary. The Afghanistan sanctions committee requested that, pursuant to paragraph 9 of resolution 1267, all member states provide such information to the committee. The very nature of the United Nations Security Council means detailed procedural rules have not been laid down. These are matters for international dialogue and negotiation. 
I would not wish emphasis on the United Nations Security Council procedure to divert attention away from the thoroughness of the government's proposed approach. The government does not propose to simply rely on a United Nations listing, and the government's proposed amendments simply do not allow for unquestioned reliance on a Security Council list either in law or as a matter of practice. The identification of a Security Council listing is merely the first step in a thorough process. Notwithstanding that an organisation is on a Security Council list, a listing could be made under a regulation as part of the government's proposed approach only if there was independent evidence that the organisation was engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act—and I have covered that previously. That is, under the government's proposed approach, the Attorney-General would have to be satisfied on hard evidence of this terrorist connection before the Attorney-General could propose a listing. Listing by the Commonwealth under the terrorist organisations provisions is currently discretionary, because outside the asset freeze context we are not obliged to list. That is because the current obligation under Security Council resolution 1373 applies only to asset freezing.
Action outside the asset freezing context is a matter of international cooperation. A listing under the government's proposed approach—that is, listing by regulation—will therefore have to be based on hard evidence and independent judgment by the Attorney-General. The regulation will be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and will be disallowable in each house of parliament. Furthermore, it will not take effect until the disallowance period—that is, 15 days after tabling in each house—has concluded. Any aggrieved party could make representations direct to the Attorney-General or through a member of parliament. Parliamentary processes, including consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, would apply. As I said earlier, judicial review would still be available. Relevant grounds of review include that there was no evidence to justify the making of the regulation or that there was a failure to consider a relevant matter in making the regulation. Perhaps most importantly, a court could invalidate a regulation that was not made in accordance with the requirement for prior evidence laid down in the bill. Finally, a regulation will automatically cease to have effect after two years.
This thorough process means that the merits of a particular listing will be thoroughly scrutinised by the executive and legislature and be fully open to challenge by courts in appropriate circumstances. Let me emphasise again that hard evidence of organisations' terrorist related activities will have to be in the hands of Australian authorities and there is no power simply to rely on a United Nations Security Council listing. All in all, what the government proposes involves the absolute highest levels of rigour, transparency and scrutiny. I note that this rigour, transparency and scrutiny also apply to subparagraph (b) of the government's proposed definition of `terrorist organisation' relating to listing based on evidence before the Attorney-General—and this is what the opposition seeks to take away.
What is not being said is that, although extraordinary powers are being dealt with here, there are extraordinary safeguards, safeguards by virtue of disallowance in the parliament, with regulations not taking effect until after the period for disallowance has expired—not a normal procedure taken— and, furthermore, the regulations will expire after two years. Finally, there is the prospect of judicial review. So the government has put in place, after very careful consideration, the appropriate powers needed to deal with terrorist organisations but the appropriate balance in assuring that that power is not abused. That assurance involves the exercise of the power of parliament and review by the courts.  
I reject what Senator Brown has said in that this is simply a procedure which relies, in one limb, on the United Nations. I reject the notion that the opposition amendments are needed. We say that there are appropriate checks and balances here and that the opposition amendments (4) and (5) are not needed. They are not needed to assure the Australian public that the power will not be abused because we have in place adequate safeguards. I think the opposition needs to look carefully at those safeguards. However, in order to secure passage of this important legislation, the government will not oppose these amendments, albeit with some reluctance.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-06-26,"—Senator Ellison has cogently argued that what the government now proposes is reasonable. This raises questions as to why these things were not originally put forward, why the bill arrived in its current form and why the government had not put these safeguards and improvements in the initial bill. I want to raise two matters here. Firstly, and I know that this has been canvassed a bit, the third leg which allows for parliamentary disallowance of a proscription is something that I have never supported. I find it very difficult to support that; I find it more difficult to support that than oppose the Attorney-General having the power to proscribe. My reasoning is: how can you have a full and frank debate on a proscription when much of the material on which you have based the proscription will have come from security agencies? I do not think there is any question that a government has to rely very strongly on advice from the whole range of security agencies before it can proscribe an organisation. How it can then lead that evidence in this chamber I do not know. There are two ways of doing it. One is to go off and brief the opposition and the minor parties—which leaves them totally inhibited as to what they can say in this chamber—or in our excitement we use some of that material and then we have breached faith. So to have a disallowance of a proscription is a very difficult thing to do when most of the information that a government properly relies on to proscribe an organisation as a terrorist organisation may well come from secure information that would not normally be put in the public domain. It makes that debate extremely contorted and extremely difficult. I ask the minister to respond to that.
The second thing I would like to ask the minister—and I do not think it has been raised at length here—is whether the government is satisfied that the proscription regime, modified as it proposes, is in fact constitutional. Did the government get advice as to whether that element of its security legislation is constitutional? Given the previous decisions of 51 years ago and other matters coming out of the High Court since, I would have thought that there was some doubt that there is sufficient coverage in the Constitution for proscription and that there are other countervailing interpretations of the Constitution, coming out of the Theophanous and other cases, that may make this unconstitutional. I do not allege or assert that this is unconstitutional; I say that doubts have been raised. I am not asking for the government to convince me as to whether it is constitutional or not; I am asking whether the government sought advice. Of course, if it had sought advice, clearly I would follow that up by asking whether that advice could be made available to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—Why does that last comment not surprise me? The answer is yes and yes; the government did seek advice on the proscription proposal and the advice was that it was constitutional. That brings me to the third part of Senator Ray's request, which was: can he see a copy of the advice, which we have dealt with many times before. I will take that on notice and take it up with the Attorney. Generally, of course, the government does not reveal advice given to it, although there have been occasions when that has been done. We have gone through this many times in the Senate. I will take that on notice and see what the Attorney-General says about it. 
In relation to the debate on disallowance, Senator Ray was indicating that that was an unsatisfactory safeguard because it would go to matters of security and particular organisations and there would be evidence, perhaps operational aspects, which would be touched on in the debate. Certainly my view is that we have had occasions where we have debated sensitive matters. In fact, it is not rare that we have debated sensitive matters; it is not common, though. There are measures that can be employed to deal with security matters. Just the other day, we had a three-hour briefing given to the opposition— Senator Faulkner was there—in relation to matters of intelligence received about boats coming to Australia. The Leader of the Opposition gets briefed on matters which pertain to security.
I really do not see that the disallowance provision is one which would be unsatisfactory in these circumstances. I believe that we do have the means to deal with it and to deal with sensitive information, as we have done on other occasions. We do it with parliamentary committees quite frequently. Some committees in particular deal with it quite often. So I think that is still an essential safeguard. I take a different view from Senator Ray in that I think it can be debated. Of course, there are other aspects too: there is a judicial review and the regulation expires after two years. And there are normal parliamentary processes in relation to how the power is exercised. Questions can be asked in the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, through the estimates process and through this very chamber as to how the exercise of power is carried out. We get that often. I really do not see that the parliamentary scrutiny, with all its attendant possibilities, is an unsatisfactory check in this case. I will take the other aspect about the advice on notice and, hopefully, get back to the Senate shortly.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I think the minister misses the whole point about the debate on the disallowance. No-one has argued that a government cannot brief an opposition on sensitive matters. Of course it does; in fact, it is a statutory requirement within the ASIO Act. On other occasions and in other areas, be it in defence, foreign affairs or migration, quite often a government will brief an opposition. But that then limits the rights of an opposition. Every now and then, on certain topics, we refuse to be briefed because we do not want to be particularly silenced on a matter. It puts an opposition—and this extends to minor parties—in an extremely difficult position as to how it then goes on and debates the matter. We, for instance, could have been briefed on the proscription of an organisation, could have found that briefing not to be compelling and moved to disallow, but found it very difficult to bring to bear arguments because we did not want to breach the conditions of confidence that were properly put on us from the briefing we had received. It puts us, as an opposition, in an extremely difficult position. 
I also think it puts the government in a difficult position. It may look inept, it may look second-rate, because it cannot put all the evidence against an organisation on the table here to convince the Senate as a whole. People then think the government has used flippant or inadequate reasons for proscribing an organisation when, in actual fact, it may have been operating under extremely detailed intelligence material which it can never put before the Senate because it might reveal a source, methodology or whatever else. So it is extremely difficult to have a disallowance debate, no matter what the briefing. In fact the briefings—private briefings, security briefings—will make that even more difficult.
On the other point of whether the government can make the legal advice available, Senator Ellison says that on some occasions it has and on some occasions it has not. Why don't we define those right now? When the legal briefing is totally in accord with the government's thinking, there is usually an enthusiasm to make it public. When there is some doubt or opposition within that legal briefing, it is not made available. We understand that. Governments behave exactly the same in this context whether they are coalition governments or Labor governments, so let us not get on our high horse about this. But I do put this point to the minister for consideration: the one area where I think it is incumbent upon a government to make advice available is on constitutionality. When the government receives advice on constitutionality, I believe it has an obligation to make that advice available to the parliament before it votes on such bills where there is some doubt involved. Without going to that legal advice directly, my understanding is that the difference between 2002 and 1951 is the enormous advances in administrative law and appeals et cetera, that this has in fact changed very dramatically the way the High Court may look at these things. I do not know if the minister can comment on that aspect. ",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—I will just touch on this point. I do not think the briefing does make it more difficult for an opposition to then move a motion for disallowance, because just recently we had a briefing and the opposition took a different view from the government.
—Not on security matters.
—We say that illegal entrants are a matter of border protection, which I think does have a security content. Border security always has a—
—How do you know we did not have any difficulty? Because we did!
—Can I also say this. Many times the government do rely on information which we cannot divulge, and it is difficult. But that does not mean to say that we do not do it. The fact is that in my portfolio—and I know I deal with it perhaps more than other ministers—you have operational information which you cannot divulge, and for a certain reason you take a course of action. People query you and they criticise you, and you cannot come out and give the detail. That of course is difficult but it is part of the job. Similarly, I think that with the opposition in a disallowance situation, you could say that we have had a briefing and we will not comment on it and we will just move to disallow—and it is as simple as that. It happens quite often in a range of areas where details cannot be released for privacy concerns and for all sorts of other reasons. I think that it just does impose the difficulty that is suggested. 
In regard to the question of the change between 1951 and 2002, of course Australia is a very different country today. There is a very different situation in relation to administrative law and freedom of information which was not even dreamed of in 1951. We have different ways of dealing with things. Senator Ray does say that governments of all persuasions have a reluctance in divulging legal advice. In some cases they do and in some cases they do not.
—Do not verbal me unless there has been a decision.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—I would like to point out that the government has listed, through the back door, proscription of the PKK, the Kurdish freedom fighters organisation. It completely disbanded three years ago and it has been replaced by a non-violent organisation committed to democratic reform in Turkey. I wish them luck because they are up against a pretty cruel regime there, democratic or otherwise. But it shows the absurdity of leaving in the hands of the executive the ability to proscribe organisations when one of the first things it does is proscribe an organisation that no longer exists and, moreover, has been replaced by one which is committed to peaceful and democratic reform. The minister said earlier that countries can nominate organisations for proscription to the United Nations Security Council.

This amendment inserts new terrorist organisations offences covering directing, membership, recruitment, training, funding and the provision of support or resources. With the exception of the membership offence, the offences carry different fault elements and graduated penalties. A maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment will apply where the defendant knows that the organisation is a terrorist organisation. If the defendant is reckless as to whether the organisation is a terrorist organisation, a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment will apply. Where the defendant is negligent with respect to the fact that the organisation is a terrorist organisation, the offence will attract a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The membership offence will apply only where the defendant knows that the organisation to which he or she belongs is a terrorist organisation. It is appropriate for an offence which applies to membership alone to require the prosecution to prove a high degree of fault. It will be a defence to the membership offence if the person proves that he or she took all reasonable steps to cease to be a member of the organisation as soon as practicable after the person first knew that the organisation was a terrorist organisation. It will be a defence to the offence of receiving funds from a terrorist organisation if the person proves that he or she received the funds. 
This is an extension of what we have been debating in relation to terrorist organisations. The graduated penalties and the tiers of fault are aspects which the government has proposed in other provisions of this bill and they follow much the same format. These are important provisions in relation to the fight against terrorism and the bill covers those aspects which we believe are very important. As I said, the new offences cover directing, membership, recruitment, training, funding and the provision of support or resources.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

Again, we come to this terrible word `reckless'. Last night I put the argument against this word being allowed. It gives wide-ranging ability to the authorities to impugn people with terrorism who are innocent of being part of terrorist activities. The word `reckless' can be used very widely indeed. It is not conscribed or tied down by the government. It will be wide open to interpretation and will inevitably catch people who have been in an organisation, making donations to an organisation or going to fundraisers for an organisation, and the authorities will say, `You should have known that that organisation was involved in what we call terrorism.' People who sign lists or petitions could be indicted under this reckless provision. It is a reckless provision itself and should be removed, unless the government cares to do the hard spade work in defining exactly the circumstances in which a person would be reckless. The government does not want to do that. This is a catch-all phrase. It is going to catch people who, after the event, find out that they have inadvertently been to a fundraiser, a course, a film night or a training seminar on the political aspirations of a group or part of a group which turns out to be involved in a violent dimension. We are asking the committee to support the amendment to remove this particularly dangerous component of the bill.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

As Senator Brown said, this is a debate which, in effect, we had last evening in relation to other offences. The debate is nevertheless a very important one. The opposition has accepted that the situation we now face with the government amendments is that the defences are better structure in certain respects and, very importantly, have been reworked so that elements of intent and knowledge are included. We remain very concerned that the government, in these offences, is still proposing to include the fault element of negligence. I pointed out last night the impact of the government's proposed hierarchy for offences. Knowledge of a terrorist connection to activities would lead to a penalty of up to 25 years imprisonment. Recklessness, which has just been canvassed by Senator Brown, is having the foresight of a possible connection but acting irrespective of that foresight. That would expose someone to a penalty of up to 15 years imprisonment. Senator Brown expressed concerns about this being undefined. As I understand it, recklessness is defined in the Criminal Code. The minister needs to make that clear to the committee. 
As I indicated last night, the situation with knowledge and recklessness is very different to the situation in relation to negligence because both knowledge and recklessness do require a mental state. The test of a person's knowledge or recklessness is, of course, subjective, and we say—as we have said consistently with the approach that we have taken more broadly in relation to this legislation—when you are dealing with offences like terrorism, it is all about the intention or the state of mind of the person who would commit such an offence. That is the significant difference between knowledge and recklessness on the one hand and negligence on the other. That is why the opposition is consistent with the approach that it has taken throughout the debate on these bills in saying that the negligence tier should be removed. We oppose the introduction of terrorist offences that are based on negligence because, in law, proving negligence would not require proof of any particular mental state.
The test for negligence is an objective test so it would be based on an assessment of what a reasonable person may do in the circumstances. It is not based on what the person may have intended. We have said it consistently but I repeat it, for the benefit of the committee, because I think the argument is very strong indeed, and I commend the argument to the Senate. A person cannot negligently commit a terrorist act, in the view of the opposition. We believe, with the tier of negligence remaining, that the government introduces an unacceptable threshold for terrorist acts. You have got to think about this. Surely, intention is crucial here. It is not possible to negligently commit a terrorist act, and this committee should not support the government's amended proposal. We should remove the fault element of negligence. In taking this approach, we are consistent with our arguments, last night, in relation to other offences.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—Senator Brown accused the government of not spelling out what the term `reckless' entailed. I would remind Senator Brown that, in the explanatory memorandum to these amendments, at page 11, there is an outline of what is needed to prove that a defendant was reckless. It states:
To prove that the defendant was reckless as to whether the organisation was a terrorist organisation, the prosecution would have to demonstrate that the defendant was aware of a substantial risk that the organisation was a terrorist organisation and that, having regard to the circumstances known to the defendant, it was unjustifiable to take that risk.
That sets out very squarely what is involved here and, indeed, in the Criminal Code there is a definition of `recklessness'. But in the explanatory memorandum to these amendments, the government has spelt out what `reckless' entails. It also goes on, in the same explanatory memorandum, to say:
A defendant would be negligent with respect to the fact that the organisation was a terrorist organisation if his or her conduct involved: (1) such a great falling short of the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the circumstances; and (2) such a high risk that the organisation was a terrorist organisation that the conduct merits criminal punishment for the offence. Negligence is a standard fault element recognised in the Criminal Code and is a fault element in numerous offences in Australian criminal law, including manslaughter.
That is provided for in the explanatory memorandum for these amendments. The government could not be clearer in spelling out what is entailed in relation to recklessness and negligence. But, just so that it is absolutely clear, I will refer to the definition of recklessness in the Criminal Code, which I referred to yesterday with respect to negligence. I also touched on recklessness but I do not think I gave the definition to the Senate. Section 5.4 of the Criminal Code states:
5.4  Recklessness
(1)	A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if:
	(a)	he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and 
	(b)	having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.
(2)	A person is reckless with respect to a result if:
	(a)	he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and
	(b)	having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.
(3)	The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact.
(4)	If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element.
At all stages the onus is with the prosecution; it has to prove recklessness beyond a reasonable doubt; it has to prove negligence beyond a reasonable doubt.
In relation to the Greens amendments, we believe that if it can be made out in the way that I have outlined that someone was reckless in their knowledge of a terrorist organisation, that they trained with that organisation, funded it or directed the activities of that organisation they should not escape liability. Such is the degree of culpability in that case that, with the high standard of proof and definition of fault, if the prosecution is able to make out a case with those strict requirements the government believes that the person concerned should not escape liability for their actions. Senator Brown said the term `reckless' can be used very widely indeed. The government disagrees; it believes it is a strict definition and, when accompanied by the fact that it has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, it applies in an even narrower sense.
Needless to say, the government will be opposing Greens amendments (12), (13), (16), (17) and (19). In relation to opposition amendments (6), (8), (9), (10) and (11), the opposition does not object to recklessness but does object to the fault element of negligence. I have already touched on that in previous debate, but I remind the chamber that a person's conduct will be criminally negligent only where it departs so substantially from standards of reasonable behaviour as to warrant the imposition of criminal sanctions. Removing the offences involving negligence will restrict the circumstances in which persons who fund, direct, train with or provide support to terrorist organisations can be prosecuted.
Again, we say that the term `negligence', having regard to the fact that it has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and that it has to fall within the strict definition of the Criminal Code and as outlined in the explanatory memorandum which I have referred to, does deserve sanction and that a person who is guilty of that behaviour—guilt having been proved beyond a reasonable doubt—should not escape liability for their actions.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2002-06-26,"—Can I comment on the last remarks of the minister. At the moment the government, together with a lot of other people, are making very trenchant criticisms of the legal profession. Mr Antony Sachs is in the chamber and he would know what I am talking about—a man who has recently had Oscar born to him.
—A fine adviser.
—Yes, a fine adviser. The government is saying, `Look, just because there is a claim of negligence, you should not have people rushing off to sue.' As I understand it, the government has said that just because you might suffer an injury due to negligence should not entitle you necessarily to go ahead and sue. Being negligent is something we sometimes are as human beings. None of us are perfect, none of us are the perfect being, and we are going to be negligent and careless. That is how people are. Do we punish someone because they have been careless or because they have been negligent? What we mean by negligent is that you have done something that a reasonable person would not have done or that you have failed to do what a reasonable person would have done. Just because you have done that does not mean that you should be punished. Otherwise, how are we going to go around in life? We are all careless at times. We go into periods of carelessness. That should not be punished. I think that is borne out by the government's own approach to the insurance crisis and to civil action. 
On the other hand, if the carelessness is such that, for example, a person fires a gun towards a beach where there is a great number of people and says, `I did not intend to do that and I did not even intend to hit them,' that is something done in a gross manner. If somebody drove a car at 100 kilometres per hour down Bourke Street through the mall— I am talking about Melbourne—
—As you would.
—As I would, and no doubt there are other cities in Australia where you could imagine that happening. Having imagined it, one would see just how gross it is that a person with little ability as a driver drives at a high speed down a heavily built-up street. People would then say, `That is so gross, that is so beyond what is fair, that it ought to be punished.' But that goes a long way beyond the concept of negligence. Minister, the problem with this is the three tiers. You said that you can be punished for manslaughter if you are negligent, and that is true, but that is gross negligence, that is reckless negligence, that you are talking about. You do not get punished for manslaughter for simply being negligent—perhaps for driving at 70 kilometres per hour when you should be driving at 60 kilometres per hour. That is a negligent act, as is brushing past somebody and knocking them over in your haste to get to somewhere to catch a train or to get somewhere to meet somebody.
—Or for a division.
—Or if you are trying to get to a division.
—It is all right if you knock someone over going the other way.
—That is all right, but it is getting to the point now where I am finding it so hard to get to divisions that I will have to give the game away, Senator Faulkner.
—I reckon that you have at least another day in you, Senator Cooney.
—I have another day in me, yes. In any event, I do not want to go into this for too long, because I know that we are trying to save time. Nevertheless, I think it is very important to make the point that there are people who say, `Look, I don't really intend to hit somebody when I fire this gun, but I'm going to fire it and I understand that there are people there.' A reasonable person would say that that is not just the ordinary sort of negligence; that is so gross that there ought to be some punishment for it. I am trying to think of an analogy that might strike home with Senator Brown. I suppose he would say that some of the ways the forests in his state and elsewhere have been treated goes a bit beyond ordinary negligence and starts to get to the gross stage.
—It is not even reckless.
—Yes, it is not even reckless. So, Minister, given the government's attitude and approach to insurance claims—actions by people suing doctors and what have you—I think the government itself draws a big distinction between `negligence' and `gross negligence of a reckless kind'.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—I will not have many more opportunities to enjoy a good debate with Senator Cooney in this chamber. As always, he has put his argument very well and has done so over many years on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, which has done a lot of very good work—excellent work, I might say—largely due to Senator Cooney's fine work on that committee. But I would say to Senator Cooney that, in this case, we are dealing with negligence that could be termed gross negligence; it goes beyond the civil standard of simple carelessness. When you look at the definition in the Criminal Code Act 1995, it says that a person is negligent if his or her conduct involves:
... such a great falling short of the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the circumstances.
So it is not just simple carelessness; it is not like driving a car without due care and attention. We would argue that the negligence here could be termed gross negligence. It is certainly not the same standard applied in civil law; what is more, the prosecution has to prove this negligence beyond a reasonable doubt. The government says that this negligence could form the basis of a conviction for manslaughter. We have seen how recklessness can found a conviction for murder; similarly, negligence of this standard can found a conviction for manslaughter. We want to make it very clear that the negligence the government is talking about here is not of the civil standard but of the much higher standard set out in the Criminal Code.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—I think the opposition's arguments against `negligence' are cogent, very logical and apply equally to the term `recklessness'. I have to remind the Committee of the Whole that we are not dealing here with a void in the law that deals with violent, nasty criminals. We have a second-to-none bank of law in this nation to deal with criminal activities. The whole of this legislation is redundant when you consider that bank of law—developed not just over 100 years but over hundreds of years. So this legislation is an overlay. Anyone who thinks that we need this legislation in order to catch terrorists is wrong. We have very strong laws to catch murderers, rapists and people who rampage and cause destruction.
But there is political motivation involved here, and I reiterate that it is dangerous— very dangerous indeed. I repeat the evidence of one eminent jurist before the committee looking into this matter. He had the experience of going to a fundraising dinner for the Tamils. That dinner was being held to raise funds to help children and youths who were maimed and disfigured in the civil war in Sri Lanka. Was it negligent or reckless to pay $20 to attend such a fundraiser if it is found later that, instead of going to the target for which the fundraising event was set up, the money was diverted into the military activities of that organisation? At what level does negligence or recklessness come in?
This is not an easy dividing line, as the government would have it—and it is dangerous. We have long-considered laws to deal with all these matters. We do not need the overlay of this legislation. It is political legislation which, in the face of those long-considered laws, is redundant. The problem here is that it has not been long considered. It is hasty and knee-jerk, and it has very big consequences. That is why we are opposed to it, and that is why we are promoting these amendments.

(15)	Government amendment (17). Omit Section 102.6.
(18)	Government amendment (17). Omit Section 102.7.
I point out to the committee that these amendments seek to remove two terrorist organisation offences proposed—that is, getting funds to or from a terrorist organisation and providing support to a terrorist organisation. On the face of it, the government's amendments might seem to be a good move but I have already referred to them when discussing our opposition to the banning process, which is supported in some measure by the ALP and the government, notwithstanding the withdrawal this morning of the government's earlier intention.
The refusal by the opposition to support our amendments to remove `recklessness' as a fault element, as we have just seen, makes these fundraising offences dangerous to many communities in Australia. I have just given an example of how that can be. The Greens amendments now seek to minimise the damage that could come from those government amendments. I ask committee members to consider whether people in Australia who support Kurdish independence—I spoke earlier about how that has gone from being violent to a pursuit of democracy through democratic processes—or Tamil independence will be charged with an offence of providing funding to the relevant organisations, the PKK or the LTTE.  
Some time in the future, will the OPM, the freedom for Papua organisation, or those fighting for freedom from the military occupation of Tibet by the Beijing regime be labelled and listed as terrorists and funding and supporting those organisations be outlawed? How long is it going to be before we see China list the people it labels as terrorists— who are nothing more than peaceful defenders of freedom and democracy? If China had its way it would list the Falun Gong. As I said last night, China offensively and obscenely labels the Dalai Lama as a criminal. Are we going to see a Security Council resolution coming through proscribing organisations which he may have some association with? The government claims that it needs to enact this legislation because of its obligations under the Security Council resolution 1373, but those obligations are covered by the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002, which we are going to deal with later, so they do not need to be dealt with here.
I am very concerned that through the myriad of fundraising processes that go on in our democracy and people's intentions to raise funds for the greater good, under this legislation they may be caught up and labelled as terrorists simply because the fundraising is claimed to have gone elsewhere. Hence, that is reason for moving these amendments.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I move opposition amendment (7) on sheet 2503:
(7)	Government amendment (17), omit subsection 102.3(1), substitute:
	(1)	A person commits an offence if:
	(a)	the person intentionally is a member of an organisation; and
	(b)	the organisation is a terrorist organisation because of paragraph (c) of the definition of terrorist organisation in this Division (whether or not the organisation is a terrorist organisation because of another paragraph of that definition also); and
	(c)	the person knows the organisation is a terrorist organisation.
Penalty:  Imprisonment for 10 years.
As the committee is aware, the Labor Party has objected to the government's creation of an offence of membership of a terrorist organisation, notwithstanding—and I acknowledge this—the attempts by the government to provide additional, albeit limited, safeguards to what was contained in the original legislation. The real issue, and the cause of great concern from the opposition's perspective, is that we do not want to go down the path of criminalising passive affiliation. The opposition does not support the harsh penalties proposed by this legislation being applied to a passive act of membership—that is, compare a passive act of membership to an act intended to further a terrorist act. It comes back to the same principle that the opposition has put forward throughout this debate: target the terrorists and focus on terrorist activities but do not criminalise passive membership, either formal or informal, of an organisation. One of the problems here is that the government does not define membership. It even proposes to include the vague concept of informal membership. I can only say that that heightens the opposition's concerns about this offence of membership.
There are two principles at play in relation to criminalising membership of a terrorist organisation. In our view, the first principle is that mere membership of an organisation without any active participation should not be criminalised. To do so is to criminalise a person's thoughts as opposed to a person's actions. The other principle is that Australia should play its role as a good international citizen in assisting other members of the international community to fight terrorism and international terrorist organisations. We have an in-principle objection to criminalising membership per se.
There is one case in which we certainly are willing to make an exception; one case and only one case. It goes back to this situation of membership of organisations declared to be terrorist organisations by the Security Council of the United Nations. As I have explained previously to this committee, we have taken the view that if the international community, speaking through the United Nations Security Council, declares an organisation to be a terrorist organisation, we will accept membership of that organisation as being a criminal offence. In all other cases, we believe that the appropriate threshold for an offence of membership is the demonstrated willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act. We have argued that these words should be included as an offence, maintaining the important distinction between active involvement in the commission of a terrorist act and passive membership of an organisation. Again, we must get this right. 
That principle would apply to organisations—that is, the demonstrated willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act. `Active involvement in terrorist activities' would apply to organisations found to be terrorist organisations either by Australian courts or by the United Nations Security Council. This, again, is a very different approach to the one the government proposes, but there are serious concerns about an offence of membership of a terrorist organisation. This committee needs to take account of those concerns. If we are serious about targeting the terrorists and focusing on terrorist activities, then we can fix the original draft of this bill. We can have a situation where those who are actively involved in terrorist activities do have their behaviour criminalised but where those who are passive members of organisations, without the intent or knowledge to be involved in terrorist activities, are not unwittingly caught up in this legislation.
It comes back to those fundamental principles that I have been speaking of as we have dealt with this legislation from the beginning of the committee stage of the debate. Again, it restores the focus to catching and dealing with the real terrorists, the people who know and intend to be involved in or give assistance to a terrorist organisation for the commission of a terrorist act. That is what it should be about. We need to deal with those people and deal with them appropriately, but we do not want to see the unintended consequences of people who do not have that knowledge or that intention being caught up due to their formal or informal membership of organisations. It is a fundamental principle, and we need to protect appropriate civil liberties and freedoms in relation to this issue. It reinforces all the weakness of an executive proscription regime— one which I now acknowledge the government has backed away from. This is another important amendment and an important principle, and I would urge this committee to strongly support the opposition's approach.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—I will support the opposition's approach now that the Greens amendment has been knocked down. I want to wrap up our argument by quoting another eminent jurist, Mr Julian Burnside QC from Liberty Victoria, on the proscribing of organisations. In his submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee he stated:
Although this is not part of the written submission, because of the shortness of time, can I make the observation that, leaving aside constitutional problems, proscribing organisations is a very different thing from proscribing acts. Generally speaking, acts are the object of criminal laws; organisations are not. Proscribing an organisation is tantamount to proscribing modes of thought— because what makes an organisation, generally speaking, is a community of ideas or beliefs. To proscribe an organisation where there is no act done by individual members of that organisation is, with respect, nothing more than an assault on freedom of thought. If, on the other hand, members of organisations do engage in acts which contravene the criminal law then the law is able to deal with them.
There is a subsidiary difficulty with the provisions relating to proscribing organisations, and that is the very wide definition of `membership'—
which is what we are dealing with at the moment—
which includes people who are informal members or who are trying to become members; and those people can not only cause the organisation to become a proscribed organisation but can also be caught up inadvertently in the conduct of other people who are, properly speaking, members of the organisation. The measure that allows anyone—a judge, the Attorney-General or anyone at all—to proscribe an organisation is profoundly dangerous and, we would say, profoundly undemocratic. It amounts to nothing more than restraining freedom of thought. 
That is why we oppose the government's proscription of organisations, and that is why we oppose this measure which imposes enormous penalties on people for being members or de facto members or for seeking membership of organisations. People can be caught up quite inadvertently, as Mr Burnside points out, and there are pretty gargantuan penalties to boot. It is quite dangerous, and it is unnecessary. We have the criminal law to deal with people who commit terrorist acts. The opposition amendment should be supported, but the measure as a whole should be thrown out.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—There are a number of things that I should say about this. In relation to membership, the bill has a definition of `member' and that is set out at division 102. It states:
member of an organisation includes:
(a) a person who is an informal member of the organisation; and
(b) a person who has taken steps to become a member of the organisation; and
(c) in the case of an organisation that is a body corporate—a director or an officer of the body corporate.
That quite clearly spells out what a member is. There was some query raised by the opposition that we had not defined `membership', but I think that definition is a very good starting point. In order to prove membership, the prosecution would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person had knowledge that the organisation was a terrorist organisation and intended to be a member. You cannot get it more squarely spelt out than that. We would say to the opposition and others: look carefully at the definition of `member'. We are not talking about passive membership; we are not including something which occurs independently of a person's will. We are saying that, if it can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that you intended to belong to a terrorist organisation and that you knew it was a terrorist organisation, you should not escape liability. We think that dispels squarely the concerns expressed by the opposition.
—Informed membership is in there, is it?
—It can only be informed membership. I say to Senator Faulkner: have a look at the definition I have just referred to, because it says `a person who has taken steps to become a member'. That is not someone who is sitting back doing nothing. Remember also what I have just said: the person has to have an intention to become a member and the person has to know that it is a terrorist organisation. Those elements have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. There is nothing passive about that.
The curious thing about the opposition's proposed amendment is that it comes in subparagraph (b)—that is, a person commits an offence by being a member only of a terrorist organisation as set out in subparagraph (c). Subparagraph (c) is the third limb of the definition of `terrorist organisation', which deals with the involvement of the Security Council of the United Nations. The opposition has missed subparagraph (a), which deals with a finding by a court. There are three limbs, and the second limb—the executive listing—has been eliminated. Subparagraph (a) is where a court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that an organisation is a terrorist organisation. We ask the opposition: what is the difference between subparagraph (a) and subparagraph (c)? In subparagraph (a), the court has found beyond a reasonable doubt that the organisation is a terrorist organisation. We would think that the requirement that an Australian court come to that conclusion would be an even better way to determine a terrorist organisation than some process which is triggered by a decision of the Security Council of the United Nations.
That suggests that our courts are not equipped to do their job and makes somewhat of a mockery of our judicial system. There is absolutely no reason not to include the other limb which still remains. That has not been explained by the opposition, and I think it is a fundamental flaw in their proposed amendment. The government opposes this amendment not only for the reasons I have mentioned but also because it opens up a loophole in relation to membership of a terrorist organisation. The amendment provides that a person commits an offence if they join a terrorist organisation which has been listed by the United Nations Security Council, so the opposition agrees with the government to that extent. But the government cannot go further and say, `We don't agree that it's an offence if an Australian court has found an organisation to be a terrorist organisation, notwithstanding that that finding is beyond a reasonable doubt.' It is obvious that there is a feeling that you should have an offence for membership of a terrorist organisation, and the government agrees that we should—very much so. 
We want to say that once a terrorist organisation has been established as such, after strict requirements have been met—and there are strict requirements proposed—any membership of that organisation should also be outlawed. You have to remember that, as Senator Cooney would say, you cannot strike without meaning to harm—I think that is one of his old favourites—that is, you cannot have your cake and eat it too. You cannot knowingly join a terrorist organisation and then say that in some way you are a passive player in the whole situation. Terrorist organisations can only exist because of membership, so the membership of the organisation also has to be the subject of liability. For those reasons, the government is opposed to this opposition amendment. I indicate that the government will be seeking to divide on the matter.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2002-06-26," Listening to the analysis of the minister, which was very cogent, probably brought out what the difficulty is on this side of the chamber. As the minister said, `You would not be a member of this organisation, if you knew what it was, unless you wanted to do something.' What the minister is really saying is, `Look, being a member of this organisation is evidence that you have done a bad act or you intend to do a bad act.' So the membership is evidence of intent. But, as written in this legislation, the membership alone is what is punishable. The membership is not being used as evidence to prove that a person who is a member is doing a bad act. It is not used in that way at all. It simply says, `You are a member, therefore you should be punished.' But that leaves out the step, `You are a member, therefore your intention must be to do something bad, therefore you have an intention to do a bad action.' That is not the process of thinking. The process of thinking is: you are a member, therefore you will be punished. That is a dangerous situation to be in.
What goes to the heart of it, I think, is that everybody agrees with Senators Greig, Brown and Faulkner: we want to punish criminality. We want to punish people who do the wrong thing, those who act in such a reckless way that they are doing the wrong thing. We, as reasonable people, want to feel comfortable that such people are being punished for doing something that is wrong. However, this legislation says, `Look, you're a member, therefore you should be punished.' We say why should that be the process? Why shouldn't we be able to join any organisation we want to? The joining itself should not be punished. Doing things once you have joined might be a different thing. Take the political parties in this chamber. We all know that some people join in a peripheral way and that others direct things and others finance them. All those acts have different qualities. We say that the person who just joins an organisation should not be treated in the same way as a person who organises some criminal act and so forth. I think there is a difference; there is a problem.
I will have drink of water. It has been brought to me by the people who look after us. I might take this opportunity to thank them for the way they look after us in this chamber: Frank Alles, Lorna Lane, Kathy Eliopoulos, Ron Kropp and John McPherson—I do not think he is here today, but I will mention him. So they are my thoughts, Minister, on the issue of membership.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I have enjoyed Senator Cooney's 40th valedictory speech and look forward to the 191st he makes tomorrow, as this committee stage debate wends its way forward. The minister has read the definition of `member' contained within the bill into the Hansard. Let me remind the committee of the first line of this definition: 
member of an organisation includes:
(a) a person who is an informal member of the organisation ... 
I have two questions for the minister: is `informal member' defined anywhere? Secondly, if `member of an organisation' includes (a), (b) and (c), would I be correct in assuming it may well include others who are not listed—that there are a whole range of others who would not be excluded? If I am wrong, I would appreciate that advice from the minister.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—Firstly, I cannot miss this opportunity to tell Senator Cooney about the defence available to someone who joins an organisation and then learns subsequently that it has been listed as terrorist organisation. As I said earlier, it will be a defence to the membership offence, if the person proves that he or she took all reasonable steps to cease being a member of the organisation, as soon as practicable, after the person first knew that the organisation was a terrorist organisation. That is fairly straightforward.
With respect to Senator Faulkner's question, yesterday Senator Brown asked me the same question. I made it very clear then that an `informal member' was based on the fact that a lot of organisations that we are looking at would not have membership lists, badges or registers. Really it is aimed at the fact that an organisation does not have a formal listing, receipts, badges or things of that sort which we commonly come across with community organisations.
The crucial part here is that the member must have taken steps to become a member, and that falls within the definition. Even if you are a member of an organisation which does not have records or things of that sort, then it must be shown still that you took steps to become a member of that organisation. That is a very high requirement of a prosecution, because it has to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. As I have already said, intention and knowledge have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. So it is very much focused on membership—that is, on the person concerned, what steps they took, what their intention was and what knowledge they had. All those have to be met by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. So, under our criminal jurisdiction, you could not have a tighter approach to regulating such a situation. If I have missed anything else, perhaps Senator Faulkner will remind me.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I heard what the minister said in response to Senator Brown, and I heard what he said in response to me when we were dealing with the question of informal membership. I was making a point under division 102.1, `Definitions', which says:
In this division:
member of an organisation includes—
and then it includes those categorised in (a), (b) and (c). I am aware of that. Who else does it include? That is what I was asking the minister to comment on. The concern of the opposition is that membership, as defined in the act, is a very low threshold of involvement in an organisation. That is especially the case because the government includes as members so-called informal members. It is a very vague term. I hear what the minister tells us about informal members, and I know that a member of an organisation includes a person who is an informal member, but there are still a very significant number of questions that require answers from the government.
What the opposition says in this circumstance is that we believe that that important threshold of membership should apply only to international terrorist organisations that have been listed by the United Nations Security Council. That is how the opposition is approaching this question. Otherwise, we have said, the test should be of demonstrated willingness to assist. Again, this has the advantage of targeting the terrorists. Clarifying who we are focusing on will assist the prosecution of any who are engaged in terrorist activity. That really should be our objective here. So there are weaknesses in relation to what the government proposes. Those concerns have not been answered by the government, although they have been identified by the opposition and other senators and, of course, more broadly by those who have made submissions and given testimony to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. They are important issues, Minister. I believe that the solution the opposition proposes will have a very positive effect in dealing with this current problem of the government proposing that membership be defined in this bill with such a low threshold of involvement. I commend the approach the opposition is taking in relation to this matter. It is tighter, more focused and better targeted and, as a result, it will be more effective.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—The court decides the issue of membership here. It is a question of fact and there is no other aspect to it than that. As in all things in relation to criminal jurisdiction, those questions of fact are determined in a court of law. The government believes that the definition is tight and the requirements are high for the prosecution. The opposition says that it is an offence to belong to a terrorist organisation which the UN Security Council has listed but not an offence to belong to a terrorist organisation which is found to be such by an Australian court. Why doesn't the opposition think that it should be a criminal offence to belong to a terrorist organisation which has been found to be so beyond a reasonable doubt by an Australian court?",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—Minister, as you know— but if you do not know, you should check with your advisers—we believe the test is demonstrated willingness to assist. So, if there is demonstrated willingness to assist a terrorist organisation to commit a terrorist act, that has the advantage of going to those who have knowledge and intention of doing what we are all agreed ought to be serious criminal offences in Australian law. That is how it should be dealt with; not with some totally unacceptable politically motivated executive proscription regime and then propose, in relation to those organisations, that membership become an offence. It is just possible that the government and the opposition have a very different view in relation to the fundamental principles here. I would hope not, because I would hope the government would agree with the Labor Party that what we have to do here is target terrorists and terrorist activities. We say that, if a demonstrated willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act is an offence, then rightly such individuals should feel the full force of the law.
I hope, Minister, that you will accept that. I also hope that you will accept the proposition that, if the United Nations Security Council comes to a decision to list an organisation as an international terrorist organisation, in that circumstance—but only in that circumstance—membership of such an organisation should be an offence. I would commend the opposition's approach to you; I think it has very great merit. We have said consistently that, as the United Nations lists terrorist organisations for the purpose of freezing assets and preventing arms-smuggling, as it currently targets people who are engaged in that sort of activity and as such listing is an action of the international community that has the backing of the United Nations Security Council, we believe Australia would be silly not to join in such international action against that sort of terrorist activity. That was not considered important, or certainly did not appear, in the original bill introduced by the Attorney-General.
As you know, we have said in relation to proscription that we strongly oppose that power being given to a domestic government of any political persuasion. I think that is fair. We do so because we realise that the power of proscription could be easily abused. We do not think you are going to get the United Nations Security Council listing, for example—if you want to use an example that might be close to the minds of some in the Australian community and something that happened a few years ago in this country— the Maritime Union of Australia, which might have happened during the Patrick waterfront dispute. What we have said is that, while we have an in-principle objection to criminalising membership of any organisation, for all the reasons that have been outlined, we are prepared to make an exception in the case of membership of organisations declared to be terrorist organisations by the United Nations Security Council. Do not think for one minute that anyone else who is engaged in terrorist activity will not be caught up because of this offence of demonstrated willingness to assist. That is really, conceptually, what most people understand membership to be; not informal membership. It is not what you think but what you do.  
With the amendments to this legislation, I believe you will have a very strong regime, but you will have a strong regime that targets the terrorists; and that is our aim. We have also said—and we have been consistent in this not just over the past few weeks or months but literally for decades—that we want to act in concert with and with the support of the international community in the fight against terrorism. So if the international community, acting and speaking through the United Nations Security Council, declares an organisation to be a terrorist organisation then we do accept membership of that organisation being a criminal offence.
I commend this approach to you, Minister. It is a tough approach. It is a very tough approach on the terrorists, but it does not have the unintended consequences of catching within the definition of criminal activity those who have no intention or knowledge of what membership of an organisation might mean. That is one of the very many weaknesses and probably one of the unintended consequences of the government legislation when it was introduced. I have been very generous in this, Minister. I have accepted that the poor drafting, the sloppy definitions and the lack of oversight, both ministerial and executive, as well as the shoddy performance of those who supported the government in the drafting of this legislation, are not deliberate. I have said that I certainly hope and am willing to accept that all the extraordinary consequences of the original bill were unintended consequences; that all the weaknesses in the drafting are not deliberate. But that does not give a huge amount of comfort to this committee.
We have to fix the problems that have been created by this extraordinarily sloppy piece of legislation coming before the parliament. It has taken a lot of time in a Senate committee and it is taking a lot of time in the Committee of the Whole now, but it is the intention and commitment of the opposition to get this right. We are going to be tough on the terrorists, but we are not going to see people who are not involved in terrorist activity being unwittingly and unfairly caught up in the sloppy drafting of the provisions of the bill which your government introduced. We will not resile from that important principle and we will not resile from the important work of trying to fix up the pathetic efforts that the government made when it first introduced this bill, riddled with these sloppy definitions and unintended consequences.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—The pejorative terms used by Senator Faulkner reveal the fact that he is very much on the back foot on this because he knows very well there is a huge deficiency in the opposition amendment: `We will say it is a criminal offence to be a member of a terrorist organisation determined by the United Nations but not so if it is a terrorist organisation determined by an Australian court.' But it is quite possible that in the future we could have terrorist organisations which operate in Australia only, and it might be difficult to get it through the United Nations Security Council. There might be other organisations on which agreement just cannot be reached by the Security Council of the United Nations, and action might have to be taken in Australia.
We have proposed that an Australian court could find beyond a reasonable doubt that an organisation is a terrorist organisation. The Labor opposition are saying, `We will follow the international guide but we will not have any regard to the domestic situation in Australia or to what might be thrown up in the course of the unusual times that we live in.' We are saying: if it is a criminal offence to belong to a terrorist organisation as defined by the United Nations Security Council, why should it not also be a criminal offence to belong to a terrorist organisation as determined by an Australian court, with the requirement that such a finding be beyond a reasonable doubt? All Australians, I am sure, would say, `We would much rather place faith in our Australian judicial system than some listing determined by the United Nations Security Council.' We say: `Have both.' You may well have a domestic situation where a terrorist organisation is formed in Australia but is not listed by the United Nations Security Council, for a number of reasons, and you might want to have an Australian court determine that. That is why we have subdivision A: to give this legislation that added strength for dealing with a matter not just internationally but also domestically. We have to be aware that not all terrorism resides overseas. Unfortunately, the day will come—I hope it does not—when we will have a terrorist organisation which is Australian in make-up and which is operating in Australia alone. Believe you me, terrorism does not have to be international. It does not have to be determined by the United Nations. It can be determined quite properly by an Australian court using the requirements of our criminal jurisdiction that it be found beyond a reasonable doubt. 
This absence in the opposition amendment leaves a huge hole in this legislation in the fight against terrorist organisations. The opposition has conceded that there is a case for making it a criminal offence to be a member of a terrorist organisation. The question that Senator Faulkner raised in relation to my question to him about the willingness to assist really goes to opposition amendment (12)—he is really debating opposition amendment (12). We are here debating opposition amendment (7), which talks about membership per se, not going that step further and willingly assisting. We are talking about being a member of a terrorist organisation. Labor has agreed that that should be a criminal offence if that terrorist organisation has been found to be so by the United Nations, but it will not go one step further and say, `Yes, we also agree that it should be a criminal offence if that organisation has been found beyond reasonable doubt to be a terrorist organisation by an Australian court.' That is where the gap is. As I said, it may well be that in the future we are faced with terrorist organisations which are Australian alone in make-up; we will have to deal with them domestically or rely on an alternative avenue of enforcement.
The proscription that Senator Faulkner talks about has gone. The executive aspect has gone with subdivision B being deleted. We are now dealing with an Australian court determining a terrorist organisation or the United Nations option. They are the only two left in the proposal. The opposition is ignoring the Australian option of a court being able to determine the status of an organisation—whether it is a terrorist organisation or not. You have to remember that it is quite a substantial requirement that we make of the court in order to do that. The court has to be satisfied that the organisation is:
... an organisation that is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act occurs) ...
The court also has to be satisfied that it is beyond a reasonable doubt. The question of `willingness to assist' arises at a later time and we will be talking about the opposition amendment then. This is not a question of what people think but of people taking that action to join a terrorist organisation, of becoming a member. The opposition and the government agree that becoming a member of a terrorist organisation determined by the United Nations should be a criminal offence. Where we disagree is—
—You propose no role for the courts at all. You propose the Attorney-General. It is so hypocritical.
—We have it in subdivision A, and Senator Faulkner does not like this because—
—That is not your idea; that is the opposition's idea.
—subdivision A is put up by the government—
—You propose the Attorney-General, not the courts. You know that.
—and that what we have is an Australian court determining whether or not an organisation is a terrorist organisation.
—That is not in your bill. 
—That is in subdivision A, and I suggest Senator Faulkner take some advice on that over the luncheon adjournment.
—I have no intention of taking any advice.
—He ought to. You always know when you are winning because of the way that Senator Faulkner reacts. In this case, he ought to get some sound legal advice—
—You have won nothing. You have run up the white flag on everything.
—He knows full well the huge deficiency in the opposition drafting in relation to this provision—
—You just keep running up the white flag.
—where they are leaving a huge loophole for terrorists to operate in Australia.
—Rubbish. Don't be such a hypocrite.

"Senator GIBBS,",ALP,2002-06-26,"—In recent years the government has established a range of measures to increase the number of GPs and nurses in rural and regional Australia. The full effect of these measures is yet to be seen. We do not know whether they will work to solve the crisis in doctor numbers in the bush in the medium or long term. We simply do not yet have enough data.
—It has gone up 10 per cent. It is the first time it has turned around.
—But the government can be congratulated, Minister, at least for trying—even if some of the measures are of dubious impact. Indeed, some of the government's other policies actively work against encouraging a diverse and vibrant rural Australia—not that it will be my focus today, but the government certainly could do a lot towards helping in this area by slowing the removal of essential services like banks and pharmacies in the regions. But that is another speech entirely.
What the government did ignore, however, was the burgeoning problem of GPs abandoning the outer urban areas of our bigger cities. There is growing evidence of a substantial problem in the urban areas of major capital cities and surrounding areas. I know that in the budget extra doctors are to be allocated to outer suburbs, but is the program designed to attract GPs to the outer urban areas of our regional cities like Ipswich, Caboolture and Redcliffe? The problem of the shortage of GPs in these areas is becoming a serious problem. A paper written by Access Economics earlier this year for the Australian Medical Association has identified a number of problems in this area. Australia overall has a shortage of GPs in relation to the number of services that Australians seek to obtain. The shortages are not limited to rural and remote areas but affect many outer urban areas as well. Unless there is a change in current policies, the shortages will get worse. 
Health care is costing more. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare figures show that in 1989-90 spending on health was $35 billion. In 1999-2000 the figures show $52.5 billion. Average annual real growth in health expenditure was four per cent over the 1990s. Costs also rose faster than inflation in the 1990s due in large part to a high uptake of technology, high utilisation, and an increasingly ageing population. There has also been a fall-off in the rate of bulk-billing. In 1996, 80.5 per cent of medical services in Australia were bulk-billed. That figure has declined sharply and now only 75 per cent of services are being bulk-billed. There are a number of issues that drive demand for GPs. Average visits to GPs differ depending on where Australians live. Health Insurance Commission figures show that people in smaller rural areas visit their GP on average only 4.5 times a year. On the other hand, people in outer metropolitan areas visit their GP on average nearly six times a year. Given the linkages between lower socioeconomic status and poor health, this discrepancy is best explained not by overservicing but by general poor levels of health. 
There are also age, population and distribution factors that affect the provision of health services between and within states. The Access Economics report states that until now governments have assumed that, with the right carrots and sticks, city doctors who were steadfast in remaining in coastal and more affluent suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane would move into the country. This may be the case but it ignores the needs of our outer suburbs. There are a number of options for measuring the supply of doctors Australia wide. One thing that is agreed upon is that the outer urban areas of our major cities and surrounding districts are suffering. There are a number of reasons for this. Despite GP shortages in poorer areas, bulk-billing is still very popular in outer urban areas.
Surveys have found that many GPs feel compelled to bulk-bill. Many patients cannot afford anything else. Many also have complex health problems that require detailed consultations. Many doctors also report that trivial visits to GPs are increasing. Abuses of bulk-billing and a general unwillingness of doctors to charge genuinely poor patients are the main factors leading the GP exodus to wealthier areas. Like much of the rest of the population, GPs like inner suburbs. The influx of population in general has made practices more attractive in inner urban areas. Overall, there are a number of factors affecting the supply of doctors in outer urban areas. They are many and varied, but they are there.
To focus these details at a more local level I would like to speak about what is happening in Ipswich. As I am sure many of you know, Ipswich is a regional city adjacent to Brisbane. We have seen right across Australia a tendency, especially in the last 20 years or so, for the cities to grow and merge. Ipswich retains a distinct economic, cultural and sporting identity, but in some aspects the city has become part of a larger Brisbane, especially in terms of the provision of important services such as GPs. The figures in Ipswich itself are quite persuasive. Excluding special purpose practices, there are 47 practices in the Ipswich West Moreton region; seven of those are rural practices in the areas surrounding Ipswich—Boonah, Esk and Laidley shires. A work force survey conducted by the Ipswich West Moreton Division of General Practice showed that, as of 1 April, the region had 77 full-time GPs, 10 of whom are rural doctors, and 43 part-time GPs working a full-time equivalent of 15.5, with five of them rural doctors.
Across the Ipswich West Moreton division, the GP population ratio is one doctor for every 1,803 people. In Ipswich the ratio is one to 1,687 people and in the rural shires it is one to 2,459. Of the 74 GPs responding to questions on age, eight per cent were 34 or less, 34 per cent were 35 to 44, 39 per cent were 45 to 54, nine per cent were 55 to 59 and nine per cent were 60 or over. Regarding their plans for the next five years, 75 per cent said they would be doing the same thing, 14.7 per cent said they would retire or be retired, 5.9 per cent said they would be doing only locum work and 4.4 per cent said they would leave general practice for another career. In Ipswich city itself, 36 per cent of doctors said they were taking new patients, 30 per cent were refusing to take new patients and 33 per cent were taking patients if they were relatives of an existing patient. All of the rural practices are taking new patients but with some restrictions. The Ipswich West Moreton Division of General Practice has details showing that, based on Medicare billing numbers, 105.4 full-time equivalent doctors are doing the workload equivalent of 137.5 average full-time doctors.
The situation is also grim in terms of commitment to, recent experiences of and plans for recruitment. Twenty-five had no recent experiences or plans to recruit, 10 are currently trying to recruit, two anticipate doing so but are expecting difficulties, one practice has given up because of the difficulties and one was successful in recent recruitment. So, as you can see, the situation is particularly difficult. Of the doctors surveyed, 25 per cent indicated that in five years time they were likely to be doing something other than general practice. Age is also a factor: more than half of the doctors surveyed are over 45 years old. This is worrying when you consider the fact that many of them may leave their practices in five or 10 years because of factors such as age, early retirement or any of the other pressures facing doctors. Ipswich GPs also report difficulty attracting locums to the area to work. Locums find working in practices that do not bulk bill, therefore offering higher payments, as being more attractive. This inability to attract locums to the area is increasing the pressure on local doctors, forcing them to work extra-long hours. 
Obviously the situation cannot continue the way it is. The government has taken some measures to address the situation, but more work is needed. We need to fix the endemic problems that plague the system. We need to make sure that the outer urban areas of our bigger cities are not ignored while inner cities bloom and the government directs resources to the rural and regional areas. Our outer urban areas already house some of the most disadvantaged people in our society. We need to make sure they do not suffer further because of a lack of doctors.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Health: General Practice</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-06-26,"—My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill. Can the minister confirm that the government signed up to a $25 million contract in 1997 to introduce new personnel software, known as PMKeyS, in Defence with a delivery date of 2000? Is the minister aware that the government will now spend more that $70 million on the PMKeyS contract, which will deliver only some of the elements originally contracted more than three years late? What will be the full cost of this project when completed, including all indirect and associated costs? Aren't taxpayers again having to foot the bill for the government's gross mismanagement of a Defence contract?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Contracts</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-06-26,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. The government is very keen to blame industry for these bungled Defence projects. We know this by virtue of some of the responses previously. Has any action been taken by the government to penalise the company responsible for PMKeyS? Did the contract have penalty clauses for any failure to deliver on time?

I was honest and frank and acknowledged that I knew very little about this particular contract. You could have asked me about a hundred other contracts and I would have given a more authoritative answer. Let us get the full facts and we will make a determination on that basis, if there is blame to be attached to any party whether it is to Defence or to industry.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-06-26,"—On 25 June, Senator Bartlett asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, a question about elephant seals on Macquarie Island. I have some further information from Dr Kemp on this question. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
SENATOR BARTLETT—25 June 2002
ENVIRONMENT: MACQUARIE ISLAND ELEPHANT SEALS
SENATOR BARTLETT—Can the minister advise or undertake to find out whether or not these experiments (on Southern elephant seals on Macquarie Island), and the latest way they are being conducted, were referred to the Australian Heritage Commission under section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act prior to the approval for the research being given? Can the minister also indicate whether the minister is satisfied himself that the disturbance to seals from the research is not a cause for declining seal numbers?
SENATOR HILL—Macquarie Island Nature Reserve is listed on the Register of the National Estate. The provisions of section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act relate to Commonwealth Ministers and Commonwealth agencies. The current research on Southern elephant seals on Macquarie Island is being conducted by scientists from the University of Tasmania. Macquarie Island is part of the State of Tasmania and the permitting authority for research in the Reserve is the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service. I understand that appropriate research approvals were sought and obtained from the Tasmanian Government. There was no requirement to refer the research to the Australian Heritage Commission.
The Southern elephant seal population on Macquarie Island has been declining since the 1950s. The current population of approximately 70,000 seals continues to fall at the rate of between 1-2% each year. This is one of the reasons for it being the subject of research.
Recent research by a group of mainly Dutch scientists, and published in the journals Polar Biology and the Journal of Comparative Physiology, has concluded that research on Macquarie Island's elephant seals appears not to negatively impact upon the seals' survival.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment: Macquarie Island Elephant Seals</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-06-26,"—by leave—I have a few brief remarks to make in relation to a return to order successfully agreed to by the Senate on the motion of Senator Brown yesterday. I make these remarks on behalf of the Minister for Science, in response to the Senate order to table the study commissioned by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation of the preliminary evaluation of the construction site for the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights. The Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences is still conducting its study of the geology of the replacement research reactor site. The government is therefore unable to meet the Senate's request at this time. The institute is expected to complete its study of the geological mapping of the excavation site in the next few weeks. The government will consider tabling the report once it is completed and the government has taken advice on the matter.",SENATE,<title>NUCLEAR ENERGY: LUCAS HEIGHTS REACTOR</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—by leave—What we have here is a failure by the government to give a report, even a progress report, on a matter of great importance ahead of a six-week parliamentary break—it is not good enough. A report was given to ANSTO about the finding of a fault line at the site now being worked for the establishment of the Argentinian-designed nuclear power station at Lucas Heights to replace the current reactor. That report should be available to the Senate now. That is what the minister should have delivered to the Senate. If there were good faith on this matter, the minister would furthermore have the interim information that has gone to ANSTO and then on to ARPANSA, the regulatory body overlooking the building of that reactor.
It has not escaped my attention and it certainly did not escape the attention of the reporter Stephanie Peatling who, in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday last, reported on comments by the director of the regulatory branch at ARPANSA, Don McNab. This is the organisation charged with the job of looking at nuclear safety. Mr McNab said the discovery was:
... an inconvenience and a disappointment. We don't know the full extent of it yet but it is a setback and more work needs to be done.
That is laden with a bias that must concern anybody who wants to ensure that if a nuclear reactor is to be built in Australia then it must be absolutely safe. This one is being built on the southern edge of the biggest city in Australia. I have looked through the reports of earthquakes in recent times in Australia—and my windows certainly rattled in Hobart a couple of Saturdays ago when a quake measuring 4.4 on the Richter scale shook central Tasmania with the effects felt through to Hobart and Launceston—and on 14 February this year there was a similar quake just south-west of this reactor site measuring 3.8 on the Richter scale. It is reported that this earthquake occurred about 14 kilometres west of Wollongong and about 80 kilometres south-west of Sydney. The earthquake was felt in Wollongong and the southern suburbs of Sydney, Campbelltown and Mittagong. The seismologists are asking for people who felt the impact of that tremor to report.  
Without further information I can say that as a general rule—and this applies in Tasmania—if you can get a quake that measures four on the Richter scale you can get one that measures seven and when you do that you have moved into major damage. You have moved way beyond the death and destruction that is so fresh in our memories from Newcastle. It is a very serious matter. This parliament is charged with the duty of overseeing, in the interests of all Australians, the siting and building of this reactor. The Australian Greens are totally opposed to it and we have been all the way through.
But this afternoon, on the second last day of sitting before the recess, the warning signs are very much up when the minister made the glib statement: `We haven't got this report completed yet. We will see you sometime later.' That is simply not good enough— there are all the elements here of a cover-up. The minister did not even present the report which went from the New Zealand company that found the fault line to ANSTO, the builders of the reactor or to ARPANSA, the people who are overseeing this important and contentious matter. That is totally unacceptable.
This government should have reported fully to the Senate this afternoon. I will be looking at what measures we can take to increase the government's ardour in the face of a failure like this. The government might think this is an unimportant matter but the Greens do not. We are responding to the feelings of residents in the area who certainly do not and who are mightily alarmed by the prospect of a nuclear reactor, let alone one built on a fault line. I repeat that this is an unacceptable failure of duty by the minister to report to this chamber following an order from the Senate two days ago. It has the makings of a cover-up and is not acceptable to the Greens.
—Madam President, on a point of order: I understand Senator Brown's concern about this matter but I thought he sought leave to make a short statement. I would hate to see it when he seeks leave to make a long one.
—He did get leave to make a short statement so I presume he is winding up.
—Senator Calvert is tempting me greatly—
—You just do not get leave in the future.
—Senator Knowles is indicating that in the next couple of days one of the devices that may be used will be to not give leave. I take the idea aboard Senator Knowles—
—You asked for a short statement, not a waffle.
—If that is what the government is indicating is part of its armamentarium for the next two days, remember that two can tango. Let me go back to my concluding statement: this is a very serious matter which affects hundreds of thousands of people in the region near to the reactor. There is the appearance of obfuscation and cover-up in this matter. This parliament should be informed this afternoon on the latest information and not be getting a duckshove which says, `It is going to take a few weeks more and then we will decide what to do.' That is totally unacceptable.",SENATE,<title>NUCLEAR ENERGY: LUCAS HEIGHTS REACTOR</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I present report 2/2002 of the Committee of Senators' Interests, entitled Proposed changes to resolutions relating to declarations of senators' interests and gifts to the Senate and the parliament. I also present a register of senators' interests, incorporating statements of interests and notifications of alterations of interests of senators lodged between 7 December 2001 and 24 June 2002.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of report 2/2002 of the Committee of Senators' Interests.
The purpose of this report is to recommend to the Senate changes to resolutions relating to the declaration of senators' interests and gifts to the Senate and the parliament. Senators will note that the resolutions relating to senators' interests have been in operation, virtually without change, since 1994, and the resolution relating to gifts since 1997.
Having re-examined the terms of the resolutions, the committee makes the following recommendations. The first recommendation is that all senators make a full declaration of interests at least once in each parliament. The committee suggests that the appropriate time is after the swearing in of senators for the states in July, and the resolution has been redrafted accordingly. The second recommendation is that the value of gifts and assets required to be declared under the terms of resolution 3 be raised as indicated in the report. The existing amounts have not been increased since the passage of the original resolutions in 1994. The third recommendation is that resolution 5 be omitted altogether. This resolution requires a declaration of relevant interests by a senator when first speaking or voting on a matter before the Senate. The committee considers that, given the public nature of a senator's statement of registrable interests, this is sufficient to comply with the requirements at present set down in resolution 5.
In respect of the resolution relating to declaration of gifts to the Senate and the parliament, the committee recommends the same increase in the amounts specified as for declarations of interests, and for the same reasons. It also proposes amendments to the resolution to enable retiring senators to retain declared gifts under certain conditions, based on guidelines for retention of ministerial gifts.
The committee has also made changes to the explanatory notes and procedural rules relating to the resolutions. The most important of these reflect the committee's decision to exclude frequent flyer points and membership of airline lounges from declaration requirements. Further amendments will be made to these documents, as required, if the Senate agrees to changes to the resolutions.
The purpose of tabling this report at this time is to enable all senators, including the newly elected, to consider the proposals before the Senate resumes sitting in August. A draft booklet, which consolidates and, the committee hopes, simplifies the present documentation of senators' interests and declarations of gifts is at appendix A to this report. The committee would welcome any suggestions for amendments either to the resolutions themselves or to the explanatory notes, forms and rules, which any senator may have before the Senate considers the resolutions. I seek leave to give a notice of motion for Wednesday, 21 August 2002, the terms of which I have handed to the Clerk.
Leave granted.
—I give notice that, on 21 August 2002, I shall move:
That the following amendments to the resolutions relating to senators' interests and declaration of gifts to the Senate and the Parliament be agreed to.
Resolution 1—Registration of senators' interests
Paragraph (1), omit—
“Within 14 sitting days after the adoption of this resolution by the Senate and 28 days of making and subscribing an oath or affirmation of allegiance as a senator”,
substitute—
“Within:
	(a)	28 days after the first meeting of the Senate after 1 July first occurring after a general election; and
	(b)	28 days after the first meeting of the Senate after a simultaneous dissolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives; and
	(c)	28 days after making and subscribing an oath or affirmation of allegiance as a senator for a Territory or appointed or chosen to fill a vacancy in the Senate”.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—This report of the Committee of Senators' Interests does require comment, because it is changing the requirement for senators to report to the Senate and therefore to the public on pecuniary interest. I note that the report recommends that we delete the requirement that in debate we reveal pecuniary interest where it is involved in a matter. I am the senator who has on a number of occasions—fairly rare, but they have been there and they were important—called the Senate's attention to the requirement under our standing orders that, where we have a pecuniary interest, we reveal it. This has happened on occasions such as in legislation dealing with the logging of forests where senators who have shares in woodchip companies are ostensibly required to reveal them and in mining matters where people have shares in mining companies—where people could have a pecuniary gain or loss out of a matter before the Senate. It is good practice that that be made public at the time. It is good practice for the senators that we keep making ourselves aware that if there is an interest we divulge that, because it can make a difference to how we vote. 
I believe that if we do not we lose trust from the public. It is not the reverse. We are inviting the public to become even more cynical about politics and the integrity of the place. It is simple good practice, and we should be following it. At local government level in many parts of Australia and certainly in Tasmania, if you have a pecuniary interest you must not just declare it but also absent yourself from the debate and the vote taking place. That is not called for here, but it is extremely good practice that, where we have a pecuniary interest in the matters before the Senate, we put that interest on record.
I note that the value of gifts for which we are required to make a declaration is going to increase. I hope that is consistent with inflation and not beyond that. Again, we are privileged to be in parliament. We do get gifts from time to time. It is very difficult to say no when you are travelling overseas and people want to make a gift. In fact, it is quite rude on occasions not to accept and it does sometimes present us with difficulties. But the matter should be recorded. This process is very important. I think we should be tightening it up, not loosening it. If anybody has any worry about it, then all the more reason for having it. It does not take up much time, it does not take up much deliberation, but it is important that it be there for the integrity of politics. I will certainly be looking very carefully at the report and will be ready for moves to change the standing orders when they come through—I think they are a bit lax, if anything.
Finally, on the matter of frequent flyer points: the government's requirement, as I understand it, is that frequent flyer points not be used for personal use, that the government claims them as government property, effectively, and that they should be used for parliamentary travel. In that case, they are not an advantage to an individual. However, when it comes to the use of airline lounges— the captain's lounge, the supreme lounge or whatever it might be—which are frequented by politicians, millionaires and people who fly frequently, it does provide benefits for those of us who are working on the move. But it is a big largesse from the airline companies. I had to think about this when I asked my question today about the fallen standards of Qantas, because I find the people in the Qantas lounges absolutely affable, helpful, charming and wonderful hosts. The very facility presents something of a cushion against MPs who use those facilities being outspoken if Qantas or another airline presenting those facilities falls short of the mark. If we are getting value above the prescribed level in the rules from the use of those lounges, we should declare it. I do not think most of the public even know that those lounges exist. Maybe an alternative there is that, if it is going to be removed by wish of the majority, it be stated on the declaration forms that we fill in, as part of the declaration form itself, that these advantages that politicians get in flying about the country are nevertheless advantages coming from private corporations which influence the way we think.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Senators' Interests Committee</title>,Committees,16,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I wish to address a few issues, especially those raised by Senator Brown. Senator Brown says that, if you do not declare your pecuniary interest here, no-one knows about it. He is missing the point, as he has always missed the point on this. Our point is that if your pecuniary interest is recorded on your declaration form, which is published annually, then that signals to everyone whether you have a pecuniary interest or not. If you have suddenly acquired one and it is not on that form, you will have to get up and declare it at the first available opportunity, because we do not want conflict of interest with regard to pecuniary interest.
It becomes farcical, because it is only raised in certain circumstances. Where do you draw the line on pecuniary interest? If there is a greenhouse bill, am I supposed to declare a pecuniary interest because I consume oxygen? I would probably suck in a lot more than Senator Brown does, especially since giving up smoking. This is not a conspiracy to weaken accountability; it is just commonsense. If the information is in the form you do not have to declare it in here and you do not have to respond to someone who is after a bit of opportunistic publicity. Far be it from me to say that you have ever done that in the past, Senator Brown. Nevertheless, it is not done on every vote; it is only done and raised in specific circumstances. As long as the form is properly filled out, though, and here we have common ground: it must be extensive. 
On the second matter of gifts and hospitality, it is time that was adjusted for inflation. The levels were very carefully thought about. By the way, the levels were not 1994 levels. That is when we finally browbeat the coalition into accepting this. They are actually levels which had been set four years before. So if someone wants to put this in terms of constant dollars, do not go back to 1994; go back to 1990 to get the true effect—rather than say, `You have gone up a bit.' I assume also that the committee has put it a bit higher to take into account a midpoint adjustment to inflation. That is a very sensible thing. Senator Brown says, `What about airport lounges?' Let me declare that I had a bowl of peanuts and a strong latte last Sunday night in the airport lounge. He is also right to say that, in terms of Qantas, that is the one area where their service and approach to everything have not declined at all. It would be very hard to find any other area. 
Senator Brown today complained about the catering on Qantas. I have one question to Neil Perry, who is the cuisine consultant: where do you buy the seven-day-old focaccias? Everywhere I go in Melbourne they are either fresh or a day old. I cannot find seven-day-old foccacias. I hope Neil Perry will let me know that one day. The third matter mentioned by Senator Denman is important: going from six-year to three-year declarations. Usually you only do it once a term, but doing it every three years will be a trigger for all of us to make sure we have not overlooked something. It also means that the amount of adjustments and extras we have to put in will be less. That is another commonsense approach by this committee and I congratulate the committee for that.
Finally, Senator Brown mentioned frequent flyer points. I notice that the Carr government in New South Wales have just cut a deal with Qantas to cut out frequent flyer points in lieu of cheaper air fares. That is something Labor governments have tried to do. I assume that Senator Minchin probably tried to do it when he was minister. I was looking at this as far back as 1988, and we never got anywhere with the airlines. One of the reasons why we did not get anywhere with the airlines was that if you succeeded with one airline the other airline would take customers away. We do not have that anymore. I think some airlines have got sick of frequent flyer points, so probably this will be solved for us by the end of this year. The government will be able to cut a deal with the airlines for cheaper air fares with no frequent flyer points applying et cetera. I know the government encourages us to use frequent flyer points to come to and from Canberra, but if you can find a spare seat let me know. The department themselves gave evidence at an estimates committee saying they could not use any of their frequent flyer points because they could not find any seats. If the mean, miserable department of finance cannot find a spare seat in a plane, what hope have we got?

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I present report 2/2002 of the Committee of Senators' Interests, entitled Proposed changes to resolutions relating to declarations of senators' interests and gifts to the Senate and the parliament. I also present a register of senators' interests, incorporating statements of interests and notifications of alterations of interests of senators lodged between 7 December 2001 and 24 June 2002.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of report 2/2002 of the Committee of Senators' Interests.
The purpose of this report is to recommend to the Senate changes to resolutions relating to the declaration of senators' interests and gifts to the Senate and the parliament. Senators will note that the resolutions relating to senators' interests have been in operation, virtually without change, since 1994, and the resolution relating to gifts since 1997.
Having re-examined the terms of the resolutions, the committee makes the following recommendations. The first recommendation is that all senators make a full declaration of interests at least once in each parliament. The committee suggests that the appropriate time is after the swearing in of senators for the states in July, and the resolution has been redrafted accordingly. The second recommendation is that the value of gifts and assets required to be declared under the terms of resolution 3 be raised as indicated in the report. The existing amounts have not been increased since the passage of the original resolutions in 1994. The third recommendation is that resolution 5 be omitted altogether. This resolution requires a declaration of relevant interests by a senator when first speaking or voting on a matter before the Senate. The committee considers that, given the public nature of a senator's statement of registrable interests, this is sufficient to comply with the requirements at present set down in resolution 5.
In respect of the resolution relating to declaration of gifts to the Senate and the parliament, the committee recommends the same increase in the amounts specified as for declarations of interests, and for the same reasons. It also proposes amendments to the resolution to enable retiring senators to retain declared gifts under certain conditions, based on guidelines for retention of ministerial gifts.
The committee has also made changes to the explanatory notes and procedural rules relating to the resolutions. The most important of these reflect the committee's decision to exclude frequent flyer points and membership of airline lounges from declaration requirements. Further amendments will be made to these documents, as required, if the Senate agrees to changes to the resolutions.
The purpose of tabling this report at this time is to enable all senators, including the newly elected, to consider the proposals before the Senate resumes sitting in August. A draft booklet, which consolidates and, the committee hopes, simplifies the present documentation of senators' interests and declarations of gifts is at appendix A to this report. The committee would welcome any suggestions for amendments either to the resolutions themselves or to the explanatory notes, forms and rules, which any senator may have before the Senate considers the resolutions. I seek leave to give a notice of motion for Wednesday, 21 August 2002, the terms of which I have handed to the Clerk.
Leave granted.
—I give notice that, on 21 August 2002, I shall move:
That the following amendments to the resolutions relating to senators' interests and declaration of gifts to the Senate and the Parliament be agreed to.
Resolution 1—Registration of senators' interests

	(b)	28 days after the first meeting of the Senate after a simultaneous dissolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives; and
	(c)	28 days after making and subscribing an oath or affirmation of allegiance as a senator for a Territory or appointed or chosen to fill a vacancy in the Senate”.
Resolution 3—Registrable interests

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,2002-06-26,"—I present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on quota management control on Australian beef exports to the United States, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted. 
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
A number of members of the committee would like to speak to this report, so I will not speak for long. But this is the last time that I will put down a report in this place and speak to it, so I would like to thank all the people I have worked with on the committee over the past 12 years. This committee has earned a reputation in this place for, firstly, the quality of its work and, secondly, our ability to work through issues on which we had different positions at the start. Very seldom has there been conflict across the floor when the legislation was dealt with. I refer to the inquiries into the beef industry, the wheat industry, the wool industry, the dairy industry and a whole range of things that we dealt with which were very difficult for us in terms of the position we started with and the number of players involved from right across Australia. I even make reference to the final sale of Sydney airport. That was a report that we did some years ago. And there was the Northern Prawn Fishery, another very difficult one where there were a thousand different views but we were able to bring the industry and the players to a consensus position. 
I also want to acknowledge the cooperation we have had over the years from the department. We have worked with a hell of a lot of very dedicated, very good officers. We have not always agreed with them, but we have always had a very frank, informative and proper working relationship, and that contributed an enormous amount to the things that I mentioned before. We have with us Senator Calvert, who was one of the founding members of the committee. I welcome him as the Government Whip; it is great to see him. 
—Do you remember the quarantine service inquiry?
—That is right, we did a fair few of those. There were a number of them. I remember the rail report. I remember being out in South Australia up at the top of the peninsula.
—There were the abattoirs.
—Yes, that is dead right. This report was no less difficult or more challenging than any issue that we have had to deal with. There were competing, conflicting commercial interests involved here. They included whether or not somebody would be able to stay in the industry in terms of their abattoir operation or their processing operation and whether, in going right across Australia, we could get things as fair as possible in terms of making sure that producers across this country were able to maximise their price.
I want to particularly thank the committee for last week. Unfortunately, I could not be here for some of the meetings last week as I was not in good health as I am now. Senator Heffernan stepped in for me, and I welcome him here and thank him for his contribution in the last days—and also Senator Buckland, who acted as chair through a difficult, long day. Through modern technology, I was able to involve myself in it all except for a very short period.
We had before us a range of policy issues, not greatly different in a lot of ways from the European Union quota issue we dealt with— tonnages were very different and the quality of the meat we were dealing with was very different, but they are both crucial markets to the Australian meat industry whether you be a producer, as I am—and I declare that interest—or right at the end of the process—export, delivery, marketing in the US or whatever. RMAC put down one proposal. The minister, after looking at it and having discussions, brought down another proposal. We have introduced into this an extension of what is fundamentally the minister's proposal in that we have recommended—and this is the key point—a doubling or thereabouts of what was known as the hardship provision of 14,000 tonnes. We are recommending that and it is out for discussion with industry across the board. We are not calling it a hardship provision but a discretionary provision so that those processors that are most disadvantaged will be able to pick up a lot. We also have to acknowledge that a number of the larger operators who concentrated more on the US market than other markets—and I do not criticise them for that; that is the economic reality—have shown goodwill in allowing us to get to these recommendations. I very strongly recommend—as strongly as I have ever recommended in this place—to the minister and the department that this is a very sound way to go. It does not move a long way from where the minister was but it is very significant in what it will do and the impact it will have. 
There are three other recommendations which I will briefly touch on. Recommendation 2 says:
The Committee notes the difficulties that re-allocation of beef quota will pose for the industry in the current quota year and recommends that the Australian Government actively pursue with the United States Government the allocation of US discretionary tonnage of beef to Australia.
Not many people would know, but the US holds a discretion in the order of 70,000 tonnes. With the collapse in Korea and Japan and the problems in Argentina, we are urging our ministers, our Prime Minister and anybody who may have the opportunity to talk to influential people in the US, to suggest that this year in particular but also the next year or two would be a very good time to show some goodwill back to our industry in Australia and to use the friendship that exists between the two countries to utilise some of that discretionary tonnage. It would not take very much out of that to resolve the particular problem we have with the oversupply in the country due to the aspects I mentioned. Recommendation 3 says: 
The Committee notes that the United States has been reported as having increased its share of the Japanese beef market recently and the Committee recommends that, in light of this development, and evidence to the Committee during this Inquiry of strengthening demand in Japan, that the Government support intensified Australian beef marketing initiatives in Japan.
The evidence that we took and listened to was not all doom and gloom from Japan. Some of the operators were pessimistic about Japan but others were quite strong in their belief that there was and would be a gradual improvement in the Japanese market. Certainly, I have had private discussions with a number of operators whom I know personally—we did not take evidence from them— about the Japanese situation and they are quite confident that we will see a gradual improvement there. So there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Recommendation 4 says:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Beef Export to the United States) Order 2002, when prepared, complies with the recommendations made by the committee in this report.
We believe that it is essential that that be done. If it is not done, then I have great fear that there will not be put in place for the remainder of this season a workable system to deal with the situation we have, and there will be a lot more pain than would otherwise be felt. 
Finally, I must make comment with regard to RMAC, which was established by a memorandum of understanding in 1996-97 to be the key body of the meat industry in this country. Unfortunately, that has not happened. There is now a divide. I think it is absolutely crucial that the minister forms a roundtable with the various parties and has some real down-to-earth discussions about how the meat industry is going to move forward.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,21,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-06-26,"—Firstly, I endorse Senator Crane's comments about the tremendous work of the committee secretariat in the preparation of this report—as with many others—in a very short time. They got together the documentation for the basis of the committee's report and coordinated the evidence and the witnesses, using technological means to keep Senator Crane involved in the committee, as well as one could in the circumstances. I want to congratulate Senator Crane, who lays down his last committee report today, for the work he has done. He has been committed to his role as the chair of the committee, and committed to an outcome that he thought was the best outcome, and that has contributed greatly to the fact that this committee is one legislation committee in the parliament that presents a great many unanimous, all-party reports and perhaps sets an example for the future for the Senate. I congratulate him for it. I will get the opportunity tomorrow to make some comments about Senator Crane's other roles and the future.
In relation to the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on quota management control on Australian beef exports to the United States, I remind the Senate that the administration of the United States beef quota has been the responsibility of the federal minister for agriculture since the industry was restructured in 1997. Before that, it was the responsibility of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. Therefore, this inquiry has been very much about how Mr Truss has managed this matter because, in the end, the allocation of the quota into the United States, a market worth $2 billion to Australia, has been a matter for him and him alone.
After a number of representations from various sectors of the beef industry, I referred this matter to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee to enable all the facts to be put on the table and to allow senators to make an informed judgment about the manner in which Mr Truss has handled the issue and the merits of his proposals for the management of the quota. The committee has done its job in a timely but comprehensive manner and, as I was referring to earlier, has formed a unanimous view as to the best way forward. The evidence presented confirms that the performance of Mr Truss has been a combination of indecision, poor judgment and periods of inaction followed by ill-considered reaction to industry pressure. It is damning of the minister in the extreme that a Senate committee has been forced to step in—with the aid of Senator Heffernan in this case—and lever a compromise deal which, in our view, is the least worst option half-way through a quota year. When I say `our view', I mean the view of the six senators, not based on political allegiance but based on the evidence heard and the best compromise we could salvage from what is a fiasco of the first order. 
The debate over how best to allocate quota has become increasingly acrimonious, not only between the industry and the minister but within the red meat sector itself. This is a consequence of the failure of Mr Truss to give the industry a clear direction as to how the matter should be progressed and his failure to act to establish a clear framework for the timely management of the quota. Despite writing to the industry in December last year suggesting that he may or may not act and, if he did, he would look to a scheme built around a US shipper of record, Mr Truss clung to the view that the quota may not fill until the end of the quota year. He hoped that he would be relieved of the burden of having to do his job. That was always a false hope. As I said in this place last week, never before have I witnessed such intensity of feeling against a minister as that directed at Mr Truss by nearly all witnesses who gave evidence to this inquiry. A number of processors laid out for the committee the extent of job losses that they were concerned would flow if Mr Truss pushed on with his model for management of the quota—an aspect of this debate which Mr Truss and his department had not even bothered to take into account.
The committee's first recommendation is that the minister's scheme be varied to include a substantial parcel of quota that should be allocated over the remainder of the year to minimise disruption in the industry. The committee also recommends that the minister's model be renegotiated, through an industry roundtable, for 2003 and beyond. Those negotiations must commence immediately. Last Tuesday, I called on industry organisations to consider how they might restructure consultative arrangements. I note that the minister made a similar call late last week. While the forum that the committee recommends be established will obviously have new quota arrangements as its principal task, it could also provide the first step to building a new set of industry consultative arrangements.
The unanimous recommendations from this committee, if accepted by the minister, will enable the industry to get through to the end of this quota year with minimum job losses. This whole process has been nothing short of a disaster for large sections of the red meat industry. I acknowledge that the plan that all members of the committee have endorsed today is far from satisfactory to a lot of people, but it is the best of a bad lot, to put it frankly. That is caused by the failure of the minister to act in a timely manner, which has left the committee with little choice in relation to its recommendations.
A number of processors will still be disadvantaged under what, effectively, is the deal which Senator Heffernan has been able to broker with a number of industry participants, despite the spoiling role played by the minister. I understand that as late as last night, Mr Truss was still seeking to undermine what I describe as the `Heffernan plan'. Certainly, this plan will avoid the significant regional job losses that were guaranteed to flow if the Truss plan were implemented. These unanimous recommendations are designed to facilitate the development of a strategy to move on from this Truss-induced chaos. There is a need to reach agreement quickly on how we manage the US quota for the coming year. I am optimistic that there is still sufficient goodwill in the industry to progress this matter to a satisfactory end. On behalf of the opposition, I am happy to do what I can to assist that process, but there is a further more fundamental issue that must be addressed—that is, the development of a strategy to rebuild the focus of all beef sectors on our total export effort. As I said last week, that process has all but been destroyed by Mr Truss. I have now written to all industry organisations and to a number of individual companies proposing that a group be established that is representative of all industry interests. It is time for all existing industry structures which were put in place in 1997 to be subjected to a review. 
While the thrust of this report is about moving this multibillion dollar industry forward, I am concerned that the minister, Mr Truss, I will be unable to meet this challenge. It is clear that the Prime Minister has for some time been of the view that Mr Truss has failed to manage this process. There can be no other explanation for the appointment of Senator Heffernan as the government's negotiator with the industry. Given the poisonous relationship that now exists between Mr Truss and most industry players, Mr Howard must consider how best to progress a long-term solution to the current dilemma. I cannot see how Mr Truss can make any constructive contribution to that process. Perhaps Mr Howard should keep Senator Heffernan on the case for a bit longer.
Were Minister Truss to decline to accept the unanimous recommendations of this committee and seek to promulgate his proposals—which, as I described earlier, have seen some of the most scathing comments made about a minister for agriculture that I have seen in my time in this place—that would no doubt prompt significant challenges through the legal system, further chaos in the management of the quota and problems with the minister's relationship with the industry. I believe it would be inappropriate for him to do so. If he proposes to do so in a timetable which means that the Senate cannot deal with this matter until August, that will be a matter of condemnation to be heaped upon the minister.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,21,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-06-26,"—I would like to acknowledge the extraordinary contribution that Senator Crane has made as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. I thank him for his contribution and his assistance to me, as a new member of the committee, over the last 11 months. On behalf of the Democrats and on behalf of my predecessor, Senator John Woodley, I extend to Senator Crane our thanks for the very multipartisan way in which he has run this committee. It has produced a series of unanimous reports on very contentious issues. Today, we have another unanimous report on a very important issue: the allocation of the US beef quota. I am happy to endorse the recommendations of the committee, which dealt with what has been an incredibly difficult issue, in an area where there are extraordinarily entrenched interests and extraordinarily entrenched difficulties, in trying to find the best way and the best criteria to deal with that issue.
I would also like to acknowledge Senator O'Brien's contribution in initiating this very important inquiry. It has been important to let all sides have their say, to look at the decision making process, to look at the weaknesses of the industry structures that have emerged and the delays that have resulted in this decision being left until seven months into a shipping year. It was entirely appropriate for the Senate to have an inquiry into this issue.
I acknowledge that it has been a very difficult issue for the minister. I know from my discussions with him that he has been trying to ensure that a fair and reasonable proposal has been developed for both the specialists on the one side and the global processors on the other. And it is not easy. I certainly know that, having met most of the people in this debate. The difficulty which we have is not so much that the minister has come up with a model, rather that the model is being imposed so late into the shipping year. That is why I am quite happy to sign off on the recommendation that what is needed is a much larger hardship quota within the US beef quota to ensure that those people who are disadvantaged by the late implementation of the quota management system can survive until the end of the year. That is a very important consideration. 
The problem, from my point of view, is not the model or the formula; it is the lateness. That has been a result of almost a comedy of errors going right back to last December. I would probably share out the blame for this across a whole range of people. The problem started because of the different philosophies that exist between RMAC and the industry bodies favouring global diversification on the one side and the department and the minister, who have been quite happy to encourage specialist markets, on the other. It exists because industry bodies signed off on a proposal—the majority of their members were in favour of it, particularly with respect to meat processing—while the majority of people, who have 70 per cent of the market in the US, had not signed off on that proposal. In my view, the industry bodies do not come out covered in glory. RMAC does not come out covered in glory; AFFA does not come out covered in glory. The whole thing has been a shemozzle from end to end. A very important recommendation, which the Senate will have to debate on another day, is the recommendation to have a Senate inquiry into the advisory processes within the meat industry, to make sure that we are not faced with a debacle like this ever again.
I encourage the minister to take on board the committee's recommendations, particularly the very important one that his regulations will have to be changed to significantly increase the hardship component. I do not particularly care whether it is 30,000 tonnes or some slightly different figure—that is something which I will be happy to negotiate with the minister at the appropriate time. What is essential is that the hardship quota will need to be increased very substantially above 14,000 tonnes if we are going to be able to implement this quota allocation model into a market, seven months into a shipping year, without losing processors across Australia. I also encourage the minister to take on board the committee's other important recommendations about trying to make sure that Australia uses whatever means it can to talk to the US about getting access to more quota. The fundamental issue here was not so much the allocation of quota but the lack of available quota and the fact that there is a quota. That comes back to the whole difficult issue of Australia's trade relationship with the US, which we need to look at.
The other important recommendation is to put some marketing effort into Japan. That market is now starting to recover, yet we are losing market share to American exporters because of the failure of the government to match the Americans' marketing efforts into Japan. It would really do a great deal to take the pressure off this quota management issue if we ensured the retention of our traditional markets in Japan, which we are currently losing.
With those comments, I encourage the minister to continue discussions, with goodwill, with the Democrats and with others in the Senate—particularly Senator Heffernan—on the issue of raising the hardship quota to a level that can sustain the industry much more broadly and what the appropriate criteria for allocating it would be. The Democrats will be continuing their discussions with the minister on those matters. We would certainly leave open the issue of whether these regulations would stand if they were unamended. I would have difficulties, but it is something we would leave open for another stage. At this stage, what the industry needs is certainty. That means that the minister needs to become flexible in dealing with the hardship element. That would mean taking on board the recommendations of what I think is an excellent committee report, produced under exceptional time restraints. I give credit to the secretariat for that.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,21,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-06-26,"—I would like to make a few comments on the report of the Rural and Regional and Transport Legislation Committee on the quota management control on Australian beef exports to the United States. Essentially I reiterate what Senator Cherry has said because his description of the problem was very adequate. His description of the problem was very apt because it is a shemozzle and one that probably could have been avoided through better management across the board. I think that the government and the minister have done what they could.  
I have not gone through the committee report because I have only just been given it. On the recommendations, the hardship quota needs to be seriously addressed. Over and above that, we seriously have to address the issue of having quota restrictions at all with the US. When we are talking about having a free trade agreement, if we cannot get to the point where we can sort out some of these matters, it does not bode too well for an agreement that will be of any consequence or use to the agricultural industry in this country. I support the committee's recommendations. I think that under the circumstances they did a reasonably good job. The outcome is not the best, but it is probably the best of what was a rather difficult set of circumstances for everybody. There would have been potential job losses no matter what happened. Of course there will be some wind-back at some of the meat producers, but I think that will be the consequence of something that was poorly managed by all concerned. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,2002-06-26,"—I present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on quota management control on Australian beef exports to the United States, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted. 
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
A number of members of the committee would like to speak to this report, so I will not speak for long. But this is the last time that I will put down a report in this place and speak to it, so I would like to thank all the people I have worked with on the committee over the past 12 years. This committee has earned a reputation in this place for, firstly, the quality of its work and, secondly, our ability to work through issues on which we had different positions at the start. Very seldom has there been conflict across the floor when the legislation was dealt with. I refer to the inquiries into the beef industry, the wheat industry, the wool industry, the dairy industry and a whole range of things that we dealt with which were very difficult for us in terms of the position we started with and the number of players involved from right across Australia. I even make reference to the final sale of Sydney airport. That was a report that we did some years ago. And there was the Northern Prawn Fishery, another very difficult one where there were a thousand different views but we were able to bring the industry and the players to a consensus position. 
I also want to acknowledge the cooperation we have had over the years from the department. We have worked with a hell of a lot of very dedicated, very good officers. We have not always agreed with them, but we have always had a very frank, informative and proper working relationship, and that contributed an enormous amount to the things that I mentioned before. We have with us Senator Calvert, who was one of the founding members of the committee. I welcome him as the Government Whip; it is great to see him. 
—Do you remember the quarantine service inquiry?
—That is right, we did a fair few of those. There were a number of them. I remember the rail report. I remember being out in South Australia up at the top of the peninsula.
—There were the abattoirs.
—Yes, that is dead right. This report was no less difficult or more challenging than any issue that we have had to deal with. There were competing, conflicting commercial interests involved here. They included whether or not somebody would be able to stay in the industry in terms of their abattoir operation or their processing operation and whether, in going right across Australia, we could get things as fair as possible in terms of making sure that producers across this country were able to maximise their price.
I want to particularly thank the committee for last week. Unfortunately, I could not be here for some of the meetings last week as I was not in good health as I am now. Senator Heffernan stepped in for me, and I welcome him here and thank him for his contribution in the last days—and also Senator Buckland, who acted as chair through a difficult, long day. Through modern technology, I was able to involve myself in it all except for a very short period.
We had before us a range of policy issues, not greatly different in a lot of ways from the European Union quota issue we dealt with— tonnages were very different and the quality of the meat we were dealing with was very different, but they are both crucial markets to the Australian meat industry whether you be a producer, as I am—and I declare that interest—or right at the end of the process—export, delivery, marketing in the US or whatever. RMAC put down one proposal. The minister, after looking at it and having discussions, brought down another proposal. We have introduced into this an extension of what is fundamentally the minister's proposal in that we have recommended—and this is the key point—a doubling or thereabouts of what was known as the hardship provision of 14,000 tonnes. We are recommending that and it is out for discussion with industry across the board. We are not calling it a hardship provision but a discretionary provision so that those processors that are most disadvantaged will be able to pick up a lot. We also have to acknowledge that a number of the larger operators who concentrated more on the US market than other markets—and I do not criticise them for that; that is the economic reality—have shown goodwill in allowing us to get to these recommendations. I very strongly recommend—as strongly as I have ever recommended in this place—to the minister and the department that this is a very sound way to go. It does not move a long way from where the minister was but it is very significant in what it will do and the impact it will have. 
There are three other recommendations which I will briefly touch on. Recommendation 2 says:
The Committee notes the difficulties that re-allocation of beef quota will pose for the industry in the current quota year and recommends that the Australian Government actively pursue with the United States Government the allocation of US discretionary tonnage of beef to Australia.
Not many people would know, but the US holds a discretion in the order of 70,000 tonnes. With the collapse in Korea and Japan and the problems in Argentina, we are urging our ministers, our Prime Minister and anybody who may have the opportunity to talk to influential people in the US, to suggest that this year in particular but also the next year or two would be a very good time to show some goodwill back to our industry in Australia and to use the friendship that exists between the two countries to utilise some of that discretionary tonnage. It would not take very much out of that to resolve the particular problem we have with the oversupply in the country due to the aspects I mentioned. Recommendation 3 says: 
The Committee notes that the United States has been reported as having increased its share of the Japanese beef market recently and the Committee recommends that, in light of this development, and evidence to the Committee during this Inquiry of strengthening demand in Japan, that the Government support intensified Australian beef marketing initiatives in Japan.
The evidence that we took and listened to was not all doom and gloom from Japan. Some of the operators were pessimistic about Japan but others were quite strong in their belief that there was and would be a gradual improvement in the Japanese market. Certainly, I have had private discussions with a number of operators whom I know personally—we did not take evidence from them— about the Japanese situation and they are quite confident that we will see a gradual improvement there. So there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Recommendation 4 says:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Beef Export to the United States) Order 2002, when prepared, complies with the recommendations made by the committee in this report.
We believe that it is essential that that be done. If it is not done, then I have great fear that there will not be put in place for the remainder of this season a workable system to deal with the situation we have, and there will be a lot more pain than would otherwise be felt. 
Finally, I must make comment with regard to RMAC, which was established by a memorandum of understanding in 1996-97 to be the key body of the meat industry in this country. Unfortunately, that has not happened. There is now a divide. I think it is absolutely crucial that the minister forms a roundtable with the various parties and has some real down-to-earth discussions about how the meat industry is going to move forward.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,21,2,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-06-26,"—Firstly, I endorse Senator Crane's comments about the tremendous work of the committee secretariat in the preparation of this report—as with many others—in a very short time. They got together the documentation for the basis of the committee's report and coordinated the evidence and the witnesses, using technological means to keep Senator Crane involved in the committee, as well as one could in the circumstances. I want to congratulate Senator Crane, who lays down his last committee report today, for the work he has done. He has been committed to his role as the chair of the committee, and committed to an outcome that he thought was the best outcome, and that has contributed greatly to the fact that this committee is one legislation committee in the parliament that presents a great many unanimous, all-party reports and perhaps sets an example for the future for the Senate. I congratulate him for it. I will get the opportunity tomorrow to make some comments about Senator Crane's other roles and the future.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-06-26,"—I would like to make a few comments on the report of the Rural and Regional and Transport Legislation Committee on the quota management control on Australian beef exports to the United States. Essentially I reiterate what Senator Cherry has said because his description of the problem was very adequate. His description of the problem was very apt because it is a shemozzle and one that probably could have been avoided through better management across the board. I think that the government and the minister have done what they could.  
I have not gone through the committee report because I have only just been given it. On the recommendations, the hardship quota needs to be seriously addressed. Over and above that, we seriously have to address the issue of having quota restrictions at all with the US. When we are talking about having a free trade agreement, if we cannot get to the point where we can sort out some of these matters, it does not bode too well for an agreement that will be of any consequence or use to the agricultural industry in this country. I support the committee's recommendations. I think that under the circumstances they did a reasonably good job. The outcome is not the best, but it is probably the best of what was a rather difficult set of circumstances for everybody. There would have been potential job losses no matter what happened. Of course there will be some wind-back at some of the meat producers, but I think that will be the consequence of something that was poorly managed by all concerned.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-06-26,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present a report concerning the 46th report entitled Treaties tabled in March 2002, which was tabled in the Senate on 24 June 2002. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted. 
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On Monday, 24 June I presented a report to the Senate which contained the results of an inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into a protocol to the double taxation agreement with the United States of America tabled in the parliament on 12 March 2002. As a result of the committee's scrutiny of this treaty, the committee declined to support binding treaty action on the protocol pending the receipt of further information from Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office concerning its benefit to Australia.
The purpose of the double taxation agreements, commonly known as DTAs, is to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, but their wider function is to facilitate investment, trade, movement of technology and movement of persons between countries. The reduction or elimination of double taxation caused by overlapping tax jurisdictions is a key aim for Australia in the development of a network of bilateral income tax treaties. By separating the parties' taxing powers and, in certain circumstances, by giving credit for the payment of tax in the other countries these arrangements seek to prevent the double taxation of income received by a resident in one country from their activities conducted in the other.
Australia has a network of double taxation agreements that include countries like Romania, South Africa, Vietnam and Malaysia. This type of agreement is also widely used to develop and strengthen bilateral relationships between countries particularly in commercial areas. DTAs provide certainty to Australian enterprises trading in these countries and offer protection regarding the level of taxation on investments abroad which may, for instance, be valued by business when deciding on the location of a regional headquarters.
Since its inception the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has reviewed a number of these treaties and has several times expressed concern about the quality of the national interest analysis and, in particular, the lack of information on the costs and benefits of these agreements. Committee report No. 28 scrutinised two double taxation agreements, one with Argentina and another with the Slovak Republic. We covered in some detail the difficulties the ATO had in quantifying the economic benefits of these agreements. The committee noted in that report on the ATO's evidence at that time `that a search of the literature on the development of modelling processes which could more accurately measure the success of DTAs, had not been rewarding'. We also accepted evidence that an OECD working party had concluded that very little empirical work had been done on the impact of DTAs on the investment flows between countries because of the difficulty of obtaining adequate data. In that report, we concluded that, while the difficulties highlighted by the ATO in developing accurate methods of forecasting the costs and benefits of DTAs were real, they should be encouraged to explore all avenues to develop methods which could more effectively measure the impact of these agreements. 
In our review of the protocol to the United States double taxation agreement, on the one hand the committee was once again faced with the problem of accepting that major Australian companies have for many years raised concerns about the lack of competitiveness of Australia's tax treaty with the United States of America. These companies had suggested that the reduction in withholding tax rates made by the protocol, particularly on non-portfolio dividends, would be welcome. On the other hand, the committee was faced with agreeing to support binding treaty action on an agreement which would lead to a fairly clear loss of revenue of some $190 million to Australia. This support would have to be made without any qualitative evidence of the benefits to justify that decision. The committee therefore withheld its support for the agreement until the ATO and Treasury were able to provide additional evidence justifying such action to the committee. We also recommended:
The Australian Taxation Office, in consultation with the Australian Treasury and other interested parties, take immediate action to develop an effective methodology to quantify the economic benefits of double taxation agreements and that the ATO report back to the Committee on the methodology developed before the Committee is required to recommend action on further double taxation agreements.
Since tabling the committee's report on this agreement earlier this week, the committee has received additional evidence from Treasury confirming the benefits of the agreement to Australia and has resolved to recommend that binding treaty action should now be taken on this treaty. To this end, the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has made a statement to the House of Representatives today indicating the committee's changed position concerning this treaty. I seek leave to table a copy of that statement by Ms Julie Bishop for the information of the Senate.

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,23,2,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—When the committee was dealing with this amendment before question time, we had, in my view, a very hypocritical contribution from the minister. I think it is important to briefly indicate to the committee that we should get a few things straight. The government's original proposal for dealing with terrorist organisations required no proof that an organisation was a terrorist organisation other than the say-so of the Attorney-General or some other government minister he cared to nominate. It was up to just one person to say so: a minister in the government. Of course, like all politicians— and I do not direct this at the current government; I say this of all politicians—he has a domestic political agenda. That was the proposal contained within the government's bill introduced some weeks ago. We were concerned that the government proposal was that the Attorney-General could delegate this power to any other minister. My colleagues, particularly Senator Ray, have talked about having such a power in the hands of ministers like former minister Peter Reith, for example—
—He is the master of mendacity.
—the master of mendacity—or in the hands of current minister Mr Tony Abbott.
—Master of nothing.
—Master of nothing, but—
—No-one will reflect upon members of either this or the other place, thank you.
—No. Both assessments are very objective, in my view. The committee must recognise how slipshod the legislation was. A minister could be given evidence that did not need to be tested or challenged, ban an organisation and then prosecute its members. It was that simple; it was that open to abuse—and that is the proposition that Senator Ellison and his colleagues were supporting. That was the government's original proposal. That is the proposal that the government expected us to tick through and accept with literally no scrutiny at all. That was the proposal rammed through the House of Representatives the day after being introduced.
Before question time, Senator Ellison was getting worked up about proof of whether an organisation is a terrorist organisation and whether someone is a member. How quickly a minister can change his spots. What an extraordinary change has occurred in the few weeks since this bill was originally introduced. Given the nature of the government's original bill, under which a court would have had no role at all in determining whether an organisation was a terrorist organisation, how hypocritical it is for the minister to be so righteously defending the role the court will play now that amendments have been forced on the government. Amendments have been forced on the government. They did not want to amend it; they have been forced to do it because of the scrutiny we have applied to these bills. How hypocritical it is for the minister now to so stoutly defend the role of the courts. The truth is that giving the courts the principal role in determining the nature of an organisation was a proposal that came from the opposition. I proposed it to the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, and it is very hard to stomach the sort of hypocrisy we heard this morning.  
—It is a government amendment.
—Senator Ellison really should reflect on what he and his government originally intended. Arbitrary banning of organisations was the government's model, and the government wanted that model up really badly. A consequence of that model would have been the prosecution of those members of organisations listed by the Attorney-General. We said, and we still say, that such a system is open to abuse for domestic political purposes. That is its weakness: pure and simple, it is open to political abuse.
We know how disposed governments, particularly conservative governments, have been to use executive powers to ban organisations. That is one of the reasons that Labor has been so steadfast in its opposition to the government's executive proscription proposal. I acknowledge that Labor has been successful in ensuring that we do not have an executive proscription regime. I acknowledge that the government has put up the white flag on that issue. I do not want to be churlish about that. We welcome the fact that the government has changed its position. But do not come in here pretending that that was what you wanted to do. You were forced to change your position by the weight of numbers and the weight of community opinion. That brings us back to the amended bill—
—If it is such a good idea, why are you not supporting it? It was never your idea; it is a government amendment.
—That was not in the bill, and you know it, Senator Ellison. You had one proposal and that proposal was an executive proscription regime. You were forced to change that bill because of the Senate committee's report, because of the weight of community opinion and because the opposition, minor party and Independent senators would not have allowed such a draconian measure to pass this chamber. Everybody knows that. Do not deny it, because we do not want to hear another hypocritical speech from you on this issue. Everyone knows what the situation is. Everyone knows how the Attorney-General has had to back down over a series of weeks, but if you want a history lesson on it you will get it.
—You're just weak.
—Order!
—The opposition does have a number of concerns about the definition of membership as set out in the existing proposed division 102 of the bill. It states:
member of an organisation includes:
	(a)	a person who is an informal member of the organisation; and
	(b)	a person who has taken steps to become a member of the organisation; and
	(c)	in the case of an organisation that is a body corporate—a director or an officer of the body corporate.
The definition of `member' has been left in this vague form by the government, I think quite deliberately, as they wanted maximum flexibility when prosecuting membership offences. That is what it was all about. It is worth noting that I have been told by legal experts, and I certainly do not claim to be one—
—It's good that you got some advice!
—I am not a lawyer; I do not pretend to be a lawyer. It is a pity you did not get some advice when you were drafting the bill. That would have been a lot more helpful to everyone concerned because maybe we would not have had to have this sort of committee stage debate had some decent advice be given to the government. Perhaps you just let politics get in the way. Perhaps you let the attempt to wedge the opposition get in the way. The advice I received is that it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that when doubt exists as to exactly what words or terms mean in legislation the benefit of that doubt is always given to the accused. So the definition that the government is hanging on to may well cause more problems than it solves.  
The Labor Party has proposed a much better and much tighter form of words to capture those individuals who might assist terrorist organisations. Our wording would mean that someone who `demonstrates a willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act would commit an offence'. That offence would apply to all people assisting terrorist organisations, whether they be assisting those listed by the United Nations Security Council or assisting those found to be terrorist organisations by a court in Australia. The reason Labor has left the less precise membership offence in place is so that it will automatically be an offence for anyone to be a member of a terrorist organisation listed by the United Nations Security Council.
Members of international groups like Al-Qaeda, or their associated entities, have been painstakingly exposed by police and security organisations right across the international community, and listed by the United Nations. These are organisations that have been formally and publicly identified by the international community as terrorist organisations. Surely no-one would argue about that. There is no ambiguity and there is no uncertainty about the status of those organisations. Their membership, in whatever context, should be accepted as an offence in Australia, as it is accepted by other countries. They should be pursued and they should be prosecuted.
Let us not forget that we are at war with Al-Qaeda, but for all other groups, groups that are not listed by the UN Security Council, we think the offence of demonstrating a willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act is appropriate. That offence will pick up only active members. It will also pick up the sleepers— that is, those who are waiting for some signal to commit terrorist acts. That is a real issue in relation to the activities of modern terrorist organisations. That is not an area properly dealt with under the government's proposed offence regime—before it is appropriately amended by the Labor Party. We say Labor's approach will cover all of our bases. You will get the members of Al-Qaeda and its associated entities, and there is a focused membership offence that will make prosecutions more likely to be successful. This, again, targets the terrorists. This is a responsible and tough approach in relation to the terrorists, but also ensures that we protect important liberties and freedoms in this country. Again, it is a demonstration that Labor has got the balance right—something this government was incapable of achieving.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-06-26,"—Earlier today I raised with the minister the constitutionality of the proscription regime in whatever form it emerges out of the Senate. The minister at the table indicated that he would take the matter up with the Attorney-General and give us a response. My question is first of all whether that process is under way yet and whether there is a response. There is also a supplementary question: in order for us to get an idea surrounding this matter could the minister indicate whether the advice was provided by—I may not have the terms right because they do change their names—the Australian Government Solicitor's office or provided by the Solicitor-General? Or, indeed, whether the government commissioned outside advice on this particular matter and whether it sought only one advice or was able to get more than one advice on this particular matter to reassure itself. I would ask for an indication on those matters from the minister.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—I think it was the Government Solicitor's office but as to who it was I will take that further. The matter has been taken up with the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is not prepared to table the legal advice, in accordance with standard practice, but would draw to the attention of the Senate two key features of the provisions that underpin the validity of the area mentioned by Senator Ray. Firstly, there is an express constitutional nexus provision that ties the offences to the Commonwealth's legislative powers. The operative effect of a terrorist organisation's definition is in the use of this term in the offences. Secondly, the express requirement for the Attorney-General to have had evidence of a terrorist connection means that in all cases there will be evidence capable of being tested in a court. This makes it clear that no Communist Party type issue arises. There is simply no issue of deeming an organisation to have a particular character, because evidence has to be involved in each case. It also should be noted that the constitutional basis is the same as that relied upon for listing under the United Nations listing provision, which the opposition supports. The government therefore is of a view that the provisions have a firm constitutional basis. 
The second point made by the Attorney is an important one: that this is not a Communist Party type issue. It is not a deeming issue, because the proposed legislation requires evidence to be taken into account, and that evidence can then be the subject of a review. And, of course, what the government is saying is that to have the same listing power with a United Nations starting point is much the same mechanism as if you had the Attorney-General as the starting point. The listing power, we believe, relies on the same base. The Attorney has provided that information to me, but I will confirm the question of which office provided the advice.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I thank the minister for at least explaining to the committee why he believes there is a constitutional basis; I think that advances us just a little. But the way ministers approach the tabling of legal advice is so disingenuous. We have been dealing as equitably as we can with Senator Scullion and with his difficulties that he drew to the attention of the Senate. The advice from Mr Burmester, which is favourable to him, was of course forwarded to us posthaste. I am not going to revisit the issue of the misuse and abuse of the electoral roll, which was potentially the biggest at least mass criminal act to be committed in this country, that we prevented. The government was very happy then to put the Solicitor-General's advice down to justify a 180-degree change in course. I could go back and cite many other examples.
I do not assert that governments are honour bound to produce legal advice given to them and table it in this chamber. I do say— and it should be very helpful to this committee, to government as a whole and to this chamber—that where it is advice as to constitutionality governments should always table it. It is all very well to quote to us a couple of sections. Why should we now be suspicious that some part of this legal advice creates some doubts that we would need to explore? When you will not table advice on a constitutional issue, it always does. You give us a couple of reasons—and I do not doubt your reasons and I thank you for putting them before the committee—but I wonder if there is not some caution in that legal advice that this committee would need to know about. I suppose you could say we could go off and commission our own legal advice, but we do not have the resources to do that. I will finish on this point: I think a major distinction can be made, in terms of tabling legal advice, between advice that pertains to constitutionality and advice that pertains to the other elements of government.
By the way, it was the coalition that demanded back in 1995, I think it was, that every piece of legal advice that was given to the then government pertaining to Dr Carmen Lawrence's legal case—a case that was yet to proceed—be tabled. That is, they got the entire case so some other solicitors could see it. That is how far they went. We would never go that far. The government assert that this is constitutional, and they have put down a couple of grounds which seem to me, on the face of it, quite reasonable. But why won't they table the advice? They do table advice probably 10 or 15 times a year; always when it backs up their position. 
—When it suits them.
—They do it when it suits them and when it backs up their position. Therefore, there is precedent. The only time I suspect they do not table advice in these matters is when there is some qualification or areas of doubt that could be explored. I do not think that is good enough. When the government gets advice on the constitutionality of legislation that we are expected to assess and pass, we should see that legal advice.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-06-26,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (8) and (9) on sheet 2555:
(8)	Government amendment (17), after paragraph (1)(c), insert;
	(d)	did not take all reasonable steps to cease to be a member of the organisation as soon as practicable after the person knew that the organisation was a terrorist organisation.
(9)	Government amendment (17), omit subsection (2).
These amendments go to the heart of `onus of proof', a key issue which came to the fore during the debates, discussions and inquiries held by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The other key issues were the proscription powers, which we have debated at length—I am sure there will be more discussion on that—and also the notion of how we define terrorism. The amendments which I am moving here address a further onus of proof issue, this time relating to the offence of membership of a terrorist organisation. I have already indicated that the Democrats do not believe that membership, in and of itself, ought to be criminalised. We believe rather that people should be punished for their actions, not for whether they belong to organisations and associate with them—a point that Senator Cooney made earlier.
I was struck by the parallel debate which is happening in my home state in the West Australian parliament—I am not sure where that debate is at, having been out of the state for a couple of weeks. There is a move in that state to try and proscribe—that would not be the word that Premier Gallop would use—bikie gangs or motorcycle gangs as being criminal and to have membership of those gangs deemed to be criminal. It has been interesting to see the public debate around how you would use those definitions. The strong argument which is being put, interestingly from both the left and the right in my home state, is that it ought to be the behaviour and the actions of people involved in particular organisations that should be subject to criminal sanction, not the organisation itself. 
The government amendment sets out, as a defence for members, taking all reasonable steps to cease to be a member of the organisation as soon as practicable after the person knows that the organisation is a terrorist organisation. However, the defendant bears the legal, as opposed to the evidential, burden in relation to showing that they took steps to cease being a member and stop being involved. This is the highest standard of proof that can be imposed on a criminal defendant. I think the definition of `member' including `informal member' or `person who has taken steps to become a member' is particularly onerous. The person may not even be a member, but the law will require them to prove to the civil standard of proof that they quit the organisation.
It is very difficult to see how a defendant would be in a position to do this, in many cases. He or she might simply resign by telling someone verbally, particularly in the case of informal members. How can a defendant be expected to be in a position to prove that in all cases and in all circumstances? At the most, I think the defendant should bear an evidential burden in this matter. These Democrats amendments restructure the offences so that the onus is on the state to show that the person did not cease their membership. In practice, this will often require the prosecution to show that the person continued to play a role in the organisation after they found out that it was a terrorist organisation. So, if the state has no evidence to show that the person continued to be involved with the organisation once they discovered it was a terrorist organisation, there is no basis for sending them to jail. These two amendments give effect to that principle, and I commend them to the committee.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—For the record, the government opposes these amendments and believes that the proposal that ceasing to be a member be provided as a defence is the way to go. You do not incorporate it as an element of the offence, which has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution. This accords with other legislation and provisions where you make something a defence where the relevant information is easily available to the defendant but not available to the prosecution, and in this particular instance the prosecution would not have the personal knowledge that the defendant would have. We believe that, where a person is a member of an organisation knowing that it is a terrorist organisation, it is reasonable to expect that they bring forth information or evidence of how and when they ceased to be a member, if they want to raise that defence. We believe that incorporating the ceasing to be a member aspect in the offence itself as an element—which these amendments would do—would create an untenable position for the prosecution, or certainly a very difficult one. So, in accordance with the practice in other areas of the criminal jurisdiction, we believe that it should remain as a defence— that is, the cessation of membership of the member concerned should be raised as a defence by that person.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech

	(1)	This section applies if, in a prosecution for an offence (the prosecuted offence) against a subsection of a section of this Division, the trier of fact is not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of the offence, but is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of an offence (the alternative offence) against another subsection of that section.
	(2)	The trier of fact may find the defendant not guilty of the prosecuted offence but guilty of the alternative offence, so long as the defendant has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to that finding of guilt.

5  Application
For the purpose of making regulations specifying an organisation for the purposes of paragraph (c) of the definition of terrorist organisation in section 102.1 of the Criminal Code, it does not matter whether the relevant decision of the Security Council of the United Nations was made before or after the commencement of this item.
Government amendments (15), (18) and (19) are consequential on the replacement of the proscribed organisations provisions in division 102 with a range of offences relating to terrorist organisations. It is really consequential on what we have just done. Amendment (15) would replace the existing heading to proposed division 102 entitled `Proscribed organisations' with a new heading `Terrorist organisations'. Amendment (18) gives the offences broad geographical jurisdiction and provides for alternative verdicts in line with the other terrorism offences. Government amendment (19) removes the transitional provision relating to proscribed organisations and substitutes a new transitional provision relating to terrorist organisations. The transitional provision makes it clear that regulations could be made specifying an organisation for the purpose of paragraph (c) of the definition of `terrorist organisation' regardless of whether the Security Council decision relating to the organisation was made before or after the commencement of the terrorist organisations provisions.
What we have here are really consequential amendments to the proscribed organisations which we had with the old division 102, which is now being replaced with a new division that deals with terrorist organisations. The government believes these are essential for the efficacy of the working of the new division 102. 
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
 (Senator Hogg)—The committee is considering government amendments (15), (18) and (19) on sheet DT340. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.
Question agreed to.
—We now move to government amendment (12) on sheet DT340. The question is that section 101.3 stand as printed.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—The government opposes section 101.3 in the following terms:
(12)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 10 (lines 22 to 31), section 101.3 to be opposed.
This amendment is consequential on the replacement of the proscribed organisation provisions in section 102 with a range of offences relating to terrorist organisations. Government amendment (12) removes the offence of directing a terrorist organisation in proposed section 101.3, as the new terrorist organisations offences in section 102 would cover directing the activities of a terrorist organisation. Therefore, in view of that amendment, the government will be opposing the call that section 101.3 stand as printed.
Question negatived.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I move opposition amendment (12) on sheet 2503:
(12)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 15, (after line 18), at the end of division 102, add:
102.8  Demonstrating willingness to assist a terrorist organisation
		A person commits an offence if the person demonstrates a willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act.
Penalty:  Imprisonment for 15 years.
I think the minister made the point some time earlier in the debate that there has been a considerable amount of canvassing of this particular amendment already. I think that was probably a fair point to make, and no doubt my colleagues in the chamber would say that there is no need for a long speech from me in relation to this particular amendment. There will be a lot of relief around the chamber when I say that I agree with them. But I want to very quickly put the case to the committee because I do believe this is an important amendment.
This amendment has the effect of criminalising active assistance by people in a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act. We say that that is an appropriate threshold for a membership style offence for all other groups who are not listed as international terrorist organisations by the United Nations Security Council. I have indicated that we have a strong objection to criminalising membership per se; I think everyone in this chamber is aware of that. I have indicated that the only exception to that is membership of organisations declared to be terrorist organisations by the United Nations Security Council. We have taken the view that if the international community, speaking through the United Nations Security Council, declares an organisation to be a terrorist organisation, we do accept membership of that organisation being a criminal offence. In all other cases, the opposition believes that the appropriate threshold for an offence of membership is demonstrated willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act.
We have argued that these words should be included as an offence, maintaining a distinction between active involvement and passive membership, and I have indicated that this would apply to organisations found to be terrorist organisations by either Australian courts or the United Nations Security Council. I am aware that not only I but also other senators in the chamber have effectively spoken at length about these provisions. I apologise to the committee for outlining the case again—as briefly as I could—but, even though the issues have been canvassed, given the significance of the amendment I just wanted to place those few comments on the record.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—The Greens oppose this amendment. In fact, I find it quite extraordinary that the opposition is putting forward an amendment which would allow a person to be indicted through demonstrating `a willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act'. Presumably, if one were in a conversation at a coffee shop and said, `I am willing to do such a thing,' you would have demonstrated it. There is a wide range of things that could be seen as exhibiting a willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act, nevertheless, without either assisting or committing a terrorist act. This amendment in fact throws the net far wider and is open to an interpretation which is quite extraordinary when you think about it.
I have been given a premise review of the new film Minority Report by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Cruise.
—I would like to read it if you would like to table it.
—I have my $11 saved up. Here is the premise:
In the Washington DC of 2054, murders can be prevented before they are committed, by the use of three Pre-cogs. These are psychics who bear witness to the violent crimes before they are committed. Once the identity of the victim and perpetrator are known, it is then up to Detective John Anderton and his team of Pre-crime law enforcement officers to stop the killing before it can begin. But, just as the future of Pre-crime is about to be decided, Anderton is shocked to discover that he has become the next murderer the Pre-cogs see. So now on the run from his former partners, the Chief Officer of Pre-crime must try and uncover if his sealed minority report contains a different prediction about his future destiny or if he is slated to kill a stranger inside of 36 hours.
The film highlights the dangers of attempting to pinpoint people for crimes they might commit in the future and the dangers of a pre-emptive police state. That is what this legislation is about: if you demonstrate a willingness to do something, you are in.
I remember, quite a few years ago, two what I thought were dastardly people with machine guns robbing a jewellery shop in downtown Melbourne and getting away with a huge amount of money. There was a survey in one of the quality Melbourne broadsheets the next day which found that half the people admired these gangsters for the success of their robbery. I have no doubt that amongst that half of the survey were a good number of people who would be willing, if asked, to take part in such an event if they could get away with it.
Are we really going to get into the realm of getting evidence together on whether somebody was willing to do something or other and indicting them with an offence? This is not to be taken lightly, because the penalty here is 15 years. Senator Faulkner says the person would need to have demonstrated active involvement—that is, taking part—in a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act. But it does not say `active involvement' here; it says `willingness'. They are very different things. Willingness very much includes the alternative of passive involvement. It can involve expressing an opinion, no more, no less. It depends on how seriously people take that opinion. I think all of us, if we think back, can remember a time when we were willing to do something or other that we later regretted and, in fact, did not get caught in that escapade, whatever it might have been. The motivation for this amendment may have been good, but the amendment itself is appalling. We already have very strong measures in this legislation for nailing people who want to assist in the commission of a terrorist act. This one takes it far too far, and we will be opposing it.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I hear what Senator Brown says. I can make no comment about Steven Spielberg's film; I am not a film buff.
—Still saving for your $11?
—No. I thought it was a very cunning trick from Senator Brown to give the film that publicity in the Senate. He thought he might actually get a ticket sent to him in the post, but I am on to him. If that happens I have no doubt that all senators, maybe Senator Ferris too, would be recipients. While I honestly cannot say whether the analogy Senator Brown draws is a good one or not, nevertheless the issue of willingness to facilitate a terrorist act is an important one. I say this to the committee: think no further than what happened on September 11 and how the operatives that organised that atrocity worked. There were operatives in the United States of America who may well have been in place for some time effectively waiting for some indication from a person directing terrorist activities to begin to engage in that sort of activity. 
One of the problems with the way terrorist organisations operate now is that operatives, activists, terrorists, can be in place literally not for days or weeks or months but maybe for years before they are given the word or the signal to engage in a terrorist act. I do think it is appropriate in that circumstance that this legislation has the capacity to deal with that sort of offence. As we look at this particular provision, I think we need to consider the recent experience of September 11. I do not know what the view of the government is in relation to this—Senator Ellison can tell us—but, as I understand it, the indications are that the government is likely to support this amendment. I would be interested in hearing it, given the contribution that Senator Brown made. 
We find ourselves in opposition, Senator Brown—we are not in government—and we do not have access to the level of briefing and material that the government does. With the recent experience of September 11, and given the way terrorist organisations are operating, or appear to have operated, can Senator Ellison say whether it is the view of the government that the legislation we in this chamber deal with has to accommodate those terrorists who may be primed to involve themselves, facilitate or participate in a terrorist act once they are effectively triggered to do so. 
This is not Steven Spielberg fiction; this appears to be a real issue given the recent experience of September 11. I would be very interested to hear the minister at the table comment on this and address the substantive issue of whether these are real concerns that are appropriate for this parliament to deal with. So perhaps Senator Ellison, as the minister at the table, might care to comment on those issues. It certainly seems to me, with my limited understanding—and of course most of us in the non-government parties are in this situation—of the way terrorist organisations now operate, that this is an important issue for us to deal with, and if we do not deal with it we may well have a significant loophole in the legislation that finally passes the parliament.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—The opposition's amendment would create a new offence of demonstrated willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act. The amendment states:
A person commits an offence if the person demonstrates a willingness to assist a terrorist organisation in the commission of a terrorist act.
Penalty: Imprisonment for 15 years.
The government amendments will make it an offence for a person to provide support to a terrorist organisation that would help the organisation engage in a terrorist act. The government believes that this amendment— its aim and the area it covers—is really dealt with in government amendments. But the government will not oppose the opposition's amendment here. I understand the motive that the opposition has in moving this amendment but the government would say that we think, in the provisions that we have, it is already an offence for a person to provide support for a terrorist organisation that would help that organisation to engage in a terrorist act. 
We believe the terminology does not capture any behaviour which is not already captured in the government's proposed legislation, that it really does not add anything, as such. We will not oppose it, however, because we want to see the legislation passed, and passed swiftly. On that basis, we will not be opposing the opposition amendment.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I hear what the minister says. Is the minister able to advise the committee that in his view the legislation deals adequately with the issue of `sleepers'? You understand what that term means—it is a bit of Australian vernacular but I cannot think of a better word to use. If the minister can give that commitment and assurance that that is more than adequately covered without the need for this opposition amendment, I will certainly be happy to consider his advice. ",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—I refer to 102.7 which is headed `Providing support to a terrorist organisation'. That lists the support that a person can give to a terrorist organisation and be found liable. It is outlined in some detail. It talks about intentional support. It says that it is an offence if a person intentionally provides to an organisation support or resources that would help the organisation engage in an activity described in paragraph (a) of the definition of a terrorist organisation in that division, and the organisation is a terrorist organisation, and the person knows that the organisation is a terrorist organisation. 
The government believes that would cover the field in relation to someone who wanted to stand back from the act of terrorism but give the support to the organisation. I think that covers the term `sleeper' that Senator Faulkner refers to. You can get a situation where there are terrorist organisations that have people giving support but not necessarily carrying out the act, and that is what Senator Faulkner is getting at with the `sleeper'—a person who is not engaged in the actual act itself, for instance, but provides resources, the wherewithal, to the organisation to carry out those terrorist acts.
—That is right, but what I am seeking from you is an assurance that there is no loophole. If you can give me that assurance there is no need to progress the amendment.
—What I want to put on the record is why the government is saying this. I can say that the government gives the Senate a clear commitment that there is no loophole in the government's legislation which would let someone like a `sleeper', as termed by Senator Faulkner, off the hook.

The effect of these amendments would be, if nothing else, to trigger a debate around the notion of a bill of rights or a charter of rights and freedoms. One of the key arguments or key points of reference that emerged during community debate and discussion and anxiety around the notion of antiterrorist laws, and the powers of ASIO attached to that, was the more fundamental question of what about the freedoms, rights and civil liberties of Australian citizens and how these bills affect those, and isn't it alarming that, as a nation, we do not have a bill of rights or a charter of rights? 
I had the privilege of speaking in Sydney to the Gilbert and Tobin public law facility only last Friday with the Attorney and shadow attorney on this very topic of a bill of rights, so I can probably anticipate that the government will not be supporting this amendment because the Attorney made it very clear that the government did not support a bill of rights or a charter of rights. The shadow attorney, Mr Robert McClelland, pointed out that a bill of rights was Labor Party policy but they were still discussing and debating how they might form that. I note that the Attorney actually took a few moments in his speech to be very critical of me for proposing that we even discuss, through an amendment, a bill or charter of rights within this legislation; he argued that that was an inappropriate forum. I think there is no better opportunity to discuss the fundamental question of a bill of rights than within this legislation, given the community anxiety around it. 
My party takes the view that if you believe strongly enough in a particular policy position, you should try and translate that into a private member's bill and table it. We have done that in our private member's bill, the Australian Democrats' Parliamentary Charter of Rights and Freedoms Bill 2001. It went through a long community consultation process and has been on the notice paper for almost a year. Quite simply, it is beyond our comprehension how anyone could reasonably oppose the concept of enshrined rights and responsibilities. It is worth noting that Australia is now the only common law country with no bill or charter of rights. Our proposed bill, represented here tonight through amendment, would do several things. It would establish a charter of rights or freedoms, facilitated by the Human Rights Commission and made accountable through reporting to parliament. Secondly, it would ensure entitlements to rights and freedoms without discrimination, with permissible limitations. Such areas of identity and status could include such things as equal protection before the law, the rights of minority groups, the right of participation in public life, freedom of expression, freedom of thought and conscience, freedom of religion or belief, the right to peaceful assembly, freedom of association, protection from arbitrary interference, the rights of the child, the rights of people in Australia and so on. The benefit of a charter of rights, as opposed to a bill of rights, is that parliament can determine those parameters.
A charter of rights is therefore an evolving process, an organic process, not set in concrete as much as a bill of rights. Although ultimately the Democrats would like to see Australia have a bill of rights, we acknowledge that would require a constitutional referendum. Given that, historically, all constitutional referendums have failed without bipartisan major party support, I think it is reasonable to conclude that that would not be successful. So this is the better starting point to introduce into Australian legislature the notion of a charter of rights. Overarching the entitlements that I have spoken of would be Article 1 of the charter which would ensure the entitlement to rights and freedoms without discrimination, ensuring that every person is entitled to equality before the law and to human rights and the fundamental freedoms set out in the charter without discrimination. That could be based on age, race, colour, sex, sexuality, transgender identity, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, mental or physical disability or other status.
This article would ensure also that men and women would have an equal right to the enjoyment of the human rights and freedoms set out in the charter. Article 2 of the charter ensures:
A right or freedom existing under, or recognised by, any other law shall not be taken to have been diminished or derogated from by reason only that the right or freedom is not set out in this Charter.
In other words, in jurisdictions around Australia where rights and freedoms were set in place by the states, for example, things could not go backwards. Article 3 provides for permissible limitations: 
(1)	The rights and freedoms set out in this Charter are subject only to such reasonable limitations prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.
(2)	A right or freedom set out in this Charter shall not be limited by any law to any greater extent than is permitted by the Covenant.
That is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Opposition to having a bill or a charter of rights in Australia is, in my experience, underpinned by the belief that democratic processes, current legislation, conventions, constitutional guarantees and the use of international law as a source of common law development provide for the adequate protection of fundamental human rights. The Constitution, for example, protects the rights to trial by jury for federal crimes and freedom of religion. The courts frequently uphold the basic rights of security and liberty of the person, the freedoms of assembly, association, speech and due process. We have federal legislation, such as the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, protecting certain rights. However, there is no one statute which lists the rights and freedoms of Australians and there is no guarantee that the rights we enjoy will be protected.
Of particular concern is the claim that Australia's Constitution embeds certain rights. In reality, section 41, which outlines the right to vote, for example, is arguably not currently in operation and section 80, which details the rights to trial by jury, only addresses federal crimes. The right to religious freedom, similarly, only guarantees federal protection. The Constitution was never intended to protect rights and freedoms, and the belief by some that a bill or charter of rights is unnecessary as they are implied in the Constitution is misguided. In fact, it was a conscious decision by the majority of delegates who drafted Australia's Constitution to omit a bill of rights. Its proposed inclusion had been debated at the constitutional conventions. It was, however, omitted as its provisions were contradictory to the discriminatory practices that were already in action against Indigenous Australians and immigrants from Asia. A bill of rights would not have been in line with the intended first acts of parliament, which were the beginnings of the White Australia policy.
I think Australian parliaments have often neglected the protection of human rights, particularly when laws that violated these rights were perceived as being popular with voters. This has resulted in an ongoing history of ill-treatment of minority groups in Australia and exposes the inadequacies of the current system of human rights protections. Failures of the parliamentary system and of common law to protect fundamental human rights in Australia include the ill-treatment of Aboriginal peoples, juveniles affected by mandatory sentencing laws, gay and lesbian citizens, same sex couples and asylum seekers. 
The failure of parliament to protect the human rights of all Australians has resulted at times in the intervention of the High Court, which has played an integral role in upholding rights and liberties in Australia. It has interpreted the Constitution in a manner that attempts to uphold traditional rights and liberties and has attempted to protect human rights via common law decisions. It should not, however, be the sole responsibility of the judiciary to recognise the importance of upholding human rights in Australia. The federal parliament has a greater role to play. It must also be acknowledged that the emphasis on using common law to protect rights fails to recognise that the High Court does not have a mandate to overturn legislation that violates international human rights agreements to which Australia is a party. The role of the High Court and Senate committees in determining whether a law violates provisions within a bill of rights will, however, be instrumental.
History teaches us that majorities do not always make just laws, particularly with regard to minority groups. It is therefore paramount that Australia has an all-encompassing statute that can be used to critique proposed laws and to stop the passage of unjust laws. Australia is now the only common law country that does not have a statement of its rights and freedoms. There is clearly not enough protection for basic rights within the current system. Canada instilled its bill of rights in 1982, New Zealand in 1990 and the UK just a few years ago in 1998. These countries have recognised the inherent failures of democracy and the common law system to protect and promote human rights.  
It is time for Australia to follow suit by legislation of a statutory bill of rights. This will enable parliament to refine and develop the statute, thereby creating a working balance between parliament and the role of the judiciary. This would not be a radical change, as parliament continually sets standards for government and the courts ensure compliance with these standards. In the long term, constitutional change might occur, but only once experience has been gained. A bill of rights would also help us address Australia's failure to uphold its international human rights obligations, which require that legislation be passed to recognise provisions within the treaties that are signed. Australia's failure to implement human rights into domestic law has resulted in some international condemnation. The UN Human Rights Committee concluded that human rights violations are occurring in Australia in several areas, including the mandatory sentencing of juveniles, Indigenous self-determination, native title and heritage protection, the stolen generations, the deportation of people risking summary execution and the mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals. 
There also needs to be an effective remedy for human rights violations in Australia, as there are limits on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's current complaints powers, and bodies in charge of protecting human rights have been subject to funding cuts. If this were to occur, Australia could more effectively monitor and remedy human rights violations and begin to rebuild our somewhat tarnished international reputation. This would also empower groups and individuals who have suffered or who are aggrieved, as they would have an effective avenue to challenge these violations and seek redress. 
I think that educating Australians about their rights is also an important function of a bill or charter of rights, as people would then be better able to critically evaluate the actions of government. It is also critical as most Australians enjoy their rights and freedoms to the extent that they exist and there is a lot of complacency and much is taken for granted. I think the majority in our community must understand that often the weak and vulnerable do not always have the opportunity to enjoy their basic rights and freedoms and to participate fully in society, and the Australian national ethos of a fair go for all must be legislated.
The present system in Australia affords no guarantee that governments will protect and promote human rights. Australian parliaments have no consistent protection of basic human rights. The Commonwealth should also be an example to other nations by legislating the human rights provisions within the international human rights conventions that it has ratified. At present, the rights of all people in Australian society are not inalienable and it is the duty of parliament to redress that.
In summary, as I said from the outset, one of the more peripheral but nonetheless very important and critical elements of this debate in terms of citizens' concerns about the rights and responsibilities of parliament in setting laws, laws which clearly infringe human rights or civil liberties—or may do—is the deep concern that there is no assurance and no protection with either a bill of rights or a charter of rights to ensure a limitation of potential government excess and redress to government excess where that may occur.
Interestingly, at a talk I contributed to last Friday that was attended by approximately 200 to 250 people, it was demonstrated to me—through that slice of the Sydney community—that there is a great passion for this, a strong feeling about this, as something we need to do. I accept that these amendments are unlikely to succeed tonight, but I do believe that we need to trigger the debate and I do believe that the major parties need to articulate clearly and unambiguously where they stand on this issue and why. I commend the amendments.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-26,"—The proposal that we have before us from Senator Greig is to insert into the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] a so-called parliamentary charter of rights and freedoms. I am surprised that Senator Greig is progressing these amendments in this way because it seems unusual to say the least. I am not going to suggest to Senator Greig that it is necessarily an arrogant way to deal with the issue, but it is certainly unusual to try and achieve this outcome by inserting such a parliamentary charter into this bill. 
In the view of the opposition, it is a bad attempt to restrict or balance the powers outlined in the legislation. It is also the opposition's view that attempting to advance a bill of rights in this way is actually counterproductive because people will see the Democrats' bill of rights as a limitation on law enforcement rather than protecting rights or promoting a greater culture of civil rights. As such, I am very doubtful it will achieve any good purpose. It seems to me to be extraordinarily undemocratic to impose a bill of rights in this way. It is very much a top-down approach and I note the Democrats have not always signed up to such an approach.
In the view of the Labor Party, any move towards a bill of rights ought to be developed with popular will and with consultation and involvement, not just by amending a bill relating to the security of the Commonwealth. I have to say that as a tactic I do not think it is a good one. That does not mean that the substantive issues raised by Senator Greig are not important issues—of course they are. The Labor Party has always taken the view that a bill of rights should focus on rights such as the right to education, to an adequate level of health care, to social security infrastructure, access to scientific advances and the like, but I think that using this tactic, this mechanism, to impose a so-called parliamentary charter of rights and freedoms leaves an awful lot to be desired. I do not say that from the point of view of the Labor Party being opposed to a bill of rights. That is not our position and I do not want there to be any uncertainty about that, but this is a device and, as a device, I do not think it is a very good one—in fact, I think it is a cynical one. I know the Democrats have flagged that they would use the debate on this legislation to propose this course of action. That is their entitlement, and I understand that, but I think the issues are too important to be dealt with in this way. This is a very undemocratic way of dealing with the issue of a bill of rights. It is almost absurd to be proposing a bill of rights in—
—In the committee stage.
—I think the minister is right about that: it is inappropriate in the committee stage of a bill relating to our security. I think that is worth some consideration on the part of the Democrats. But I suppose, at the end of the day, this is politics; that is fair enough. A lot of politics and tactics go on in this chamber, and we are all part of that from time to time—I certainly plead as guilty as the next person. But, in relation to this important package of legislation to deal with the threat of terrorism in our community and the real issue of international terrorism, I think this tactic is a bridge too far. It is for those reasons that the opposition will not be supporting this tactic and will not be voting for the Democrat amendments.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—The government will, of course, be opposing these amendments. A bill of rights requires public debate. It requires its own attention; it is not something that should be tacked onto a bill such as this and dealt with in such an ad hoc way. With due respect to the Democrats, the government considers that the way this has been done is not well considered; it has not given adequate opportunity for debate. It is the government's policy that there is not enough evidence to support the need for a bill of rights in Australia generally. So, for those reasons, the government opposes these amendments. I do not think I have to take it further than that. It is pretty simple to determine whether you want a bill of rights tacked on to this security bill. The government believes that this is entirely inappropriate and is not satisfied that there is a need for a bill of rights in any event.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—I had better even the score and make it two parties to two. I think that a bill of rights—and, indeed, in the Greens policies, responsibilities—is very important for our nation. The question that really arises here is, `How should it be promulgated?' The answer I have is, `Why hasn't it been, after 100 years in which both the Labor Party and the conservatives of various shades have been in office?' 
—That is a fair enough point, but don't you think there ought to be some community consultation on this?
—I think there would be community consultation on this if it were to pass here tonight.
—That is a very good response. They would hear about it, anyway.
—Notice would probably be taken. I have all my fingers crossed for it to be passed, but I think Senator Greig flagged at the outset that he was using this device to have the important matter of a bill of rights for Australia brought to the fore. Why not do so in a situation where the Democrats, like the Greens, have been concerned about the truncating of long-held rights in Australia by the very piece of legislation we are dealing with? So, in a way, this is a balancer. The extraordinary thing I have just heard, however, is this government saying that one of the reasons they will turn this down is because it requires public debate. Here is a government that is great at bringing pieces of legislation in here late at night and expecting them to get through that same night—in fact, trying to put them through the House of Representatives and then through here in the space of 24 hours. Remember the bill in the run-up to the last election?
—What about this one?
—Look at this bill; look at the whole stack of other bills that this government has tried to ram through this parliament. Thank goodness for the Senate. Even with occasional lapses by the opposition, the government has not been able to get away with it here. Now is an appropriate time to flag such an important move as this. The Greens totally support a bill of rights for Australia, but it should also go to the people of Australia through a referendum—I would rather see it go that way than through a legislative mechanism. But it is fair enough to raise this in the middle of debate about a bill which is a collage, a collection, of measures cutting the rights of organisations and individuals in Australia in the name of the hunt for terrorism, which is already very adequately dealt with under our criminal sanctions and legislation against criminality.

	(i)	the Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002;
	(ii)	the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Act 2002;
		the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002; and
I first turn to government amendment (20). This provides for a review of the provisions of the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002, the Border Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 and the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Bill 2002. Under this proposal, the operation, effectiveness and implications of the amendments made by the counterterrorism bills would be reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD three years after the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill receives royal assent. 
Government amendment (1) provides that the review provision commences once all the acts to be reviewed have received royal assent. The committee is required to report its comments and recommendations arising from the review to each house of the parliament and to the responsible minister. The committee has the power to hear and consider a full range of evidence that will be relevant to a review of this important legislation, including security information. The parliamentary joint committee has the appropriate resources and established procedures and is fully equipped to conduct such a review. The government believes that this is an appropriate way for this legislation to be reviewed. 
As I have said, we have in place the mechanism: a parliamentary joint committee has the resources, the wherewithal, to deal with a review of this sort and there are other committees of a similar nature which have access to security information so that they could conduct a comprehensive review. That would then give assurance to those who wanted a review that the review would be not only an appropriate one but an effective one. That would occur, as I said, three years after the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] and related bills receive royal assent. The opposition, I understand, has an amendment in relation to a further review and I think the Democrats have another amendment.

	(1)	The Attorney-General must cause a review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of amendments made by the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002, Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Act 2002, Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002 and Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Act 2002.
	(2)	The review must be undertaken as soon as practicable after the third anniversary of the commencement of the amendments.
	(3)	The review is to be undertaken by a committee consisting of:
	(a)	up to two persons appointed by the Attorney-General, one of whom must be a retired judicial officer who shall be the Chair of the Committee; and
	(b)	the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security; and
	(c)	the Privacy Commissioner; and
	(d)	the Human Rights Commissioner; and
	(e)	the Commonwealth Ombudsman; and
	(f)	two persons (who must hold a legal practicing certificate in an Australian jurisdiction) appointed by the Attorney-General on the nomination of the Law Council of Australia.
	(4)	The Attorney-General may reject a nomination made under sub-section (3)(f). If the Attorney-General rejects a nomination, the Law Council of Australia may nominate another person.
	(5)	The committee must provide for public submissions and public hearings as part of the review.
	(6)	The committee must, within six months of commencing the review, give the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD a written report of the review which includes an assessment of matters in subsection (1), and alternative approaches or mechanisms as appropriate. 
	(7)	The Attorney-General must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after its receipt by the Attorney-General.
	(8)	Before the copy of the report is tabled in Parliament, the Attorney-General may remove information from the copy of the report if the Attorney-General is satisfied on advice from the Director-General of Security or the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police that its inclusion may:
	(a)	endanger a person's safety; or
	(b)	prejudice an investigation or prosecution; or
	(c)	compromise the operational activities or methodologies of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Defence Signals Directorate or the Australian Federal Police.
	(9)	The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD must take account of the report of the review given to the Committee, when the Committee conducts its review under paragraph 29(1)(ba) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001.
I thank the committee and Senator Mackay for granting leave. This is an important amendment. Senators would be aware that the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002 as it was originally presented contained provisions for a review, by predominantly departmental representatives, of the amendments made by that one bill. I acknowledge that the initiative in relation to the financing of terrorism bill did have some merit, but I also want to be very clear and say to this committee that it is simply not good enough. The opposition is of the view that we need a significantly wider review. We need to broaden the review to include the operation of all the bills in this package.
The amendment that is being proposed by the Labor Party will ensure both public consultation and high-level representation on the review committee. The Labor amendment will ensure that the review is of all five bills in the package we are currently debating. It will ensure it is conducted by a genuinely independent committee of up to two persons appointed by the Attorney-General—one of whom must be a retired judicial officer, who shall be chair of the committee—the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Privacy Commissioner, the Human Rights Commissioner, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and two persons appointed by the Attorney-General on the nomination of the Law Council of Australia. The review that is proposed by the Labor Party of the five bills we are debating will have public submissions and hearings. It will be chaired by a retired judge. It will report to the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. It will commence after three years and report within a further six months.
This is a proposal for a thorough, independent, detailed review of all the legislation that the Senate is dealing with. In other words, the review that the Labor Party proposes will be a fair dinkum review. It will give the parliament and the community a timely audit of the impact and operation of these bills. This is absolutely necessary, and I commend the opposition's approach to the committee.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—The Greens support this amendment. As I said much earlier in the debate, we withdrew our similar amendment because the Labor Party's was better—in particular, the setting up of the review system with a retired judge chairing it. It is a better review option than that which we had earlier put forward and we support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—The government opposes this amendment and it does so for a number of reasons. Firstly, I have outlined the proposal by the government for a review by a parliamentary joint committee, and the government believes that that is a more than appropriate way of reviewing this legislation. Indeed, in other cases, equally important legislation has been reviewed in a similar manner. 
The government believes that with the opposition proposal you would have this committee of experts carrying out its review and reporting to the PJC, and the PJC then going over the same ground again, so you would have a duplication of work and a duplication of review. The situation also arises that such a committee of experts would not have the access to security information that the parliamentary joint committee would have. It is akin to the dilemma that Senator Ray mentioned earlier when he talked about the opposition disallowing regulations while perhaps not having full access to all the security information that would go to the consideration of disallowance of regulations for terrorist organisations. Similarly, we believe that an expert committee formed in this way would not have the wherewithal and the facility to access the information of the parliamentary joint committee. In any event, there would be duplication, because it would be attempting to look at much the same ground as the parliamentary joint committee. 
We do not see what this opposition amendment brings to the transparency and accountability of the legislation. A parliamentary joint committee is made up of members from all parties and covers the field of political thought. We have seen very good work done by our parliamentary joint committees, and I have no reason to doubt that a parliamentary joint committee reviewing this legislation would do as well in carrying out its responsibilities. It would give the Australian people the assurance that the legislation had been reviewed properly.

4  Cessation of operation of Act
This Act, unless sooner repealed, ceases to be in force at the end of 5 years after Royal Assent.
This quite simply is a sunset clause. I am conscious of the significant amendment just passed in relation to review, but I still think it is worthy that we give consideration to ensuring there is a sunset clause for cessation, which we advocate ought to take place five years after royal assent. That is, once in operation this bill—by then an act—would completely cease to be after five years and could then be subject to reintroduction, presumably following the very review that has just been accepted by the committee. I am aware that a similar sunset clause was moved, I think by Senator Brown, at the beginning of this debate and it was defeated, but I think it is worthy now, at the very end of the debate and discussion on at least the first bill, that we review that situation.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech

SUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM BILL 2002
Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—The Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002 is designed to prevent the movement of funds for the purposes of terrorist activity and to enhance the provision and exchange of financial transaction reports information. It will create an offence directed at those who provide or collect funds to facilitate terrorist activities. It will require cash dealers to report transactions that are suspected to be related to terrorist activities. It will enable AUSTRAC, the AFP and ASIO to disclose financial transaction reports information directly to foreign countries and foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Finally, it introduces higher penalty offences for providing assets to, or dealing in assets of, persons and entities engaged in terrorist activities. That was a brief outline of the bill, which deals with the more financial aspects of the war against terrorism. 
More particularly, the government has a number of amendments to move. I move government amendment (4):
(4)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (line 7), omit “integrity and”.
That amendment omits the words `integrity and' from the proposed heading to chapter 5 of the Criminal Code, which is entitled `The integrity and security of the Commonwealth', so that it would simply read `The security of the Commonwealth'. This amendment responds to concerns raised during the committee's consideration of the bill in relation to the ambiguity of the term `integrity'.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-26,"—I apologise, I got here as soon as I could. I wish to address some general questions at the commencement of the committee stage of this bill. I do not think I will detain the committee for long. I will commence by remarking favourably on the conduct of the debate to date, on the amendments that have been put and on the very hard work that has been put in by all concerned on all sides. I start with a congratulation to Senator Faulkner and his team of opponents to the worst aspects of the bill, to the Liberal members who fought gallantly in the back rooms to ameliorate the bill, to Senator Brown and especially to my colleague Senator Greig and his very small team of hard workers.
I wanted to wait until the first bill had been passed, because that bill—if it is accepted by the House of Representatives— will become law. The framework in which this next bill is to be considered is therefore an appropriate one for me to make these remarks within. I have for some time been concerned that the definitions of and the attitudes to terrorism seem to focus on what I would describe as non-state actors. If you are going to go down this route then criminals who offend against humanity, who deny democratic processes and who harm populations in the ways that have been discussed at length can be both from and not from the state.
As anyone with a knowledge of history will know—and I think Senator Ray is one with a very strong interest in history, and I acknowledge those people at the table with a historical interest—the greatest crimes against humanity have been committed by the state. Yesterday Senator Ray entertained us with a somewhat gloomy tale of Soviet communist Russia, and I reminded him that the authorities now believe that that state put to death 60 million of its own and other citizens. Right now, in this world we live in, there are states whose acts of terror against their own peoples are far worse than any of the acts done by Al-Qaeda or the Taliban in terms of the numbers of people killed, raped, burnt, maimed or terrorised. If any government in any democratic country were to start taking the high ground then they had better apply these principles without fear or favour against those who terrorise populations. 
I will sketch this background briefly, because it is a necessary background for the putting of my questions. We can all think of past and present regimes which would, I think, fall into the realm of state terrorists. In my youth, I opposed the Nationalist government of South Africa. I think there were political parties and perhaps governments in Australia who long supported that colonial and racist regime. I suspect that, if the original bill had been allowed to progress as it was presented—and thank goodness the Senate has had the wisdom to ameliorate that— under those terms of way back then, the government of the day would probably have proscribed me. Friends of mine were banned, detained without trial—does any of this sound familiar?—murdered, beaten up. I probably have, strangely enough, given the attention paid to student issues, one of the most dramatic student politician histories of this place. I do not often talk about these things, but I recall meeting people opposed to that apartheid regime who were being pursued by the security forces that were—in that peculiarly heavy-handed and humorous way—run under the acronym of BOSS, the Bureau of State Security.
I remember meeting them in the back rooms in the townships and on cold and wintry hillsides. It was a dangerous occupation. However, I was a foreigner in the land I was in, so in the end I was treated relatively well. They simply deported me. They followed me and my poor mother around endlessly, opened our mail, tapped our phones and watched our movements. Does any of this sound familiar with the bills we are dealing with? And what was I standing for? Was I blowing up people or attacking installations? No, I was advocating democracy, I was advocating black majority rule under a nonracial constitution that covered all the population; but at that time and at that place I was a minority. I was vilified and I was pursued, and I had some interesting experiences as a result of having those attitudes. No, I am not heroic about it—there were many like me. The point I make is that times change and that if you are going to address issues like these you have to make sure that the principles, the method and the manner by which you apply them are in fact consistent and constant and that you apply them fearlessly.
To return to my theme, I suggest to the government of Australia, in which there are many good people, and to future governments of Australia, which will include many good people, that you have to be as vigorous about state terrorists—state actors, if you like—as about nonstate actors, because people who shove people down wells, burst open their homes and deliberately engage in ethnic rape or who use the weapons of racism, terror and intimidation deserve the same treatment you intend to give to nonstate actors. I am not suggesting that Australia should become a vigilante nation and should rush off to other nations and haul people out of their beds and bring them over here to be tried—although I must say in the case of people like the Chilean that was probably an attractive prospect. But I am suggesting that, if somebody of that sort sets foot in this land, they do not warm themselves in Australian beds and drink cups of tea with the Queen at Commonwealth functions. That is what I am suggesting. I think, if you want to name a few regimes, past Indonesian regimes, present Burmese regimes and certainly present Zimbabwean regimes qualify for what I am saying to you.
I think it is appropriate to now say that, if under this Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill a terrorist act includes `intentionally intimidating the public or section of the public by an action or threat of action that is done or made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause that causes serious physical harm to a person or damage to property', surely it applies to someone who has killed tens of thousands of N'dbele, as an example, or to someone who has terrorised an entire population under a sham election process. 
A terrorist organisation is an organisation that is `directly or indirectly engaged in preparing, planning or assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act whether or not a terrorist act occurs'. I recognise the importance the legislation that has just moved through the Senate attaches to the issues of United Nations Security Council listings. I think the government has to consider state actors taking action that causes death or serious physical harm to a person in the advancement of a political objective with the intent of intimidating a section of the public. For example, the white nationalist apartheid regime attacking blacks I think would qualify under that—and they were racist—and I think the racist Mugabe regime equally qualifies under that. I think that arming militia groups or allowing them to carry out their activities against a civilian population, as is alleged with regard to Indonesia and East Timor, qualifies under that legislation. I think the public advocacy, as carried out by Mr Mugabe in his sham election, of mass terror qualifies under this legislation. 
So I hope, Minister, to put you on the spot by asking you whether, with respect to states that act in a way which the international community regard as abhorrent and have condemned, through either the Commonwealth or the United Nations or some other international body—so it is not a lynch mob or the opinion of one country—the government will accept that state actors, representatives of political parties and organisations that run other countries and their officials can, have and do commit terrorist acts which are far greater in extent and impact than those dreadful and much-to-be-condemned events that we saw in New York last year.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—There are two questions here: the question of terrorism and the question of crimes against humanity—genocide—and a variety of other acts. It is not uncommon in the course of human behaviour to have different categories of criminal behaviour. In fact, what we are talking about is at the extreme end of criminal behaviour of a human being. What we are talking about in these bills is what the government is doing to bring in measures to provide law enforcement with the response it needs for the security of this country.
Senator Murray raises a different issue, really, but certainly of equal, if not more, seriousness—that is, what other states do in the matter of crimes against their own citizens, crimes of genocide and other very serious acts which affront any decent human being. We are bringing forward a bill on the International Criminal Court which deals with things such as genocide, crimes against humanity and other serious acts. We believe these are best dealt with in the bill and by ratifying that statute, as we have indicated, action can be taken in that forum. With respect to terrorism, which is a threat to this country, we believe that this package of bills provides the legislative response. 
In the course of one week in this chamber, we will have dealt with all those different categories of human behaviour—ranging from terrorism to crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes—but we will have done it via two different pieces of legislation, if you like. We do not believe we should be dealing, in this particular package, with those aspects that Senator Murray has mentioned. Senator Murray has asked the government to pass an opinion as to which is worse—terrorism or these other crimes against humanity that he has mentioned. I think they can broadly be described as such—crimes against humanity. 
The government believes this legislation deals with such serious human behaviour that to draw comparisons between such extreme behaviour is not possible. The behaviour is so indescribably evil and wrong that comparisons do not get you anywhere. We believe this country has to respond in a civilised and appropriate fashion. We will deal with all of those aspects of human behaviour that Senator Murray has mentioned this very week in this chamber through this package of legislation and through the bill dealing with the International Criminal Court when it comes before us.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-26,"—I thank the minister for his answer. I appreciate that he and his government have condemned some of the activities and some of the states that I have run through. I use the Zimbabwean example because it is current and everyone knows my background there. I have a personal interest and I acknowledge that. However, I have assumed that under this legislation it is open to the government to determine that Mr bin Laden is a terrorist, that his organisation is a terrorist organisation and that if Mr bin Laden set foot in Australia you would arrest him and deal with him under the legislation. I would be shocked if you did not. If I assume that for a foreigner who committed a criminal act in another country, surely I can assume the same for Mr Mugabe and his regime—foreigners who have committed crimes in their own country.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—We are getting down to the legalities now of the definition of terrorism. I put away too quickly my bill dealing with that very definition from the last debate we had. We dealt with this very question as to what constitutes terrorism, and it was something which exercised very much the minds of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I suppose Senator Murray is inviting me to say whether a person such as Mr Mugabe is a terrorist or whether the actions of Mr Mugabe and his colleagues are capable of being determined as terrorist acts, rather than looking at them in the jurisdiction of an International Criminal Court, where complaints could be made that they have committed genocide. 
Senator Murray mentions the N'dbele, and that is a widely known matter of concern. I think it is a question of applying the circumstances to the definition in this legislative package. Of course, if someone does meet that their acts could be determined as terrorist acts in accordance with this legislation. I cannot deal with any hypothetical situation but, certainly, if there are people who are involved in terrorist acts within the jurisdiction of this legislation—we dealt with the geographical reach of this legislation earlier—there is no reason why they should not come within the ambit of this legislation. 
With respect to Mr Mugabe, I cannot pass judgment either way as to whether or not he or any person in Zimbabwe is guilty of terrorism in accordance with this legislation. I think the way of dealing with states that are intent on genocide or crimes against humanity is to deal with them in the forum of the International Criminal Court, which we are looking to set up.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-26,"—Thank you, Minister, for your answer. I am conscious of both the title and the intent of the security legislation that is before us. Perhaps I should draw the thread together as to why I am looking at this in this particular bill. This bill is the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002. It seems to me that one of the issues that attaches most to what I would describe as state actors is the finance issue. As we know, leaders of regimes which we abhor have always funnelled their money elsewhere.
I am not proposing that the Senate operate as a kangaroo court and here and now proscribe or determine who is or who is not a terrorist under this legislation. What I am suggesting is that throughout the debate Mr bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda organisation have been, quite rightly, used as typical examples of nonstate actors. I choose to use Mr Mugabe and the ZANU-PF political party as state actors because their crimes, like those of many other regimes, have been well documented. So really at the heart of my question is not whether this government is going to determine here and now or even in the near future that Mr Mugabe and ZANU-PF are state actors under the broad terrorism package but whether the government will contemplate the issue that state actors and nonstate actors both fall under the ambit of the legislation and contemplate their ability to address issues such as finance. I think I have clearly made my point; I do not think anyone is in any doubt as to my intent here.
Minister, I will conclude with a question which draws together the threads under this finance issue: would it be an offence for a person to fund a state actor that was a terrorist organisation, to train their troops, militia or other officials or, indeed, to simply park their money here until they used it elsewhere? I do know that the government has partly addressed this issue in another forum under the broad heading of smart sanctions. This is an issue which I think is germane. It is not just Zimbabwe. What if it were some country in Central America, Asia or Europe? What are we going to do about those sorts of clowns, criminals, racists, deviants and monsters—I suppose that is the best way to describe them—who populate the world stage in countries which are not democratic and do not observe the rule of law? Once you walk down this path of deciding on terrorism and how it should be dealt with, I simply say to you that you have to be consistent. So perhaps you could answer that question, Minister. Just to repeat the question: would it be an offence for a person to fund a state actor or to keep moneys in this country that may be regarded as funding a state actor which was regarded as a terrorist organisation to train their troops, militia or other officials? ",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—If the person were assisting a terrorist organisation as defined by the amendments which we passed in the previous bill, then that person would be guilty of an offence. In relation to the funding or freezing of funds, there is a different regime which is applicable to that. Schedule 3, clause 15 of the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002 states:
(1)	The Minister must list a person or entity under this section if the Minister is satisfied of the prescribed matters.
The bill then goes on to deal with what are prescribed matters. It says:
(5)	A matter must not be prescribed under subsection (2) or (4) unless the prescription of the matter would give effect to a decision that:
	(a) the Security Council has made under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; and
	(b) Article 25 of the Charter requires Australia to carry out; and
	(c) relates to terrorism and dealings with assets.
Then it goes on to talk about how that must be listed by notice in the Gazette and the asset or class of asset is also to be listed in the Gazette. So there are two aspects here to Senator Murray's question. In answer to the first aspect, if a person is involved in terrorist activity or is supporting a terrorist organisation—and it matters not whether that has some official recognition overseas or has official standing—then you have the offences which we have outlined of assisting a terrorist organisation and they could be liable. Secondly, you have the other provisions which deal with supporting terrorism, or being involved in terrorism for that matter, and the person could be liable. Thirdly, you have being a member of that terrorist organisation, if that was the case. So there is a range of human involvement which could be liable to criminal sanction in the scenario that Senator Murray has depicted. 
The issue of finances is dealt with by this bill, and I have referred to the provision which deals with the listing which must take place. That flows from prescribed matters which deal with the United Nations Security Council. The Security Council has already listed entities where funds can be frozen. I do not think that is the end of it, but I think that for some of the entities that Senator Murray is looking at—I use that expression rather broadly—there could well have to be a listing from the United Nations Security Council in order to meet the prescribed matters as outlined in this bill. If there is anything further to that, I will get back to the chamber, but I think that covers the question.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—by leave—I move government amendments (5) and (8) on sheet DT313:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (lines 6 to 12), omit the definition of terrorist act, substitute:
terrorist act means an action or threat of action where:
	(a)	the action falls within subsection (2) and does not fall within subsection (2A); and
	(b)	the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause; and 
	(c)	the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of:
	(i)	coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of the Commonwealth or a State, Territory or foreign country, or of part of a State, Territory or foreign country; or
	(ii)	intimidating the public or a section of the public.
(8)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (after line 28), after subsection (2), insert:
	(2A)	Action falls within this subsection if it:
	(a)	is advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action; and
	(b)	is not intended:
	(i)	to cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or
	(ii)	to cause a person's death; or
	(iii)	to endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the action; or
	(iv)	to create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.
These amendments relate to the definition of `terrorist act' and are identical to the amendments that were moved by the government in relation to the terrorist definition in the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. We went over that pretty comprehensively and I do not seek to detain the committee any further by going over that again. I simply move these amendments and rely on the arguments put previously by the government.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—We have opposed the government's approach to this right throughout this process. The Greens are totally opposed to this bill. We are aghast at it. It effectively gives the government the option of backdoor proscription of organisations by crushing them financially—removing their ability to raise funds, hold funds and bank, to engage in any financial activity, to transfer funds or to do a whole range of other things which many organisations engage in—without reference to the parliament. Effectively, we have here the executive capability to proscribe organisations and individuals in Australia that the executive thinks might be engaged in terrorist activities under the very wide-ranging definition of terrorism—which includes, in the sections that we are dealing with at the moment, `creating a serious risk to the health or safety of the public.' As I said earlier, that could apply to nurses who are on strike, at a picket, and beds have to be closed. It could apply to conservationists who are up trees and where the logging industry repeatedly says, `This is dastardly; it is creating a threat to life and limb in the forests.'
The government will be able to proscribe such organisations, domestic or otherwise and whether listed by the United Nations Security Council or otherwise. Those organisations will have no comeback; there is no redress on that, effectively. It is going to be very difficult, anyway, for organisations to be able to defend themselves in that situation. What is particularly unacceptable in a democracy is that the executive has the power to do that. It is very offensive that under proposed sections 15 and 18 of this piece of legislation the executive will be able to do that.
I would expect that the Labor Party would not have a bar of that. Is the Labor Party, the opposition, going to hand across to the executive, without reference to this parliament, the ability to proscribe organisations? The Greens have amendments here to prevent that from happening. If you are going to go to the extraordinary length of proscribing— that is, banning—an individual or a group in Australia then the parliament should be the watchdog on that. It should be by regulation. Both houses of parliament should have the option to investigate it and, if necessary, to refer to authority or to the public on the matter before the shutter goes down. But that does not happen under this legislation. The executive, a minister, without reference to the parliament, can ban people or organisations by freezing their assets, by putting them out of business, by removing their livelihood.
We ought not to be going down that path. There has been no demonstrable need for that to happen in this country without reference to the elected parliament. We are not in favour of proscribing organisations. We believe it drives them underground and simply makes them harder to track down. It makes the task of ensuring that they are watched and do not get to create terrorist acts more difficult. But that is the path that the government has taken. If the government wants to be able to proscribe organisations effectively by removing any financial wherewithal, let it not be left to the executive to do that. If you are going to name individuals and put them on a list which effectively totally demobilises them as members of society, removes their financial wherewithal and proscribes their ability to effectively exist in our society, do not leave it to the whim of the minister. But that is what this legislation does. It is draconian, unnecessary and dangerous. 
The problem is that the government has already—through a regulation that went through unspotted by us, unfortunately, last October—gained the power to do this without reference to this legislation anyway. Without a parliamentary debate, the government can proscribe organisations and individuals. Indeed it has done so, based on a United Nations list which comes not from the General Assembly but from the Security Council of the United Nations. There is a long list of organisations that have already been proscribed in Australia without public debate or reference to the parliament. I would have thought that many entities on this list—such as Al-Qaeda, which is at the top and, as far as we know, has not been functioning or financially capable in Australia—would have been proscribed very quickly by the parliament. Yet, this already long list of organisations is going to be added to. It is not restricted to the United Nations; the government and the minister are going to be able to add to that list without parliament being consulted.
We should not be allowing that to happen. This is where the opposition becomes the watchdog on democracy, where the opposition becomes the watchdog on civil and political rights. The opposition must become the watchdog on the excesses of the executive, and you do not become that watchdog by allowing legislation through like this. What we ought to be doing here tonight is overturning that regulation that got through, which has already allowed the government to proscribe organisations and individuals without reference to the parliament. Then we should be ensuring that in this legislation that right of proscription is not further enhanced, and in fact is abolished. This is the job of the Labor Party. Who is going to be listed next by the government? Will it be a union or a unionist? Will it be an environmental organisation or an environmentalist? We can all list a whole range of people, from the Shearers Strike right through to now, who could have and would have been proscribed by a government with these powers if it did not have an extraordinarily strong grip on itself, on the passage of events and on the nature of a free and open democracy. 
But that is not what this legislation does. It crosses a boundary into territory we have never seen before in this country. I will be interested to see what the Labor Party is going to do in ensuring that the extraordinarily big loophole—the tunnel—through which long-held rights in this country can flow at the whim of an executive government is closed. The Greens amendments would ensure that, and we will be seeking support for those amendments.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—It certainly takes it away from economic harm but it also takes it away from what you could describe as nervous shock. It would just make the definition too broad if you left the `physical' out of it. Physical harm is actually defined in the Criminal Code as follows:
Physical harm includes unconsciousness, pain, disfigurement, infection with a disease and any physical contact with a person that the person might reasonably object to in the circumstances whether or not the person was aware of it at the time. 
I would submit torture, albeit psychological, could involve unconsciousness, it could involve pain, it could involve physical contact which a person might not be aware of—the applying of light, the applying of heat, the applying of cold. The application of any of those mediums to a person could possibly come within the definition.

 (3)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (lines 29 to 34), omit subsection (3).
These amendments refer to the sections of the legislation which effectively mean that you can be labelled a terrorist if you are creating a risk to public health or safety or to an electronic system. We have had this debate at length. It is wide open to abuse by the executive. The executive must not, should not, should never have the ability to proscribe, through the removal of all financial rights, an organisation in Australia on the basis of these particular sections of the bill. To do so is to open up the threat of a whole range of community organisations, unions included, being proscribed by a heavy-handed government in the future. Certainly the Communist Party would have been proscribed under this provision back in the 1950s even though at a referendum, following a big debate in which both political parties in here supported the banning of the Communist Party, the people of Australia—with a vigorous campaign by then shadow attorney Dr Evatt— overturned the thought of banning the Communist Party.
There will be no qualms after this legislation—if it were to get through—passes: the ministry can do it without even referring to the parliament. You will not have to have a debate in here between the opposition and the government. People go on a list, organisations go on a list; the government says they are a serious threat to public heath and safety or they have seriously interfered with or disrupted an electronic system and, bang, they have got the grounds for proscribing an organisation. We oppose the legislation but we want to tighten up that ability. The Greens amendments remove those flimsy, wide open, manipulable components of this legislation so that the government would have to fall back on serious harm to a person, damage to property, endangering persons' lives— the things which the public recognise as being terrorism—if it is going to list and, through this backdoor mechanism, proscribe individuals or organisations as terrorists.

These amendments refer to the constitutional basis provision of 100.2. This is again the same as the argument I outlined in relation to a similar provision in the previous bill.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-06-26,"—I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 2556:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 7 (line 17), after “person”, omit “is reckless as to whether”, insert “intends or knows that”. 
This relates to recklessness, which we discussed in definitional terms a little earlier, only this time in the context of the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002. The amendment deals with the financing of terrorism and gives effect to one of the many recommendations of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Section 103.1 creates an offence of providing or collecting funds where the person who provides or collects them is reckless as to whether the funds will be used to facilitate or engage in a terrorist act. The penalty is imprisonment for life. The Law Council of Australia observed that:
The offence created by section 103.1 contains no requirement that the prosecution proved that a person charged had actual knowledge of circumstances indicating connection with a terrorist act or intended to provide funds to be used to facilitate or engage in a terrorist act. 
The Law Council also considered that, at the very least, the offence for financing terrorism should include a requirement of specific intent. It is noteworthy that the explanatory memorandum for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002 provides that section 103.1 implements article 2 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and paragraph 1(b) of United Nations Security Council resolution 1373. It draws on the language used in those international instruments. Article 2, paragraph 1 of the convention, however, contains a requirement of specific intention. It states:
1. Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part ...
The UN Security Council resolution 1373, paragraph 1(b), says:
Criminalize the wilful provision or collection, by any means, directly or indirectly, of funds by their nationals or in their territories—
and this is the key point—
with the intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in order to carry out terrorist acts;
Accordingly, both international instruments contain, unlike proposed section 103.1, a clear requirement of specific intent. The Senate committee recommended that the bill be amended so that the financing of terrorism include an element of intent. The government's amendment in response falls well short of this. 
The government has circulated amendments to insert a note in the section to clarify that the person must intentionally provide or collect the funds—that is, people who give people money by accident are not within the scope of the section. The real issue here is whether the person provided funds with the intention or the knowledge that the funds would be used to facilitate or engage in a terrorist act. However, the government intends to retain the current standard of recklessness, despite the criticism from eminent bodies such as the Law Council and the deliberations of the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. This Democrat amendment implements this committee recommendation by ensuring that we do include in the financing of terrorism offence a requirement that the person knew or intended that the funds would be used to facilitate or engage in a terrorist act.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—For the record, the government opposes this amendment. This amendment would replace the fault element of recklessness in the financing of terrorism offence with the fault elements of intention and knowledge. The application of recklessness to the circumstances that the funds are used to facilitate or engage in a terrorist act is in accordance with the general principles of the Criminal Code. The government believes this is essential and that the amendment as opposed by the Democrats would diminish the effect of this legislation. Therefore, the government opposes the amendment.

We believe the Greens amendment could result in the offence applying to completely innocent activity. For this very reason that the government opposes this amendment.

This amendment will include an explanatory note at the end of the financing of terrorism offence to indicate to readers of the legislation that the fault element of intention applies to the conduct of providing or collecting funds. The fault element of intention applies by virtue of section 5.6 of the Criminal Code which provides that, where a law creating an offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element of the offence, intention applies to physical elements consisting of conduct. This responds to recommendation 6 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report.

This would allow prosecution of people or proscription of organisations under this legislation for activities occurring overseas. The one incidental possibility out of this is that somewhere down the line a government with the gumption to respond to what Senator Murray was talking about earlier on could itself proscribe some of the thugs, the villains and the killers who are themselves in offices of power overseas so that if they came to Australia they could get arrested. I am talking about heads of state and others— Senator Murray named some of them—who ought to be arraigned as mega-terrorists when they come here.
I have terrible memories of the Ceausescu couple from Romania coming here and being entertained by, amongst others, Lang Hancock and co. They ought to have been locked up instead—it would have saved a lot of lives if they had. But I do not think that is the intention here because it would be enormously embarrassing to governments of either persuasion to have to scrutinise the activities of some of the heads of state, for example, who have shaken hands with John Howard over the last five years and to determine whether or not they fell into the category of terrorists under the definition most Australians would give to it.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-06-26,"—I look forward to next week's Newspoll to see how much closer the Democrats are to being in government. Senator Brown mentioned Mr and Mrs Ceausescu, and I remember that issue quite specifically. It would have been perhaps 1986 or 1987, maybe 1988, when I was a student and an elected member of the student guild of Murdoch University and we learnt that the Ceausescus were coming to Western Australia. They had expressed a keen interest in visiting a campus. It was mooted that they were going to tour Murdoch. I am pleased to say that I was one of those who discreetly ensured that that never happened—unless it did happen and I was unaware of it.
The question of extended geographical jurisdiction is an interesting one. I note, for example, that there is some similarity between this and the approach that both parties have taken on the child sexual abuse laws which were introduced in relation to child prostitutes in South-East Asia and so on. Better still is the question of what opportunities we have, if any, to detain and investigate those people who may set foot on our shores. I have covered that at great length in previous debates I have engaged in on antigenocide legislation and which we witnessed in part in terms of the issues surrounding Mr Kalejs, Mr Ozols and others.
It is interesting that Britain in fact detained Pinochet when he was in that country two if not three years ago—although ultimately he did return to Chile where he was then, it would seem, immune from further investigation. If we are serious about addressing the question of both terrorism and crimes against humanity, and I would argue that they are often interchangeable terms, then we must be empowered to seize people when they are on our shores. 
Minister, I wonder if the argument you have just presented in opposition to this amendment is not perhaps contradicted by the next step of the government, which is the ratification of the Rome Statute and participation in the International Criminal Court that, as I understand it, would to some degree give us those powers anyway. Perhaps you could enlighten us on that.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—We do not see any contradiction at all. What we are talking about here is terrorism. Of course domestic legislation in Australia has an extraterritorial application; we have seen that with child sex tourism and we have seen it with bribery of foreign officials. If we are to fight terrorism comprehensively, there should be this geographical reach. It does not contradict in any way the government's stand in relation to the International Criminal Court. There was some concern that it would work the other way: that the International Criminal Court would impinge upon the sovereignty of this country. We believe there is no breach of the sovereignty of Australia in the way that this is being proposed. Moreover, this legislation is all about the sovereignty of Australia. It is all about protecting Australia from terrorism as well as helping the international community fight terrorism.

Senator Brown has just criticised the government for being too arbitrary in its approach to this. I could not say, just willy-nilly, that a member of a corporation would be charged. I would have to have the facts before me in relation to whether the landmines were used in the course of terrorism—
—Are they ever used any other way?
—That very question that Senator Brown poses goes to the root of his own problem. The fact is that you cannot say, just on a hypothetical proposition, whether something would attract criminal sanction or not. A case would have to be made out that the person was involved with a terrorist organisation or in terrorist acts and that their activity was caught by this legislation.

I can confirm that these new obligations will not affect the current obligations on cash dealers to report transactions that they suspect are related to existing Commonwealth offences, including terrorism related offences. This is an important aspect of this bill. It provides the privacy safeguards that I think most Australians would want to see.

Repeal the subsection, substitute:
	(1B)	Despite paragraph (1)(b), the Director may only authorise under that paragraph one of the following law enforcement agencies if the agency undertakes that it will comply with the information privacy principles set out in section 14 of the Privacy Act 1988 in respect of FTR information obtained under the authorisation:
	(a)	the Crime and Misconduct Commission of Queensland;

9B  Saving of authorisations and undertakings
For the purposes of subsection 27(1B) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 as amended by this Schedule, neither of the following is affected by the amendments of that Act by this Schedule:
	(a)	an authorisation conferred on the Anti-Corruption Commission of Western Australia by the Director;
	(b)	an undertaking by that Commission to the Director.

Add:
	; and (j)	the Royal Commission (appointed by the Governor of Western Australia on 12 December 2001) into whether since 1 January 1985 there has been corrupt conduct or criminal conduct by any Western Australian police officer.
14D  Paragraphs 27(17)(k) to (m)
Repeal the paragraphs.
14E  Paragraphs 27(17)(t) and (u) (the paragraphs (t) and (u) inserted by item 7 of Schedule 6 to the Measures to Combat Serious and Organised Crime Act 2001)
Repeal the paragraphs.
14F  Before paragraph 27(17)(v)
Insert:
	(ua)	a Commissioner of the Crime and Misconduct Commission of Queensland; and
	(ub)	an Assistant Commissioner, Senior Officer or member of the staff of that Commission; and
14G  At the end of subsection 27(17)
Add:
	; and (x)	the person constituting the Royal Commission (appointed by the Governor of Western Australia on 12 December 2001) into whether since 1 January 1985 there has been corrupt conduct or criminal conduct by any Western Australian police officer; and
	(y)	a member of the staff of that Royal Commission.
These items will enable the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission and the Western Australian Royal Commission into Whether there has been any Corrupt or Criminal Conduct by Western Australian Police Officers to have access to financial transaction reports information. The inclusion of the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission reflects the fact that that body has replaced the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission and the Queensland Crime Commission, both of which had access to FTR information. Enabling the Western Australian royal commission to access FTR information for the purposes of investigating police corruption is consistent with the existing policy of the act, which provided for such access by the royal commission into the New South Wales police service. These amendments will require both the Crime and Misconduct Commission and the royal commission to undertake to comply with the information privacy principles in the Privacy Act 1988 with respect to FTR information. I believe that these amendments are quite straightforward. ",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—The government opposes schedule 2, part 2 in the following terms:
(18)	Schedule 2, Part 2, page 14 (line 2) to page 15 (line 30), to be opposed.
We are seeking to amend schedule 2 to the bill as introduced by removing part 2 of the schedule which provides for a review of the amendments to the FTR Act. The removal of part 2 is consequent upon the insertion into the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 of a general review mechanism covering the provisions of that bill, the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002, the Border Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 and the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Bill 2002.
Government amendment (12), which I will touch on now, would omit the heading to part 1 of schedule 2 as a consequence of the amendment removing the review provisions in part 2. By way of background, I can advise the chamber that the operation, effectiveness and implications of the amendments made by the counter-terrorism bills would be reviewed by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD three years after the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill receives royal assent. We have covered that in previous debate, and the opposition of course has amended that by adding another tier of review. The debate on that was lengthy and involved, and we do not need to revisit that.

	(ii)	their rights and obligations consequent on the listing.
This amendment, relating to the notification of listings, aims to gives effect to recommendation (7)(b) of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into these bills. The recommendation was: 
(b) once action has been taken to freeze an asset, the owner of assets must be advised in writing as soon as possible and their rights and obligations explained.
This legislation does not include that. The government has amendments which will allow it to make regulations—and we hope that it intends to regulate to pick up all of the relevant parts of that committee recommendation. However, we believe that this particular matter can be better addressed by legislation. It does not necessarily require regulation.

As stated by Senator Greig, this amendment would require the Minister for Foreign Affairs to notify the owner of an asset of the minister's intention to list the asset and of the owner's rights and obligations. In the normal course of events, that would be entirely appropriate, but we are not dealing with a normal course of events; we are dealing with the assets of a terrorist group, assets which are being used or could be used in acts of terrorism. The amendment would have the effect of giving advance notice of that listing to a terrorist organisation, thereby alerting that organisation and giving it the opportunity to take evasive action. We do not believe that that is appropriate in the circumstances. In other circumstances, of course a notice would be given to someone who owns property. But this is a very serious situation where you have the involvement of a terrorist organisation, and we do not believe that the normal niceties can apply.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—I move Australian Greens amendment (6) on sheet 2513 revised:
(6)	Schedule 3, item 1, page 17 (after line 21), after subsection 15(7), insert:
	(8)	A listing under subsections (1) and (3) must be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of the listing.
	(9)	A listing under subsections (1) and (3) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
In schedule 3, item 1 on page 17 in the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002, section 15 lists persons, entities and assets which the minister can list and proscribe. What we are doing with these amendments is giving the parliament the power to oversee what the minister does. After section 15(7), we would add subsections (8) and (9). This would enable parliament to look at and accept or reject a regulation which listed an organisation or an individual to be proscribed, in the same way that it has the power to reject hundreds of other matters that are dealt with through regulation. But this one is much more important than most of those hundreds of others. 
This is where parliament should be very closely watching the executive to ensure that it does not become excessive in its zeal to hunt down political opponents, community groups it disagrees with or individuals who it believes are going over the traces—but who are not terrorists under the ordinary test of the community's understanding of a terrorist as a person who creates bloodshed, destruction and terror through the committing of such crimes. This needs to be kept in mind. This government through this legislation is opening the way for a future minister to be able to proscribe, through the freezing of their assets, organisations or individuals who it believes create a threat to public health and safety or who it believes are threatening communications. We should not be allowing that. The Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens should not be allowing that. If we are going to allow it then for god's sake let us ensure that parliament vets this list.
I commend this amendment as strongly as I can to the opposition and indeed to the government, because it is an enormously important safeguard against the ability of government to bring down organisations and individuals that it disagrees with and who it says are interfering with public health or safety, for example. It is essential that parliament have an overview on that. It would be extraordinary for parliament to countermand the listing by the government of a terrorist organisation or a terrorist individual. Remember, these are not necessarily people who have committed an act of terrorism. It includes people who simply are members of an organisation. Are we really going to allow an executive outside parliament the power to do that? We are, if we do not accept and endorse these amendments. It is very, very important that the government, the opposition and the crossbenches do not allow a minister to not only freeze the assets of organisations and individuals in our democracy but freeze them into oblivion through that mechanism, without parliamentary overview. It is extremely important that we do not allow that to happen. At this juncture, because we are dealing with listings, I would also ask the government how it has come up with the current list that it has. Where did it get it from? Is it just a Security Council listing or is there more to it? ",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—It is important that the government puts its position on the record in relation to this, because it is an important aspect of the legislation. The government does oppose the amendment proposed by the Greens. Amendment (6) would enable the asset freeze listings to be disallowed by parliament. That is it put shortly. The government believes that this proposal is seriously flawed in a number of respects. 
I will, firstly, touch on the aspect of international obligations. The disallowance of asset freeze listings could place Australia in breach of our international obligations under UN Security Council resolution 1373 to freeze terrorist assets. Under this resolution Australia is obliged to freeze, without delay, funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit or attempt to commit terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts and of associated entities. If parliament disallows a listing made in accordance with Security Council resolution 1373, and terrorist assets are unfrozen, we will be in breach of this obligation. The relevant treaty obligation is found in article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations which provides that Security Council decisions are binding on members of the United Nations. Consequently, Australia is obliged to comply with Security Council resolution 1373. This is notwithstanding any conflict with domestic law resulting from the operation of a disallowable instrument.
This is far more than a legal or technical consideration. International cooperation in freezing terrorist assets has been a vital area of international cooperation to combat terrorism. For Australia to hedge on its commitment in this area would leave a gap in these international efforts that terrorists could exploit. Curbing the financial flows on which sophisticated terrorist activities rely is absolutely vital, and we should do nothing that would undermine this. The government's position on this issue is entirely consistent with the arguments it has put forward in other contexts. The content of Australian law is first and foremost a matter for the Australian parliament. How we implement our treaty obligations is a matter for the Australian parliament, and how we do that is a decision to be made taking into account our international treaty obligations and how they may be best met with regard to our national interest. Where those obligations are enshrined in domestic legislation, they are part of Australian law.
In this case, the government consider that compliance with our obligations relating to freezing of assets pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373 is a crucial contribution to the international efforts to combat terrorism. In our view, it is in Australia's interest to ensure that we have a strong domestic regime for meeting our obligations to freeze such assets and to ensure that we will not be placed in a situation where those obligations might be breached. Inserting a provision for disallowance will not, in itself, place us in breach of our international obligations. Rather, the act of disallowance would place us in breach if the listing had been properly made in line with our obligations. More importantly, that act of disallowance would prevent us from doing our part to support the efforts of the United Nations Security Council to combat terrorism and, in this case, terrorist financing. 
To support our involvement with the United Nations on the one hand and to support this amendment on the other would be the height of contradiction. On the one hand, it would be saying that we should do all we can to be a good UN citizen and to help the UN fight terrorism; on the other hand, it would be saying that we should cast our domestic legislation in terms which might prevent Australia doing just that in circumstances where the Security Council has specifically requested that member states freeze assets. The government's position is unequivocal: we will do what is necessary to play our part in the international effort to stamp out terrorism. We think that should be done in a way which fully gives effect to our international obligations.
The concerns I have highlighted are heightened by the inherent features of the disallowance process. It is not practical to place each named individual or entity on a separate list; there would be hundreds of lists being separately tabled. Yet if there were cumulative lists, disallowance relating to one individual or entity would disallow the entire list. Furthermore, terrorists would be tipped off and could take advantage of even the smallest gap between disallowance and remaking to move their assets offshore. Assets can be moved very easily, and any slight gap in the freezing scheme could be ruthlessly exploited by terrorists. Let me emphasise that asset freezing is subject to a whole series of safeguards in this bill, to which the government amendments will further add. It is ironic that the main reason these asset freezing provisions were included in the bill was to provide a more rigorous and accountable framework in primary legislation for something that was already permitted under regulation.
The safeguards included in the bill, as introduced, include the following. Proposed section 15 provides that regulations may be made specifying matters of which the minister must be satisfied before listing a person, entity or asset. This will allow greater transparency in the listing process. Under that provision, the listing takes effect by being set out in the Gazette so that it is on the public record and open to scrutiny and questioning. Proposed sections 16 and 17 enable a listed person or entity to make an application to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to have a listing revoked. In the case of such an application, or on the minister's own motion, the minister may revoke the listing if satisfied that it is no longer necessary to give effect to a decision of the United Nations Security Council relating to terrorist assets. For example, if a person were listed and it then emerged that an error had been made and that the person had no connection to terrorism, the person could apply to the minister and there would be clear grounds for revocation. 
Furthermore, under proposed section 19, a listing is automatically revoked by force of law when Australia ceases to be required to implement the relevant United Nations Security Council decision, for example, because it is no longer in force. The listing of persons and entities is also subject to judicial review, for example, on the grounds that there was a failure to consider a relevant matter in making a listing decision—and we have already covered this in other areas in previous debates. There is a provision for the minister to authorise a dealing in a frozen asset on application under proposed section 22. Proposed section 25 is a key safety net provision underpinning all of the other provisions in the bill. This confers a right to compensation on the owner of an asset if the asset is wrongly frozen. The Commonwealth is directly liable under the provision, whereas a third party—such as a bank—that acts in good faith is indemnified by the Commonwealth, with the Commonwealth having full responsibility to compensate the owner of the asset.
The government proposes to further build on these safeguards by government amendments. The government amendments will introduce a regulation making power in proposed section 22A relating to procedures for freezing assets. Government officials have been liaising closely with the financial sector on the procedures to be followed in relation to asset freezing, and the government has undertaken to ensure there will be further close consultation in developing the regulations. The government has also undertaken to consult the opposition in formulating these regulations. The bill, coupled with the government amendments, offers an extremely strong framework for procedural fairness and review. The government's framework is far better geared to resolving issues concerning individual cases and to reviewing the evidence in those cases than is the mechanism of disallowance. 
The government has proposed that the listing of terrorist organisations be disallowable. I will outline the very marked differences between the two categories of listing. I can understand why people might raise that issue. We are under a direct international obligation to freeze terrorist assets under Security Council resolution 1373. There is currently no direct corresponding obligation relating to the listing of terrorist organisations for the purpose of criminal offences. The listing power in the terrorist organisations provisions is directed in part at situations of international cooperation where there is much less likely to be a binding obligation of the kind that exists in relation to asset freezing. Whereas the government has accepted disallowance in the terrorist organisations context, it cannot do so for asset freeze listing because disallowance could well place Australia in direct breach of international obligations. 
There is a further important difference between the terrorist organisations listing and asset freeze listing. With terrorist organisations, the provisions set the framework for an ultimate criminal prosecution. There is time to gather the evidence and therefore pursue the other limb of the government's terrorist organisations definition if there is no listing in place—for example, because of disallowance. That is, there is the possibility that proof that an organisation is a terrorist organisation can be presented in court if a relevant listing has been disallowed. Asset freezing works on far more immediate time frames. The operative time is immediate. If a terrorist has assets in Australia then any hiatus can be exploited in just minutes or hours and the chance to prevent the use of funds in terrorism is lost. 
Gathering evidence against the terrorist after the event will simply be of no use if the money has been whisked away. I think this is an important point that the Senate must remember. So the scope for the disallowance is far more problematic than in the terrorist organisations context because of the very sharp timing considerations which are involved. The government's approach offers a rigorous, transparent and procedurally fair process for making and reviewing asset freeze listings. Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002 lays down review procedures far more suited to dealing with the facts of particular cases than parliamentary disallowance could provide. The government is working closely with the financial sector to ensure all procedures are as fair and effective as possible and has undertaken to make regulations in consultation with the industry and opposition. Unlike in the terrorist organisations context, disallowance could place Australia in immediate and direct breach of our international obligations. The government therefore opposes this amendment for those reasons. ",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-26,"—The reasons do not stand up; they simply do not hold water. Here we have a government which has almost routinely— certainly in extremely notable cases, not least with the abhorrent treatment that it dishes out to asylum seekers coming to our shores and in detaining them on our shores—breaches UN and international treaty commitment after commitment. It is now going through the routine of saying that we must adhere to the wishes of the United Nations Security Council in a way that no other country would be prepared to. We have to respond so quickly to the listing of terrorist organisations that there is no time for the parliament to look at it. It says that if we do not do that we might be in breach of a UN Security Council resolution. That is nonsense. It would take very little skill—if the minister would have it, but he will not—to make the freezing of assets instantaneous but then require regulation and review by the parliament. 
This government does not want the parliament involved. This government is not interested in the ultimate democratic backup of the process of freezing the assets of individuals and organisations in this country of ours, which is reference to the parliament. What a false concoction this is. The executive is taking unto itself extraordinary powers—in this field unprecedented powers— and saying that the parliament should not be involved or the United Nations would not like it. Certainly, the Security Council resolution says that states shall freeze without delay funds and other financial assets.  
We should bring that under parliamentary review. The minister argues that the parliament would not be able to review it because that would flout the direction of the United Nations if it did. This government is saying that an edict from the United Nations Security Council is supreme over this parliament. There is new ground, particularly from this government, if I have ever heard it. This government, which tramples on the basic UN civil rights, civil liberties, refugee rights, rights of asylum seekers which have been in place for decades, is now suddenly saying, `We are going to jump ahead of the United Nations Security Council resolution and implement it in such a way that even the Australian parliament is not referred to.' 
What nonsense. Are we really going to allow an executive in future—using the loose provisions of this legislation, widely open to interpretation—to ensnare community protest organisations, unions, outspoken activists, people who have dotted history over the last two centuries in this country, very often for the betterment of the country and have their actions proscribed by executive action with no reference to parliament. That is what will happen, if we allow the government to get away with it and if the opposition, which stands for not allowing proscription of individuals and entities by the executive, turns down these Greens amendments. The minister says that it might alert a terrorist if it had to refer it to parliament. I have already shown the course of action which is available to the minister—that is, freeze the assets if it is such a serious situation, but have it brought to the parliament for review.
When you get an executive that believes that secrecy of its activities is more important than the overview of the parliament, you are moving away from democratic to dictatorial government, and a parliament is charged very highly with ensuring that it keeps the reins on the executive. This is a very critical moment in this debate. Are we really going to allow individuals to have their assets frozen without reference to them, without their knowledge, and organisations the same by an executive operating in secrecy with no reference to the parliament? I submit, we should not. It is a dangerous course of action, and I would have expected an opposition which says that it is opposed to proscription to be standing with the Greens and the Democrats in this matter to ensure the parliament does have an ultimate say.
The executive is not elected to run this country; the parliament is. It concerns the Greens more and more that the executive is taking away powers from the parliament and making decisions outside the parliament. The worst thing a parliament can do is to give away its own powers to that executive function. This legislation accelerates that course. We must be wise enough not to allow that to happen. The Labor Party should be wise enough not to allow that to happen. In the one opportunity that the people of Australia were given—in the referendum of 1951— they voted against that being allowed to happen. But now we have a situation in which the government, if it is supported by the opposition, is going to be allowed to almost routinely sift through the activities of community groups and individuals in this country and secretly list them and freeze their assets—credit cards, bank accounts, the lot—without reference to parliament. Are we really going to allow that to happen? 
With the spectre of September 11 and terrorism hanging over the heads of all of us, legislation such as this can get through. Some of the country's most eminent jurists have warned against that being allowed to happen. Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has warned against that being allowed to happen, and that is what I see happening here tonight. We have the power to vet and stop terrorism second to no other country in the world. We do not need to allow the executive to do it unchecked without having the same effect. I appeal to the opposition to support these Greens amendments. ",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-26,"—I want to reiterate that, if parliament disallows a listing and terrorist assets are unfrozen, we will be in breach of our international obligation. Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, to which Australia is a party, states that a party cannot justify failure to perform a treaty obligation on the basis of a domestic legal impediment. The relevant treaty obligation here is found in article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations, which provides that Security Council decisions are binding on members of the United Nations. That puts it fairly squarely, and Senator Brown is the first to say that we should have regard to our international obligations. That spells out very clearly that there is an international obligation here and, furthermore, that the United Nations has given a list of assets that should be frozen, and we are acting on that.
I have gone through at length the consequences of disallowance here and how it is so different from the disallowance that is provided for under `terrorist organisations'. I will just touch on the regulations under part 4 of the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 that stipulate the steps that should be undertaken by those who have obligations under part 4 before a decision is taken as to whether or not to freeze funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons associated with terrorist acts. It is anticipated that the regulations will cover steps to ensure correct identification of assets and owners of assets. 
Procedures in this regard will include types of searches and inquiries that affected organisations should carry out in relation to existing holdings and proposed new business. The regulations are also likely to stipulate that affected organisations should make early contact with the Australian Federal Police if they have concerns about some particular existing holding or proposed new business. In this regard, it is anticipated that the procedures will specify the nature of the information that should be passed to the Australian Federal Police, when it should be passed and that the Australian Federal Police response will, where possible, provide further information but will not be determinative of whether the organisation should in fact freeze the assets concerned.
The regulations are also likely to specify when information should be forwarded by affected organisations to AUSTRAC and the level of protection that will be available to affected organisations in relation to a suspect transaction report given to the Director of AUSTRAC, even if the report was provided under a mistaken belief that such a report was required under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988.
It is also likely that the regulations will specify the notice that organisations should give to owners of assets of freezing, including identification of detail of the assets concerned, when the notice should be given, information that the notice should include as to the rights and obligations of the organisation giving the notice and of the persons receiving the notice, and the steps that owners of the assets may take to claim compensation if appropriate. It is expected that the regulations will also cover the protection that will be available to affected organisations in relation to action taken in good faith and without negligence.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-06-26,"—I rise tonight to raise some concerns regarding the disturbing news that has come to light in South Australia earlier this week that five nursing homes are facing potential closure because nursing home residents are not being properly fed and properly cared for due to staffing shortages. It is an indication to me that the government is doing no more than tinkering at the edges, and never actually addressing the real needs of nursing homes in an overall way. It was the government's own accreditation agency that found that in some of the nursing homes residents were left restrained for long periods of time and were experiencing discomfort and loneliness because their basic needs, such as being fed on time and taken to the toilet regularly, were not being met. These five nursing homes facing closure, accommodating 232 residents, were among 22 homes inspected by the agency last year. 
The chief executive of Aged and Community Services, Trevor Goldstone, says that the latest round of accreditation will reflect the inevitability that standards will fall further, given the lack of staff. The conditions I have described—people not being fed, not being taken to the toilet and being restrained for long periods—should not come as a shock to Minister Andrews. The government has received repeated warnings that it is necessary to have a national strategy to address staffing shortages and related issues. It has failed. It is an indictment of this government that it has failed. Aged care groups estimate staff and nursing shortages of at least 800 in 300 South Australian aged care centres.
If the government is unable to start making fundamental changes, we are on the road to disaster, and those who can least afford to pay or help themselves will suffer the most. It is a case of once again the most vulnerable being treated the worst by this government. I guess some of us might be cynical and say we are becoming used to that, but why should we have to become cynical to bring it to the attention of the government? The aged care sector is ill equipped to double in size in the next 30 years to meet the demands of South Australia's ageing population. The percentage of the population in South Australia aged more than 65 will increase from 14.6 per cent in 2001 to 26.9 per cent in 2031. This means that the state's 13,000 nursing home places will need to double to 26,000. 
Industry professionals attribute the shortage to salaries which are about 10 per cent less than in other sectors, the large amount of paperwork, the ageing nursing population and the unglamorous image of aged care. The bedpan image of aged care needs a massive makeover to compete with the more glamorous medical careers, otherwise ageing Australians will suffer at the hands of unqualified staff. This is the warning from a recent report. A two-year study by the University of South Australia and the Aged Care and Housing Group has found that aged care nursing is suffering from an identity crisis. Most nurses perceive the aged care sector as a dead end requiring little skill. On my visits to many aged care units, I find that it is not a dead-end task requiring little skill but in fact a fulfilling task for those who are treated right in that sector. Some of the nursing staff and carers do have aspirations to advance and go ahead and are fully committed to the ageing in our community. But until this government acts to address the issues of staffing and the needs of staff, there is no future and no way we can attract young people into this critical need area.
There is a common discernment that you do aged care nursing if you cannot find a job elsewhere, and so it is considered an end-of-the-line nursing job. That is sad when you consider those folk in the nursing homes cannot fend for themselves, and would like someone to talk to or someone to hold their hand for a little while. But, because the nurses and the caring staff are now so stretched, this can no longer happen and a visit from anyone is a visit that is cherished.
University of South Australia academic Julian Cheek claims that the impression that it is a dead-end job is backed by the wage disparity, with aged care staff being paid considerably less than the public sector nurses. Professor Cheek said the report made nine recommendations, with the top priorities being to boost wages, improve working conditions and market the image of aged care nursing to graduates as a rewarding career path. Meg Klecko, one of the study's original researchers, said:
If someone doesn't pick up the study's recommendations quickly, I think we'll find we won't have a workforce, and ultimately care will be given by people without proper nursing training.
The study, which backs anecdotal evidence of widespread aged care staff shortages, at a time when Australia's population is ageing, the birth rate is declining and the nursing work force is close to retirement with far fewer placement graduates, was handed to the Minister for Ageing, Kevin Andrews, recently. It is imperative that the government addresses these issues and makes them a priority. We must take action to make older Australians continue to live quality lives irrespective of illness and disabilities, rather than respond to Mr Andrews's spokeswoman, who said: 
A culture has developed that staff feel the need to document almost everything a resident does on their care plan because that's how homes are funded.
The large amount of paperwork aged care nurses face is not what they are trained to do; they are there to nurse the elderly and care for us as we get older.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Nursing Homes</title>,Adjournment,30,1,speech
