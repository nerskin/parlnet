"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2005-06-20,"—In the context of this motion, I first apologise to the Senate that the last barriers will not be removed by what had been planned as the target date, 30 June 2005. I made a statement to the Senate to that effect on 15 March. The reason for the delay is a longer than expected time to install the bollards on the slip roads. Only a small number of barriers will be retained, near the three slip roads, and these will be removed once access arrangements are settled for those roads and the bollards can commence operation.
Although the motion seeks an extension until 31 December, the Speaker and I expect that the last of the barriers will be removed well before that date. With regard to costings, the original costings for all the security enhancement works was $11.7 million, which was included in the budget papers. There will be no additional capital costs because of the extension of time for removal of the barriers. The barriers were purchased by the parliamentary departments and will be disposed of by tender when no longer required. No additional equipment or material is being acquired in connection with today’s motion.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-20,"—I want to speak briefly to this. I have spoken to this motion or related matters at least twice before, if not more often, when they have come up in this chamber. I acknowledge the inherent logic of the specifics of the proposal—that things are not ready to go so the barriers have to stay up in certain areas—but I want to once again record my dissatisfaction with the fact that this went ahead before any finalisation or agreement was reached about alternative arrangements for staff, building occupants and anybody else to be dropped off at areas away from the entrances to the Senate and the House of Representatives.
The aspect of this motion which is not really detailed in what has been tabled before the Senate is the uncertainty about what is going to be done for building occupants as an alternative to them being able to be dropped off, as they currently are and have been since this building opened, outside the entrances to the Senate and the House of Representatives. That is the key concern for me. Certainly most of the barriers have been removed. They are unsightly and I think they were there longer than they should have been. It is pleasing to have most of them gone.
The inherent component of this is that the remaining barriers will go once the bollards are activated, and the bollards will be activated once it is agreed to prevent people other than members and senators from being dropped off outside the Senate and House of Representatives entrances. That puts in place almost a blackmail situation, where the barriers have to stay there until agreements are reached for nobody to be dropped off at the Senate and House of Representatives entrances except for parliamentarians.
I do not think that is a satisfactory arrangement because it almost puts a reverse blame on people who are opposing that change and says that it is their fault that the barriers are staying there. I think there are still very serious issues that may not be able to be resolved in changing the arrangement so that people can no longer be dropped off outside the entrances to the House of Representatives and the Senate. I think there should at least be some initial consideration given to some alternative to these white, fairly unsightly, oversized Lego-block barriers. I am not opposing this motion, but I would ask you, Mr President, to give consideration to whether there might be some alternative barrier to the existing temporary ones if some agreement is not able to be reached on people no longer being able to be dropped off at entrances to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Obviously, I am most interested in the Senate, but the principal applies for the other side as well.
As I have said before, this building is occupied by a lot more people than just the parliamentarians. Many of them are here all year round as opposed to the 20 or so weeks that the parliamentarians are here. Many other people get access to the building—community groups, lobbyists and others—and it is far more convenient for them to be able to be dropped off out the front. I realise that this is in response to security assessments, and perhaps the security situation has changed and we need to be more vigilant. Changes have already been made. For many years people were able to park for 30 minutes or so out the front near the entrances. That was stopped. It may be that some other sorts of changes may be necessary. But nothing I have heard to date as an alternative arrangement has seemed satisfactory to me, particularly for people who have disabilities or difficulty with mobility. That is something that I have not heard a proper solution for yet. We are putting ourselves in an impossible bind. These temporary and unsightly barriers will stay up until that is arranged, and I think we should start looking for alternatives.
It is possible to have other arrangements, in the same way as we had other arrangements once it was decided that people would no longer be able to park out the front. I am sure similar sorts of things could be considered as an alternative to perpetually extending the time line for these barriers. This is a building that many other people work in. Thousands of people use Parliament House in all sorts of ways as a working building. It is not here specifically or primarily for members and senators. I personally feel rather uncomfortable about having the elite privilege of being able to be dropped off at the front door while everyone else has to go in through the car park, or the so-called tradesmen’s entrance. I do not think that sends a very good signal. Frankly I do not believe that it is necessary, but of course there are alternative views.
The problem I have with this is that the process that has been followed here has pretty much presented us with a fait accompli and we basically have to deal with either unsightly temporary barriers staying there or people losing their right to be dropped off near the Senate or House of Representatives entrances. I do not think either of those choices is particularly desirable and I am sure there would be alternatives if we started to look for them.
It is not really feasible to vote against this motion because we do still need to have security arrangements, according to the advice we have received. I would not seek to prevent that happening. But I do want to signal, as I did well over a year ago for the first time, my concerns about the process that has been followed here. I have not seen anything happen since to dissuade me from my concerns. Indeed, I suppose the fact that we have gone ahead and spent large amounts of money putting in place all this infrastructure, before we have actually figured out how the new drop-off arrangements are supposed to work, seems to be putting the cart before the horse. It seems to almost add to the pressure to come to some arrangement simply to justify the expenditure that has occurred. Be that as it may, that has already happened. My concern is what we do from here. I do think it is time to attempt to explore alternatives to having these large, nominally temporary—they have been around a long time for ‘temporary’—barriers being extended time after time in the absence of any reasonable and workable arrangement for access to those entrances.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-06-20,"—I do not think this is an acceptable situation. You have apologised, Mr President, for the delay. Nonetheless, inherent in the statement you made were inadequate explanations and a failure to state whether or not the delay in the placement of bollards and/or alternative arrangements will add to the cost and, if so, how much it will add. We understand that it is not going to cost more to move the water-filled, white Lego-like plastic defences from Parliament House, whether that happens in December or now. I think it is very likely—and let us see what happens—that there is going to be a cost overrun in this $12 million fortress plan for Parliament House simply because of the inherent delays.
I want to look at the bollard arrangement. What has been put in place here is a prohibition on all vehicles effectively—except white cars—approaching the ministerial doors, or the House of Representatives doors or the Senate doors. And that is going to be implemented by bollards, which are effectively metal posts, rising out of the ground to block the way of any vehicles. There will be some signal coming from the white cars—presumably either built into the white cars or coming from some other source, for instance given by a sentry on watch—that lowers these metal posts so that the white car can approach one of the three official entrances to Parliament House.
What the government officers who are in the presiding chairs, or the committee, are looking at now is two sets of bollards. When you get past the first set, the white car is then confronted with another set of bollards in front of it, so it effectively has bollards in front of and behind it. The front bollards are then lowered and the car can proceed. In terms of preventing a terrorist attack on a car approaching Parliament House, rather than a terrorist attack through a car approaching Parliament House, you do not have to be Dick Tracy, or a whiz in protecting cars approaching Parliament House, to know that this is going to make the situation untenable. You are going to have a white car enclosed by bollards front and back before it can move on. It will be stopped at the start of the slip-road approaching Parliament House and effectively imprisoned between the bollards before the signal goes for the front bollards to be lowered so the white car can move on. Not only that; as we all know, white cars tend to approach Parliament House in the morning serially with, say, a group of senators, or members, or the Prime Minister’s entourage. What happens in that situation is that the front car approaches, the bollards lower, it goes into the stile—a bit like a cow bail, trussed front and back—and the other cars wait behind. So you have moved a series of cars with MPs in them to the ring-road around Parliament House. The line of cars stops while this bollard arrangement works—or fails to work. So you leave this group of cars to become a target on the ring-road outside Parliament House, which I would have thought would be more difficult to defend than any other arrangement.
I note that the explanation given to the Senate says that the last of the white barriers will not be able to be removed until the bollards are activated or other arrangements are made to secure the building perimeter. One can only read into that that the Presiding Officers have now discovered that the bollard arrangement may not be successful and other arrangements may have to be made. The Senate should be told what those other arrangements that are being entertained are. Having spent $12 million, the Presiding Officers should explain to us the other arrangements they are looking at.
The bungle here is that this was not thought out in the first instance. Thousands of people use Parliament House, particularly when parliament is sitting. Under this system there will be problems for all those people using the building—except the few hundred MPs and senators—because the approach by taxis and cars will no longer be possible. What happened to the consultation process with those people who use this building as part of their working lives? Why was there no consultation before the $12 million was spent in implementing this arrangement? Why is the consultation taking place now that the arrangement has been seen as not a good one?
Mr President, I put that on your shoulders. You are the Presiding Officer of the Senate and you ought to have sorted this out with the Speaker of the House of Representatives first, but you did not—and it is an expensive ‘did not’. It is a bungle. One would have thought that, had you properly consulted with the senators and staff—the think tank that this building is—right from the outset, this would not have arisen. All we are left to do is wait and see what other arrangements, which are unspecified in this document, may be entertained or to see how the bollards—the cow bail system for cars—are going to be made to work so that they increase the safety of MPs coming to parliament rather than increase the risk.
There is a consultation failure here. That is your responsibility, Mr President, and the responsibility of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. It requires much better analysis than I can give it based on this document. If we cannot get security arrangements for parliament sorted out, brought in according to a timetable and made to work, one has to wonder about security arrangements elsewhere. It does not escape my attention that these security arrangements for Parliament House are at least limping into place way ahead of adequate security arrangements at our national airports, which one would have thought would have had priority. Mr President, in the absence of further explanation, except your apology, I am not accepting that this process has been well guided, that any final decision has been made—inherently there has not been one—or that the problems that have arisen should not have been foreseen. It does not take a great deal of intelligence and analysis to work out that there were problems with the system that has been brought in here. More consultation would have avoided that situation.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,0,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-06-20,"—The opposition will not be opposing this motion, although we do share some of the concerns that Senator Brown expressed about the need for proper consultation with the users of this place and the effects that the changed security arrangements will have on the users of this building, particularly the staff. We do note that this matter was the subject of debate when the original authority to proceed was given by this chamber and that this motion is essentially about extending the provisions of the earlier resolution to allow the works to continue and the temporary barriers to remain in place. We see it as inappropriate to oppose this motion because, obviously, the arrangements need to be completed as the funds have been committed to their completion.
We do strongly support the view that there needs to be proper consultation with the users of this place about how the new arrangements will affect them. It may be that other arrangements need to be put in place with regard to the effective access and some other comfort issues that will need to be attended to—for example, for staff who come and go from this building and who depend on taxis outside of normal hours and the like. I am sure those matters are foremost in your mind, Mr President. We simply say that we continue to have those concerns and are anxious that they be resolved as quickly as possible. We will be supporting this motion otherwise.
—I would like to thank those senators who made a contribution. Senator Brown and Senator Bartlett, my door is always open and I am more than happy to discuss these issues with you but, as you can imagine, I am not going to discuss security arrangements publicly. Senator O’Brien, I can assure you also that just this morning we had a joint house meeting and there is a subcommittee dealing with security. We have not got around to that subject yet, but the subcommittee, which has members of both the opposition and the government on it, is considering the very issues we talked about this morning.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,0,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I rise today to discuss the important Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005, and I will be moving a second reading amendment. This is a relatively straightforward bill. It contains a number of important provisions which deserve close examination. The bill contains a number of basic housekeeping amendments and some new agencies are listed as tax deductible gift recipients. The bill also proposes yet another correction to a legislative mistake by the government. As my colleague the shadow Treasurer, in the other place, has unfortunately had to make the point on a number of occasions, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Mr Brough, is establishing a reputation as somewhat of a serial offender when it comes to taxation law amendment mistakes in the parliament. There have been a number of examples of significant errors since Mr Brough has held his position. A couple come to mind, and I use these as examples of the government expecting the opposition—and in this place, of course, the minor parties—to consider and, indeed, give passage to bills with the minimum amount of notice and minimal opportunity to consult those who may have been affected by the change.
The first example related to long-term, non-renewable contracts and the application of those contracts and the GST. On that occasion the government expected the opposition to consider and give passage to the bill in just one day as we were rushed in the lead-up to Christmas. The Labor opposition rejected the call from the government. Then the government was forced to amend its own bill after Christmas, an amendment only made possible by the Labor opposition’s insistence that we would not be rushed on that very important issue. That the Liberal government accepted our amendment is a vindication for the Labor Party’s position and insistence that this bill would not be rushed through. We are not going to have hundreds of small business people, and people with an interest in property generally, adversely affected by faulty amendments that we were expected to consider in just one day.
There was another error. Again, the Labor opposition was expected to deal with the bill in a very short period. That was the amendment to the application of the GST on foreign tour operators. On that occasion, we were again expected to handle a bill in a very short time even though many in the tourist sector were expressing some very real concerns about the unintended consequences associated with that bill. Labor consequently sent the bill to a Senate committee where, extraordinarily—and this was something I had not seen before—Treasury admitted there were errors in the bill. They agreed the bill should go back for drafting. It is an example of the Senate committee system at its best.
—And Treasury at its best.
—Treasury at its worst.
—They admitted it.
—But at least they admitted to the problems. On behalf of the Labor Party, I give the Liberal government notice that we will not be rushed into ramming tax legislation or amendments through the Senate without being given proper opportunity to properly consider them and to consult with the relevant potentially affected parties. Then the government introduce six pages of amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005. How embarrassing for the minister: six pages of amendments that effectively take out of the bill the most significant clauses. We would have been dealing with that as the first item today had we not pointed out the number of problems and the lack of notice in this regard.
Of course, what we get from the minister is not acknowledgment that errors were made, not an honest declaration that amendments have been found and need to be corrected; we get it in the form of enhancements. Every press release that should be about the correction of an error is about an enhancement. Enhanced cover-up would be the best way to describe the approach of the minister Mr Brough when it comes to admitting mistakes that were made honestly and then seeking cooperation to correct those mistakes as expeditiously as possible. Here is another example of a botched approach to legislation. Again we will be expected to consider it in great haste, regardless of the consequences it may bring for those affected in various industries. The bill before us today provides another example of that. I seek leave to table a list of errors in bills that the Labor Party has identified. I have circulated that list to the chamber.
Leave granted.
—I will go through the schedules one by one. Schedule 2 is a measure to correct a major legislative error. Last year the parliament passed the New International Tax Arrangements (Participation Exemption and Other Measures) Bill 2004. The bill extended tax exemptions to foreign branch profits and non-profit dividends where Australia has a tax branch with the country in which the foreign branch operates. Prior to this bill, international shipping and airline profits were taxed under foreign treaties. However, the government has now realised that this creates a situation whereby income and capital gains from ships or aircraft of Australian companies may not be taxed anywhere, either in Australia or in the country in which the company’s foreign branch operates.
We have been advised that Treasury still does not know with any great certainty whether there has been a revenue leakage as a result of this substantial error. This bill now carves out these sectors from the change introduced in the 2004 legislation so that they are now taxed under the provisions applying in a particular tax treaty. This bill sees a return to the situation that applied prior to the act enacted last year in respect of international shipping and aviation profits. So, after 12 or more months, the government is bringing in a bill to repeal it. This is an example, yet again, of a major error from the minister, from the government—a faulty approach to important tax legislation. Labor calls on the minister, or the minister representing in this case, when he sums up today on this bill, to concede that an error was made.
Schedule 1 provides tax concessions for philanthropy and provides greater flexibility to charitable funds. These amendments are welcomed by those of us who sit on this side of the Senate. This schedule expands concessions associated with making donations, especially testamentary gifts—that is, gifts made under a will. Schedule 1 makes it easier for gift funds to obtain a tax exemption on income the gift fund earns. An anomaly exists in the current legislation which stops a charity gaining an income tax exemption for moneys in its gift fund if it gives money, property or benefits to two different types of charities. The amendment will correct this irregularity. Recognition has also been given to non-charitable funds, which provide money, property and benefits solely to DGRs that are tax exempt, where funds are subject to income tax concessions. This will now be available to those funds which provide money, property or benefits solely to DGRs that are tax exempt.
The final change to schedule 1 will allow ancillary funds to obtain a refund of franking credits on the same basis as other DGRs. The amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 in schedule 3 add the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia within the definitions of law enforcement agency and head to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose relevant taxation information to the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia. This treatment mirrors the provisions that apply to similar state bodies, and the Labor opposition is more than happy to support this amendment.
Schedule 4 relates to the correction of yet another error. One of the more significant concessions to charities is that of being an FBT rebatable employer. It is well established in common law that an arm of government is not a charity; however, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2004 amended charity law in such a way as to allow many government bodies to secure exemption from 1 July 2005, including, for example, museums, art galleries and public universities. On estimates, this would have cost $20 million per year. This amendment ensures that a government entity cannot gain the FBT concession. Although these are worthy institutions, they should not receive the concessions because they are organisations intended to be funded by government. Recent case law has blurred the distinction between what is and what is not an arm of government in the charitable and welfare sector. Still, on the whole, the distinction is a worthy one. Arms of government should not receive the tax concessions normally available to a charity. The exception to this rule is DGR status, but this is a concession given to the taxpayer not to the entity per se. Labor will assist the smooth passage of the bill and will support the amendment to the schedule.
Schedule 5 relates to the dependent child age criterion. Schedule 5 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to standardise the age criterion for dependent children for the purposes of taxpayers claiming tax concessions in relation to their dependants. Prior to the introduction of this bill, the dependent child age test for the child-housekeeper, zone and overseas Defence Force tax offsets and the Medicare levy surcharge was less than 16 years of age for a student or 25 years of age for a full-time student. This differs, of course, from the dependent child age criterion for the medical expenses tax offset and the family tax benefit part A. In the case of a medical expenses tax offset, a dependent child is a child of the taxpayer who is less than 21 years of age, a child under 16 years of age who is not a student, or a full-time student under 25 years of age. For the family tax benefit part A, a dependent child is an individual aged under 21 or an individual who has turned 21 but is under 25 and is undertaking full-time study. Standardisation in these areas is an important goal and objective, and Labor supports the amendment.
I shall be moving a second reading amendment in my name which takes the opportunity to make the point that the Labor opposition expects a higher standard from the Liberal government, something more than the piecemeal approach it has had to tax legislation in recent months. We had a vigorous debate in the Senate last week, and I make the point again: when it comes to the budget, we expect something more than an unfair, unbalanced major tax handout, some $23 billion, weighted significantly in favour of those on higher incomes in our society. Labor expects a real approach to tax reform and, in particular, a real approach to reducing effective marginal tax rates in Australia. The fact is the government has done little to reduce the high effective marginal tax rates which apply to low- and middle-income earners in this country, and the package we debated last week and passed via amendment to the government’s income bills reflects that.
This government has no real plan to deal with the interaction of tax and social security systems that leads to these massive welfare and poverty traps. The Liberal government needs to totally reshape the system and focus on tax reform not just tax cuts—and unfair ones at that. That is the issue. We have tax cuts aplenty, but reform is nowhere to be found. This government has no vision or plan for improving the efficiency of the tax system in this country, no plan to improve our international competitiveness and no plan to make the tax system fairer. So Labor calls on the government to make these fundamental reforms.
I note that when the Treasurer came into the House of Representatives last Wednesday evening to participate in the consideration in detail stage of the government’s tax package—something that is relatively rare for him, I have to say; we do not often get the Treasurer in the House of Reps participating in debate—he made no attempt to dissect Labor’s alternative tax policy. He made no attempt to issue a criticism of it, despite the fact that he had the broad principles attached to that policy for more than two weeks and despite the fact that he had had the detailed amendments to the tax policy for seven hours and 45 minutes prior to the debate. He came into the House and heaped what varied from personal critique, irrelevant in many cases, to outright—in my view misleading, and probably I should be careful about how I use that phrase—criticism of the shadow Treasurer, Mr Swan, the member for Lilley. He heaped criticism on the Leader of the Opposition and heaped criticism on the Labor Party. But he has not made any attempt to dissect Labor’s alternative tax package and not one attempt to issue any criticism of it. I was reminded of Darth Vader when I watched him waving around in the chamber in the House of Representatives last week. He has not made any attempt to go into the detail of Labor’s alternative tax package, and that is not a solid approach to meaningful tax reform in this country.
The bottom line is: Labor’s approach to tax reform—and I note the support we had from the Democrats, the Greens and a number of the Independents—would have delivered $12 in tax cuts to low- and middle-income earners earning less than $63,000 rather than the $6 a week proposed by the Liberal government. Labor took the fundamental position that a tax cut 10 times the value of $6—$65 a week—for those earning more than $125,000 is unfair. On top of that, the icing on the cake was the proposal to abolish the superannuation surcharge tax for high-income earners which would have delivered them another $35 to $40.
—Hear, hear!
—I hear, ‘Hear, hear!’ Where were you when the tax was introduced by the current government and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, described it as a fair tax meant to minimise rorting in the tax system on superannuation? That was this government’s explanation for introducing the tax in the first place back in 1996. We know that the removal of the surcharge tax exclusively from the superannuation of high-income earners is a very desperate attempt by the Treasurer, Mr Costello—

Senator Eggleston interjecting—

—to obtain the votes of people like you, who are continually interjecting, in justification for an exclusive tax cut to people on a taxable surcharge income of more than $100,000 a year. Where is the tax cut on superannuation for people earning less than the surchargeable tax income of $100,000 a year? That is a prime example of the exclusivity in approach of this government and it is nothing more than a pitch by the Treasurer to get the votes of the backbench in this place to support him in his leadership bid, if he has ever got the guts to launch it.
I might point out to the chamber and to those few listening in the audience—we are not on broadcast today—that that exclusive tax cut to people earning more than $100,000 a year surchargeable tax income delivers to people in this place, in the parliament itself, because of the nature of their scheme, a tax cut worth between $5,000 and $6,000 a year. That is why the Treasurer is so keen to do full reversal on a tax measure that he described back in 1996 as fair and designed to eliminate rorting and which caused outrage amongst Liberal Party backbenchers and Liberal Party members. I understand Liberal Party members of parliament do not go to branch meetings in July and August when the tax assessments are issued because they get hammered by their own members. This is nothing more than a blatant attempt by the Treasurer to garner favour from the backbench and the frontbench of the Liberal Party in order to obtain votes in a blatantly unfair way.
—Talk commonsense.
—Where was the commonsense? The Treasurer, Mr Costello, described this tax as a commonsense measure, a fairness measure, back in 1996. He has undertaken a Darth Vader course from the good side to the dark side. It is just amazing the way that the Treasurer has got himself into contortions on this matter.
We had an extensive debate about the lack of fairness in the government’s tax package. I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the list of errors made by the minister, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue, Mr Brough. There were six substantial errors that he fails to acknowledge and we are here today partly fixing the results of the incompetence of the minister. When ministers make a mistake, they should fess up, own up, admit they made a mistake. Don’t put out another press release saying it is an enhancement; own up to the error, and it will be corrected as expeditiously as possible. Labor is supporting the bill today. However, I want to move this second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate condemns the Government for:
failing to pursue meaningful structural income tax reform;
failing to seriously address the problem of effective marginal tax rates in its 2005-2006 Budget; and
continuing to introduce tax bills with significant errors and anomalies requiring costly and cumbersome legislative correction”.
I point out to the chamber that I have tabled some six examples of errors made by the minister. He is the one that is accountable. It might be that he wants to blame the tax office. I do not blame public servants; I am not in the habit of blaming public servants. They do a lot of good, solid, hard work under enormous pressure and it is the minister who bears the responsibility. He has got all these staff over there working away in his office advising him and thousands of public servants work on tax, but at the end of the day the minister has to carry the can. We want to see a few press releases titled ‘Minister admits error. Amendment to tax bill to be introduced in the parliament’—not ‘Enhanced tax measures to be introduced’ and a cover-up of the errors being made continually by this minister, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue, Mr Brough.
We will support this tax bill and correct the errors that the government has made, but we want to make the point about Minister Brough’s mistakes and we want to make the point, by the second reading amendment, about the lack of meaningful income tax reform in this country.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-20,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005 contains five schedules. I will briefly outline their purpose. Schedule 1 ensures that testamentary gifts of money or property to charities are not subject to capital gains tax. It also contains some minor technical amendments designed to assist the charity sector. The Democrats strongly support moves to strengthen charities through beneficial tax concessions because they play a vital role in our society. Having said that, I and others have spoken previously of the need to drastically improve accountability in the charity sector, and I note the series of Business Review Weekly stories commencing on 24 March 2005 that have contended that Australia’s $70 billion not-for-profit sector is in many respects out of control with respect to proper accountability and proper transparency in these matters. I have raised and will continue to raise questions arising from these matters with the Taxation Office and Treasury. In return for substantial concessions from both federal and state governments, and even local governments, the not-for-profit sector really does need to become more transparent and more accountable in its public reporting in return for the benefits that it receives.
The government would be wise to adopt some serious measures to tidy up the not-for-profit sector. They could, for instance, finish implementing the recommendations of the charities review which was initiated by the Democrats and agreed to by the government at the time of the GST negotiations. The benefits would include improving the confidence of the Australian public that their donations are being properly directed towards their nominated target. It would also give the government some idea of the full value of the concessions that the sector receives. The not-for-profit sector is one area and a very major area of our society which needs serious statutory attention to improve the way in which it is called to account for the taxation concessions and other concessions it gets.
I note that in the explanatory memorandum, regarding tax concessions for philanthropy, the financial impact statement says the cost to revenue of allowing a franking credit refund to non-charitable ancillary funds and prescribed private funds is expected to be insignificant. The cost to revenue of the remaining amendments is unquantifiable but is expected to be insignificant. Of course, it depends what is meant by ‘insignificant’. Without imputing any mala fides on behalf of those who constructed the explanatory memorandum, I just do not believe it. I think that these concessions will amount to several million dollars a year. It may be likely that it is not capable of being quantified but if you are going to call it insignificant, in my view, many millions are not insignificant.
Schedule 2 corrects an unintended error from a previous international tax change that resulted in ship and aircraft income from international traffic not being subject to tax in Australia or a foreign country. This amendment applies retrospectively from 1 July 2004. Generally the Democrats are wary of retrospective legislation. However, as this is a revenue protection measure which corrects an anomaly in the law which was unintended, we will support this change.
Schedule 3 amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to allow disclosure of relevant information to the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia. That is a sensible, facilitative, administrative and technical change which we support. I note in passing that the previous Liberal-National government in Western Australia resisted reforming and improving the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia and I am very pleased that the Gallop Labor government has rectified this and that the commission is now more effective than it used to be.
Schedule 4 corrects a further anomaly that allows government institutions that are charitable institutions at law to be eligible for fringe benefits tax rebatable employer status. Schedule 5 standardises the age criteria for dependent children for tax concessions. The age criteria for a dependent child who is not a student is 21 years—up from 16 for the housekeeper, zone and medical expense offsets—and it is 25 years for a full-time student.
The Democrats will support this tax laws bill. It is necessary to correct mistakes and to make small but useful advances in tax law. However, I want to return to and briefly go through the second reading amendment moved by Senator Sherry on behalf of the opposition. Item (a) on revised sheet 4610 states:
... the Senate condemns the government for:
failing to pursue meaningful structural income tax reform;
As Senator Sherry outlined earlier, we had a very significant debate on this last week and I do not intend to go over that ground again. The government has been making income tax changes but they are not integrated into a coherent plan which puts into place a permanent income tax structure which meets the full needs of Australian society. We, the Democrats, have outlined five measures which we believe are essential for structural income tax reform. Those include raising the tax free threshold significantly, indexing the tax rates, broadening the base, raising the top income tax rate and attending to welfare tax intersects to ensure that the maximum encouragement is provided for low income people to move off welfare and into work. We think it is about time the government repeated the thought through, comprehensive and fully modelled and costed approach it took to indirect and business tax reform and did the same for income tax reform. We thoroughly support item (a). We think it is a major failure of the government. Item (b) of the second reading amendment states:
... the Senate condemns the government for:
                  …         …           …
failing to seriously address the problem of effective marginal tax rates in its 2005-2006 Budget;
The coalition government has addressed the issues surrounding tax and welfare intersects to some extent by reducing the taper rates in the year 2000 and in the latest budget year. Nevertheless, it is a fact that lower income Australians experience the highest effective marginal tax rates of all. It is not the higher income sector at all that experience that problem, but they are the ones who get the most publicity because the people who write the articles and own the newspapers happen to be high-income people. A little more attention to lower income people, which I must say certain writers do give, is more than welcome. In that respect I mention George Megalogenis from the Australian, who writes some very instructive articles on policy and dissects the way in which our tax system affects individual Australians. So we support item (b).
Item (c) condemns the government for ‘continuing to introduce tax bills with significant errors and anomalies, requiring costly and cumbersome legislative correction’. On the one hand, it is slightly unfair to criticise them in that you would want government to introduce tax bills to correct significant errors and anomalies. It is also slightly unfair because I think this is an inevitable consequence of our very detailed, complex and difficult to follow tax act. I am a person, along with a number of other people in the chamber today, who has stood here for nine years through every single tax debate that has gone on in this place. I defy a minister or their advisers, a shadow minister or their advisers, or myself or my advisers to be certain of all the consequences, interactions and interrelations of the tax act and the legislation before us. The consequence, of course, is that people miss connections and the way in which these things interact, and that results in errors and anomalies.
What item (c) and the second reading amendment should have done is implore the government to continue to find ways to simplify and improve the act. Indeed, at least one senator in this place would be delighted to know that yesterday I was reading the Treasury’s latest Economic Roundup. I read a very instructive article in there on the way in which Treasury is producing new coherent principles for tax legislation design, which have only been implemented in a few fields so far. That is a very useful shift in the way in which tax legislation is to be couched, expressed and interpreted. So for my part I encourage Treasury and the tax office to hurry up on that side and try and improve tax law as much as they can to achieve what Labor is effectively asking for here, and that is less costly and cumbersome legislative correction.
Frankly, without the input of the professional organisations that examine tax legislation, without the efforts of Labor’s team on tax and occasionally without the efforts of the Democrats and their small team, we would not be able to pass as much legislation as we do. It is those bodies, supported by the very capable services provided by the Senate, which provide for review of tax legislation. With those remarks, you will have gathered that the Democrats support Labor’s second reading amendment as well as this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-06-20,"—On behalf of the government, I now sum up on the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005. To begin with, I would like to thank those who have participated in the debate on this bill. The bill continues the government’s program of modifications and improvements to the tax laws. It provides charitable funds, ancillary funds and prescribed private funds with greater flexibility in the way they make donations to other funds. This has been achieved by removing the limitation on the capital gains tax exemption for testamentary gifts to charities and giving various funds the ability to make donations to a wider range of organisations without losing tax concessions.
The income tax exemption for charitable funds only applies in limited circumstances. Presently, charitable funds can distribute solely to charities that are located and pursuing their purposes in Australia or solely to deductible gift recipients, but there is no tax exemption if they make distributions to a combination of both kinds of organisations. The measure in this bill will ensure that charitable funds can access income tax exemptions if they distribute all of their funds to either of these organisations or to a combination of both kinds of organisation. Furthermore, under common law, ancillary and prescribed private funds can only access income tax exemptions if they distribute funds and/or property to deductible gift recipients that are also charities. They cannot be income tax exempt if they distribute to deductible gift recipients that are only income tax exempt. The changes proposed in this bill will mean that ancillary and prescribed private funds will not lose the income tax exemption if they choose to distribute solely to deductible gift recipients that are charities and deductible gift recipients that are income tax exempt or to both.
This measure will improve access to refunds of excess franking credits. Presently, the law allows refunds to deductible gift recipients, endorsed charities and charitable funds. Under this measure, this would be extended to ancillary and prescribed private funds that distribute solely to income tax exempt deductible gift recipients. The measures under the bill ensure that the tax law operates equitably across the range of philanthropic and charitable organisations, allowing funds a greater choice in the distribution of moneys. These changes also give effect to the government’s announcement in the 2004-05 budget.
The second measure outlined in the bill is technical in nature. The recently expanded foreign branch profits exemption, when viewed in conjunction with Australia’s treaty obligations, can be interpreted to mean that international shipping and airline profits derived from Australian owned foreign branches are not subject to taxation regimes either in Australia or overseas. The proposed changes ensure that these amounts continue to be taxed in Australia, consistent with Australian tax policy. I note that Senator Sherry has sought an assurance that the amendments on international shipping and airline profits will stop revenue slippage. I have instructions and information that the amendments to section 23 are expressed to be retrospective to prevent revenue slippage from arising.
The third measure in the bill concerns the release of information by the Commissioner of Taxation. Presently, the commissioner is able to release taxpayer information to certain law enforcement agencies if he is satisfied that this is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been committed or where it is necessary to the making of a proceeds of crime order. The measure adds the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia to the list of law enforcement agencies able to receive relevant taxpayer information from the commissioner.
The fourth measure in the bill makes a technical amendment to the fringe benefits tax law. The existing fringe benefits tax law provides, in effect, that fringe benefits tax rebate applies to a scientific, charitable or public education institution so long as it is not a Commonwealth, state or territory institution. In the course of updating the law relating to charities, consequential changes were made to the rebate provisions. A new provision was introduced to extend the rebate to charitable institutions endorsed for the purpose of income tax concessions. It was not intended as a consequence of the original amendment that the scope of the rebate would be extended to Commonwealth, state or territory institutions. The measure therefore proposes a technical correction to the provision to specifically exclude these institutions. This measure makes it clear that government institutions will remain, as is currently the case, ineligible for FBT rebates.
The bill simplifies the rules for concessions which are contingent on having a dependent child of a particular age. Previously, different concessions have had different age criteria. This measure standardises the dependent child age criteria used to determine entitlement to the housekeeper, child housekeeper, medical expenses and zone tax offsets as well as the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge. The introduction of a single set of age criteria—that is, a child less than 21 years of age or a full-time student less than 25 years of age—gives consistency to the law. The revised age criteria are more generous than the various criteria currently in place. More taxpayers will be able to access dependant related offsets, including the concessional Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge threshold offsets and the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge family thresholds.
The measures proposed in this bill will make the taxation regime more equitable in a number of ways and improve the operation of Australia’s tax laws. I note that the bill is supported and I commend the bill to the Senate, which brings me to Senator Sherry’s second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition. I do not propose to deal with either items (a) or (b) of the amendment for the reasons that the usual criticisms are made, and to that extent the usual answers are given. I think it would be more constructive if I were to deal with item (c) which relates to introducing ‘bills with significant errors and anomalies requiring costly and cumbersome legislative correction’. To that end, I say to Senator Sherry—although his remarks seem to have been confined to my successor, Minister Brough—that to my knowledge the government still very much does give full consideration to all tax bills to ensure that revenue concerns are balanced with community needs. That is obviously a very important objective.
The government is committed to community consultation on the design of tax measures to provide, so far as possible, appropriate and targeted responses. The government operates from an in-principle position of consulting on all substantive tax legislation initiatives, except where this is precluded by sensitivities or timing restrictions. I will give a couple of examples. Since 2002 there have been consultations on nearly all substantive tax measures—in fact, quite exhaustive consultations on many measures that I can recall. Feedback from those consulted has generally been very positive. Indeed, it is a very critical part of the development of tax law where it is appropriate. However, the government will not hesitate to introduce legislation before consultation when tax integrity measures are required to close down tax abuse arrangements or tax loopholes. I cannot seriously think that either Senator Murray or Senator Sherry could be opposed to that approach. This was the case, for example, with recent amendments to the GST margins scheme property measure and the GST foreign tour operators measure.
Consultation is based on draft legislation whenever circumstances permit. As I can say from my own experience, that is almost always. The form of consultation on proposed measures varies. It may involve inviting written submissions in response to a discussion paper, public release of exposure drafts of legislation, roundtable discussions with a small number of stakeholders or the confidential release of draft legislation to technical experts, depending of course on what is sought to be addressed and what is thought to be the best and most effective way to gain that very valuable input. If any scope for improvement or the need for correction is discovered, the government is committed to taking action even if it does attract the attention or criticism of the shadow Assistant Treasurer. I think all would agree that the government would be very remiss if, having identified some unintended consequence or anomaly, action were not taken immediately to remedy it.
But I did want to correct any impression that the chamber may have or be left with that the government does not take its responsibilities to consult very seriously and in fact to assure the Senate that the government does and will continue to consult wherever appropriate to develop the most appropriate and targeted responses. Obviously, the government does not support the second reading amendment, but I did think it quite timely and appropriate to put on record the fact that the government has a very good record of consulting, and certainly a good record of correcting, when it comes to the government’s attention in a timely way that there is either an unintended consequence or some anomaly that has not been addressed. We all know that the tax regime does have some very complex linkages and interactions. Sometimes even with the benefit of consultation it is only at a later stage that some of these matters come to light. I note that the bill is supported. I thank senators for their support for the bill and I commend it to the Senate.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2005-06-20,"—My question is to Senator Hill, Minister for Defence and Leader of the Government in the Senate. Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate confirm figures in today’s media revealing the depth of the Howard government’s contempt for this parliament? Can he confirm that this government has only responded on time to four of the 137 Senate inquiry reports since 1996 and failed to respond at all to 46 Senate inquiries? Why is the government avoiding its responsibility to at least respond to the recommendations of, and preferably take action on, reports of issues like children abused in care, bushfires, road safety and poverty? Given the Howard government’s willingness to ignore the cases put before the parliamentary committees by many Australians in the last nine years, can we expect that its performance after 1 July will be even more a case of democracy denied?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Howard Government</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2005-06-20,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Will the Minister for Defence be taking the standard Howard government attitude to the unanimous recommendations of the Senate’s military justice inquiry tabled last week? Wasn’t the minister flagging this democracy denied attitude in his media comments over the weekend when he clearly signalled that he was not inclined to throw out a military justice system because it has ‘taken hundreds of years to develop’ and ‘has the culture of the command chain as its basis’? How many stories of violence, racism, abuse of power and suicide will it take to convince this minister to take this Senate report seriously and to fix this broken system of military justice?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Howard Government</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2005-06-20,"—We have had many more of what might be described as political reports in the Senate in recent years. These have been, departing from the traditional bipartisan nature of the Senate, committee inquiries set up with the specific purpose of bagging the government and—surprise, surprise—the reports that have come out, controlled by a Labor Party majority, have bagged the government. The honourable senator has the cheek in such circumstances to get up here and say, ‘Why didn’t the government take that report seriously?’
Unfortunately, what has happened in recent times is that the government has referred legislation not to the legislative committees that were set up for that specific purpose but to other committees that they control so that they have had the numbers to deliver the political outcome that they sought. The fact that those reports from references committees have not always been taken as seriously as the opposition would like should come as no surprise to the opposition, because they were not ever intended to be taken seriously. They were an excuse to travel around Australia calling public meetings and calling in witnesses from the unions, teachers and so forth to bag the government. If the honourable senator had prefaced his question by acknowledging the abuse of the system that we have experienced under Labor then I might be responding to his question more seriously. But in so many instances reports from references committees which were purely political exercises might have achieved what the Labor Party intended but certainly did not add to the public’s knowledge of the important issues at hand.
In relation to proper bipartisan reports, they are taken seriously by the government. When I look at the President’s report I see that most have in fact been responded to—certainly not always within the very strict time limits required, but I think most senators would say it is better to get it right than hurry and get it wrong. We take our responsibility seriously and we take the task of responding to genuine parliamentary reports seriously. So in many instances what will be seen here are interim reports, acknowledged as interim reports whilst other specific questions are further addressed.
When the parliament contributes, either through a reference inquiry or through suggestions in its consideration of a piece of legislation, changes that are constructive and helpful, they will always be treated with respect by this government. If they can stand on merit, they might even be adopted by this government. We do not mind acknowledging that we can get benefit out of committee reports, but unfortunately in recent years the committee structure has been debased by an opposition that really has not been interested in seeing that it continues its previously high standard but rather has sought to simply use it as a political tool. I think that is a matter of great regret.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Howard Government</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2005-06-20,"—Bad cases do not make good law and I am sorry to hear the honourable senator having a go at the ADF in this way. In most instances, the military justice system has worked well. Where it has not done so, what can be learned from the experience should be learned. If reform is necessary in structure, policy, implementation or resources then such changes should be made. That is what I was saying on Sunday. I do take that report very seriously. It was, in this instance, a bipartisan report. A great deal of effort was put into it. I have already instructed that the response to be developed as an advice to me from my department has to be done promptly. I have said that I am looking for a response expeditiously in this instance because I do think the issues are very serious. Where change is warranted, change will be effected. (Time expired)

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2005-06-20,"—My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone. Today is, of course, World Refugee Day. In that light I ask the minister to provide an update of the government’s ongoing commitment to providing resettlement solutions for refugees and others in desperate humanitarian need.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-06-20,"—I thank Senator Knowles for her question. Today is indeed World Refugee Day and the government remains as committed as it ever has been to an orderly resettlement program that provides protection to those who need it most. These are the people who are in UNHCR camps, some of whose kids have lived all their lives in places without running water and without power. These, by any definition, are the people most in need.
In 2005-06 our bipartisan humanitarian program will again offer new life and new hope to about 13,000 people who come to Australia from offshore and through the front door. That program includes 6,000 refugees, which is an increase of 50 per cent from 4,000 in the previous year. It is a great pleasure for every member of this government to recognise that later this year we will welcome to Australia the 100,000th humanitarian arrival to Australia in just under 10 years. So much for all the talk about this being a government that is not willing to welcome refugees and that is not willing to take humanitarian entrants.
Some time this year, the number will tick over to 100,000 people from offshore in desperate need. It is about at 95,000 now and we expect that we will in fact get there by the end of the year. You can be sure there will be some form of appropriate celebration, to which we may even consider inviting Labor senators. Perhaps it would do them a bit of good to come along, Mr President, because, as you know, Labor senators are always reluctant to acknowledge that this government has consistently welcomed refugees from offshore. This government is consistently ranked among the top three governments in the world for providing resettlement to people who desperately need it.
Our humanitarian program does in fact focus on those people who are in the greatest need. It does not focus and will not focus on those people who go outside the international system of protection and pay people smugglers or who run the gauntlet on a leaky boat. The proposal we have adopted is not unfair nor is it unprincipled; it is just plain good policy. To quote a former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees:
Step by step, we need to move towards more refugee resettlement and less irregular movement
That is what the policies of this government do. They put a stop to irregular movements coming to Australia and focus on those who come in through the front door—in other words, to organised resettlement. You cannot have a structured permanent humanitarian program and run that alongside an open door policy. It just does not work because the latter undermines the former. Time and time again, that has been shown to be the case.
As I said, today is World Refugee Day. The theme for this year is courage. We do want to acknowledge the strength of character and the perseverance of refugees, and the courage they show in living a life in a refugee camp, hoping that someone will insist that the orderly system of taking refugees out of camps is adhered to. We welcome them having the courage, determination and trust to believe that people will not allow the international arrangements for resettlement to be undermined and that they will finally get a place.

That will be subject to the passage of legislation and ratification of the treaty. You asked about consultation. Significant consultation has occurred and will occur with stakeholders, including consumers in Australia and New Zealand, on the implementing legislation once it is drafted. Once this legislation is passed by the parliaments of both countries, the treaty will come into force and a new joint regulatory scheme will begin.

If there are any details that are available but not available on the web site, I will get those and present them to the Senate. Senator Harris refers to the Codex. This is the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which was established in 1963 by two United Nations organisations, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and WHO. Its main purpose is to protect consumer health and to ensure fair practices in international food trade through the development of food standards and guidelines. Codex standards and guidelines are developed by committees of the commission which are open to all member countries, including Australia. The Codex committee on nutrition and foods for special dietary uses has developed draft guidelines for vitamin and mineral food supplements. The draft Codex guidelines for vitamin and mineral food supplements specifically state that they apply in countries where vitamin and mineral supplements are regulated as foods. As these types of products are regulated as medicines in Australia, they will not be affected by the proposed Codex guidelines. (Time expired)

Independent Committee to Review Human Cloning and Embryo Research Legislation

The Australian Government has appointed retired Federal Court Judge, Justice John Lockhart AO QC, to head a committee to conduct independent reviews of Australia’s Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002 and the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002.
The committee also included Associate Professor Ian Kerridge, a clinical ethicist; Professor Barry Marshall, a specialist gastroenterologist and community advocate; Professor Loane Skene, a lawyer and ethicist; Professor Peter Schofield, a neuroscientist; and Associate Professor Pamela McCombe, a clinical neurologist.
The reviews, to be conducted concurrently, are a statutory requirement of both Acts. The reports of the reviews are to be tabled in the Australian Parliament and provided to the Council of Australian Governments by 19 December 2005.
The Australian Government has received the unanimous agreement of the State and Territory governments on the membership of the committee.
The independent reviews will consult with the Australian, State and Territory governments and a broad range of people with expertise or experience in relevant disciplines.
The committee will be supported by an independent secretariat and is expected to call for written submissions shortly.
The Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002 and the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002 were passed by the Australian Parliament in December 2002. They established a strict regulatory framework to prohibit certain unacceptable practices including human cloning, and to regulate, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, research involving excess human embryos created through assisted reproductive technology.
The reviews’ terms of reference and more information about committee members are attached.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked today relating to employment and training.
You really would have to wonder, listening to the answers to questions given today by Minister Abetz, if this government is simply allergic to the notion of training young Australians to ensure that they can get jobs. Australians are entitled to ask: why is it this government has such a problem with training Australians? Why is it that this government has such a problem with investing in developing the skills of our young people and welfare recipients in order to ensure that they maximise their opportunity to get a job?
We all know that the best way to get a job is if you have the skills an employer needs. Whether you are a young person who wants to leave school and look for an apprenticeship or other vocational training, or a welfare recipient who wants to build a better life for yourself and your family, job skills that enable you to get a job are what you need. But what we have in this government, both in its so-called Welfare to Work package and also in its abysmal record on vocational training, is a stubborn refusal to invest in the skills of Australians. We have a skills shortage in this country at a time when the Howard government over its life has turned away 270,000 people from TAFE. We have a skills crisis at a time when a so-called Welfare to Work package massively underinvests in developing the skills of welfare recipients in order for them to get a job and actually contribute to dealing with the skills shortage.
I asked the minister today on two occasions if he could explain why there were so few training places for people who receive the parenting payment. I just want to remind the Senate of the statistics here, because they really do tell the story. There are around 600,000 people receiving the parenting payment. There are around 65,000 people of mature age who are on Newstart. And how many training places is the government allocating for both those groups, around 665,000 people all up? The answer is 12,300. I have not done the percentages on that, but I am pretty sure that they are pretty small—12,300 places for 665,000 welfare recipients. This is a government that arrogantly disdains investment in the job skills of Australians who are on welfare. This is made even more ridiculous by the government’s own research into the skills and educational levels of those parents who are not participating in the work force.
The fact is the majority of parents who receive parenting payment are engaged in looking for work, are in voluntary activity or are in a job and receiving part payment. Of those who are not, almost three out of four only have up to year 10 education. That is from the government’s own research—it is a paper that was produced by the Department of Family and Community Services. One wonders if anybody who was involved in the chaotic development of the Welfare to Work package actually took the time to read this and work out that the majority of people who do not have jobs and are on parenting payment have only got up to year 10 education. Now what does that mean? Clearly it means that we need to do some investing in developing their skills.
When I raised this with the minister previously when we had a debate on Insiders, it was quite interesting. I said, ‘Many of these people only have year 10 education.’ What was the minister’s response? His response was to accuse the Labor Party of being job snobs and to say: ‘There are incredible opportunities in retail for these people.’ Mr Deputy President, given your background, I am sure you are aware of the sorts of hours of work that are probably available in the retail industry. You would wonder how many of those are consistent with being a sole parent with family responsibilities. You would wonder how many of those are consistent with child care and all the other family responsibilities these people bear by themselves.
But is the government prepared to ensure that these parents can develop the skills they need to build a sustainable economic future for themselves and their families? Is it prepared to actually invest in these people? The answer, given the arrogant response by Minister Abetz today and given the figures in the budget, would have to be no. Yet again we see this government acting with disdain towards job seekers and welfare recipients, arrogantly refusing to invest in developing their skills. If the government was serious about moving people from welfare to work, it would do the right thing and ensure that there were proper and adequate training opportunities available to them. The numbers simply do not add up.
Finally, and very briefly, the issue on Work for the Dole that the Labor Party are pushing is not that we oppose a scheme for Newstart recipients or that we do not think there should be obligations; we just think there should be guaranteed training opportunities. (Time expired)

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2005-06-20,"—I also would like to respond to the answers given by Senator Abetz in question time today, in particular about two of the Howard government programs—Work for the Dole and that very valuable program for the environment known as Green Corps. The fact is that in 2004-05 the government is providing $178 million to enable an expected 85,000 unemployed people to gain valuable work experience.
Of those job seekers who completed a Work for the Dole participation program in the year ending June 2004, almost 40 per cent were either employed or in education or training three months after leaving the program. Indeed, in my capacity as a senator for Victoria I have personally attended many of the graduation programs for Work for the Dole, and I know that many people who have been in the program are not able to attend because they have already obtained a job.
These programs are of great value, not only to the participants who undertake them but also to the communities where they are worked on. The Work for the Dole program is one of mutual obligation, and the participants in those projects provide a service to the communities which help to pay them the money that they gain through being on that program. The projects come from the communities. These are projects that the communities want, that they see as being of vital necessity in fulfilling what they would like to see happen in their local town or area.
I will give as an example the recent Work for the Dole graduation that I attended in Maryborough in Victoria, which is in the electorate of Bendigo and not far from the city of Ballarat. In that program the participants had undertaken the renovation of a guide hall which was of some historical significance to Maryborough and in urgent need of renovation. All 15 or so participants who were on that program had learnt skills as a result of their work. They had learnt skills in building, painting, carpentry and gardening. They had learnt to be part of a team. They had learnt to be part of a group. At the end of the training they were being given help to build up a CV and help in writing a resume, and those participants who had been part of the program the whole time would then gain access to a further $800 in job training credits which would enable them to go on to further study. All of that indicates the attention the government is paying to helping those participants to be job ready when the right opportunity comes along. As I said, the participants are often not there at the graduation because they already have jobs, and I am delighted to see that.
Another example of the practical skills that can be gained are those related to positions like that of an administrative assistant at a primary school, which again teaches participants to interact as part of a team, whether it is outside in the school grounds or in the administrative area, and to learn the skills that they will need to go on to get a job. During 2003-04 there were almost 74,000 commencements in Work for the Dole. For each year this program has run since 1997 the level of participation has risen: in 2003-04 that level was up 16 per cent on the previous year.
I will finish by pointing out that, when this government came to office in 1996, long-term unemployment was something like 11 per cent—11 per cent for a growing, productive country like ours. At present, long-term unemployment, which was a great feature of the unemployment picture at that stage, is now 0.9 per cent of the labour force, the equal lowest level on record. Work for the Dole is contributing to that, so is Green Corps for the environment and so are many of the other training programs that we have in place. I personally am extremely pleased that we have adopted such a proactive attitude to filling the unemployment gap, getting people from welfare to work and assisting them in that way. (Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-06-20,"—As Senator Wong was outlining earlier, one of the most significant crises facing this nation at the moment is that of the skills shortage. What those opposite do not seem to realise is that skills shortages do not appear without any prior indication; they do not just suddenly pop up. The skills shortages crisis that this country now faces has been building over time. In fact, many of its origins can be attributed to the election of this government and its policies. It is a crisis that has many causes, whether it is the failure of businesses to take on apprentices, the closure of rail workshops and engineering shops by state governments in the 1990s, or the movement of more and more of our tradespeople into management and supervisory roles. Each one has had an impact. What we are now seeing, though, is that the problem of skills shortages is leading to increases in wages and massive increases in immigration. That seems to be the only solution we are being offered.
The other thing that the government claims as its contribution to solving this crisis is that it is creating 24 technical colleges around Australia. Whilst we accept that these technical colleges will increase the capacity to train more apprentices, it is also true that we will not see one of these apprentices graduate until 2010—some 4½ years away. Although there is some work being done by the government, it is playing catch-up. The first Australian trained apprentices under its grand new vision will not be here for another 4½ years.
The simple fact is that the indicators collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations show that, for over 10 years, there has been a decrease in the number of people undertaking and, more importantly, completing their apprenticeships. This data has been available for 10 years; it has not suddenly appeared. The facts are pretty straightforward for anyone in the government who is paying attention. Fewer apprentices, an expanding economy and normal retirement patterns mean that there are fewer tradespeople each and every year. It is not that hard to work out: fewer people completing apprenticeships and tradespeople retiring or moving to a different job over time mean fewer tradespeople. When the labour market is allowed to function like that, it is no surprise that we find ourselves in the situation we are now in.
The approach to employment of those opposite has always been purely ideological. First, they set up the Job Network where the main priority has been about process, but the process has been about providers getting paid for putting a person into work. That was all they cared about. Then they just sat back and allowed the market to run itself. Now they are surprised about what the market has delivered to them. Take the case of a young person in Western Australia whose father is a tradesperson, who did not want to go to university upon leaving year 12 and who considered a trade—that is until he was offered work in the mining industry. Why would he be an apprentice for four years and get paid poorly when he can work casually for a mining company and earn more per year than his father? In good economic times, why are we asking young people to work as an apprentice when they can work in the resources sector and earn considerably more? These are some of the significant challenges that we face.
This same driver exists for employers. Why should they expend energy and meet the cost of training apprentices when they can simply source foreign tradespeople on short-term work visas? That is something about which this government seems to be very proud. And there is no shortage of people from countries such as South Korea or South Africa who are prepared to come to Australia on a 457 visa. Many of them come to Western Australia in the belief that they are actually going to work up north in the Pilbara but then find themselves working in the suburbs of Perth. They can always leave, but they need to find another employer who is prepared to sponsor them as part of their visa conditions. My office in Perth has dealt with a number of South African boilermakers who came out here on the promise of working up north on good money. Indeed, they resigned from well-paid jobs in the South African mining industry in search of a better life here and instead found themselves working in small engineering plants in Perth.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-06-20,"—It is an honour to stand here and take note of the answer given by Senator the Hon. Eric Abetz in response to the question from Senator Wong on employment and workplace relations. In particular, I want to highlight some of the fine achievements of the Australian government, particularly under the Work for the Dole program, and to comment on the Australian technical colleges and the policies we have in place to tackle the skills shortages in this country. You cannot but compare the record of the Howard government with that of the opposition, whose senators have made a reasonably feeble attempt to chastise and criticise the government’s record. You must remember that the most meritorious thing any government can do is to provide people with jobs. This is what the Welfare to Work policy is about and particularly what the Work for the Dole program is about.
We are investing $178 million to enable approximately 85,000 unemployed people to gain valuable work experience. These are people who would otherwise perhaps remain unemployed. One must remember that unemployment is now at a record low—the lowest it has been in decades. It is around the five per cent mark across the country. In my home state of Tasmania it is a bit higher than that, but even in Tasmania things have been improving. The record is there. In terms of money in the pockets of workers, we remember that after 13 years the Labor Party provided this country with a paltry 1.2 per cent increase in real wages growth. Since 1996 the Howard government have delivered—wait for it—a 14 per cent increase in real wages growth. The benefits are there; they are flowing through.
It was an honour to be at the Work for the Dole national awards just last week when the Hon. Peter Dutton, the Minister for Workforce Participation, gave out the national awards. Congratulations to Minister Dutton and to all the recipients of those awards. There were finalists in each category and a national award. I was so proud to be there and Michael Ferguson, the federal member for Bass, was also proud to be there because the Mount Barrow Discovery Trail was the national winner. You should have seen the smiles on the faces of the recipients of that award. Not only were they proud, but all the finalists were very proud and pleased to be involved in the Work for the Dole program. The Mount Barrow forestry trail participants should be congratulated: Ian, Dave and Andy Padgett and their team have worked very hard. Today we should be applauding their efforts and saying congratulations and well done to those from the Mount Barrow forestry trail and all those who have had input into it.
We should also be congratulating Minister Dutton for the work that he has done so far in highlighting the importance of the Work for the Dole program. The important thing is that, three months after participants have finished the program, 40 per cent—four out of every 10—are either in jobs, in education or in training. They are actively participating, and that is why this program is so good. It creates good work habits. I have seen many people at the beginning and at the end of those programs. Those programs create good habits in terms of both self-confidence and self-motivation and in terms of making a difference in the community—and the same goes for Green Corps. They are all proud of themselves by the end of that program.
Participants learn more than just good work habits; they learn about occupational health and safety issues, they learn about first aid, they learn about safety arrangements, and they learn how to increase their confidence—and that is just through talking and participating. There is no particular structure to the program on this, but at the beginning their confidence is low and then it goes up a cog or two, big time. That is why they end up in jobs, in training or in education. This is something that the Labor Party opposes.
Why does the community support this program? Do you know what the support levels across the country are for this particular program? The support in the public arena for the Work for the Dole program is up around 85 to 90 per cent, and yet the Labor Party opposes it. That sort of popularity rating is exactly what Kim Beazley would be dying for right now in terms of support. It is something that the Hon. Mr Beazley would dearly love. (Time expired)

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I take this opportunity to speak on this issue of employment and workplace relations that was raised with Senator Abetz earlier today in question time. We have really got to get it into our thinking and understanding that the Howard government refuse to guarantee training as part of Work for the Dole. They refuse to guarantee training. All of the people that Senator Barnett was talking about get jobs at the end of the day, but very few of them get jobs that relate to the work they did when they were on Work for the Dole, because the training does not exist to put them into the mainstream employment lines.
The Labor Party see this as a great shame and a waste of the potential of unemployed Australians. Contrary to the Howard government’s spin, Labor support Work for the Dole. What Senator Barnett has just been telling us is wrong. He does not know. He wants to keep going back to the past. He said that we have to look at the record. Isn’t it time we stopped looking at the past and got on and did something constructive for the future—especially when the nation has a chronic skills shortage at the moment? Unlike the Howard government, we do not think that the scheme is perfect. In fact, we think it is very flawed.
I was interested to note that, in his answer today, Senator Abetz himself said, ‘It could be better.’ He recognises that it could be better. The fact is that it is an absolute disaster. Unlike the Howard government, we look at the results of Work for the Dole. Fewer than one in three Work for the Dole participants ends up with a job three months after completing the program. I talk to employers, and what they are saying is that those people do not come with skills. Sure, the unemployed have been out there. They might have picked up the idea that you have got to turn up each day if you want to hold a job. They might have picked up the idea of working as part of a team. But they do not bring with them skills that are relevant to the area in which they live and work. The program needs major reform, but this government have got their eyes shut and rely on one success here and there rather than looking at the whole picture. That is a disaster and an absolute shame for the long-term and short-term unemployed.
Labor want to make the program work better. That is our goal. We want to make it work so that people go from unemployment into the work force with a constructive role to play and a chance to contribute to the nation’s great future. We want to give the unemployed people who participate in Work for the Dole a greater opportunity to work in mainstream employment. The key to that is ensuring that participants have the opportunity to develop and improve their skills. Many of the long-term unemployed in the unemployment queue at the moment are people who have already been in work. They need retraining and reskilling so that they can move into another job. Their employment might have ceased because of the closure of a business, or they might have moved. Many things take people away from what they were doing. They need to be skilled for what is out there for them in the future.
One thing I do want to draw attention to is that in South Australia, my home state, as a result of very positive initiatives by the Rann government and the employment minister, Stephanie Key, major inroads have been made into teenage unemployment—especially in my part of regional South Australia. We need to give these people real opportunities to move from welfare into work. Labor absolutely support the principle of mutual obligation. We want to take it to the next step of ensuring that it actually improves people’s chances of getting off welfare all together. Mutual obligation is not the version that the government would give you, where the employee must always oblige the employer. The employer also has obligations to employees and to potential employees.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-20,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
I think it is particularly important at this time when, as everybody in this house knows, we are shortly moving to a phase where the government will have control of the Senate to once again note the government’s continual record of ignoring returns to order by this chamber. I have spoken a number of times in the past on this developing habit of the government. I will not go into detail now, but for them to say, ‘We will not table any of these reports at all because of security concerns,’ really comes close to treating the Senate with contempt. There is a very large list on the Notice Paper that is provided to us every sitting day of all the returns to order that are outstanding—that is, orders of the Senate for documents to be provided to the Senate by the government that have been ignored by the government. That is, or should be, a serious matter.
We saw on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today a detailed outline of this government’s habit of flagrantly ignoring the obligations under the standing orders to even respond to committee reports—not to agree to committee reports or to say, ‘Yes, we will do whatever you want,’ but to even respond to and acknowledge the work of the committee. I would say that that is not just a contempt of the Senate and the Senate committees but also a contempt for all the people in the general public who have taken the time to put themselves under the spotlight and express their views, to be questioned—sometimes quite vigorously—and have their views and ideas tested and examined because they want to contribute to the political process. That degree of contempt for the views of the general public as well as the views and activities of Senate committees and, indeed, House of Representatives committees is reflected in the very poor record of this government in responding to those reports and the recommendations.
This habit or practice that has been growing more and more over time of ignoring orders of the Senate is one that I believe should be drawn to the Senate’s attention each time that it happens. It is tempting when it happens more and more to just say, ‘Oh well, there we go again,’ and ignore it. That just makes it all the more easy for governments to get away with it. I draw the Senate’s attention to the list that goes for three pages, from page 27 onwards, in today’s Notice Paper of orders for the production of documents still current from previous parliaments. They are the ones left over from before the last election, and there are a number of others that are still outstanding that have not been complied with. We can add this latest one to the list.
There may well be valid concerns relating to security that could be contained in some of the documents but to simply not release them at all on those grounds beggars belief. Obviously, there is material contained within them that is embarrassing to the government. Its failure on the important matter of public policy and public safety has been embarrassing for the government. But to hide behind security issues and refuse therefore to produce anything, even an edited or a censored version, is totally unsatisfactory.
It also invites less accountable and less desirable alternative mechanisms for information to get into the public arena, such as documents being leaked to the media or sometimes directly to web sites. I am not criticising the media for publishing them, but if there are genuine security concerns involving these sorts of documents then you are much better off trying to go the honest way and releasing the documents with problem areas excised, rather than risk them being leaked and all of that material getting into the public domain. I think it is an unsatisfactory practice that has developed, beyond just this individual example we have seen here. It needs to be noted each time.
It sends a fairly worrying signal about what we may be in for when this government gets full control of the Senate. Of course, the first thing that will happen is that attempts by the Senate to pass orders requiring documents to be provided will probably cease. That will be one less accountability mechanism for the Australian people. But, as we have already seen, the government is pretty much working in advance of that by simply refusing to provide documents even when orders for the production of documents have been passed by this Senate. An order of the Senate is not just a passing whim; it is a formal resolution of the Senate that does have legal standing. It has weight, and it is not satisfactory for it to be continually denied on what I believe to be such flimsy pretexts.

I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Report No. 65 contains the findings and recommendations of the review conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into eight treaty actions tabled in the parliament. The review includes the following treaty actions. First is the Agreement on Bilateral Cooperation between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand. This will strengthen the political, diplomatic, security and social ties between Australia and Thailand through cooperation and information exchange. The agreement also establishes a joint commission on bilateral cooperation which will meet biannually, at the ministerial level, to review progress on cooperative activities identified in the agreement. The commission will also continue to strengthen ties between Australia and Thailand by identifying further areas for potential cooperation. The treaty committee supports the ratification of this agreement.
Secondly, the committee supports the termination of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Slovak Republic on Trade and Economic Cooperation. Accession to the European Union requires a country to terminate existing bilateral agreements. This treaty action will allow the Slovak Republic to accede to the EU.
Thirdly, the committee reviewed the enhanced cooperation agreement with Papua New Guinea. The Senate will be aware that this agreement was implemented late last year and was subsequently suspended. The committee supported the agreement, which enabled the deployment of Australian police and other officials to deliver assistance to PNG. The committee acknowledged the urgent need for the agreement to be in force prior to the treaty action being tabled in parliament and so supported the national interest exemption being invoked. The committee awaits the outcome of developments following the decision of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea that Australian police and personnel withdraw, and the possible renegotiation of the terms of the agreement. The committee has found that there have been a number of treaties relating to the stability of Pacific island countries which have invoked the national interest exemption and entered into force before being tabled in parliament. The committee has recommended that, in cases such as these, it receives an urgent briefing on the proposed treaty action.
Fourthly, the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air updates and will eventually replace the current convention and also a number of subsequent conventions and protocols which together form the Warsaw system. The Montreal convention will provide a uniform code that modernises the international air carrier’s liability framework and will provide measures such as electronic documentation to assist the movement of air passengers, baggage and cargo.
Fifthly, the committee supports the amendments to the schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, a multilateral treaty that regulates the conservation and use of whale stocks. The initial focus of the convention was to ensure international control of postwar development of the commercial whaling industry. More recently, the International Whaling Commission, established under the convention, has been a vehicle for conservation measures such as the 1982 decision to implement a moratorium on commercial whaling. The committee found that Australia already prohibits killing, injuring or interfering with whales in Australian waters and that, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, Australia provides a higher level of protection for whales than provided under the convention.
The sixth treaty action is the Agreement on Social Security Between the Government of Australia and the Government of Malta. The agreement is part of a network of existing social security bilateral agreements that Australia has with other countries. The agreement, similarly to the current agreement, will provide access to certain Australian and Maltese social security benefits and limited portability of these benefits between the countries.
The Beijing Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer recognises the environmental and human health problems resulting from damage to the ozone layer. The amendment aims to diminish this damage by committing parties to a reduction of their consumption of substances that harm the ozone layer.
Finally, I turn to the amendments to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, a multilateral treaty which regulates international trade in specimens of wild fauna and flora. This treaty action recognises that international cooperation will protect and conserve endangered and threatened species of fauna and flora from exploitation through international trade. This treaty provides for differing degrees of regulation of trade, resulting in differing levels of protection for each species.
In conclusion, it is the view of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties that it is in Australia’s interest for the treaties considered in report 65 to be ratified. The committee has made its recommendations accordingly. I commend the report to the Senate. I take this opportunity to say that normally the report of the treaties committee is presented in the Senate by a member of the opposition, as the committee is chaired by a member of the government. I would like to thank Senator Stephens for transferring to me the privilege of presenting this report today. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the treaties committee and all my colleagues on it, particularly the chairmen under whom I have served—the Hon. Andrew Thomson, Kerry Bartlett and Dr Andrew Southcott—and all the staff of the committee for the six years I have spent on it. I thank the Senate.

Report No. 65 contains the findings and recommendations of the review conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into eight treaty actions tabled in the parliament. The review includes the following treaty actions. First is the Agreement on Bilateral Cooperation between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand. This will strengthen the political, diplomatic, security and social ties between Australia and Thailand through cooperation and information exchange. The agreement also establishes a joint commission on bilateral cooperation which will meet biannually, at the ministerial level, to review progress on cooperative activities identified in the agreement. The commission will also continue to strengthen ties between Australia and Thailand by identifying further areas for potential cooperation. The treaty committee supports the ratification of this agreement.
Secondly, the committee supports the termination of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Slovak Republic on Trade and Economic Cooperation. Accession to the European Union requires a country to terminate existing bilateral agreements. This treaty action will allow the Slovak Republic to accede to the EU.
Thirdly, the committee reviewed the enhanced cooperation agreement with Papua New Guinea. The Senate will be aware that this agreement was implemented late last year and was subsequently suspended. The committee supported the agreement, which enabled the deployment of Australian police and other officials to deliver assistance to PNG. The committee acknowledged the urgent need for the agreement to be in force prior to the treaty action being tabled in parliament and so supported the national interest exemption being invoked. The committee awaits the outcome of developments following the decision of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea that Australian police and personnel withdraw, and the possible renegotiation of the terms of the agreement. The committee has found that there have been a number of treaties relating to the stability of Pacific island countries which have invoked the national interest exemption and entered into force before being tabled in parliament. The committee has recommended that, in cases such as these, it receives an urgent briefing on the proposed treaty action.
Fourthly, the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air updates and will eventually replace the current convention and also a number of subsequent conventions and protocols which together form the Warsaw system. The Montreal convention will provide a uniform code that modernises the international air carrier’s liability framework and will provide measures such as electronic documentation to assist the movement of air passengers, baggage and cargo.
Fifthly, the committee supports the amendments to the schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, a multilateral treaty that regulates the conservation and use of whale stocks. The initial focus of the convention was to ensure international control of postwar development of the commercial whaling industry. More recently, the International Whaling Commission, established under the convention, has been a vehicle for conservation measures such as the 1982 decision to implement a moratorium on commercial whaling. The committee found that Australia already prohibits killing, injuring or interfering with whales in Australian waters and that, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, Australia provides a higher level of protection for whales than provided under the convention.
The sixth treaty action is the Agreement on Social Security Between the Government of Australia and the Government of Malta. The agreement is part of a network of existing social security bilateral agreements that Australia has with other countries. The agreement, similarly to the current agreement, will provide access to certain Australian and Maltese social security benefits and limited portability of these benefits between the countries.
The Beijing Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer recognises the environmental and human health problems resulting from damage to the ozone layer. The amendment aims to diminish this damage by committing parties to a reduction of their consumption of substances that harm the ozone layer.
Finally, I turn to the amendments to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, a multilateral treaty which regulates international trade in specimens of wild fauna and flora. This treaty action recognises that international cooperation will protect and conserve endangered and threatened species of fauna and flora from exploitation through international trade. This treaty provides for differing degrees of regulation of trade, resulting in differing levels of protection for each species.
In conclusion, it is the view of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties that it is in Australia’s interest for the treaties considered in report 65 to be ratified. The committee has made its recommendations accordingly. I commend the report to the Senate. I take this opportunity to say that normally the report of the treaties committee is presented in the Senate by a member of the opposition, as the committee is chaired by a member of the government. I would like to thank Senator Stephens for transferring to me the privilege of presenting this report today. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the treaties committee and all my colleagues on it, particularly the chairmen under whom I have served—the Hon. Andrew Thomson, Kerry Bartlett and Dr Andrew Southcott—and all the staff of the committee for the six years I have spent on it. I thank the Senate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,28,2,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-20,"—The New International Tax Arrangements (Foreign-owned Branches and Other Measures) Bill 2005 is the fifth instalment of a package of reforms to Australia’s international tax regime. The Democrats have been involved in all the international tax changes under that package of reforms, and we have been strongly supportive of the process. Some of us think that we as a party and probably the Senate as a whole do not get enough credit from business for the support of the international tax regime that has gone on here. I sometimes think that many people in business are a bit like that gigantic glutton in Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life—the fat one that Cleese was feeding, in the famous dining room scene, who kept asking for one more piece. Sometimes I think that, with respect to tax and tax change, business is exactly like that—never satisfied and incapable of being satisfied. Maybe that is just how things are.
The Labor Party have been quite consistently supportive of an internationally competitive tax system, except for on one occasion which I can remember, when they seemed to have some sort of brain implosion and opposed the Australia-United Kingdom double tax agreement. I never did quite find out why they did that. Anyway, that agreement passed with the assistance of the Democrats, and it is pleasing to see Labor back on track and strongly committed to an internationally competitive tax system. I have agreed with Labor that they put Australia very much on the path to an internationally competitive situation, particularly with respect to floating the dollar and other sorts of reforms, way back when they were in government.
Australians must be encouraged to invest offshore and that means a reciprocal arrangement to encourage foreigners to invest in Australia. We need to get on top of that relationship because the current account deficit is worrying if the flow is too much in one direction. This bill contains various compliance measures dealing with dividends received by foreign owned branches, the controlled foreign company regime and Australian branches of foreign financial entities. The bill also aligns the taxation of cross-border employee share schemes with OECD international norms.
Schedule 1 to this bill amends the taxation treatment of certain residents in respect of Australian branches by calculating tax and dividends paid to the branches on a net assessment basis and by providing tax offsets in relation to franked distributions received. Schedule 2 to this bill amends income tax law to prevent inappropriate taxation as a result of the definition of ‘commencing day’ in the controlled foreign companies rules when Australian residents gain a direct or indirect interest in a controlled foreign company and removes inappropriate taxation where an unlisted country-controlled foreign company becomes a listed country-controlled foreign company due to its country of residence being listed. Schedule 3 to this bill extends the existing separate entity treatment currently provided to Australian branches of foreign banks to include Australian branches of foreign financial institutions. Schedule 4 to the bill amends income tax law to more closely align the taxation of shares or rights acquired under an employee share scheme with international norms developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and schedule 5 to the bill amends some application rules in a technical manner.
The financial impact of all these measures is relatively low or defined as ‘insignificant’. Once again, I doubt that. I do not think business clamour for tax changes where the financial impact is insignificant. It is my view that this is very significant to them. However, that is the verdict of the explanatory memorandum. I have to deal with the second reading amendment moved by Senator Sherry. In my view the amendment is superfluous; we already passed a similarly styled amendment to the earlier bill. Of course, this particular second reading amendment says, ‘but the Senate notes that the bill contains a number of corrections of errors in relation to legislation introduced last year’. It does, but it also contains other things and I think, having voted for one kick in the pants for the government, on balance we will leave this one out of the equation.",SENATE,<title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS (FOREIGN-OWNED BRANCHES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2005-06-20,"—I thank senators for their contribution to the debate and will respond to a couple of issues Senator Sherry raised in his contribution. Firstly, he asked whether these changes in relation to foreign branches are consistent with consolidation. I can advise that the changes are consistent with consolidation principles, and extensive consultation with industry will ensure that this outcome is achieved as far as is appropriate. Secondly, he asked for assurance that the revenue impact will be insignificant. I can confirm that the amendments in schedule 2, to fix errors contained in legislation introduced by the then Labor government, produce an unquantifiable revenue cost. I am advised by officials that this is likely to be insignificant. Collections of capital gains tax are inherently lumpy and difficult to estimate.
The New International Tax Arrangements (Foreign-owned Branches and Other Measures) Bill 2005 continues the government’s program to modernise Australia’s international tax regime. Schedule 1 ensures that there is similarity of treatment between nonresidents investing in Australia through subsidiaries and nonresidents investing through branches. This is achieved by providing for Australian branches of nonresidents who receive dividends to be taxed by assessment rather than by way of withholding. Furthermore, nonresidents with Australian branches will receive franking credits when they receive franked dividends. This measure not only attains equity of treatment but also reduces some of the compliance costs. Schedule 2 makes minor amendments to the foreign-controlled companies rules. In particular, the amendments enable additions to the listed-country list without inappropriate consequences.
Additionally, the amendments ensure that, when foreign companies’ assets are sold, Australia’s capital gains tax rules apply appropriately. Currently, Australian branches of foreign banks are provided with separate entity treatment for income tax purposes, which means that they are treated more like foreign owned subsidiaries. Schedule 3 provides Australian branches of foreign non-bank financial institutions with the same treatment. The International Banks and Securities Association of Australia, in their media release on 17 March this year, welcomed the government’s initiatives in this area.
Schedule 4 aligns Australia’s taxation of shares or rights acquired under employee share schemes with international standards of the OECD model tax convention. The measure provides individuals and employers with greater certainty, as individuals who work in more than one country will be able to calculate with confidence the Australian tax liability related to their employee shares or rights. The last schedule is a technical amendment. I would like to mention that this bill contains measures which are eagerly anticipated by industry and which will improve the operation of Australia’s tax laws. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Original question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS (FOREIGN-OWNED BRANCHES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,34,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-06-20,"—As we said in our speeches in the second reading debate, the ALP will not be insisting on the amendments that we agreed to with Senator Stott Despoja at that time. But we do want to take this opportunity in discussion to urge the minister and the department to consider further extending the activity for maternity allowance for adoptive parents. As we said during the second reading debate, we have decided not to insist because, in the package of measures put forward in this legislation, we think it is particularly important that the area of debt trap and family tax benefit B be considered. We thought, as we said, that that should get the priority at this time.
However, as the minister well knows and did reflect during the debate at the second reading level, there has been considerable lobbying by parents who are going through the stress of the adoptive period, raising the very real issues of the costs and trauma involved with adoption, particularly overseas adoption, and we have been made most aware of the need to extend the maternity allowance for these people and to ensure that their needs are met. While we are not insisting on the amendments at this stage, we will continue to lobby and we urge the minister to take up the generosity of spirit that she described in talking to the bill. We have already moved the 26 weeks to two years. I think it would be reflective of the urge to extend if we were to get rid of this stupid age requirement to ensure that families who are having a new person come into their family receive the kind of financial support that is required. Having said that, we accept that this bill should go through at this stage and we encourage further consideration of family allowance debt traps.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,35,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-06-20,"—I acknowledge the message that has come back from the House, obviously with disappointment. The Australian Democrats will be insisting on the amendments that I moved last week—I believe it was on Wednesday night—with the support of a majority of the chamber. We believe that all adoptive parents should be eligible to receive the maternity payment. That includes adoptive parents whose children are more than two years of age. In fact, adopting older children is something that parents in our society find incurs additional costs, contrary to some claims by some in this place.
Senator Moore was not kidding when she said it was a very organised campaign by the adoptive parents and aspiring adoptive parents who have sent emails, faxes and letters to our offices in recent days, weeks, months and indeed years. This is a campaign that some of us started more than two years ago. Certainly there were a number of phone calls over the last few days as the urgency of this issue became more apparent. There is a good reason for this group to be so well organised. This is not a political movement; this is a group of parents who have often spent many tens of thousands of dollars to try to adopt a child successfully. They are desperate for this additional financial help and they believe, as do I, that they are quite rightly entitled to that maternity payment. The women who adopt these children not only often incur additional costs but also have the same responsibilities as other mothers—no matter how their child is delivered to them, shall we say.
The supportive emails had an element of desperation to them. Many of the adoptive parents also pointed out to me that they believed the minister, Senator Kay Patterson, actually misled the parliament during the debate last week when she said:
By the time a child is two, you do not have the same costs.
One woman who emailed me said, ‘I can vouch that nothing is further from the truth.’ She went on:
... adopting older children brings a whole range of extra issues, that would make it even more relevant to provide financial support to these adoptive families ...
Then she drew my attention to:
... the chronic need for families in Australia to open their homes to the millions of children, aged 2 years and older, in overseas countries who are waiting for an adoptive family.
These sentiments were echoed by many other families—many of the individuals and families who contacted my office, and I am sure many others. I do not have time today to put all their comments and views on record, but I will endeavour to put some of them. Many of those who contacted me are concerned that restricting the maternity payment to those adopting children aged under two will discourage families in Australia from adopting children who are more than two years of age. Let us remember that many of those children are already overlooked by prospective adoptive parents.
Prospective adoptive parents often have to scrimp and save to come up with the many thousands—literally tens of thousands—of dollars required for intercountry adoption. The maternity payment would go some way, albeit a little way, to help these families meet the costs of adoption. Another woman who contacted me went as far as to say that only paying the maternity payment to those adopting children under the age of two:
... may place pressure on families to adopt a child under the age of 2 years because they just cannot afford to adopt a child older than 2 years. This pressure (foregoing several thousands of dollars) is hard to ignore if you are already mortgaging your house or borrowing money in order to adopt, common situations.
She went on:
Is this something that the Government wants to do? ... to place pressure on families not to adopt children who are living in very bad situations and desperately in need of a family but who happen to be older than 2 years of age? Why should the Government place children at such a disadvantage when they have already so much loss in their lives ...
Yet another woman, currently in the process of adopting her second daughter, said in an email to me:
It doesn’t matter how old a child is when they come into a family. The costs are huge but ESPECIALLY—
and I note the caps—
in the case of adoption. I will be paying approximately $30,000 as I did so before and then I am required to take at least 6 months off work so that my child will have the opportunity to bond with ... my family.
As I mentioned last week, many parents are encouraged by the relevant state departments to take time out—up to 12 months—of the work force. That can enhance their chances of being adoptive parents. Obviously, there are a lot of sacrifices that come with that, not least of which is the income forgone as a consequence of doing so. This is one of the points, theoretically, of the government’s maternity payment—that women who have children have the option to take time out of the work force. As I have said on record before, it is not the same as paid maternity leave, but I will leave that issue alone today and restrict myself to the issue of adoptive parents. So even that $3,000—now roughly $4,000—payment would assist these families and in particular these women.
Unless the amendment before us becomes law those women who adopt children older than two years of age will be ineligible to get this small piece of financial assistance. As I pointed out to the minister last week, it ain’t the newborn allowance: it is not the newborn payment; it is the maternity payment. It is effectively a payment made when you become a new mother regardless of the age of your child. Especially in the case of adoption, age should not be an issue. These women should be entitled to this payment in the same way that any other woman in Australia who has a new baby is entitled to it and in the same way that anyone, including people like me, is eligible for this payment. Why on earth are these adoptive parents ineligible? Another woman said to me:
... my daughter’s adoption happened 3 days before her 2nd birthday and hence we landed back in Australia after her 2nd birthday and I was ineligible for things like the immunisation rebates etc and needed to pay the additional airfare on the way home. All of this I had not expected but still was exhilarated to become a mother.
The immunisation rebate is a debate for another day, but it is another additional cost that is incurred, contrary to claims by some in this place that adoptive parents do not have additional costs as a consequence of their child being older than two years of age.
The minister said last week that her advice was that 70 per cent of adopted children will be covered by the payment if the bill as it stands becomes law. The fact is that a small number of parents would therefore be affected by my amendments. Presumably 30 per cent are going to be affected by the amendment that I have moved on behalf the Democrats and was pleased to see pass last week. Surely that fact is a strong argument for support of this amendment, not just by the government but also by the Labor Party. It is a relatively small number of parents who will be affected but, gee, it is going to make a difference to their lives. I see it as an opportunity for the government to say: ‘Yes, this is not onerous. Financially this is not a huge difficulty for, or impost on, the government. We are going to pass it.’ The same argument applies to the Labor Party, who have shown their support for this issue. Now is the time not to back down on this issue. We are so close to getting these people this additional assistance. I fear that if we do not deal with it now it will be deferred for forever and a day. It took us long enough to get the retrospective changes made to the baby bonus, and I must have started campaigning for that in 2002 with the introduction of the baby bonus. We have only just amended the maternity payment to deal with children being adopted up to the age of two. When on earth will we deal with, if we ever do, the issue of adopted children over the age of two? I doubt we will get back to it. So this is a great opportunity for us to make this real difference to people’s lives today.
None of the adoptive parents who have contacted me—and I will make this very clear—begrudge the costs that they had to pay in order to become mothers and fathers. But they do not understand why the government is discriminating against them and their families in this way. I reiterate: the pressure is now on all parties in this place, but in particular on the Labor Party—and I know Senator Moore is more than aware of this because we have discussed it in this place and generally—as to whether or not the government is allowed to continue this discrimination. I understand that they do not want to hold this bill up. Senator Greig has explained on behalf of the Democrats our support for the legislation in parts, but he also recognises, as do my other colleagues, that this is our little chance to improve it in a big way for a number of families who are currently being discriminated against.
I believe that if we insist on these amendments now—if the Labor Party joins the Australian Democrats to remove this age restriction—we will together send a strong message to the government that this discrimination is unacceptable. So, once again, I urge the parliament to pass these amendments. The cost is not onerous for government. Think of those adoptive parents; the last thing we want to do is make it harder for parents to adopt. We do not want to discriminate so that aspiring adoptive parents feel pressured to adopt children under the age of two. We know of some of the circumstances in which children that are up for adoption in other parts of the world are living. We do not want to make it so that it is more desirable to adopt babies and children under the age of two. We have to make it equally opportune and possible for parents who wish to adopt to children aged two years and over. That is remembering, of course, that logistically a lot of children who are adopted in intercountry adoptions are just under two years of age when the adoption process is being discussed or is under way. But then, when it is finalised, some of those parents are bringing children back to Australia that are three or four years of age. Indeed, about 52 per cent of intercountry adoptions are of children between the ages of one and four—that is off the top off my head and I will check those stats. The reality is that two is such an arbitrary figure. Why is the government persisting with that figure? And, in doing so, why are they discriminating against those other families? I urge the Labor Party to insist on these amendments and I commend them once again to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,35,1,speech

I thank Senator Moore, on behalf of the Labor Party, in agreeing to support the motion and not to press its requests, notwithstanding some reservations that the Labor Party has.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-06-20,"—I rise to speak to the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 [2005]. Over the past few years, it has been rare that I have had the opportunity to stand and welcome legislation introduced within the Attorney-General’s or justice portfolios; however, this is one of those rare occasions. I am pleased to say that we Democrats welcome this bill and support its passage. While the bill is perhaps not perfect, it is nonetheless a significant step in the right direction. I think it is fair to say that, within this parliament, we Democrats have been amongst the most outspoken advocates for the victims of trafficking. We have long called for greater protection—both legislative and otherwise—for those affected by this insidious trade in human misery.
The Attorney-General’s Department has estimated that, each year, somewhere between 700,000 to four million people are trafficked around the world, including to Australia. These people are transferred, either against their will or after obtaining their compliance by the use of threat, force or bribery, to another place for the purpose of exploitation. Within Australia, that exploitation usually means sexual servitude. In fact, last year’s US State Department report on trafficking in persons identified Australia as one of the world’s top destinations for sex-slave trafficking, putting us on a par with countries such as Morocco, Colombia and Lithuania.
I think everyone in this place would agree that the victims of trafficking are the victims of a serious crime. Tragically, however, they have not always been treated as such, including, regrettably, by the Australian government. There are many documented cases where the government has treated such victims as illegal immigrants and deported them—often back to countries where their safety is at risk. Frequently, the safety of these women is at risk before they even leave the country, whether on account of the risk posed by the perpetrators of their crime or because they are kept in appalling conditions in detention centres.
Perhaps the most notorious case is one which I have spoken of on a number of occasions—the case of Ms Puangthong Simaplee, who died in Villawood detention centre in September 2001. Ms Simaplee had been discovered by Immigration officials during a raid on a Surry Hills brothel during 2001. She informed the officials that she had been sold into sexual servitude at the age of 12 and trafficked to Australia at the age of 15. Ms Simaplee suffered from hepatitis C, malnutrition and pneumonia, was addicted to heroin and displayed clear evidence of self-harm. Nevertheless, she was put into detention at Villawood and died there three days later as a result of heroin withdrawal. Ms Georgina Costello, a barrister who appeared on behalf of Project Respect at the inquest, indicated that Ms Simaplee was found face down in a pool of vomit, in the same bucket she had urinated, defecated and vomited in for three days. It is against this grisly background of the most horrendous abuse and mistreatment of victims of trafficking that we are pleased to finally welcome this legislation.
Just over a year after Ms Simaplee’s death, the government signed the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children. The legislation before us today is intended to facilitate Australia’s ratification of that protocol. The protocol came into force on Christmas Day 2003 and currently has 117 signatories and 76 parties. It sets out a very broad definition of trafficking and makes it clear that consent is irrelevant where a person has been trafficked for the purpose of exploitation and where force, or the threat of force, or abduction, fraud, deception or the abuse of power is involved, or where consent has been obtained by the giving of benefits or payments. The protocol requires parties to, firstly, criminalise trafficking in persons and, secondly, protect and assist the victims of trafficking.
The focus of this bill is on the criminalisation of trafficking, and there is no doubt that it represents a significant improvement on our existing legislative framework. I note that both the government and the opposition have foreshadowed amendments to the bill in response to recommendations made by the Senate’s Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the excellent work of my colleagues on the committee, which resulted in a comprehensive, compelling and courageous report. It is a fine example of the way in which Senate committees are able to involve the Australian community in the legislative process and identify substantial improvements to legislation. In this case, the committee recommended extensive improvements to the bill to ensure its consistency with the trafficking protocol. We Democrats wholeheartedly support those recommendations and look forward to the opportunity to implement many of them during the committee stage.
I turn now to the second part of the trafficking protocol, which deals with the obligation to provide protection and assistance for the victims of trafficking. While our legislative regime will be greatly improved by the passage of this bill, it is in the areas of victim protection and victim support that Australia is lagging behind. That was a consistent theme of the vast majority of submissions to the Senate inquiry. As Project Respect pointed out, ‘The best legislation in the world is useless if complementary measures, such as support for trafficked women, are inadequate.’ Similarly, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission argued:
While the passage of the Bill should mean Australia would largely comply with its obligations under the Trafficking Protocol (once ratified), there remains considerable work to be done before Australia could be considered to have achieved a standard of best practice in addressing trafficking in people.
In late 2003, the government announced a $20 million package of measures to combat trafficking in Australia. As part of that package, the government announced that it would provide protection and assistance to victims of trafficking who cooperated with police. The inherent flaw in that approach is that it links protection and assistance with police cooperation. It fails to recognise that trafficked women are victims of a serious crime, regardless of the extent to which they are willing or able to assist police. As HREOC argued during the committee inquiry:
Restricting access to recovery and support programs to those women who undertake to assist the investigation or prosecution of trafficking offences and to those women whose evidence is considered to be of value, means that many victims of trafficking would not be eligible for any assistance despite suffering significant human rights abuses. From a human rights point of view, access to these programs should be on the basis of need.
But perhaps the most compelling argument came from Project Respect, which made the point that this approach to victim support:
... creates the impression that we are using the women like the traffickers—when they are of use to us (through helping with a prosecution) we will provide them protection and support; in contrast, if they provide no benefit to Australia, they will be deported.
It is important to remember that, as soon as these women come forward and provide information to the police, they are putting their personal safety at risk and it is their safety which must be the first priority. The failure of the government’s current protection regime is illustrated in the case of a 27-year-old Thai woman known as Julie. As reported in the West Australian on Saturday, 7 May, Julie was forced into sex slavery in 2001, but subsequently escaped and lived underground with her Australian boyfriend. After the government introduced its new protection measures, Julie was one of the first sex slaves in Australia to come forward and provide information to the police. However, the police considered that Julie’s evidence was not strong enough to mount a prosecution against her perpetrators and her visa was cancelled. That prompted Julie to again disappear, but she was found by the police in January and, as far as I am aware, has remained in detention in Villawood detention centre to this day. Her lawyer says, ‘She is really frightened and depressed,’ and the fact that she has provided information to police puts her at great risk.
Julie’s case, I think, illustrates vividly the irony of Australia’s approach—an approach which puts the victims of trafficking behind bars, while their perpetrators remain free. Who knows: Julie’s traffickers may already have brought another woman into Australia to replace her at the brothel. The case also illustrates the fact that trafficking crimes are often difficult to prosecute. That is because trafficked women often suffer attacks on their credibility as witnesses. It is important to remember that those women work in the sex industry and must often overcome prejudices and assumptions associated with that industry. The issues surrounding the credibility of trafficking victims can perhaps be compared to issues surrounding the credibility of victims of rape, which have been well documented over many years. For example, it has been argued that sexually active rape victims are often viewed as less credible witnesses than women who were virgins at the time of their rape, despite the fact that each of those women is a victim of the same crime.
If Australia’s protection regime relies not only on the cooperation of victims with the police—as stated by the government—but also on their credibility as witnesses, then the protection promised is virtually illusory. That means that there is little incentive for other trafficked women to come forward, and the likely effect therefore is that those women will remain in sexual slavery, where their fundamental rights are violated each day. As Natalie O’Brien reported in the West Australian on 7 May, advocates and lawyers are concerned that Julie’s deportation from Australia would ‘seriously hinder future investigations into sex-trafficking syndicates in Australia’.
While providing incentives for women to assist police is a vital consideration, the primary concern must always be for the safety and wellbeing of the women concerned. Those issues underline calls for the government to delink protection for trafficked women from the provision of assistance to police. We Democrats take this opportunity to reiterate those calls. Now that the government has largely fulfilled its legislative obligations under the trafficking protocol, we ask it to now turn its attention to rectifying the very serious problems associated with the protection regime itself. I note that the US State Department’s most recent Trafficking in persons report—released just a couple of weeks ago—recommends that Australia should consider expanding its protection efforts for women who cooperate with police but who are not part of a viable prosecution. We Democrats would go one step further and say that the only qualification for assistance should be that these women are victims of a serious crime, whether or not they are willing to assist police. There may be a whole range of legitimate reasons why these women may be reluctant to assist the police, including fear and the potential trauma involved in recounting their experiences before a court.
At a time when Australia’s mandatory detention regime is again under the spotlight, we Democrats put on record our view that there is no justification whatsoever for placing the victims of gross violations of human rights behind bars. Such treatment will only exacerbate the sense of entrapment that they suffered whilst in slavery. In closing, I congratulate the government on introducing this bill and on taking up many of the committee’s recommendations for improvement, but I remind the government that this is just the next step towards Australia’s compliance with the protocol and that we still have some way to go.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS OFFENCES) BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,36,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-20,"—The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 [2005] follows a review of Australia’s laws to address the trafficking in people. It introduces new criminal offences and extends other offences. The bill is designed to implement the United Nations protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children. While the government says that the bill ‘ensures Australia meets, and actually exceeds, its obligations’ under the protocol, there are several concerns about the legislation. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s inquiry into the bill picked up a number of these concerns, and the Greens support the bulk of the committee’s recommendations in its report tabled in March. We are pleased that the government has reconsidered its position on the committee’s recommendations and has adopted most of them. We also understand that, while the government did not accept the committee’s recommendation to extend the bill to trafficking as it relates to servile marriages, the government is looking into this matter. However, we believe there are still problems with the government’s approach to this issue.
People are trafficked to provide labour and there is evidence that this extends to the construction industry, clothing and textiles, domestic work—for example, through forced marriages—and sexual services. The exploitation of people is repugnant and never acceptable. It offends basic principles of human decency and justice and it is a cause of great distress that so many people are exploited in this way every day. The Australian Greens support international and national efforts to prevent exploitation and to punish those responsible. However, the Australian government’s approach to the problem as an entirely criminal and law enforcement matter leaves unaddressed important issues. For example, it does nothing to improve the rights, the access to justice or the access to legal routes of labour migration for the individuals who are caught up in trafficking into Australia, nor does it address their social issues. The increased criminalisation of aspects of trafficking runs the risk also of further marginalising and making vulnerable the very individuals that the legislation is trying to protect.
Mobile work forces are not new, but the numbers of people wanting to and prepared to travel across national borders for work has increased greatly. This is a feature of globalisation, and earning capacity is the main reason for it. People with large amounts of capital have the right to invest in more and more nations around the world. But the movement of human labour has become increasingly regulated and it is harder for workers to move around. As there is increased demand for work in other countries at the same time border security has tightened, the role of the trafficker has increased. More money than ever is to be made by traffickers assisting the illegal entry of people into Australia. A trafficker may organise visas, false documents, passports, air tickets, accommodation and, vitally, work at the other end of the trip, either overseas or within domestic borders. It is an illegal form of migrant labour and may involve deception, force, threats and blackmail.
The common element of this form of labour is a lack of rights to justice, industrial relations laws, equal pay and industrial arbitration in the country they are illegally working in. However, there is a longstanding human rights campaign to render these illegal workers with rights under an international protocol. The international convention on the protection of rights of all migrant workers addresses these issues but has not come into force because not enough countries have signed it. Australia is not a signatory. If it were, migrant workers in Australia would be afforded the same rights as Australian workers. The Greens urge the government to ratify this convention.
Trafficking in the sex industry is part of this expanded illegal movement of workers. Exploitation in the sex industry is complex, as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission stated in its report of June 2004. While it was unable to accurately estimate the extent of trafficking in women for sex work, it noted general acceptance that the number was around 300 women a year but that the proportion of these women likely to be in servitude was relatively small. The committee’s report stated:
Contract women who have been trafficked into Australia represent a continuum of those who enter with full knowledge and consent; those who enter with consent but are deceived as to conditions; and those who enter Australia completely deceived as to their work in the sex industry.
A legislative regime and policy framework that assumes all foreign sex workers in Australia have been trafficked into the industry is then not appropriate. The Scarlet Alliance, which is the Australian sex workers association, represents sex workers and sex worker organisations in Australia and is a member of the Asia-Pacific Network of Sex Workers. The Scarlet Alliance has raised concerns about the bill and its unintended impact on women working by choice in the sex industry, which is largely legalised or decriminalised in Australia. The Scarlet Alliance estimates that fewer than 400 women annually enter a financial contract to enable them to gain entry to the Australian sex industry. These are women who have been unable to obtain legal entry to Australia to work in this industry. Scarlet Alliance president, Janelle Fawkes, told the Senate inquiry into this bill that this is a discriminatory and potentially dangerous situation. She said:
By denying sex workers visas to enter Australia, the federal government has created de facto sex industry law. Even though sex industry law is currently determined by states and territories, the status of migrant sex workers is in the hands of the federal government and will be further criminalised under these proposed amendments.
The bill creates the offence of debt bondage, and the minister in his second reading speech stated:
This offence prevents traffickers from using unfair debt contracts and other similar arrangements to force victims into providing sexual services or other labour to pay off large debts supposedly incurred by the trafficker in transporting the victim to Australia.
He went on to say:
This new offence will not criminalise legitimate employment arrangements that are not exploitative or unfair.
But the Scarlet Alliance says that the sex industry is being singled out for mention in the context of addressing trafficking when this is not warranted and that the effect of this is to criminalise activities that should not be made criminal. This singling out, the group says, will lead to law enforcement agencies targeting the legal sex industry. The bill need not specify sexual services because they are already a subset of forced labour for the purposes of giving effect to the UN protocol that the legislation seeks to give effect to. The protocol does not single out sexual services in its definition of trafficking in persons. Article 3A of the protocol defines trafficking in persons as:
... the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.
Ms Fawkes says that businesses that fear being raided by Immigration compliance officers and the Federal Police have taken to operating in a less open manner. This has impeded the group’s contact with sex workers, which undermines the good work that has been done in promoting safe sexual practices. The legal and constitutional committee report on the bill said that the government should take up this matter when further consulting with state and territory governments on the bill. In particular, the committee stated:
... further consideration can be given to the implications of the debt bondage and domestic trafficking provisions to sex workers in State and Territory jurisdictions which have legalised or decriminalised prostitution.
It is disappointing that the federal government has chosen not to do this. There are no mechanisms to support people who have been affected by trafficking and who want the right to work in Australia, not deportation. These people will continue to avoid detection, police and authorities. They will remain in the criminal labour market without a safety net. Australia is not protecting the human rights of these people.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has expressed concern about the way the Australian government has tied its support for victims of trafficking to their cooperation with investigation and prosecution of trafficking offences. In its submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill, HREOC said this approach meant that victims of trafficking will receive no support or assistance despite having suffered significant abuse of their human rights. Under the government’s policy, a woman who has been trafficked and agrees to help in an investigation and possibly a prosecution is allowed to stay until the process is completed. She then faces the difficulty of returning to her home country, which can carry considerable risks even with some assistance to reintegrate. HREOC argues quite rightly that women who are victims of trafficking have suffered a breach of their human rights in Australia and should be treated better than they are under the current regime. As Senator Greig mentioned, there is a woman sitting in Villawood detention centre right now awaiting deportation after she agreed to assist police in a prosecution for trafficking offences but was told by them that her evidence was not useful. She was then picked up by DIMIA and placed in an immigration detention centre in Sydney.
HREOC makes the pertinent point that this kind of treatment acts as a disincentive to other people to come forward and assist with investigations and prosecutions. HREOC has recommended that the government review its approach to people who assist with investigations and prosecutions, pointing out that other countries leading the way on this issue do not tie support and recovery programs to assisting with investigations and prosecutions. This is entirely reasonable and we hope that the government will now review its policy, which has been in place for around 18 months. One minor but important improvement that could be made would be to require immigration department officials to use an interpreter when raiding workplaces suspected of involvement in trafficking.
The Greens will be supporting this bill and the amendments to this bill. However, we think that the government needs to refocus Australia’s response to the issue of trafficking away from the criminal and law enforcement approach that it has adopted so far. This focus has meant that the government has overlooked the needs and human rights of those people most affected by trafficking. This bill does nothing to improve rights, access to justice, legal routes of labour migration or social issues for people who have been caught up in trafficking into Australia. As I said before, the increased criminalisation of aspects of trafficking may serve to further marginalise and make vulnerable the very people that the government is trying to protect. The government, we believe, needs to go back to the states and territories, as recommended in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report into this bill, to discuss how to address the concerns of sex workers. The government should examine permitting migrants to work in the sex industry where it is legal as this measure could reduce the influence of traffickers into Australia.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS OFFENCES) BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,36,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-06-20,"—On 26 June 2003, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission decided to conduct an inquiry into trafficking of women for sexual servitude. The inquiry was instigated by Senator Brian Greig, who leaves us at the end of the week. The committee subsequently reported in June 2004. Among its recommendations was that the government ratify the trafficking protocol as soon as possible. In fact, as was noted in the national interest analysis, a number of the protocol’s obligations could be implemented administratively or under existing legislation. That and the amending legislation we are now debating substantially advance the fight against people-trafficking of all varieties.
During the course of the inquiry the government introduced a national action plan to combat the trade. It included a range of measures, including legislative review across all Australian jurisdictions, the creation of an Australian Federal Police Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team, improved arrangements for cooperation between relevant Commonwealth agencies and a new victim support system. At the time the parliamentary joint committee reported in June last year, it was obviously too early to assess the effectiveness of these reforms. However, since 12 months have now passed it is timely to reassess the situation. Accordingly, the committee has invited officers of the Australian Crime Commission and others to provide the committee with an update on the progress of the antitrafficking measures. This will occur on Thursday morning this week. It will certainly enable Senator Greig to make one final formal contribution to that debate and process. Witnesses will include Ms Joanne Blackburn, First Assistant Secretary of the Criminal Justice Division in the Attorney-General’s Department; Mr Alastair Milroy, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission; and Mr Vincent McMahon, Executive Coordinator of the Border Control and Compliance Division in the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.
As chair of the parliamentary joint committee, I naturally have and will continue to have a close interest in these matters. But, of course, everyone does, because trafficking in persons is effectively a modern version of slavery and it offends every moral principle that decent people anywhere would have. It is difficult to estimate the size of the global people-trafficking problem. The Attorney-General’s Department, in a submission to the parliamentary joint committee inquiry completed last year, said that it is estimated that anywhere from 700,000 to four million people are trafficked worldwide in a year. There is no agreement, let alone statistics on the size of the problem in Australia. It is true that much of the discussion about people-trafficking focuses on the trafficking of women for sexual servitude. But people-trafficking takes place for a variety of end purposes, including domestic service, forced marriage and sweatshop labour. Forced sex work is the most visible end result of trafficking, especially in developed countries such as Australia, but there is no evidence that it is the most common.
The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 [2005], which is before us today, takes account, from the government’s perspective, of the recommendations of the committee inquiry. It inserts new people-trafficking offences into the Criminal Code in new division 271, which is based on the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, or the trafficking convention. The bill creates an offence of debt bondage in new section 271.8 where a person intentionally causes another person to enter into debt bondage, with a maximum term of imprisonment of 12 months. As a measure to deter debt bondage in young people, an offence of aggravated debt bondage occurs under this bill when the victim is under 18. The maximum term for this offence is double—that is, two years. The bill is good augmenting legislation and should be supported by everyone in this chamber who is interested in widening the fight against people-trafficking. It maintains the integrity of Australia’s migration law and immigration control. That too is reason to support its passage through the parliament.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS OFFENCES) BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,36,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2005-06-20,"—I rise to speak briefly on the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 [2005], which is a good, solid piece of legislation. I hope that it receives bipartisan support. This bill will ensure a number of offences of trafficking in persons is added to the Australian Criminal Code in an effort to reduce the incidence of people-trafficking globally and to ensure Australia also complies with the United Nations protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children.
The new offences inserted into this bill relate to trafficking and debt bondage offences, which are in addition to the offences of slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting, which were added to the Criminal Code in 1999. The offences of trafficking children will also now make up part of the Criminal Code. Debt bondage is where a victim pledges personal services as security for paying off an incurred debt to the person who arranged the victim’s travel or entry into that country. This includes services of a sexual nature and slavery. People-trafficking is a worldwide problem and, while often associated with people-smuggling, trafficking is a much more dangerous situation where victims have not consented to their movement. The traffickers almost always are deceptive and abusive and exploit their victims for profit. People-trafficking also differs from the smuggling of migrants in that it need not be transnational. Trafficking often occurs within countries.
It is important that Australia ensures that it is doing everything it can to not only punish those who take part in people-trafficking but try to discourage the practice from occurring. While trafficking in persons is something that would be condemned by almost everybody, Australia is leading the way in taking action against this insidious practice. The amendments to this existing legislation will ensure that Australia remains a world leader in the fight against people-trafficking.
In addition, this bill will allow Australia to comply with the United Nations protocol relating to people-trafficking. In 2002-03, the number of referrals to the Australian Federal Police of allegations of people-trafficking rose dramatically. It is unknown whether this indicates an increase in the practice occurring or just an increase in the reporting of these allegations. Nevertheless, the Australian government is acting upon these circumstances, and I think the Senate should support the legislation.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS OFFENCES) BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,36,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-06-20,"—in reply—I thank those senators who have participated in the second reading debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 [2005], which is a very important one. It is fair to say that all those who have spoken this evening in the Senate share a common concern in relation to the trafficking of persons in relation to sexual services. Indeed, this not only relates to women but includes children as well.
The Howard government have given this issue a high priority in relation to targeting it from a law enforcement point of view. The $20 million package which we announced a while ago covers a range of issues dealing with sex trafficking, be it providing an immigration official in Thailand, dealing with overseas governments and authorities in relation to clamping down on this insidious trade or an Australian Federal Police task force investigating a number of complaints, which has resulted in prosecutions that are now pending in the courts in Australia. It is something that the government have taken up with our neighbours especially in the region, and it is something that I have raised repeatedly with my counterparts I have met. I have certainly had a good deal to do with the NGOs involved in this area, and I thank them for the good work that they are doing. I thank all senators for their support of this legislation.
This legislation is simply a step further in the fight against the eradication of sex trafficking. It is staggering to think that in this modern day and age we have people being prosecuted for sexual slavery and sexual servitude. That is an outrageous situation and one which this government will not tolerate. We appreciate the support we have received from the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens in relation to this. I also acknowledge that both Senator Ludwig and Senator Greig have had a longstanding interest in this issue. This is certainly something that we can succeed with on a bipartisan basis; our fight against it can be much more effective. It is something that I have taken up with the state and territory governments as well. We are receiving cooperation from state and territory law enforcement, which is essential. The Police Ministers Council just recently in Brisbane re-endorsed its priority and commitment to fighting this insidious conduct. A number of government amendments are to be moved, and I understand that the opposition also have amendments. It is best that they are addressed in the committee stage. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-06-20,"—by leave—I move government amendments (2), (3) and (4):
(2)    Schedule 1, item 136, page 34 (line 27), omit “to ensure that”, substitute “for”.
 (3)   Schedule 1, item 136, page 34 (line 28) to page 35 (line 4), omit paragraphs (2)(a) and (b), substitute:
              (a)    if the purported order was of a kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(a) or (b)—the repayment to the maintenance provider, by the person to whom the amount or amounts referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this section were paid, of an amount up to, or equal to, that amount or the sum of those amounts; or
              (b)    if the purported order was of the kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(c)—the return to the maintenance provider of:
                    (i)    the property referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of this section; or
                   (ii)    an amount up to, or equal to, the value of that property.
The court may only order the repayment of an amount that is less than the amount, or the sum of the amounts, referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this section, or the return of an amount that is less than the value of the property referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of this section, in exceptional circumstances.
 (4)   Schedule 1, item 136, page 35 (after line 23), at the end of section 66X, add:
         (5)    An amount paid to the Commonwealth under section 30 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been paid to the person to whom, apart from that section, the amount would have been payable.
There are two sets of government amendments to the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005. I appreciate the opposition’s advice on the amendments to the effect that they will not support amendments (2) and (3); nonetheless I will address amendments (2), (3) and (4) as a whole. These amendments affect section 66X and part 14 of the bill. The amendments allow the court when ordering recovery of child maintenance under section 66X to order repayment of less than the full amount of moneys paid, or less than the full value of property transferred, but only in exceptional circumstances. This gives the court a discretion to reduce the amount of repayment or the value of property to be returned if the person against whom an order would be made can show that there are exceptional circumstances in justifying that reduction. Exceptional circumstances might include where the making of an order would force the person concerned into bankruptcy. The government remains strongly of the view that in circumstances where a person has been found not to have been the biological father of a child and has paid child maintenance that person should have a right to restitution of that amount.
However, the government also recognises that there will be very limited circumstances where full restitution is not appropriate. The changes to section 66X also ensure that an order for repayment of child maintenance cannot be made against the Child Support Agency, which effectively replicates a similar provision in the child support legislation. This provision is necessary because section 30 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 provides that a child maintenance liability under a child maintenance order made by a court which is registered with the Child Support Agency becomes a debt owed to the Commonwealth. The absence of the proposed amendment could lead to a liability for the Child Support Agency to repay the money, given that the payments are due and owing to the agency. I commend amendments (2), (3) and (4) to the committee.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,38,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I will say at the outset that we will take that on board the government’s explanation about amendments (2) and (3) to the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005. The government has provided further and better particulars in relation to those amendments, although belatedly, and we will examine them further and consider what our position will in fact be. It may be that the government’s explanation as to how that section will operate may be persuasive after all but we will need to consider it overnight at least.
In terms of the government’s proposed amendments, they would allow the court to reduce the amount that is recovered in exceptional circumstances. While this is belated recognition that the early provision was too rigid and could lead to unfair outcomes, Labor is not satisfied that this in fact goes far enough. ‘Exceptional circumstances’ is a vague test. The reality is that all these cases arise, most likely, in exceptional circumstances to begin with. Given the small sample of cases the court is ever likely to see, it is difficult in our view to see how the court could develop a sense of what are the normal hardships and what is exceptional in this field when considering this type of remedy.
As I have said in my second reading contribution, Labor welcomes the intention of part 14 of the bill but still harbours concerns about the outcomes that it could produce if applied too rigidly. The court needs to have the ability to assess the whole financial situation of both parties, whether or not deliberate deception or an honest mistake was involved and whether or not the maintenance payer had done everything he or she could, such as bringing a speedy claim, to mitigate the hardship that recovery would cause to the other party. The court needs to be able to consider all of these factors and make a decision that is just and equitable in all the circumstances. I am unconvinced at this point as to whether or not the government amendments achieve this. For Labor, one of the most convincing arguments in favour of this provision is that a similar remedy is already available under the Child Support Assessment Act 1989 which covers the vast majority of cases of this kind. It seems to us that if men who find they are not the biological fathers of children can recover maintenance paid under the CS(A) Act, then they should be allowed to do so if they happen to come under the Family Law Act 1975. But the CS(A) Act does not give the court a wide discretion. The words of the relevant provision of that act say:
In a proceeding in a court under this section, the court may—
and I stress the word ‘may’—
make such orders as it considers just and equitable for the purpose of adjusting or giving effect to the rights of the parties and the child concerned.
The bill before us is much less flexible. In fact, with the government’s amendments it is quite clear that the court may not exercise discretion to reduce the amount repayable unless it finds exceptional circumstances. It is difficult to understand why the government has not approached its position by using the same area from the CS(A) Act as a model for the changes to this area proposed in this bill. It would have seemed more likely that they would have adopted a similar model to that used under the CSA legislation rather than the one proposed. However, as I said at the outset, we will take on board overnight the particulars that you have raised with us recently and we will be able to give them a little bit more consideration in that intervening period. When we examine the arguments that you have provided more closely we may find ourselves persuaded by them but, at this juncture, we still maintain that the position you have presented is not the best option.
But Labor agrees that it is not fair for people under the CS(A) Act to enjoy a right of recovery that those under the Family Law Act do not. But this bill and the amendments would, it appears, overcorrect the problem. It does seem to make it easier to get recovery under the Family Law Act than under the CS(A) Act. Labor will be supporting an amendment that gets the balance right and makes sure the court has the same discretion under both statutes.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,38,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-06-20,"—We share with Labor some mixed views on this. The object of government amendment (2) is to make a slight change to the wording in proposed section 66X(2). We Democrats have already expressed our concerns regarding the prescriptive nature of the language in that section, which arguably leaves no discretion for the court to decide not to make an order for repayment. The bill currently says that the court must make an order ‘to ensure that’ the mistaken father is repaid. This amendment changes the wording so that it states that the court must make an order ‘for’ the repayment. It is unclear which of these places a stronger obligation on the court. From my perspective, both are unsatisfactory. We Democrats object strongly to the form of words used by the government here, and that is exactly why we are proposing what we believe is a far better alternative form of wording, as illustrated in our amendment (1).
Government amendment (3) seeks to make it clear that the court can make an order for part repayment of child maintenance. We support the principle, although we think that the government’s amendment retains too much of the prescriptive language to which we object in the current provision. Again, we feel that that is better covered in Democrat amendment (1). Government amendment (4) is one we can readily support. That amendment makes it clear that the Child Support Agency cannot be sued for repayment of child maintenance in cases where it has been an agent for the collection of child maintenance. So, in summary, we do not support government amendments (2) and (3), but can support government amendment (4).

(Senator Lightfoot)—I will split the question and put government amendments (2) and (3) first. The question is that government amendments (2) and (3) be agreed to.
Question negatived.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I wish to speak briefly on government amendment (4). This amendment closes a potential gap which would have allowed recovery of maintenance against the Child Support Agency as the collector of maintenance. This amendment makes it clear that the Child Support Agency is not to be understood as the payee in those circumstances and ensures that the right to recovery is against the person who ultimately received the maintenance payment. It is a logical amendment and Labor supports it.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-06-20,"—I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 4569:
(1)    Schedule 1, item 136, page 34 (line 24) to page 35 (line 4), omit subsection 66X(2), substitute:
         (2)    If the maintenance provider applies to a court having jurisdiction under this Part for an order under this subsection, the court may make such order that it considers just and equitable in the circumstances, including:
              (a)    if the purported order was of a kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(a) or (b)—an order for the repayment to the maintenance provider, by the person to whom the amount or amounts referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) of this section were paid, of an amount up to, or equal to, that amount or the sum of those amounts; or
              (b)    if the purported order was of the kind referred to in paragraph 66P(1)(c)—an order for the return to the maintenance provider of:
                    (i)    the property, or part of the property, referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of this section; or
                   (ii)    an amount up to, or equal to, the value of that property.
With this amendment we are proposing to address our concerns with what we feel is the prescriptive language of proposed section 66X, which creates doubt about the court’s discretion, if any, to make or not to make an order for the repayment of child maintenance. Our amendment makes it clear that the court may make such an order but it does not say that the court must make such an order. This puts beyond any doubt—I hope—that child maintenance repayments is an issue for the discretion of the court, taking into account the circumstances of the case. This amendment also, I hope, addresses the government’s concern that the current provisions do not allow for an order for partial repayment of wrongfully paid child maintenance. So our amendment makes it clear that the court may make an order for partial repayment.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,38,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-06-20,"—If this provision is not passed, then victims of fraud will have to rely on common law actions such as recovery of a debt or the tort of deceit and restitution. We have made it very clear that a victim of paternity fraud should have the right to recover losses—moneys paid as a result of that paternity fraud. The discretion the Democrats are proposing here is, we believe, too broad. Of course, although there are common law actions available, they do not take into account exceptional circumstances such as hardship to the mother. I believe that the proposal that the government have is the better one. The government prefer that one and so will not support the Democrat amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,38,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I appreciate the strength of the minister’s argument, but we think there is merit in the Democrat proposal. It is in fact an amendment that Labor would have moved if the Democrats had not moved it. It goes to the heart of the concerns we have with the provision of part 14. We still have concerns with part 14. We have not been convinced by what the minister has said about the operation of that particular area and how it will ensure fairness between the parties.
This amendment recognises that a right to recovery could create some unfair outcomes if applied too rigidly. By the same token, though, not to provide a right to recover at all would be unfair to those people who have paid maintenance under a misapprehension that they are a parent of the child. We have to remember that, in most cases, we are trying to work out who should bear the costs of what is likely to be a mistake, and good arguments have been progressed by all sides.
In Labor’s view, the only way around this difficult dilemma is to trust our courts to make the right decision on the basis of each case before them. Each case will have different circumstances. The courts need to be given the discretion to consider the relevant factors and make a decision that is just and equitable in the particular circumstances of the case. It is likely to be a small area, but those people who do have an argument and wish to be able to run that argument should be able to be heard on the equity principle.
The words used in this amendment come close to the words used in the Child Support (Assessment) Act. In our view, it is preferable to pick up those words because it means that cases that arise under the Family Law Act will yield similar results to cases that arise under the child support act. One thing that bedevils us all is where you get different decisions because of the wording provided for in legislation. When the outcomes sought by the parties are in fact the same or similar, they are sometimes not delivered because of the wording. I am sure we have all read cases where the judges have said, ‘If the legislation was worded differently, I might have been able to provide equity between the parties.’ But they have to apply the law as written.
We have not been persuaded by what the government has said in relation to there being a difference, why that difference exists and whether or not it will yield different results. This amendment will endeavour to yield similar results under the child support act—as I noted in my speech in the second reading debate—and therefore this amendment is supported.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-06-20,"—I move Democrat amendment (2) on sheet 4569:
(2)    Schedule 1, item 136, page 35 (after line 23), at the end of section 66X, add:
         (5)    In determining whether to make an order under subsection (2), the court must give primary consideration to the likely impact of such an order on the maintenance and wellbeing of the child.
We believe this is a simple amendment. This amendment aims to ensure that, in deciding whether to make an order for the repayment of child maintenance, the court must give its primary consideration to the wellbeing of the child. This goes to the heart of the Democrats’ concerns regarding the repayment provisions.
We are trying to ensure that the best interests of the child are always given the utmost priority. Of course, it is desirable to ensure repayment for those who have wrongfully paid child maintenance under the misapprehension that they are a parent of the child; however, in some circumstances, this could have dire consequences for the child. Under the current provisions, the court is not required to give any consideration to this potential and dramatic impact. In fact, the government has drafted the bill in such a way that the court is compelled to make an order for repayment regardless of the circumstances of the case.
In our view, the issue of repayment should be left to the discretion of the court—after all, the courts are well equipped to apply general principles to a range of different circumstances. In this context, the general principle to be applied is that someone who has wrongfully paid child maintenance should be reimbursed; however, it may be that the circumstances of the case require this principle to be tweaked a little or adapted somewhat. This may not necessarily mean that the court refuses to make an order for repayment; more than likely, the court will order some form of repayment, even if it is not full repayment. Another option might be for the court to formulate a repayment plan which reduces the financial burden on the mother. But, for us, the bottom line is that the court should attempt to minimise any adverse impact on the child. As I said, we see this as a simple amendment and one which we believe is eminently justified.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,38,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I will give Senator Greig the bad news first: Labor are not going to support this amendment. We did have a careful look at this amendment to see whether it progressed the argument that we have been running about fairness. Senator Greig may be able to comment on this or provide another view but, when we looked at the amendment in detail, it appeared to us that this amendment would require the court to consider the maintenance and wellbeing of the child as the primary considerations in making any order under these provisions.
We can clearly see the direction that Senator Greig and the Democrats are coming from and the argument that they are progressing, but this amendment could mean that there is no right of recovery. If the child still resides with the person who received the maintenance, it is never going to be in the child’s interest for the maintenance to be repaid—at least not until the child is 18. It is important that the best interests of the child test remain the paramount consideration in family law in disputes between parents or over parenting issues but, in these cases, we are dealing with the rights of someone who is not a parent but whose rights and interests must also be considered.
Of course, in exercising its discretion and determining what is just and equitable in the circumstances, the court will have to consider what harm might be done to the interests of the child by awarding recovery. This is one of the reasons that we have wanted to see a clear discretion available to the court—as I think I have said during this committee debate—but we do not think it needs to be the primary consideration in these cases. That is where we perhaps depart from the Democrats. In this debate, there are other interests to be considered along with interests of the parents and the child, and we want to ensure that the court has that discretion. That goes to the nub of the dilemma I mentioned earlier in my contribution.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-06-20,"—Before the dinner break the opposition had indicated that it would not support Democrat amendment (2), and the government is of a similar view. Whilst the government agrees that the interests of the child are paramount, that has to be balanced against the need for victims of fraud to obtain justice and a fair outcome. As well as that, you have to look at the rights of other children who are the biological children of the person who is the victim of the fraud. So you have these competing balances and the government says that its approach does not in any way diminish its concern for the welfare of children. Indeed, you have a potential conflict between two groups of children—those who have received the maintenance as a result of a fraud and those who are the biological children of the person who is the victim of fraud.
In sync with that, if you like, is the competing interest of victims of fraud to obtain justice and a fair outcome. Those are competing interests and ones which have to be taken into account. For that reason, the government does not support the Democrat amendment, which states that the best interests of the children should be the primary consideration and that discretion would be there to rule against those other competing interests. For that reason, the government does not support this amendment.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-06-20,"—I move Democrat amendment (3) on sheet 4569:
(3)    Schedule 1, item 136, page 35 (after line 23), at the end of section 66X, add:
         (6)    If the court:
              (a)    proposes to make an order under subsection (2); and
              (b)    determines that a person:
                    (i)    is a parent of the child; and
                   (ii)    may have been required to pay child maintenance in respect of the child if the court had been aware that the maintenance provider was not a parent of the child at the time of making the purported order;
the court must consider whether it is just and equitable in the circumstances to make an order under Part VII, Division 7, requiring the person referred to in this subsection to pay an amount, or transfer or settle property, by way of maintenance for the child, including a retrospective order.
         (7)    Nothing in subsection (6) is intended to limit the power of the court to make a child maintenance order under Part VII, Division 7.
This amendment seeks to ensure that, before making an order for the repayment of child maintenance, the court gives consideration to the possibility of a child maintenance order being made against the biological father. As I said in my contribution to the second reading debate, the court is already empowered to make retrospective child maintenance orders against any person who is a parent of the child. In other words, our amendment does not increase or augment the power of the court in any way; rather, it requires the court to turn its mind to the potential for a child maintenance order against the biological father before making an order for repayment of maintenance to the mistaken father.
Clearly, this is a relevant consideration for the court, which may directly affect the court’s decision whether to make a repayment order or concerning the amount of that order. Indeed, the Democrats’ amendment may prove beneficial not only to women and children affected by this new power but also to men who are seeking repayment for wrongfully paid child maintenance. That is because, by proactively considering whether a child maintenance order can be made against the biological father, thereby limiting the impact on the mother and the child, the court may be more likely to make a repayment order in favour of the mistaken father. The court could even adjourn the mistaken father’s application for repayment, pending the outcome of the application for a child maintenance order against the biological father. I think this is an important provision, the object of which is to limit the potential adverse impact of repayment orders on women and children.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,38,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-20,"—Democrat amendment (3) effectively allows recovery against a biological father. The Labor Party do not support the amendment moved by Senator Greig. The advice from the government—I hate to admit it sometimes—is probably right about this matter. We understand that the Family Law Act already allows retrospective recovery against the biological parent at the discretion of the court. Accordingly, we do not think this amendment is necessary when you look at it in that light. If the mother in this instance believes it is appropriate to join the biological father to proceedings for a claim for retrospective maintenance, that is a matter on which she can take advice from her lawyers. In that case, the court would be required to consider whether or not that is a realistic option and make a determination, based on the submissions that are made by the parties with respect to that matter. But we do not think it is appropriate to require the court to independently consider the issue, especially as the biological father may not even be a party to the proceedings. In essence, the court system works in a way that ensures that the parties would bring the action for joinder—not the court independently coming up with the idea that it should do that—and I think that is the appropriate way of proceeding with this matter. Unfortunately, in this instance, we do not support the Democrat amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,38,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-06-20,"—The government does not support this amendment either. We believe there is no need for it. A right for the mother to claim maintenance from the biological father already exists under division 7 of part VII of the Family Law Act in respect of children to which the new clause 66X would apply. Under the act, the court has a wide discretion to make any child maintenance order it considers appropriate. The period covered by that order would be a matter for the court’s discretion, considering the objects of division 7, the principle object being to ensure that children receive a proper level of financial support from their parents. In any proceedings against the biological father under existing provisions of division 7, the court would not be limited to awarding the amount recovered under the original order in clause 66X proceedings. Accordingly, the government does not support Democrats amendment (3).

   Part 17
Immediately after the commencement of Schedule 1 to the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005.

Part 17—Alteration of property interests

139  After subsection 79(10)
Insert:
    (10A)    Subsection (10) does not apply to a creditor of a party to the proceedings:
              (a)    if the party is a bankrupt—to the extent to which the debt is a provable debt (within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act 1966); or
              (b)    if the party is a debtor subject to a personal insolvency agreement—to the extent to which the debt is covered by the personal insolvency agreement.
These are the second set of amendments I alluded to earlier. Amendment (5) adds a new part 17 to the bill to insert clause 79(10A) in the Family Law Act 1975. The effect of this amendment is to clarify the role of third-party creditors in family property proceedings, allowing the trustee in a bankruptcy to represent the interests of all creditors in cases where a party is bankrupt or subject to a personal insolvency agreement. This amendment supplements the reforms made under the recently enacted Bankruptcy Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005 relating to the interaction of family law and bankruptcy law and should have been included with these amendments but was omitted by oversight. The amendment corrects that oversight. Government amendment (1) is part and parcel of the amendment to cure the oversight.

I do not want to bring back the days of that bill. The amendments provide that the right of creditors of a party to participate in certain family law property proceedings in the act may not be exercised if the party is bankrupt and the debt is provable or if the party is a debtor under a personal insolvency agreement. This is a sensible change in this area. It ensures that creditors cannot look to the Family Court for relief when the debt has already been dealt with through other means. Therefore, the amendments find Labor Party support.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I rise to speak on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. I foreshadow at the outset that Labor will be moving a second reading amendment to this bill. I understand that it has not yet been circulated, but we will endeavour to do that as soon as possible. Labor is supporting this bill, obviously with the second reading amendment that has been foreshadowed. As we understand it, the amendments proposed in the bill are essentially of a housekeeping nature. But we do want to raise some concerns in the context of this second reading debate with the minister’s handling of issues to do with ozone protection and synthetic greenhouse gas. These have caused concerns within the industry. Our second reading amendment will go to this issue.
One of the primary areas of Labor’s concern is this minister’s failure to appoint an industry board for the refrigerant industry. There are possible severe consequences for the airconditioning and refrigeration industry, including for food processing facilities, hospitals and storage facilities, as a result of this failure because this is the board which issues licences that will be required by law for 50,000, or thereabouts, tradespeople after 1 July 2005. The fact is that the purpose of this licensing regime was to minimise gas emissions controlled by the Kyoto protocol. Members who were here may recall that the amendments to the legislation dealing with ozone protection were included in the introduction of this act in November 2003.
This government has spent about $5 million worth of taxpayers’ money on the operation of a voluntary industry board since 2001, yet we have a situation where, despite much discussion about it, we still have no industry board appointed and no improvement in industry standards. We understand that the minister seems to have had some difficulty meeting with industry representatives who are raising concerns about this issue. Also, the original appointment of the national industry board has been derailed by lobbying from the state body in Minister Campbell’s own state. Now it appears that the board is being reconsidered so as to take in regional and sectoral considerations. Why is this occurring? It is a pity that the minister is not here to deal with this issue. It is a pity that he is not here to explain to the Australian parliament why he has dragged his feet on the appointment of an industry board.
It is the case that the appointment of the industry board is not simply an issue about which environmentalists would have concern. This is an issue about which the industry itself has concerns because, as I said before, around 50,000 tradespeople will be required to be licensed by July 2005, yet we still do not have an industry board. Where is Minister Campbell to explain why he has dragged his feet on this important issue? Why is the government not providing certainty for the refrigerant industry? This is an important issue and we are yet to hear from the minister an explanation as to why he has dragged his feet on this.
The opposition is moving a second reading amendment. We want to make the point in this that the original ozone protection legislation of the Hawke-Keating government was an important step. It was obviously a step taken by the Labor government. The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Legislation Amendment Act 2003 received bipartisan support because it did constructively build on the steps taken by the Hawke and Keating governments in relation to ozone protection.
It is important to understand that the industry board is a keystone of the proposed minimisation program for ozone and synthetic greenhouse gas emissions. This is one of the central ways in which these emissions can be regulated. Yet we still have a situation where the minister has caused unnecessary delays to the appointment of the national industry board. As I understand it, the board was only appointed some two weeks ago. It was, I think, at the end of May or on 1 June or thereabouts. What we do not understand from the opposition’s perspective is why the minister has delayed the appointment of this board for such a period of time given that the industry is reliant upon this licensing process in order to comply with the legislation. This delay in appointing the board was some six months beyond the expectation of the announcement of the board and it really is only a month before the new licensing regime begins. This has caused widespread frustration and confusion in the industry. The government’s delay has ensured that the reforms proposed by the act have been delayed. Unfortunately, the environmental improvements which are the rationale for the original legislation in 2003 have not been achieved.
The failure of the minister to appoint the board in time has meant that around 50,000 tradespeople who work in the food processing, airconditioning and refrigeration industry were concerned that they could not work after 1 July this year. Not only was this a serious industry issue; it is clearly also an issue that is serious for the environment as the licensing regime is designed to phase out greenhouse gases. We on this side of the chamber can only assume that the minister’s tardiness in appointing this board is indicative of this government’s go-slow and negative attitude to the issue of climate change and their failure to actually implement, through their energy policies or by the ratification of the Kyoto protocol, sensible and practical steps to minimising dangerous climate change and to ensure that Australia makes a reasonable contribution to protecting the planet from climate change. On behalf of the opposition I move:
At the end of the motion add:
         “but the Senate:

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-20,"—I rise to speak on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 on behalf of the Democrats. It has two parts. Senator Wong has just outlined, I think to a sufficient and certainly clear degree, the aspects to do with synthetic greenhouse gas and ozone protection. I have just received a copy of the amendment that was circulated, but I have had the opportunity to see it previously. I thank the opposition and their extremely well organised and efficient adviser for getting it to us in advance. I indicate that, having had that pre-emptive opportunity, the Democrats will support the second reading amendment. We concur with the rationale outlined by the Labor Party in relation to that. We do not, of course, stand in the way of the actual schedule of the legislation dealing with ozone protection and synthetic greenhouse gas.
The second aspect of the legislation deals with what is a fairly minor amendment to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act to enable a parcel of land to be sold. I would like to speak to that aspect of the legislation for a few minutes. I say at the start that the Democrats support the proposal and support the legislation, but I would like to put some of the background of it on the record. It is the first real opportunity I have had to fully correct a whole range of outrageous misrepresentations that were made in this chamber about me and the Democrats back in 2001. I have waited a while, but this is my opportunity so I will take it.
The legislation to establish the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust was set up back in 2001. It was first proposed, I think, back in 1999. Over a long period of time there was a Senate committee inquiry; a lot of negotiations involving me, the then minister, Senator Hill, and also the then Labor shadow minister, Senator Bolkus; a lot of meetings with community groups; some involvement from, among others, the inimitable Tom Uren, who always makes his views known; and meetings with what was then the interim trust. The original proposal, which was very flawed, was amended significantly and eventually put to the Senate again in early 2001.
At that stage, on behalf of the Democrats I agreed with the government to pass the legislation, which was heavily amended by the Democrats, because I saw it as a potentially disappearing opportunity—an opportunity that might not return—to protect some absolutely magnificent Defence Force, or former Defence Force, lands on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour and the surrounding parts. I know that politics is politics, and people take the opportunity to score points whenever they can. Nonetheless, I thought the consequent attack by Senator Bolkus and Senator Brown from the Greens on the Democrats for taking that decision was quite extraordinary not only in its misrepresentation but also for the absurd conclusions they drew about what the legislation was going to do.
I feel it is appropriate to take the opportunity, four years down the track and with the trust now having been in operation for that period of time, to really point to the record and show how effectively the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust has been operating; how comprehensively it has been consulting with the community, including on what might seem the very small issue that is dealt with in this legislation; and, frankly, to indicate, in simple terms, that the Democrats were quite clearly right—and have been proven right—in our decision to support the heavily amended legislation, and Labor and the Greens were wrong to oppose it. I do not expect them to all come in here and apologise, but I do think it needs to be put on the record because the clear risk was that, if that legislation had not been passed, those lands were vulnerable for sale.
We have seen this consequently in controversies over the sale of Defence Force lands, whether it is land at Point Nepean, some of the former ADI sites in Western Sydney or, indeed, a much more humble but nonetheless significant site going by the rather humble name of Pooh Corner in my own city of Brisbane. The defence department simply took the opportunity to try to sell all of those lands and to make money off them. In each case, the environment and heritage issues were ignored or put at risk. It took a lot of community campaigning in each of those places to save any of the lands. In Brisbane the key areas were saved, thanks to some very effective local campaigners. There was a reasonable degree of success in Point Nepean and less success—although some success—in Western Sydney. All of those events show that there is a real risk with any government owned lands, particularly somewhere as unbelievably valuable as the Sydney Harbour foreshore. Anybody who has seen those lands could imagine how much selling them for housing, hotels or mansions would bring to the government. I would not be surprised if well into the hundreds of millions of dollars were able to be reaped if they were simply sold to the highest bidder.
The simple fact is that, if this legislation had not been brought in 2001, that could have happened at any time. The government could have sold them off, albeit probably with some interference being run by the state government, and they would have been lost to the public for all time. The opportunity was there to protect them. Over a long period of time the Senate, particularly through the Democrats and the Senate committee process, and by working with the community, improved the legislation dramatically to a stage where it did provide those protections.
This legislation, frankly, shows how extensive those safeguards were, because all we are looking at here is basically a single suburban sized block on a suburban looking street in Markham Close at Mosman, with a disused scout hall on it. It is allowing that single site to be transferred from one schedule of the act to another so that it can be sold and allowing other land of pretty much equal value to be transferred across so that it cannot be sold. The very fact that such a minor transference of suburban blocks in Mosman has to come before this chamber is an indication of the extensive safeguards the Democrats put in place to ensure that these lands were protected and that any actions of the Sydney Harbour Trust that in any way modified that would need to have very close scrutiny—scrutiny to the degree of having it passed or potentially disallowed by this chamber.
One of the extraordinary claims that was made four years ago by Senator Brown, for example, was that the Democrats were throwing away the opportunity to ensure that valuable lands could be incorporated in future into the Sydney Harbour National Park. Thanks to the Democrats, the lands that have been protected and are contained in schedule 1 of the act are incredibly valuable and may well be transferred to the national park in future because the legislation was passed. The land that was able to be sold, again only after a very thorough process, contained suburban housing blocks. Without criticising the people who live in the houses, they are not overly spectacular houses. It is Defence Force housing. I am sure it is functional, but it is not exactly attractive. If I thought of expanding a national park around Sydney Harbour the first thing that would spring to mind would not be to put some of these red brick Defence Force houses, in a suburban cul-de-sac, into a national park.
That attitude showed the extent of the misrepresentation and the lack of awareness of what was involved. It showed that there was no understanding of what lands we were talking about. We were talking about suburban housing and whether it should remain in defence ownership or should be sold off. The flip side was that there was no recognition of what was being done and what was being protected. There was no recognition of the risk, of what would be lost if the legislation was not passed. It has to be emphasised every time that the real risk, if that legislation had not been passed, was that the federal government could have done anything with those lands. Having continued to follow the progress of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust methodically—I would not say ‘meticulously’—over the following years, I have seen that what has been done and is still being done in some of those lands is a very impressive job. It is a model that I wish the federal government had followed in some of its other Defence Force lands.
The ongoing rehabilitation of some of those sites aims not just to preserve them but to enhance them and to open them up to the community. Cockatoo Island might not have environmental value in the traditional sense of the natural environment but it has unbelievable heritage value. It has heritage value that I think most Australians, including most people living in Sydney, are not fully aware of. That island is now finally opened up. Recently having a concert over a weekend on that island in the middle of Sydney Harbour was an amazing step forward from what was basically just an industrial wasteland, closed off to everybody, three or four years ago. All of that happened only because the legislation was passed by this chamber, with the significant amendments put in place by the Democrats.
As I said four years ago, the legislation is an example of the importance of putting policy before politics, of putting saving the environment and heritage opportunities before political opportunities. We all play politics—I do not profess to be any purer than anyone else in that regard—but, from the Democrats’ point of view, we should not do so to the exclusion of significant gains. Quite frankly, whilst it is not the most high-profile piece of legislation ever to pass this place, it is the most clear-cut example of an obvious, clearly definable, major public good that I can think of. It provides environmental and heritage benefits to the people of Australia, and particularly to the people of Sydney, compared to what might have happened if the legislation had not been passed.
I wanted to put a bit of that heritage on the record because it is a success story and one that I am quite proud of. I want to ensure that the Democrats claim a significant part of the ownership of that success. It was, of course, originally a government proposal, so I guess they can share some of the credit as well, although I should emphasise that the original proposal was extremely flawed, which is why the legislation was dramatically amended by the Democrats and the Senate. It is an example of the importance of not missing opportunities and knowing that those opportunities might or might not be there for much longer.
I will talk about the specifics relating to the Scout hall. I took the trouble to go and look at the site with the executive director of the trust some time ago. It is important that there are development controls over that particular block of land once it is sold. There is no reason why the funds from it cannot go to assisting with the very expensive job of running the trust, rehabilitating the lands and opening up many of those lands to the public, but there does need to be a guarantee that height controls, predominantly, are in place on that site. The importance of the site and the adjoining land now having been transferred into schedule 1—schedule 1 deals with lands that cannot be sold—is that it will open up to the parkland at the top of the ridge at Middle Head. As long as the housing nearby, just below the peak of the ridge, does not go above a certain height then it will not detract from what is quite a spectacular vista when you are standing in the right spot.
This has been well thought out, not just through the work of the trust but because they have involved the community all the way along. They have involved the community all the way along because of the amendments that the Democrats made to the legislation, which ensured that the community was involved. It had to be involved and consulted. I know that there is quite significant support from the community reference group to make this transfer. It is certainly not contentious. Having worked with some of the community groups and the local Mosman Municipal Council, I know that if they were unhappy they would certainly be letting people know about it. They have put a lot of work into trying to preserve these areas for the sake of their local community as well as for the wider Australian community.
I think the success of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to date is very much a tribute to the many people at community level who have put such effort into preserving and enhancing the sites and maximising the opportunities there. The trust should get significant praise for the work it has done. It is a very difficult job, with a lot of competing demands and a lot of competing views about what should happen with these marvellous lands. But a lot of the people involved have a real passion for getting the most out of these sites. They are immensely valuable sites from an environment and heritage point of view, including from the point of view of Indigenous heritage, defence heritage and industrial heritage. The trust and its executive director, Mr Bailey, have done a very good job over quite a long period of time. They still have a large job ahead of them. I will continue to monitor their progress. I trust that the government, as the initiators of this proposal and the eventual acceptors of this very heavily modified legislation, will continue to ensure that the trust has the support it deserves.
With those rather extended comments, given that it is a fairly non-controversial bill, I indicate my support for the legislation and indicate once again that it is a follow-on from a lot of work that was done by a lot of people and, if I may say so, with the very wise judgment of the Democrats back in 2001—a legacy that many people are seeing the benefit of now and that many more will see the benefit of down the track. Perhaps next time there is some pointless and mindless opposition from either the ALP or the Greens to something, just because it is put up by the government, they might like to look at this as an example of where reaching an agreement can be immensely beneficial if you do your homework properly.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,39,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2005-06-20,"—I thank the two previous speakers for their contributions to the debate on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 and for their support of what is very obviously a bill that will enhance both causes mentioned in the bill. Senator Bartlett, you lament too late, I suggest, the way the Greens and the Labor Party have done you in over the years. I just wish you would learn from that and recognise that those who are most concerned about the environment are the coalition. Even you, Senator Bartlett, would understand and accept that this government is the greenest government that Australia has ever seen.
—Don’t push it.
—Tell me a government that has done better on the environment than the Howard government. Senator Bartlett, you recognise that at the end and you recognise that the Greens are pretty much frauds when it comes to the environment. I just wish that you had understood that. We are not perfect, I might say, but I think we deserve much more credit for our environmental record than you have given us today. In that regard I pay tribute to Senator Rod Kemp, who was our spokesman before the 1996 election; Senator Hill, who did a marvellous job as Minister for the Environment; and then the Hon. David Kemp. Currently, with Senator Ian Campbell, we have someone who has a feel for the environment and is determined to build upon this government’s reputation as the greenest government Australia has ever known.
As you say, Senator Bartlett, the scout hall does not have any significant environmental or heritage value, and the Scouting Association, as you know, has relinquished its lease on the land. The scout hall land, which comprises about two-tenths of a hectare of trust land, is to be subdivided and sold for residential purposes. Again, I will not go through the bill in detail, as I think both contributors to the debate understand that the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust’s comprehensive plan for the sites was approved in September 2003. That plan was two years in preparation and involved wide community consultation. I think it is fair to say that consultation by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust in the preparation of the plan was a hallmark of the planning process. The community advisory committee established under that legislation was instrumental in reflecting community interest in the sites and providing advice and recommendations on site outcomes. The trust has begun the challenging task of implementing that comprehensive plan.
As part of this plan, the former Defence lands at Middle Head, Georges Heights and Chowder Bay are being transformed into a headland park. The park will link all the elements of these disparate defence bases and bring them into accord with the great natural and cultural assets of the Middle Head plateau. A network of walking tracks, lookouts, revegetation and interpretive signage will underpin compatible uses of buildings and facilities and highlight the Indigenous and military history of this beautiful headland.
The effect of the proposed amendments that Senator Bartlett has particularly referred to will enable the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to more effectively bring to the fore the natural ridge line of the Middle Head peninsula and add to the character of the headland park. This entails transferring three residential lots in Markham Close from schedule 2 to schedule 1, thus allowing them to be incorporated into the park, and in exchange transferring the land on which the disused scout hall is located. It is currently included in the transfer from schedule 1 to schedule 2, permitting its eventual start.
Senator Bartlett, you mentioned Pooh Corner, which is in the capital city of Brisbane in my home state of Queensland. I am glad you mentioned that because it reminds me to pay credit to the Lord Mayor, Campbell Newman, who did a fabulous job in getting a good outcome for Pooh Corner. I certainly thank the Lord Mayor, Campbell Newman, and Councillor Jane Prentice of the Brisbane City Council, who was a great advocate for that area as well.
In referring to the part of the bill that relates to the ozone and synthetic gas amendments, I have to congratulate Senator Wong on some of the nicest pieces of sidestepping that I have seen. Obviously, Mr Albanese did not understand until the death that this particular board had been appointed some weeks ago. Senator Wong, all of the first part of your speech criticised Senator Ian Campbell for not having appointed the board. You went on and on about that. I was going to interrupt you and say, ‘Tone it down, because it was actually appointed three weeks ago.’ Then someone obviously gave you the tip-off and you did a beautiful sidestep and said, ‘It was appointed three weeks ago.’ The way you shuffled through that was well done. Despite my normally very helpful self, I was not going to elaborate too much on your ignorance of the situation, but I understand you are not the shadow minister and Mr Albanese obviously had not caught up with what happened three weeks ago. Senator Bartlett, I would be fascinated to look at the first draft of the second reading amendment that you say you saw, because I suspect it has changed between the first draft and the one that is now before us. It is not criticising the government for not having done it; it is criticising us for having done it but a bit too late, according to the opposition.
—A bit too late.
—According to you—but do not let the facts interfere with a good story. I hope you are listening to this, Senator Bartlett. It is a second reading amendment, so it is very important, but I hope you might be persuaded not to support this Labor Party second reading amendment. If you had been listening intently to Senator Wong at the beginning of her address, you would have thought that the board had not been appointed. It was appointed about three weeks ago, and the refrigeration and airconditioning industry board has been appointed to that position.
The regulations that have also been tabled indicate a transition period up to 31 December 2005. Persons in the industry who either have a licence or apply for a licence in this intervening period are deemed to hold a licence until such time as their application has been assessed. So the fact that the board was appointed three weeks ago does not make any difference to the operations. Everyone who applies is considered to have that licence until 31 December, and in that period the newly appointed board will assess the applications. The Department of the Environment and Heritage has written to more than 70,000 industry participants to inform them of the new requirements. These regulations also provide that state and territory licences transition into the new national scheme and remain valid until their expiry date or 31 December 2006, whichever is the earlier.
So, with the greatest respect to my colleagues opposite, I suggest that the shadow minister, having realised what a great job the minister did, is trying to find something he can criticise about the issue. He has brought forward a second reading amendment that I suggest has changed between the original copy that you saw, Senator Bartlett, and this one here. I really think it is not the sort of second reading amendment that warrants the support of this chamber. The first part of the second reading amendment simply seems to state the facts—there is nothing wrong with that—but part (b) seems to suggest that the Senate is concerned. It talks about unnecessary delays, which of course they were not, and then says that, as a result of those delays, certain consequences flow. Regrettably for Mr Albanese, those consequences do not flow, because they have been covered by the transitional arrangements. The board has been appointed, things are moving on and we do achieve a very good outcome for this particular area.
In conclusion, I thank senators for their support of the substantive bill. Again, I urge Senator Bartlett to understand that this is a good step forward. I think he acknowledges that; I do not think I have to convince him about that. But I ask Senator Bartlett to consider that the second reading amendment really is not worthy of the support of this chamber. The board has been appointed. There are no consequences. The transitional arrangements, which are a regulation for every senator to see, make it quite clear that the industry has not been frustrated or confused. In fact, I am told that the industry is very supportive of the bill and the arrangements that are now in place.
Question agreed to.

Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,39,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I am pleased to inform the Senate that Labor supports the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2005. This bill is derived from the earlier Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2004, and it should not be confused with the telecommunications bill we have on this evening either. The bill was subsequently split into two to ensure that it could be proceeded with in parts. This, the second part, has been dealt with by a committee and is before us this evening. The part of the bill that relates to suicide was made into a separate bill, which is now called the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2005. The remainder—the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004, which I will call the No. 2 bill—has already passed through parliament and is now being dealt with.
Labor was pleased to be able to assist in the passage of those measures that remained in the No. 2 bill, now the act, including the regulation of the internet for protection of children and the prevention of racial vilification. That left the anti-suicide measures of the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2004. This bill passed in the House with Labor support, and Labor referred it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The committee had called for submissions and commenced its inquiries into the bill by the time the 2004 federal election was called. As a result of the prorogation of parliament, the bill lapsed before the Senate committee could complete its inquiry. Now, some time later, we are here in a new parliament. A new bill was called for and the government has presented a 2005 version.
The new bill is essentially the same as the 2004 bill, with the exception of new and additional safeguards. The new bill specifically states that a person is not guilty of an offence against the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) if the person merely uses a carriage service, for example a telephone or the internet, to engage in public discussion of or debate about euthanasia. Further, the new subsections (3) and (4) explicitly state that a person is not guilty of the offences under subsections (1) and (2) if the person did not intend the material concerned to be used by another person, to promote a method of committing suicide or to provide instruction on a method of committing suicide.
The new protections available under subsections (3) and (4) are welcome additions to the bill. They protect the freedom of political communication. I welcome the inclusion of these safeguards, as I foreshadowed a need for them previously in my speech on the 2004 bill. Mr George Williams of the ANU made a suggestion along the lines of these safeguards in his 2004 submission on the previous bill, and it has obviously been picked up by the government and put into this bill.
Labor indicated it would move amendments to the 2004 version of bill in the Senate to achieve this aim, and I welcome the government’s adoption of Labor’s position on this matter. I said previously that we had to be sure that the offence does not apply to the extent that it would infringe the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. I will quote Labor’s unchanged position on this issue. My colleague in the lower house, Mr Robert McClelland, said in a 2004 speech:
We consider that the advocacy of reform of the law relating to euthanasia falls squarely within the implied freedom of political communication under its most recent formulation by the High Court in its decision in David Russell Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 1997.
Since that time additional protections to achieve this end have been incorporated, and Labor welcomes them. The rest of the 2005 bill is unchanged from the 2004 bill. This bill still contains offences that carry maximum penalties of fines of up to $10,000 for an individual and up to $550,000 for a corporation. These are important and strong measures, and Labor supports them. The fact is that there are too many suicides in our community. In 2003, the last year for which I can find statistics, there were over 2,300 suicides in Australia. These statistics make sad reading, and they have been covered in this place by members of all parties numerous times before.
We all know that young males are extremely prone to suicide and young females are extremely prone to suicide attempts. In every community, from our cities to rural and regional Australia, many have felt the unfortunate touch of needless death caused by suicide. Suicide is not just a problem among the young; it is distributed across every age group. However, I want to address some of the myths about suicide that are being raised in the broader community debate on this particular bill. Firstly, there has been the suggestion that this bill is aimed at older Australians. Let me comprehensively reject that suggestion and appeal to the actual facts of the case. The statistics point to the fact that young people are more at risk. From 1992 to 2003, the zero-to-29 age group made up more than 28 per cent of all suicides. In comparison, the 65-and-over age group made up under half of the number, or about 13 per cent of suicides. For the benefit of the chamber I will reference this material: it comes from the ABS publication Suicides: recent trends, Australia.
Here is another fact: internet use is highest among people of 15 to 19 years of age, about 63.3 per cent. In comparison, the next highest rates of usage are 55.9 per cent for 20- to 24-year olds and 55.7 per cent for 10- to 14 year-olds. Following that, the 25- to 34-year-olds age bracket is at 51.3 per cent, and no other age bracket breaks 50 per cent. In fact, internet use declines rapidly after 34 years of age. The disproportionately high users of the internet are the 15- to 19-year-olds. The disproportionately lower users of the internet are older Australians, at 65 to 74 years of age and 9.1 per cent, and the over-75s are only at three per cent. These are not statistics that I pulled from the ether. I will again reference my remarks: these statistics are available from another ABS publication, Australia online: how Australians are using computers and the internet. I found the above figures through my own research of the ABS figures.
In developing the response to the bill on behalf of Labor, we next took a look at what the authoritative work of the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention says on this particular topic. The synopsis of the research in the 2001 report Ageing and suicide is clear and concise. It says:
In general, it can be seen that adult and elderly suicide rates in the states of Australia have declined, though in an erratic way, since 1964. Conversely, there is a trend of increasing suicide rates for youth.
I will now turn my attention to the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy. On page 9 of that document, it clearly states:
Reducing access to a particular lethal means of suicide can give young people the chance to reconsider their decision to die, and provide time and opportunity for help to be provided.
Let us dispel for once and for all this myth that this bill is somehow targeted at older Australians and summarise what the statistics and policy research on this bill actually demonstrate. The high-risk age group for suicide is not older Australians but instead younger Australians under the age of 29. This just happens to be the same age group with the highest rate of internet usage. Further, the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy would seem to advocate against the free incitement to suicide in concordance with the aims of this bill.
I will deal with one further claim which I now believe has been disproved: the bill was unnecessary because internet usage has increased and the suicide rate has fallen. This is an abstraction. By logic, if everyone had access to the internet then suicide would stop. We know that that is in fact not the case. Suicide is such a tragedy that Labor will always be prepared to examine a reasonable measure that the government is able to progress and it will be determined to put forward its view.
But, as with any legislation, these measures must be examined carefully and considered for unintended consequences. For this reason, Labor voted for the bill to be steered through the committee process in the Senate. As I mentioned previously, the last Senate inquiry into the bill’s measures was not completed before the recent election. The Senate committee took 32 written submissions and conducted a public hearing in Canberra on the bill. Representations were made by organisations that you could say were pro life, although they might name themselves in other ways; others that were pro euthanasia, who also might name themselves in other ways; and a number who were in the centre in the debate.
Rather than going into particular detail, in summary I will say that we know that this bill will not, as various submissions pointed out, stop the phenomenon of suicide. That is not the aim of this bill, and it is doubtful whether any legislation could in fact achieve that end. However, as members of the Australian Labor Party, we strongly believe in our duty as parliamentarians to defend those who cannot, for whatever reason, defend themselves. This bill will ensure that young people, those suffering from depression and other mental illnesses and those with disabilities have access to the best protection we can reasonably provide. I think it is important to reiterate that those who want to access and distribute information for research or advocacy are not caught in the provisions in this bill. The freedom of political communication that Australians now enjoy will remain unchanged. I therefore commend this bill to the Senate.
Debate (on motion by Senator Vanstone) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (SUICIDE RELATED MATERIAL OFFENCES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,41,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-20,"—(Quorum formed) I rise to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Interception and Other Measures) Bill 2005; I am certainly wearing out the patience of the department this evening. The bill amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, which is referred to colloquially as the T(I) Act, and also the Criminal Code Act 1995. It amends them firstly, amongst other things, to expand the circumstances in which communications to and from certain declared emergency services facilities can be intercepted without a warrant; secondly, to create exceptions to the general prohibition against the interception of communications to allow interception without a warrant by authorised radiocommunications inspectors who are fulfilling their statutory obligations under the Radiocommunications Act 1992; thirdly, to allow telecommunications interception warrants to be obtained in connection with the investigation of the ancillary offence of accessory after the fact for a class 1 offence under the Criminal Code Act 1995; and lastly, to implement some of the recommendations contained in the Report of the review of named person warrants and other matters, colloquially referred to as the Sherman report, which was handed down in June 2003 and deals with statistical information for named person warrants reported by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and civil forfeiture regimes.
Several of the provisions of the bill are a response to the recommendations made in the Report of the review of named person warrants and other matters—it is perhaps easiest if I refer to it as the Sherman report. The bill picks up several of the recommendations made in that report. The T(I) Act contains a general prohibition on the interception of a communication passing over a telecommunications system except in specified circumstances. These circumstances include where it is done operating or maintaining a telecommunications system and pursuant to a warrant to investigate serious criminal activity. Because of the way that the expression ‘interception of communication’ is defined it is not an offence to listen to or record calls to certain emergency numbers or publicly listed ASIO numbers. Interceptions conducted in breach of the act attract criminal penalties and give rise to civil remedies.
To expand on the exemption to emergency services, one of the matters that this bill is seeking to progress, at present the T(I) Act provides that listening to or recording communications to prescribed emergency service numbers operated by the police, fire or ambulance services does not constitute an interception for the purposes of the act. The numbers currently prescribed for the purposes of the T(I) Act are the 000, 106 and 112 numbers. The bill as introduced proposes to exempt communications made to and from declared emergency services facilities as opposed to emergency services numbers. The distinction is that rather than naming the number it is the facility or place which will attract the exemption from the general prohibition against interception. As well as police, fire and ambulance services an emergency service facility will include services for dispatching or referring matters to the police, fire or ambulance services. This addition is designed to capture outsourced services, it seems. So not only will the actual services such as police, fire and ambulance be exempt as facilities but also the dispatching areas as well.
The bill proposes that the Attorney-General will have the power to declare those premises or part of those premises as deemed to be emergency services facilities. The bill encompasses emergency service facilities that are outsourced and run as a private enterprise, as occurs in Victoria. Emergency service facilities will be declared by the Attorney-General’s written instrument. These will not be legislative instruments for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and thus will not be subject to parliamentary disallowance. At present, emergency service numbers are prescribed by regulation. The explanatory memorandum notes that these facilities will be listed as a declaration rather than as a legislative instrument. The argument advanced by the government is that this is:
… to ensure that the locations of emergency services facilities are not publicly available.
It goes on to say:
These facilities represent critical operational infrastructure which needs close protection as their loss would endanger the public for so long as these services were unavailable. There are few benefits in having the location of these facilities made public, and any that do exist are far outweighed by the potential risks.
In 2004, part 10.6 was added to the Criminal Code by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004. It contains new telecommunications offences, including offences relating to the disruption of the normal operation of carriage service such as email and internet communications. The Criminal Code provides law enforcement officers who act in good faith in the course of their duties and whose conduct is reasonable in the circumstance of performing their duty, with a defence to these and other offences. Nowhere in the expanded operation of the bill, however, is there a requirement that emergency services’ interceptions from emergency service facilities occur lawfully in the course of an employee’s duties. The expression ‘law enforcement officer’ is defined in the Criminal Code with reference to the Australian Federal Police; the state, territory and foreign police forces; the Australian Crime Commission; the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions; and similar offices established under state and territory law. The bill expands the definition of ‘law enforcement officer’ to encompass other officers of the New South Wales Crime Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The reason for these additions to the definition of ‘law enforcement officer’ is that, like those who currently fall within its ambit, these officers may be able to intercept telecommunications for investigative purposes in the course of their duties.
Under the present arrangements, the T(I) Act operates to prohibit the interception of radiocommunications by the Australian Communications Authority where the radiocommunications interconnects with telecommunications. Inspectors are currently precluded from investigating radiocommunications interference to the extent that the interference emanates from a telecommunications service. The bill proposes to create a limited exception to allow the interception of communication by radiocommunications inspectors in the course of identifying the source of interference to critical radiocommunications frequencies under the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997 or the Radiocommunications Act 1992. An example of such a situation is interference by a cordless phone system with aircraft communications at a metropolitan airport. It would seem sensible to ensure that that did not happen and to allow the radiocommunications inspectors the ability to source these interferences.
There are also a number of ancillary offences that have been brought into this bill. The bill proposes to allow telecommunications interception warrants to be obtained in connection with the investigation of the ancillary offence of accessory after the fact to class 1 offences. Class 1 offences include murder, kidnapping and equivalent offences—they are, in essence, serious offences. At present, the T(I) Act does not allow law enforcement agencies to obtain a telecommunications interception warrant to assist in the investigation of a person suspected of being an accessory after the fact to the commission of a class 1 offence.
These provisions will facilitate more effective law enforcement. The bill does not extend the T(I) Act to allow telecommunications interception warrants to be obtained in connection with the investigation of the ancillary offence of being an accessory after the fact to class 2 offences. Class 2 offences include offences punishable by imprisonment for life or for a period of at least seven years where the conduct involved the loss of a person’s life, a serious personal injury or damage to property. Class 2 offences are regarded as a lesser class than class 1 offences.
There are a number of outstanding issues associated with this bill. Several issues were raised in discussions with the government confirming the scope and application of the bill. Among these was a concern that the Attorney-General’s declaration as to which emergency services facilities will fall under the regime will not be a legislative instrument and therefore will not be open to disallowance or parliamentary scrutiny. This may be resolved by prescribing the organisation that will fall under the operation of the bill without providing details that would allow identification of the location of each organisation.
A further and very important issue is that calls made to and from emergency services facilities that are not for the purposes of communicating information about an emergency could conceivably fall under the ambit of the bill. An example might include the use by an employee of a personal mobile phone, email and SMS at the emergency services facility. Under the bill, these types of communications may be intercepted, which significantly extends the operation of the bill beyond its intended purpose. As mentioned, the bill imposes no requirement that emergency services interceptions from emergency service facilities occur lawfully in the course of an employee’s duties. There is seemingly no limit to which agencies under proposed section 473.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 are exempt from the prohibition against intercepting telecommunications.
The government has not been able to demonstrate that it had considered these issues, and the opposition referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. Like clockwork, after referring this important piece of legislation to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the Attorney-General issued what could only be described as an ill thought out press release criticising the opposition for obstructing the passage of this legislation. It does seem that the Attorney-General is wont to do this. I ask for caution because, as has been demonstrated this evening in both this bill and in others that have been dealt with tonight, the Senate process should be examined carefully and recommendations taken from it should be considered carefully. The Attorney-General should in fact stop playing politics with important and sensitive matters of national security and work constructively with the opposition and, where necessary, with the committee system as well to deliver what can only be considered sensible and appropriate outcomes for the security of Australians.
The work of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee should be commended. It provided valuable input into the process. A number of recommendations have flowed from that, which Labor will consider in the debate on this bill. The submissions and evidence received were of a significantly high standard and were in general supportive of the bill and its purposes—there is no doubt about that. The committee did, however, note and respond to the concerns raised by the opposition with respect to the operation of the bill.
Of course, not all submissions were supportive, and that is by and large the committee’s strength: it gets the opportunity to hear those submissions which might be supportive of the aims and objectives of the bill but which also criticise certain aspects of the bill and identify particular areas it may trammel upon. Of course, it also gives those who might oppose the bill an opportunity to put their point across and raise issues that they may have with the bill. Several submissions were received by the committee expressing concerns about the expanded operation of the bill. The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties commented on the wide range of communications that could now be captured by the bill. All telecommunications by fax, email, web access, mobile, text message or telephone not connected with emergencies may be recorded without a warrant or advice—that was their view. Similarly, the Law Council of Australia was of the view that the scope of information that the proposed amendments in the bill capture is extremely wide. For example, the bill will allow the interception of phone calls, emails and potentially mobile telephone calls to or from the emergency service facility.
The Law Council also submitted that emergency service facilities should be declared by legislative instrument to enhance parliamentary scrutiny of the extent of those bodies that can lawfully intercept telecommunications. Without scrutiny of any kind, these provisions allow the Attorney-General to prescribe as an emergency facility any facility he or she sees fit, with no legislative requirement to justify the purpose or reason for doing so. Parliamentary scrutiny is an integral part of the Legislative Instruments Act 2004, and to remove it weakens the regime of scrutiny and ministerial responsibility, especially in relation to the minister responsible for this area.
During the committee hearings, departmental representatives acknowledged the lack of scrutiny under the bill but suggested that any potential misuse of this power would be avoided by the risk of evidence gathered by telecommunications interceptions being rendered inadmissible on the grounds of illegality when challenged in court proceedings. However, the committee, rightly, had serious reservations about this constituting the primary check on the integrity of these powers, since information obtained in such a way may not necessarily be relied on as evidence in court proceedings and, even if it were, this would be well after the power to intercept telecommunications had been exercised. It seems to be a case of the horse having already bolted.
As a result, the committee recommended that any declaration deeming an emergency services facility should be by legislative instrument for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act to allow full and proper scrutiny by parliament. To protect the interests of vital infrastructure, the committee considered that the bill should provide that there is no requirement for the information provided to parliament to detail the specific location of the emergency services facility. Information contained in the relevant legislative instrument could include identification of the town, city, region and the state or territory in which the emergency services facility is located. Specification of the facility and the service concerned in general terms without identification of location would not, in the committee’s view, compromise the security of such a facility but would enable appropriate parliamentary scrutiny of this ministerial power.
The committee also made several further recommendations, including that emergency services interceptions from emergency services facilities occur lawfully in the course of an employee’s duties and that the list of those deemed to be law enforcement officers should also be clarified. The committee also made recommendations to improve the reporting requirements to parliament under the bill—a recommendation the opposition fully supports to improve accountability.
Again, the work of the committee must be commended for devising solutions to improve this complex yet important legislative regime. The government should not, in its public statements, attempt to make political capital by criticising the opposition for sensibly referring the bill to the committee system so that, at the end of the day, a better piece of legislation could pass through this parliament. We have been advised by the government that it intends to move amendments in accordance with the recommendations contained in the committee’s report. It should be noted that the opposition will support appropriately constructed amendments that put in place the recommendations of the committee.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,42,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-06-20,"—It is very refreshing to enter this debate—albeit at a fairly late stage—and be able to listen to Senator Ludwig referring to his and the opposition’s strong support for the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Interception and Other Measures) Bill 2005. It is interesting that Senator Ludwig talked about the government listening to the recommendations of a committee. It reminds me of what I read in this morning’s papers and heard on radio which was very critical of this government’s alleged record of not listening to the advice and the recommendations of the committees. Yet here tonight—and I give credit where credit is due—we heard Senator Ludwig, quite appropriately, state that the government had in fact listened to the recommendations of a relevant committee undertaking a relevant inquiry subsequent to debate that had taken place here in the Senate—and that we have a government that is prepared to listen, to take advice and to move amendments which are going to obtain the support of honourable senators opposite. Sometimes you pick up the papers in the morning and you turn on the radio and you just wonder whether we are operating on the same planet and whether, for example, there is any correlation between what is said in the media and what we just heard from Senator Ludwig.
I am often critical of honourable senators opposite—and most of the times with reasonable justification—but I am a very fair person and I always give credit where credit is due, and this is certainly one of those times. I notice honourable senators opposite smiling and I notice that they are doing so benignly, without any sense of cynicism or any sense of ridicule—because they know that I really mean what I am saying. To honourable senators opposite: sincere thanks for those expressions of support.
The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Interception and Other Measures) Bill 2005 makes a number of amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979—known as the interception act—to improve the effectiveness of that act and to extend certain defences available in relation to telecommunications offences set out in the Criminal Code Act 1995. The interception act contains a general prohibition against the interception of communications, subject to limited exceptions, including interception under warrant to assist in the investigation of serious criminal activity. The bill will amend prohibition against interception to allow the interception of communications to and from declared emergency services facilities. The existing exception to allow recording of calls to 000 and equivalents does not adequately cover the full range of telephone services used in the provision of emergency assistance or allow recording of outgoing calls. The bill before us this evening will also create a limited exception to the general prohibition against interception to allow interception by authorised radiocommunication inspectors fulfilling statutory obligations under the Radiocommunications Act 1992. This will ensure that inspectors are able to investigate interference with radiocommunications, including air traffic control, notwithstanding that the interference is from a telecommunications service.
The bill also enhances the already extensive accountability measures in the Australian telecommunications interception regime. The bill implements three recommendations from the Report of the review of named person warrants and other matters by Mr Tom Sherman AO in 2003—namely, that the bill will require the minister to include additional statistics in the annual report for named person warrants. While statistics are already reported for all enforcement interception warrants, the proposed amendment will require the annual report to include detailed figures relating to the use of named person warrants. I think it is fair to say and to emphasise that that is a very significant safeguard that is being included as a result of the proposed amendment.
The bill will also require the Ombudsman to include in his annual report to parliament a summary of the telecommunications interception inspections conducted in the relevant year, together with a summary of any substantive deficiencies identified in any remedial action that has been taken. In the lead-up to the drafting of this bill, and particularly during the debate, we heard many civil libertarians right across the country, including from my state of Queensland, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, express strong concern about possible infringements on civil liberties. Again, I think it is fair to say that this government is always ready and willing to listen and consider alternative opinions. I think it has responded very well with this amendment to the concerns raised in the Estens review. I am not saying that the voices of civil libertarians have been totally muted, but certainly they have become more reasonably accepting of the provisions which we are debating here this evening.
Finally, the bill allows intercepted information to be used in simple forfeiture proceedings, as recommended by Mr Sherman. I note that there was a lot of debate on that particular recommendation but, again, the government, after consideration of the recommendation, has seen fit to give it substance within legislation. In addition to those important interception measures, the bill also extends certain defences available to telecommunications officers set out in the Criminal Code Act 1995 relating to law enforcement officers and intelligence officers or security officers who are acting in good faith and in the course of their duties.
I had a lot of involvement in this area of law, mainly through my experience at a state level. I used to be a member for almost six years of the former Parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee in Queensland. In fact, I served on the original Parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee that was chaired by a relatively unknown political soul by the name of Peter Beattie. One of the complaints regularly put forward by law enforcement officers to the committee, particularly when the committee was inquiring into the extent of the powers of enforcement officers, was that they were easy prey to cheap attacks and frivolous attitudes of people who just wanted to have a go. It is good to see that this provision affords enforcement officers, operating under the auspices of this act, some protections, particularly if they are acting in good faith and in the normal course of their duties. Again, I think that this provision will be very warmly received and applauded by officers who risk a lot and often put themselves in personal danger, as they pursue their duties in good faith.
The existing definitions of ‘law enforcement officer’ and ‘intelligence officer’ or ‘security officer’ do not cover all intercepting agencies. The proposed amendments will add those intercepting agencies that are not listed—for example, the New South Wales Crime Commission, ICAC, the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission, and the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia to ensure that defences are available in relation to activities ancillary to interception which may otherwise constitute telecommunications offences. Again, drawing on some of my past experience, I know that those agencies were very strong in their representations to the Commonwealth government so that the amendments that we are debating tonight could be included in the legislation. There are some jurisdictions that have not yet availed themselves of those particular provisions, and I think that the enforcement agencies and the enforcement officers within those jurisdictions would be wishing that they were also included.
These amendments will assist in the effective and accountable delivery of emergency services. There can be no doubt about that. The bill will similarly assist the investigation of radiocommunications interference, which has safety implications in the context of air traffic control. Honourable senators and other people who are involved in very frequent flying and travel warmly welcome this measure. The implementation of the recommendations in the Sherman report on named person warrants and the reporting by the Ombudsman enhance existing oversight arrangements. Again, that is another very clear example of how this government is responsive to the concerns of a great variety of people who take the time to study bills—such as the one that we are debating this evening—form opinions and provide input into legislation such as this.
All those civil libertarians who have recently been criticising the government in relation to other areas of policy implementation—the vast majority of that criticism, I hasten to add, is not justified and is certainly not supported by the vast majority of Australian people—could do themselves a lot of credit by giving credit to the federal government for the inclusion of this additional oversight arrangement, which mainly relates to reports on non-named person warrants and reporting by the Ombudsman. That is a very significant—I was going to say ‘concession’ but that is probably putting it too strongly—consideration by the government. It was a reasonable response to reasonable representations. I believe the bill represents a response that balances the need for legislation that supports the work of law enforcement and security agencies with privacy, transparency and accountability issues.
I listened, both within the chamber and outside the chamber at the beginning of it, to Senator Ludwig’s contribution. His attitude and comments were most constructive. It is good to see that this bill—particularly as it has been amended by the government after considering the deliberations and recommendations of the committee—has bipartisan support. It has been a pleasure to have been part of this debate.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,42,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-06-20,"—The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Interception and Other Measures) Bill 2005, as Senator Santoro said, is very important legislation. It is important because we live in a changed world. Accordingly, we have to adopt measures to enable us to cope both with the kind of sophisticated criminal we now have to deal with and with the security threats which our community now faces. These bills provide our law enforcement agencies with tools which will enable them to deal with the sorts of issues that they confront in seeking to bring criminals to justice in the modern world. The new telecommunications interception regime will provide an extremely effective tool for Australia’s law enforcement agencies to use to carry out their work.
Each year, reporting shows the very significant number of arrests and prosecutions in which interceptions play a very key role in providing material to be taken to court. At the same time, the interception legislation operates as a safeguard to the privacy that Australians are used to. This is done by its prima facie limitation on the kinds of interceptions that can be made. It preserves and protects the privacy that Australians expect in their communications. The areas in which interceptions can be made are very limited and are tightly defined.
The bill’s principle objective is to amend the existing exceptions to allow recording of 000 emergency calls. It will allow recording of calls to and from emergency service centres. This will allow police, fire and ambulance services to record those communications that are central to the provision of their services. The bill also makes a number of other amendments to the interception regime and an unrelated amendment to the Criminal Code.
It should be understood by senators that the bill is not about expanding powers. Indeed, under this legislation no agencies are given new interception powers. The only extension to the regime is to allow existing interception agencies to intercept messages in the investigation of ancillary and class 1 offences, such as being an accessory after the fact to murder and offences involving kidnapping or narcotics—the importation of drugs is a very important issue in this regard. These are all very serious offences and it is difficult to argue, I would submit to the Senate, against the use of the most effective law enforcement tool available in the investigation of such crimes. The Senate would agree that the use of interception in those contexts is very much in the public interest.
As I said, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Interception and Other Measures) Bill 2005 makes a number of amendments to the existing Telecommunications Interception Act 1979, which is also know as the interception act, to improve the effectiveness of that act and extend certain defences available to telecommunications offences set out in the Criminal Code Act 1995. The interception act contains a general prohibition against the interception of communications, subject to limited exceptions, including interception under warrant to assist in the investigation of serious criminal activity. The bill will amend the prohibition against interception to allow the interception of communications to and from declared emergency services facilities. The existing exception to allow recording of calls to 000 and equivalents in fact does not adequately cover the full range of telephone services used in the provision of emergency assistance or allow recording of outgoing calls.
The bill will also create a limited exception to the general prohibition against interception to permit interception by authorised radiocommunications inspectors fulfilling statutory obligations under the Radiocommunications Act 1992. This will ensure that inspectors are able to investigate interference with radiocommunications—including, as Senator Santoro outlined, air traffic control—notwithstanding that the interference is from a telecommunications service.
The bill also enhances the already extensive accountability measures in the Australian telecommunications interception regime. The bill implements three recommendations from the Report of the review of named person warrants and other matters by Mr Tom Sherman AO in 2003. Firstly, the bill will require the minister to include additional statistics in the annual report for named person warrants. Whilst statistics are already reported for all law enforcement interception warrants, the amendment will require the annual report to include detailed figures relating to the use of named person warrants. Secondly, the bill will require the Ombudsman to include in their annual report to parliament a summary of the telecommunications interception inspections conducted in the relevant year together with a summary of any substantive deficiencies identified and any remedial action taken. Thirdly and finally, the bill will allow intercepted information to be used in civil forfeiture proceedings, as recommended by Mr Sherman. These very largely relate to narcotic offences and penalties against people found to be importing and profiting from the sale of narcotics.
In addition to these important interception measures, the bill also extends certain defences available to telecommunications offences set out in the Criminal Code Act 1995 relating to law enforcement officers and intelligence or security officers who are acting in good faith and in the course of their duties. The existing definitions of ‘law enforcement officer’ and ‘intelligence or security officer’ do not, it seems, cover all intercepting agencies. The proposed amendment will add those intercepting agencies that are not listed. These are the New South Wales Crime Commission, ICAC, the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission and the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia. This will ensure that defences are available in relation to activities ancillary to interception which may otherwise constitute telecommunications offences.
These amendments will assist in the effective and accountable delivery of emergency services. Further, the bill will similarly assist the investigation of radiocommunications interference, which has safety implications in the air traffic control context. The implementation of the recommendations from the Sherman report on reporting on named person warrants and reporting by the Ombudsman enhance existing oversight arrangements.
This bill, it can be said, represents a balanced response to the need for the legislation that regulates the law enforcement and security agencies to support the work of those agencies without losing sight of privacy, transparency and accountability issues. While some people in the community may have reservations about this legislation, it does in fact mean that our law enforcement services have the tools to deal with the changed situation which our society faces in terms of both criminal and security issues. It enables an appropriate response to be made to these changes in the threats to our community in terms of both criminal activity and security issues. It is a very much needed addition to the armoury of both the police and the security services.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,42,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-06-20,"—I too rise to speak tonight on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Interception and Other Measures) Bill 2005. This bill has a number of objectives and makes a variety of changes to the current telecommunications interception regime. The regime, which is set out in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, prohibits the interception of telecommunications passing over a telecommunications system but sets out a number of exceptions relating to intelligence and law enforcement.
The Democrats have on a number of occasions been quite critical of the telecommunications interception regime and the extent of interception activity within Australia. For example, last year we Democrats expressed our concerns that the 2002-03 annual report on the act indicated that Australia’s law enforcement agencies are undertaking more interceptions than ever before. The report showed that a total of 3,058 warrants were issued to law enforcement agencies during the previous reporting year, representing an increase of 41 per cent over the previous two years.
But perhaps the most disturbing fact was that Australians were having their phones tapped at a rate 30 times higher than the rate of phone taps in the United States of America. While the annual report argued that ‘interception continues to be an extremely valuable investigative tool’, the figures revealed that many interceptions did not in fact result in conviction, prosecution or even arrest. There was a decrease not only in the number of arrests per warrant but also in the proportion of warrants which yielded information used in the prosecution of an offence. I am pleased to report that this year’s annual report demonstrated an improvement, with a minimal decrease in the number of interception warrants granted but with a higher percentage of these resulting in arrests, prosecutions and convictions. However, the fact is that 3,028 interception warrants were issued to law enforcement agencies last year—and this is just the number of warrants issued, not granted. In actual fact, each warrant may authorise the interception of tens of thousands of individual phone calls.
We Democrats also expressed our strong opposition to changes made to the telecommunications regime last year regarding stored communications. Those changes mean the government is now able to access private SMS, email and voice mail messages without a warrant. We Democrats take the view that the use of SMS, email and voice mail as forms of communication is increasing rapidly, and the Australian community should be free to reap the benefits of this technology without fearing government access to their private communications. So it is important to remember that this bill is being introduced in a context in which the prohibition against telecommunications has been watered down significantly, both by a broadening of the exceptions to the regime and by an increased reliance on those exceptions by law enforcement agencies.
Given this context, it is pleasing to be able to acknowledge that many of the changes proposed in this bill are constructive changes which will genuinely improve and clarify aspects of the current regime. Nevertheless, the bill does further expand law enforcement and other exemptions to the telecommunications interception regime, and we Democrats have therefore been very cautious in considering its provisions. The bill seeks to extend the list of anticorruption agencies to whom defences in the Criminal Code apply so that all agencies invested with powers under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act are covered by the defences.
This amendment will commence retrospectively to ensure that officers of anticorruption agencies who have undertaken interception activity in accordance with their duties will not be criminally liable for the work they have performed. The bill invests the Attorney-General with the power to prescribe additional anticorruption agencies so that they are covered by the defences. While the Democrats would prefer that additional agencies be added by way of legislation rather than by a determination of the Attorney-General, we do welcome the fact that this determination will be contained in a legislative instrument which will be disallowable by parliament.
The bill also empowers the Attorney-General to declare premises to be emergency services facilities for the purposes of the act. It then excludes the interception of communications to or from emergency services facilities from the general prohibition against interception. Following a briefing by the Attorney-General’s office, I understand that it is only the parts of emergency services facilities that deal with emergency calls which will be declared under these provisions. Administrative sections of such facilities will not be included in the declaration. This means, for example, the personal calls of employees will not be subject to lawful interception.
Nevertheless, the Democrats do have some outstanding concerns regarding these provisions. Our most serious concern relates to the fact that the Attorney-General’s declaration that a facility is an emergency services facility for the purposes of the act will not be treated as a legislative instrument. This means it falls outside the scope of the Legislative Instruments Act and will not be disallowable by the parliament. We Democrats have considered the government’s argument regarding the need to protect the security of emergency services facilities. Specifically, the government has argued:
These facilities represent critical operation infrastructure which needs close protection as their loss would endanger the public for as long as these services were unavailable. There are few benefits in having the location of these facilities made public, and any that do exist are far outweighed by the potential risks.
We Democrats agree that there may be a legitimate interest in keeping the location of some of these facilities secret. Nevertheless, we also believe there is a strong interest in protecting the privacy of Australians and we are concerned that the Attorney-General’s power is simply too broad. As the Law Council has argued:
Without scrutiny of any kind, these provisions allow the Attorney-General to prescribe any facility he or she sees fit as an emergency facility, with no legislative requirement to justify the purpose or reason for doing so.
It is on the account of these concerns that the Democrats support the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to bring the Attorney-General’s declarations within the scope of the Legislative Instruments Act, thereby making them disallowable by parliament. I am informed that the government intends to respond to those recommendations by way of amendments to the bill, although we are yet to see those recommendations.
Another aspect of the bill is that it exempts interceptions by radiocommunications inspectors if the interception is incidental to the performance of spectrum management function or the exercise of other legislative powers. The bill also permits the use of telecommunications interception to investigate suspected ancillary offences to those offences which are already listed in the legislation. For example, this would include offences such as assisting a person who has committed murder or an act of terrorism to escape punishment.
Perhaps most importantly, from the Democrats’ perspective, the bill implements a number of the recommendations contained in the Report of the review of named person warrants and other matters completed by Mr Tom Sherman in 2003. For example, the bill will require the inclusion of additional information in the Ombudsman’s report, as well as the telecommunications interception annual report. We Democrats welcome the fact that the government has finally responded to Mr Sherman, but it is frustrating that it has taken this long, particularly given that parliament has debated at least two telecommunications interception bills in the period of time that has elapsed.
The Sherman report contained a number of eminently reasonable and constructive recommendations for improving the telecommunications interception regime, with a particular focus on improving accountability mechanisms. The Democrats are pleased that the government has decided to implement some of those recommendations but are very disappointed that some of Mr Sherman’s most important recommendations will not be taken up by the government. Most particularly, we are disappointed that the government will not be implementing recommendation 5 of Mr Sherman’s report, which calls for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO, to publish in the public version of its annual report the total number of telecommunications interception warrants and named person warrants applied for, refused and issued in the relevant reporting period.
The Democrats have long advocated the introduction of a basic public reporting mechanism in relation to ASIO’s telecommunications interception activity. Indeed we have sought to amend a number of bills to achieve exactly this. On the most recent such occasion, the government indicated that it would not support our amendment because:
... Mr Tom Sherman conducted an independent review of parts of the telecommunications interception regime in June last year. He recommended that ASIO publish in the public version of its annual report the total number of warrants applied for, refused and issued in the relevant reporting year. The government have not yet made any decisions in relation to whether and in what form Mr Sherman’s recommendations are to be implemented, and we believe that to do so on the run would be inappropriate.
The government also indicated its belief that ‘a considered approach to Mr Sherman’s report is the way to go’. Yet, now that the government has had two years to formulate a response to Mr Sherman’s report, it has decided against this recommendation. In doing so, it apparently disregarded the views of the Federal Privacy Commissioner, which were sought in March 2004 to assist the government in formulating its response to the report. The commissioner recently indicated that she supports Mr Sherman’s recommendation that ASIO should publicly report on its interception activity. We Democrats maintain our view that ASIO should be required to publicly report on the extent of its interception activity in Australia, and in the committee stage we will be moving an amendment to achieve just that.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-06-20,"—Mr Acting Deputy President—
—I did not come in here to listen to this.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I trust that you will be able to keep the interjections from the other side to a minimum.
 (Senator Ferguson)—As always, Senator Conroy.
—Labor supports the principle underlying the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Regular Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2005. The government has stated that the goal of the bill before the chamber is to future-proof the telecommunications services of Australia in rural and regional areas. This is clearly a worthy aim. Senators may, however, wonder why legislation important to dealing with the future proofing of telecommunications services has been introduced today. The need for first-rate telecommunications services for rural and regional Australians is not new. The fact that the future will bring innovative telecommunications services is also hardly news. So why is it that all of a sudden the government wants to introduce future-proofing legislation? The answer, of course, is the government’s intention to force through the sale of Telstra once it obtains control of the Senate.
Rural and regional Australians know full well that services will decline as a fully privatised Telstra focuses on ramping up profits for its new owners. They know that they will miss out on the introduction of new services in the future as a fully privatised Telstra chases the big end of town. They are crying out for the government to intervene to ensure that they are offered innovative telecommunications services in the future. Labor is listening to the people in rural and regional areas and has a plan to future-proof services in these regions. Labor believes that the best way for the government to answer this cry, the best way for the government to future-proof telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia, is to keep Telstra in majority public ownership. The majority of Australians, especially those in rural and regional areas, agree that keeping Telstra in majority public ownership is the best way to protect and improve the level of service that they receive.
National Party senators ought to keep this in mind when the legislation for the sale of Telstra is introduced in the Senate. The fact that this bill apparently represents the best that the coalition can offer to future-proof rural and regional Australia should be of great concern to Australians who live in these areas. National Party senators should examine carefully the provisions of this bill and ask themselves whether it lives up to the government’s rhetoric. They should then ask themselves whether they can believe any of the government’s promises about the impact of the sale of Telstra on rural and regional Australia.
When National Party senators examine this bill, they will realise that it is nothing but a public relations exercise. It is a press release policy. They will realise that this is a bill that sounds good when the minister mentions it in a news grab, but when they get into the details, when they look into what this bill actually delivers, they will start to see a very different picture. They will start to see that this bill is something that rural and regional Australians have been offered over and again by the current government. It is snake oil sold by a travelling saleswoman with a bag full of claims that just do not stack up.
The government’s first claim about this bill that does not stand up under scrutiny is that it implements the recommendations of the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry report of 2002, otherwise known as the Estens report. It relates to the need for Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia and regular independent reviews into the adequacy of telecommunications in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia.
In fact, this bill does no such thing. Its shortcomings in this regard were noted by a number of witnesses, including the National Farmers Federation, who appeared before the Senate’s inquiry into the provisions of this bill. The first shortcoming of this bill in implementing the recommendations of Estens is its failure to have regard to any telecommunications strategic plan. The Estens report recommended that the review process provided for in this bill should be:
... linked to a strategic plan for regional telecommunications, and underpinned by ongoing arrangements that provide a high degree of certainty that Government funds will be made available to support service improvements ...
During the Senate inquiry into this bill, it was disappointing to discover from the department that the government has not yet developed such a strategic plan, despite the fact that the Estens report was handed down in 2002. One wonders about the level of priority given to this issue by the government if it still has not managed to develop such a plan after three years. No wonder the NFF has told the government to pull up its socks on the implementation of the recommendations of the Estens inquiry. On top of this, the bill provides absolutely no assurance that the government will provide a single cent in response to a recommendation of a review.
The level of certainty that rural and regional Australians have that the government will make funds available to implement any recommendations extends only as far as their level of trust in the word of this government. Australians in rural and regional areas can judge for themselves whether this amounts to a high degree of certainty. They had better hope that they do not have one of Tony Abbott’s ironclad guarantees on their hands.
Responding to the Estens recommendations is not, however, the only area in which the substance of this bill fails to measure up to the government’s spin. The provisions of this bill providing for the creation of a local presence plan governing Telstra’s operations in rural and regional Australia are also nothing more than a sleight of hand. In truth, this bill does not give the minister the ability to do anything that she could not do today. If the minister wanted to, she could develop a local presence plan today and impose a condition on Telstra’s carrier licence that requires Telstra to comply with it. The provisions of this bill offer nothing new to rural and regional Australians in this regard. What the provisions of this bill do is change the way in which the minister could do this. Senator Coonan, Senator Abetz and Senator Ferguson must take the National Party for mugs to think that they are going to fall for this. They really must take them for mugs.
Ordinarily, a licence condition imposed by the minister on Telstra would be a disallowable instrument that would be subject to the scrutiny of members of both houses of parliament. This bill, however, allows the minister to approve such a local presence plan by way of an administrative decision, free from the scrutiny of parliament. So the effect of this bill is to allow the minister to do something that she was already able to do but with less scrutiny—hardly an encouraging thought. The inadequacy of this lack of oversight was recognised by Telstra—Telstra even worked it out—in its submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill and ultimately in the report of the government senators resulting from that inquiry. The ALP endorses the recommendation of the government senators that any local presence plan developed by Telstra should be a disallowable instrument subject to parliamentary scrutiny. We will be moving an amendment to this bill implementing this recommendation.
A further shortcoming of this bill is that the mere fact that it foreshadows the imposition of a licence condition providing for a local presence plan does not guarantee any particular level of local presence by Telstra. A local presence plan is only as good as its contents, and Australians in rural and regional areas should watch this space very carefully. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, has stated that once this bill has passed she will negotiate the requirements of the local presence plan with Telstra. One could be forgiven for thinking that the level of service required for consumers in rural and regional Australia would be an objective measure.
The telecommunications needs of Australians in rural and regional areas do not vary according to what Telstra is prepared to offer the minister. It is unclear why the government need to negotiate a new licence condition with Telstra. As if this was not worrying enough, this bill includes no requirements for the minister to engage in any public consultations about the content of a local presence plan. No-one will know what is on the negotiating table. This insistence from the government to negotiate regulatory settings with Telstra stems, of course, from the government’s desire to maximise the sale price of Telstra. That is what it is really all about: they want to fatten up the cow so that they can flog it off for as much as they can get.
So, when the minister is negotiating this local presence plan, she will not be looking at the needs of Australians in rural and regional areas; she will be looking at Telstra’s share price. She will not be listening to the views of average Australians; she will be listening to the evaluations of the merchant bankers. When the minister negotiates the requirements of Telstra’s local presence plan, she will be negotiating the sell-out of consumers in order to force through the sale of Telstra, because that is all it is really about.
The lack of substance in this bill with respect to the local presence plans is reflected in the regular review provisions of this bill. This bill provides for the establishment of a Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee. The bill provides that the RTIRC will be charged with conducting reviews of the adequacy of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia at least every five years. Members of the RTIRC will be appointed by the minister. Copies of reports of the committee must be tabled in parliament within 15 sitting days of the minister receiving them—and we know from recent experience that the minister is quite prepared to break the law and ignore legislation that requires the tabling of material.

Senator Eggleston interjecting—

—It is a statement of fact. The minister must table a response to the report within six months of this report being tabled—six months. And as we saw today on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald, under the headline ‘Democracy denied’, we all know what this government thinks of reports. It just files them away.
—Fifteen days in an act of parliament is hard to get around.
—No, it is not. The minister has done it very recently, in the last couple of weeks.
—I do not think so.
—I think you will find that she has. I am willing to bet you that you will discover in the very near future that she has.
—Senator Conroy, please address your remarks to the chair. I ask that interjections cease. Do not debate across the chamber, Senator Conroy.
—I apologise for being distracted, and I take on board your admonishment for allowing myself to be distracted. The requirement provided for by this bill to hold reviews is nothing more than a facade. While the bill requires that reviews be held, it creates no obligation on the part of the government to act on the recommendations of a report. On top of this, despite the recommendations of the Estens report, there is no certainty that funding will be provided to implement any resulting recommendations. The only obligation on the government with respect to reports prepared by the RTIRC is to publicly respond to the recommendations of this review. That is right—the government does not have to a thing. This is a piece of legislation that only a National Party senator could be mug enough to vote for. It is a piece of legislation that does not require the government to do anything. So all that rural and regional Australians are guaranteed by this bill is more coalition rhetoric—hardly something they have been short on in recent times.
Labor also believes that there are serious doubts that the framework for this committee provided for in this bill will result in the formation of a genuinely independent review panel. This government does not have a good track record on these issues. As was pointed out in debate on this bill in the other place, the Estens report was conducted by Mr Dick Estens—a personal friend of the Deputy Prime Minister and a member of Mr Anderson’s own National Party branch. Fair dinkum, that is this government’s idea of an independent review.
—At least it is a real person, unlike in your branches.
—There are no sixpacks running around in my branches. I have not handed them out on campus to encourage anyone to join. I have not handed out a sixpack in my day.
—Senator Conroy, ignore the interjections.
—I accept your admonishment due to the unruly behaviour on the other side of the chamber distracting me.
—Just come back to the question.
—Let us be absolutely clear. According to this government, an independent inquiry is one where they pick a personal friend of the Deputy Prime Minister and a member of Mr Anderson’s own National Party branch. Imagine if we gave Greg Combet a ring and said, ‘Greg, we would like you to conduct an independent review of the industrial relations bills.’ Can you imagine the reaction from this government if we were to suggest that Greg Combet was an independent commentator on IR bills? We would be laughed out of the chamber—and probably rightly so, I have to say. They would have us there. But, barefaced, that mob on the other side of the chamber can pretend that Dick Estens—a close personal mate of the Deputy Prime Minister and a member of his own branch—is independent. However, putting that aside—

Senator Eggleston interjecting—

—Greg Combet is an excellent Australian as well. It is no stretch to imagine that this committee would be stacked by the government in the same way. After picking Mr Estens, we can imagine how many National Party cronies will be lined up to go on this committee. This is why Labor will be proposing an amendment to this bill designed to strengthen the independence of the review.
Let us be clear. Senator McLucas is going to be shocked by what I am going to say next, because this committee that will be conducting these independent reviews may include—believe it or not—members of Telstra or its subsidiaries, subject to the restriction that they are not allowed to have a majority on the committee. The government can appoint an independent committee to review things, and Telstra can have all bar a majority on the committee. Can you believe that? We are going to have Telstra employees conducting a review of Telstra’s conduct in the bush. What genius came up with that one? Labor do not believe that the committee would be seen as independent by the community if it included an officer or employee of any carrier or carriage service provider—not just Telstra. As such, we will be moving an amendment prohibiting officers or employees of a carrier or carriage service provider from being a member of the RTIRC. Carriers would still of course be able to provide support and advice to the review, but Labor see no need for them to have formal representation on the committee.
Labor will be moving a further amendment to broaden the terms of reference of the committee’s reviews, designed to improve its outcomes. Currently the bill provides that the committee should examine the adequacy of services in rural and regional Australia—and fair enough. Evidence presented to the Senate inquiry highlighted the importance of the telecommunications sector to Australia’s economic performance and made a case for regular reviews with a broader outlook. As such, Labor believes that the bill should be amended to expand the review committee’s terms of reference to permit it to consider a wider range of matters. The committee’s ambit should include a consideration of issues such as whether telecommunications services are meeting the social and commercial needs of the Australian people, whether services are reasonably available throughout Australia and whether competition is operating effectively. Labor will move an amendment to address this issue.
The final shortcoming of this bill is that it only requires that reviews be held once every five years. Five years is a long time in any policy setting, let alone a fast-moving area like telecommunications. The inadequacy of this five-yearly review requirement was recognised by numerous witnesses at the Senate inquiry into this bill, including most forcefully the NFF. Ultimately, in line with the previous occasions on which this bill was introduced to this House, the government senators’ report adopted a recommendation that the review period be reduced to three years. Labor believes that this recommendation would improve the bill and will move an amendment giving it affect.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REGULAR REVIEWS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,43,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2005-06-20,"—I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Regular Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2005. This bill, as Senator Conroy has pointed out, is a very inadequate response to the recommendations of chapters 8 and 9 of the Estens review: the regional telecommunications inquiry of 2002. That particular review sought to ensure—and I am reading here from recommendation 9.2—that:
Establishing a structure for future reviews of regional, rural and remote telecommunications services should:
provide certainty for regional, rural and remote communities;
ensure that reviews are independent from executive government ...
allow for flexible and appropriate policy responses to meet the range of needs in regional, rural and remote Australia; and
promote competition and commercial service delivery as the most effective and sustainable service outcome.
It is well known and on the public record that the government’s response to the Estens committee has been pretty much slammed by the National Farmers Federation, on behalf of rural Australia, as being a totally inadequate response. It is certainly the view of the National Farmers Federation president, Mr Peter Corish, that the government has failed to respond to more than half of the recommendations of that inquiry, in full or in part. In particular, the National Farmers Federation submission to this inquiry made it quite clear that it felt that the legislation as drafted failed to comprehensively address the recommendations in chapter 9 in particular. For instance, it said about recommendation 9.1:
The review process should be linked to a strategic plan for regional telecommunications, and underpinned by ongoing arrangements that provide a high degree of certainty that Government funds will be made available to support service improvements ...
The NFF stated that it understands this recommendation to mean that the legislation should include an appropriate mechanism be put in place to ensure that adequate funding is provided. Of course, there is no appropriate mechanism. The government has put in place small bits of money—I think it is about $180-odd million as part of its response to Estens—but that falls well short of the sort of multibillion dollar investment that is needed to bring Australia’s creaking telecommunications network up to world class standards, particularly in rural and regional Australia.
In addition, whilst this bill is being brought down today, the government’s strategic plan for telecommunications has not been brought forward. In fact, I was the chair of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee inquiry into the formation of ACMA earlier this year, which recommended that such a review was needed. The government needed an ongoing review, such as Ofcom is doing in the UK, to come up with a broader plan for telecommunications in this country. But the government has not done such a thing; it would scare this government, it is anathema to this government which believes in a ‘light touch’ approach to regulation of telecommunications. It was interesting to hear the comments over the weekend from the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Party, Mr John Anderson, which indicated that the Nationals are now calling for an approach of structural reform for Telstra, for more regulation and for more funding for rural and regional Australia. That sort of approach is consistent with the recommendations of the Estens inquiry but totally inconsistent with the response to date of the government to the Estens inquiry and totally inconsistent with the very inadequate measures we see here in this bill tonight.
When we looked at the evidence that came to the Senate committee which looked at this bill, it was quite clear that, with the exception of Telstra and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, pretty much no other significant player felt this bill was adequate. It is noteworthy that the government’s two core constituencies—the rural constituency and the small business constituency, as represented by the Small Enterprises Telecommunications Centre—both made it quite clear that this bill was inadequate, it fell short of what was needed, it was not providing sufficiently regular reviews, it was not providing for sufficient local input into the development of local presence plans and it would not actually ensure that rural and regional Australia got a reasonable go at commenting on whether their services were being future-proofed, to use the almost slang term that has been used around these issues.
This disappoints me and the government response disappoints me. I am pleased to note that I will be followed tonight by Senator Eggleston, who chaired the Senate inquiry on this particular bill. I note that the government majority of that committee made seven recommendations. The Democrats endorsed six of them. Those recommendations would go a long way towards improving this bill. In particular, the first recommendation of the committee—unanimously endorsed by all committee members: government, Labor and Democrat—was that the bills be amended to reduce the maximum period of the review cycle from five to three years. This was a minimum demand from the National Farmers Federation, the Small Business Telecommunications Centre and pretty much everybody else who submitted to the inquiry other than, of course, Telstra and the department.
The second recommendation was that the first review be conducted within two years of the bill receiving royal assent, not three years as recommended by the bill as it stands. These sorts of recommendations actually start to provide some body to making sure that future-proofing will occur because—as we have seen with the Besley inquiry into 2000, the Estens inquiry in 2002 and even the Page report in 2005—the changes in telecommunications coming downstream are so rapid at the moment that country and rural Australia will always be trying to catch up with what is happening in key parts of urban Australia. That more regular review cycle is absolutely crucial.
I am staggered by the gall of this government—that it would bring this bill into this place without those minimal changes being made to this legislation. I am very surprised that those amendments have not been brought forward as government amendments to this bill to make sure that the unanimous recommendations of Senator Eggleston’s committee are actually reflected in this bill. To me, in the broader political sense, it will be interesting to see how the government responds to the recommendations of this committee. If Senator Coonan, as the minister, is going to show to the public of Australia, particularly rural Australia, that she is prepared to listen and to take on board concerns then a unanimous recommendation from a Senate committee cannot be ignored. A unanimous recommendation being endorsed by the National Farmers Federation and the Small Enterprise Telecommunications Centre makes it very difficult for this government to ignore it. We have seen Mr Corish making it clear that the government has fallen well short of what is reasonable in telecommunications.
I would be very surprised if this legislation were allowed to pass this chamber either this week or in August without amendments to bring it into line with the recommendations of the Senate committee. I would be very interested to see how the government senators—Senator Eggleston and Senator Santoro, who is also listed to speak later in this debate—respond to making sure that the government takes on board what I think are very reasonable recommendations from this committee as to how this bill should be amended.
Another recommendation from the committee dealt with the composition of the RTIRC, which is the committee that will be overseeing these reviews. I think those recommendations make sense as they are trying to make sure, as Senator Conroy pointed out, that the committee is not dominated by Telstra—Telstra reviewing Telstra, or the department reviewing Telstra, which is even worse. Recommendation No. 6 dealt with the issue of local presence plans, trying to make sure that a local presence plan is not just something that is cooked up between the incredibly inadequate department we have overseeing telecommunications in this country and Telstra but rather something that has real input from the local community. The committee recommended that local presence plans should be published in draft form to allow responses from the public affected by it, that the final local presence plan should be publicly available on the ACMA web site and that any local presence plan should be required to be a disallowable instrument. All of that brings in the capacity for the community to have a say on what is actually happening with telecommunications in their area.
The sophistication in terms of telecommunications that is now out there in local communities is extraordinary. The days are long gone when Telstra could come in and bamboozle a local community with all sorts of gee-whizzery. The extraordinary brokerage roles now being carried on by local authorities, local businesses, regional telecommunications organisations, local advocates and brokerage agents themselves are really changing the face of telecommunications right across regional Australia. That is something which has been very exciting and is to be encouraged.
My committee was in Townsville recently. The Townsville City Council has been a key player in trying to establish a regional telecommunications company. It has also been a key player in trying to encourage competition in Townsville between various carriers to improve broadband offerings in that city. That example has been replicated in other places: in Ballarat and Bendigo, which we visited, in Mildura, here in Canberra and in other parts of Australia including the lower Murray—areas where local government has played a key role in making sure that telecommunications is rolled out in a competitive and forward-thinking way. The local presence plans should facilitate that as much as they possibly can.
We have to make sure that the review committee, the RTIRC, has broad representation of people with interest in regional affairs, such as farmers, local government associations, isolated children’s parents associations, small business and consumers organisations. Disabilities organisations are an important group that we should not forget in this whole debate. They are the people who know what the needs are. They are increasingly well-informed about what is happening in the rest of the world as the world gets smaller due to the information technology revolution. They can input quite significantly into developing reasonable local presence plans which can actually mean something for a local community.
From the Democrats’ point of view, we welcome the fact that the government is providing some sort of a response, I suppose, to the Estens report but we are very disappointed that this bill falls so far short of the intent of the recommendations and falls so far short of providing that future-proofing that rural Australia is looking for from this government. We are also very disappointed—and it should be noted—that in this whole debate there has been no debate about urban Australia and its needs in terms of telecommunications.
—That is exactly right!
—That is exactly right, Senator Lundy. I should note that Senator Lundy is a very significant advocate for improvement. I note that the City of Casey gave a very significant submission to this inquiry. It would be remiss of the Senate to ignore the concerns that the City of Casey put. It is an outer suburban council in suburban Melbourne. It is right on the edge of metropolitan Melbourne, as I understand it. Senator McGauran might be able to correct my geography if I am wrong. I understand that the dotted line for the White Pages directory of Melbourne goes right through the middle of it, and it is impossible to make a local call from the city of Casey to the other side of metropolitan Melbourne. You have to go into different rates of call. Those sorts of issues are replicated right across the outer parts of metropolitan Australia. The City of Casey summarised its concerns to the committee by recommending:
(1) This Bill be amended to ensure that the purview of the proposed Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee will include reporting on the adequacy of telecommunications services within metropolitan areas; and
(2) This Bill (or the ACMA Bill) be amended explicitly to call for immediate review of the alignment of the telephony charging zones and the White Pages directory boundaries in our major cities with their planning boundaries and to propose the legislative changes needed to achieve cost-effective realignment.
The committee chaired by Senator Eggleston had some sympathy with the first part of that and thought that there may be flexibility in the bill for that to occur but felt that the second part of the City of Casey’s concerns fell outside this bill. Maybe they do, but it is something that we must not forget because in all of this the services in outer metropolitan Australia, where the network has been under its most extreme pressure due to population growth, are inadequate in so many ways. Telstra is playing incredible catch-up in terms of rolling out of infrastructure to actually deal with those areas.
Senator Lundy would know far better than I the experiences of outer metropolitan Australia in terms of the inadequacy of pair gains technology and a whole range of other technologies, which make it so much harder to get real and effective services and cost-effective pricing in many parts of outer metropolitan Australia, which to me is an important region of Australia. The city of Casey is a very long way from the CBD; again, my geographical knowledge of Melbourne might limit me, and Senator Allison might correct me, but I believe it is a good 40 or 50 kilometres from the city of Casey into the CBD. Certainly, in Brisbane I know that the outer suburban areas, which have been struggling to get decent services, can be as much as 40 or 50 kilometres from the CBD. They have their own regional issues and concerns which need to be met in the government’s response to telecommunications, and those are issues we will be debating in the committee stage.
The notion of having regular reviews of telecommunications is very important and the government should be commended for bringing it forward. But the government should not be allowed to get away with bringing forward such an inadequate process for ensuring future proofing, whether it be in rural regional Australia or urban regional Australia. The need to make sure that all Australians have access to a reasonable roll-out of telecommunications services as they develop and improve across Australia is something which I feel very strongly about, and I believe the Senate should as well. Telecommunications is increasingly the infrastructure backbone of modern economic growth. Without it we will find new logjams emerging in our economy, which will ensure that Australia falls behind. Many parts of Australia will rapidly fall even more behind the inner city, where services are at a much higher level even now.
So from that point of view the Democrats support the broad intent of this legislation but are very critical of the fact that it falls short of the Estens committee inquiry’s spirit, intent and recommendations, and that it falls short of the expectations of the key people who made submissions to the Senate committee. I hope that in the government’s response it recognises the inadequacy of this legislation, recognises the argument that Telstra has shifted so much from when this bill was first introduced; and recognises that small business Australia, rural Australia and outer urban Australia deserve a much better go than what is presented in this report. I hope it picks up the unanimous recommendations of the Senate committee, because I think they form the basis for at least cleaning up this bill a little so that we can actually talk about a bill that has a real chance of future proofing services, whilst allowing for real and meaningful local input.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REGULAR REVIEWS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,43,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-06-20,"—As Senator Cherry and others have said, there has been an enormous revolution in telecommunications over the last decade or so. We have gone from a period where we had just fax to one where we had ever faster internet, and we now have broadband, which has revolutionised telecommunications, especially in the business world.
—If you can get it!
—‘If you can get it,’ Senator Lundy says. Certainly, people in the city can get it, Senator Lundy, but the coalition is determined that people in regional and rural Australia will also benefit from the revolution in telecommunications which has occurred over the last decade. We believe that it is important for people in regional and rural Australia to have access to modern telecommunications, because there are not only people who need to be able to access the internet and have faster communications for personal use but also some very large industries located in rural Australia. They are located not only in the bigger centres of rural Australia but also in some of the most remote parts of regional Australia, and include very large tourist operations in places like the centre of Australia, the remote Kimberley region and the north of Queensland. Tourist operations need to have rapid and effective communications. There are very large mining operations in some of the most remote parts of Australia and it is very important for them to have access to sophisticated communications in this day and age because they compete in the world market. The most important groups in all of rural and regional Australia are the farming and pastoral industries. These days it is very important for farmers to have access to sophisticated communications. In 2005 the pastoral and farming industries are sophisticated, high-tech industries and they need to have access to modern communications.
For that reason, the coalition is committed to ensuring that people in regional Australia have access to communication facilities which are equal to the best in contemporary standards. Because the coalition, unlike the ALP, is concerned about people in regional Australia, the Howard government set up the Estens inquiry into telecommunications and their adequacy in regional, rural and remote Australia. As has been said, the Estens report contained 39 recommendations. The government announced in June 2003 that it accepted all of those recommendations and in fact invested the sum of $181 million in a comprehensive response to them. Senator Cherry does not seem to think that that is a very large amount of money but in fact that amount addressed all of the recommendations of the Estens report.
One of the key features of the Estens report was that there should be regular reviews of the adequacy of telecommunications in rural, remote and regional Australia. To that end it was proposed that a body be set up which would carry out regular reviews of the standards of telecommunications in regional Australia. That review body is the subject of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Regular Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2005 which we are now considering. The bill provides for the regional telecommunications review body to be set up to carry out reviews of services provided in regional Australia. That is in line with recommendation 9.1 of the Estens report, which stated:
The Government should put in place a process to regularly review telecommunication services in regional, rural and remote Australia, and to assess whether important new service advancements are being delivered equitably in those areas.
The recommendation went on:
The review process should be linked to a strategic plan for regional telecommunications and underpinned by ongoing arrangements that provide a high degree of certainty that Government funds will be made available to support service improvements in regional, rural and remote Australia, where they will not be delivered commercially within a reasonable timeframe.
Recently, the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee held some hearings into this bill. As Senator Cherry has said, I chaired that inquiry. We found that there was a great deal of interest in the proposal to set up this review body and that it was regarded as a body which would be effective in maintaining the levels of services in regional areas. The bill provides for regular reviews of the levels of services in regional areas of up to five years. The committee thought that a shorter period of review of some three years might be more appropriate. But, in effect, that possibility is covered within the provision of the bill which provides for reviews in periods of up to five years.
Furthermore, the committee felt that it was very important that the members of the review board should be persons who genuinely represented the interests of regional Australians. We suggested that one of the bodies which the government might like to consider including on the board could be the Australian Local Government Association, because local government is very in touch with the interests of regional Australia and the local government associations in all states sponsor telecommunications and communications IT as a means for local government to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations. We thought having local government represented on this board was a good idea.
We also suggested that groups such as the Isolated Children’s Parents Association might be included on the board because I am sure, as all senators know, the ICPA—
—That was Telstra ringing you up!
—I am sure that was Telstra ringing—
—Telstra even works in a country town like Canberra!
—country New South Wales—namely, Canberra—to let us know that they were very committed to providing improved services in rural and regional Australia, including country towns like Canberra. The ICPA comes along to parliament every year. For the ICPA, telecommunications in rural areas are very important because these days children receive distance education through satellite services and the internet. To the ICPA, maintaining telecommunications in regional areas at a level comparable to those available elsewhere in Australia and indexing them to contemporary levels is very important. A couple of years ago, when I was travelling up through the Kimberley, I saw an example of education being delivered to very remote station communities by satellite service. That is a good example of why telecommunications are important to families living on isolated stations and farms throughout Australia. Through satellite delivered education services the children in those locations receive the best of education services and are kept up to date accordingly. We thought organisations like the PGA, the Pastoralists’ and Graziers’ Association, and the National Farmers Federation could also contribute very effectively were they included on this review board. I am sure the government will give due consideration to including bodies such as that on the review board.
What this basically comes down to is the fact that the Howard government are committed to ensuring that people in regional Australia do have telecommunications services at levels comparable with those in city areas. We are committed to ensuring that telecommunications services in rural areas are at a standard which is adequate and we are committed to protecting the interests of the people of regional Australia. That is why this board is being set up. It was interesting that Senator Conroy made much of the fact that the ALP wanted to extend the scope of the review board to cover suburban Australia. I suppose nothing could underline more effectively than that proposal of his the fact that the ALP has very little concern for the people of regional Australia and is in fact a metropolitan based and focused party. I would not like anybody to be mistaken about that fact. The ALP has very few members from regional Australia. In fact, the coalition and especially the Liberal Party very largely represent the people of regional Australia in the federal parliament. It is the coalition, through the establishment of this regional telecommunications review board, which will protect the interests of the people of regional Australia in terms of telecommunications.
There was very little doubt in my mind, and in the minds of other committee members, that this review board would prove to be a very important tool for ensuring that the people of regional Australia did have telecommunications services for themselves personally and for their businesses which would be maintained at whatever the contemporary standard of the day was. This will prove to be a very effective means of achieving that goal. I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REGULAR REVIEWS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,43,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-06-20,"—I am very pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Regular Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2005 this evening, but I ought to start with some of the more outrageous elements of Senator Eggleston’s contribution—mainly his assertion that somehow Senator Conroy’s views that the review board should extend to metro areas is evidence of something other than our complete commitment to regional areas. I think it is time for Senator Eggleston and the rest of the coalition representatives in this chamber to get a lesson in reality on what is going on with telecommunications in Australia.
The fact is that telecommunications services in this country are so far away from being up to scratch that they are a thousand miles from being anywhere near future proofed. The point that Labor makes with respect to the standard of services in this country is that it is not just the rural and regional areas that find themselves so far behind but that that poor service extends into outer metropolitan areas and indeed into inner city areas and suburban areas as well. They are all affected by Telstra’s undermaintenance and underinvestment in the telecommunications network. It does not matter where you live in this country, there are many victims of pair gains, which means that they cannot access broadband services, or at least ADSL broadband services, even if they were willing to pay some of the ridiculous prices that Telstra charge, particularly outside of metropolitan Australia.
So let us get the facts right. What we are talking about here with this legislation is the government’s effort to further window-dress a very poor performance in telecommunications in this country. This effort to window-dress what is going on out there is derived from the regional telecommunications inquiry, the Estens inquiry. We keep hearing in this place that the Howard government will satisfy the requirements of this inquiry and somehow form justification for further privatisation. There is no greater farce. For a start, the Estens inquiry recommendations do not go anywhere near the heart of the problems that are plaguing telecommunications in this country. The whole premise of the Estens document is to try to justify further privatisation, to make it look like there is some activity out there that will somehow lead to the political fix to get the National Party to support the privatisation of the rest.
We know by the sheer weight of evidence that those changes are not happening. We need look no further than the OECD rankings of broadband penetration in Australia to see what a dismal failure the policy is from a nationwide perspective. We need look no further than some of the annual reporting by both the ACCC and the ACA and some of the telecommunications carriers to know what difficulty, from a competitor’s point of view, many of the carriers are having accessing the Telstra network and, from the ACCC’s point of view, that the cost of residential telecommunications is actually going up. Line rental is going up for residential telecommunications service consumers in this country. Surely that is evidence of a system that is completely failing the Australian people. We are in the 21st century, and universal access to affordable broadband is where this policy should be starting from, not what it is trying to aim for. It is now 2005 and we have been fighting these issues, and Senator Eggleston knows—because I think he has been on every single inquiry as well—that progress is not occurring in any way, shape or form that will satisfy the needs of Australians.
I would like to discuss the issue of future proofing per se. Once upon a time, not so long ago, the catchphrase of the coalition government was that services had to be up to scratch. Everyone wanted to know what ‘up to scratch’ meant. They did not know what ‘up to scratch’ meant and, by the time people in rural and regional Australia woke up to the trick that ‘up to scratch’ meant anything up to 19.2 kilobytes per second for a data service, they realised they were being conned. It was only then that the Howard government switched their rhetoric to ‘future-proof’—that it must be future proofed. But now rural and regional Australians and many others elsewhere who are also affected by bad service have woken up to the fact that the Howard government’s term ‘future-proof’ means absolutely nothing. It means absolutely no change. They think that ‘future-proof’ means the HiBIS. What does the HiBIS do? It gives public subsidies to Telstra so that they can keep doing what they have always done, which is build up their monopoly and inhibit other people providing services. That is not a telecommunications policy; that is a policy to privatise Telstra—and it always has been.
I like to give credit where credit is due and I would like to give credit to Senator Coonan. Senator Coonan was the only telecommunications minister of the Howard government who walked into this chamber and said, ‘It is in our interests to look after Telstra’s bottom line and we are going to do that in the interests of privatisation because that is our primary policy goal.’ I was paraphrasing but, prior to Senator Coonan, the coalition were not prepared to fess up to what we knew to be the truth. The truth is that the Howard government’s primary public policy objective is to keep Telstra’s bottom line as fat as possible, in the interests of their privatisation agenda.
Every other policy consideration of the Howard government is a secondary factor—including the availability of quality, affordable broadband services, including reasonable prices for a standard telephony service and including access to internet speeds that make the download of a web page or an email attachment actually possible. Many Australians do not have access to those services and, with their dial-up internet connection, cannot do what they should be able to do as home based businesses and small businesses—and they have no hope of getting a faster service.
Throughout many of the inquiries, including the inquiry into this bill, the Senate has heard a lot of evidence about what these inhibiting factors are in Telstra’s network. The coalition government think that pair gains are a bit of a joke, but we are talking about the features of the physical network that Telstra has tried to cut costs on implementing that still pervade Australia’s telecommunications network. Pair gains affect nearly one million people in this country, which is a fair proportion of the services provided. We know that out of the 1.2 million customers who are affected by pair gain services, some 800,000 of them are affected by a RIM. That sounds a bit technical, but a RIM is like a mini exchange and most people connected to those RIMs cannot get access to the ADSL broadband services.
The government claimed in the Estens review that there would be a recommendation that would be acted upon to rid Telstra’s network of pair gain services. The government say that that recommendation has been fulfilled by the mere fact that Telstra have said that they will do something about these pair gain systems. The fact is that Telstra are not doing anything. The fact is that, despite all the lip-service in the Estens review about mitigating pair gains and removing them, despite the government’s claim that they have acted on that recommendation, Telstra do not have a policy to remove broadband-blocking infrastructure from their telecommunications network. The fact is that it is their policy to leave it right there, and for those 1.2 million or 800,000 customers, depending on what sort of pair gain system they have, it is left in place.
So while reality is occurring over here—and all those people continue to be frustrated on a daily, weekly, monthly or annual basis because they cannot get the sorts of services that they ought to be able to get in the 21st century—in the other corner, in the parallel universe, the coalition government say it is all going really well. They say that they have acted on those recommendations and that this legislation before us is proof that they are progressing. Well, it is not. In the parallel universe that the coalition government live in they pretend that things are getting better. They put notions of activity on pieces of legislation like this that so marginally tweak the edges of the regulatory regime that they are hardly worth while.
Labor are supporting the majority of the recommendations that we have put forward in our committee report, and we think that any minute progression is probably worth while. But this legislation will just build on the small pile of previously minute changes to tweak the system that have not done anything to solve these big policy questions. We are still suffering in terms of our broadband penetration. It is not so much our farmers in rural and regional Australia that I am worried about. As a constituency, they have reasonably high levels of connectivity, thanks to some early subsidy. I am more worried about the people who do not have an organisation like the National Farmers Federation to represent them—who are doing it quite admirably at the moment too—such as the people who are on those long roads out of town, on degraded copper, on an extended pair gain that might service two, three or four properties that have very little hope of one cent being spent by Telstra, the government or anyone else on having their services improved.
I am concerned about those sprawling outer suburbs of major metropolitan centres like Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide where Telstra puts in cheapskate infrastructure in a RIM—a subexchange that prevents broadband access. It is that kind of behaviour that has hardly changed at all under the coalition’s policy, because the government allows Telstra to do what they want: keep their costs low, at the expense of these average people who just want to get a decent internet service. They do not want to fiddle around with 14 kilobytes per second, or sometimes get 26 kilobytes or maybe get 42 kilobytes per second, if they are lucky, only to have it drop out regularly, and they pay another local call each time they have to dial up their ISP. That should not be happening. It happened years ago. It is fascinating to see that many other countries who have had their own struggles with telecommunications policies have taken on these issues and fixed their competition and regulatory regimes so that consumers can expect a quality, reliable and affordable data service.
I come back to my earlier point: what is wrong with the government? What is wrong with the government is that none of these issues constitute policy priorities—none at all. The policy priority of the Howard government comes back to one issue and one issue only—that is, the sale of Telstra. That is their primary motivation. Everything else becomes subservient to that goal and, whilst ever the coalition remain in power, there is no way out of this hole that the Howard government have dug for telecommunications consumers and citizens, community groups, home based businesses and small businesses—all those who now rely on these kinds of internet services for their survival and interaction with society. It is a grave indictment of the Howard government.
There have been plenty of other economic issues, too, over the last nine years—and through a period of extended growth of our economy—that this Howard government will be held accountable for. At some point, it may deign to explain to the Australian people why through this period of growth we are going backwards in such an important area of economic infrastructure as broadband. One day, the Howard government may explain to the Australian people why it has been so negligent in this area.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REGULAR REVIEWS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,43,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-06-20,"—I rise to speak briefly on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Regular Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2005. There has been enormous pressure on the government to try and ensure that the bush is up to scratch in a telecommunications sense before they proceed with the full sale of Telstra, and that is what this bill is all about. A lot of that pressure has come from the National Party, whose key constituents are very concerned about guarantees that a privatised Telstra will continue to provide services to rural and regional Australia that might in the future be adequate. Those concerns are not unfounded. When the Commonwealth Bank was privatised some years ago, many branches in rural and regional areas closed down—as did so many other services as they were privatised, simply centralised or focused much more on the city.
The Democrats do not support the full privatisation of Telstra. We opposed the previous tranches of the Telstra sale. We did so because we did not think it was in the national interest. In fact, we doubt the government has any serious reason to sell Telstra. We say that at a minimum the government should own key telecommunications infrastructure to ensure equitable access to affordable state-of-the-art telecommunications if Australia is to achieve international competitiveness and social progressiveness.
In particular, telecommunications are an essential part of economic and social infrastructure for rural and remote areas, and they are becoming more important in the context of the information economy and the need to access services such as e-commerce, e-learning, e-health and e-banking. Indeed the National Farmers Federation president recently said:
Farmers in the 21st Century need access to more than just a basic telephone service–they also need affordable, quality mobile and internet services to remain competitive ...
This bill is, in my view, a failed attempt by the government to gain the vital support of the public and interest groups of rural and regional Australia for the full sale of Telstra. That is evidenced by the fact that it only deals with recommendations of the Estens report and fails to implement any of the recommendations from the reports of the Senate committee inquiries chaired by my colleague Senator Cherry. Those inquiries included the inquiry into the provisions of the Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004 and related bills and matters, the report from which was tabled in March 2005; the inquiry into competition in broadband services, the report from which was tabled in August 2004; and the inquiry into the Australian telecommunications network, the report from which was tabled in August 2004. These reports point to the lack of competition, the lack of investment in new network infrastructure and the lack of a pro-consumer regulatory system.
The government ignored those recommendations. It has ignored calls from the ACCC, the National Competition Council and even the OECD to take steps to make telecommunications more competitive and pro-consumer by reducing Telstra’s market power. Most recently, it has so far ignored recommendations in the Page Research Centre report, which was commissioned by the National Party. The government continues to insist on holding Telstra’s excessive market power intact—it does this to maximise the price gained for selling Telstra—and on maintaining the clearly inadequate so-called light-touch regulatory system to give Telstra its best chance of gouging its customers.
In March this year, Senator Minchin argued that the government will be ‘in a better position to objectively and properly regulate the company’ after it is sold. This statement is interesting in light of comments made last week by Telstra’s new CEO, Mr Solomon Trujillo, who reportedly said that he will take an aggressive stance against increased regulation and that competition was not the answer to meet the needs of end users. He is quoted as saying:
You want the best possible infrastructure and services and capabilities for customers. That’s your constituency, not 8 or 10 or 20 competitors—it’s the end users.
Mr Trujillo was also reported as saying that Telstra could become a global prototype, even without buying up media companies, but that this would not happen if Telstra were broken up into separate units.
In considering these comments, we should consider several facts. The first is that Telstra is the most horizontally and vertically integrated telecommunications company in the OECD and most likely the world. Retaining a near monopoly position over the formerly publicly owned customer access network, or CAN, it is as a result in a market dominant position in most other sectors of the telecommunications market. It is particularly dominant in regional areas, being the universal service obligation provider and frequently the only provider of broadband links and CDMA mobile phone coverage. It is also the only telecommunications company that owns the copper wire infrastructure, fibre and pay TV.
The second consideration is competition. The ACCC continues to argue that effective competition in telecommunications delivers cheaper and better products to all of us, and yet competition in telecommunications has slowed. Mr Ed Willett, commissioner of the ACCC, in his speech on the state of competition in the telecommunications industry said:
It’s true the Australian market is characterised by healthy competition in at least some of the retail markets but this does not extend to full facilities based competition based on the costs and qualities of the underlying networks. Without regulation the move to this kind of sustainable competition is questionable. As a consequence, we are probably, at best, reaping only a small portion of the benefits of telecommunications competition.
Both the ACCC and the National Competition Council have in the past called for inquiries into structural separation as a means to address Telstra’s dominance and competition restrictions. Mr Trujillo’s comments surely fly in the face of what industry experts and even the government have been saying. Senator Cherry asked the minister during question time last week whether she agreed with comments made by Mr Trujillo. The minister in her response said:
So, in the context of those comments—admittedly we have not yet had an opportunity to really thrash these matters out with Mr Trujillo—I do not see that there is any great distance between his view of what is necessary for a competitive regime and the way in which the government would see it as appropriate to conduct the review on competition regulation, and to get the very best telecommunication environment for Australia going forward.
I think that response is some cause for alarm. The government continues to show reluctance to do anything about Telstra’s excessive market power and Telstra’s new CEO believes that this excessive market power is in fact the best thing for end users. You would also have to be concerned about how much the Telstra framework for operational separation will actually deliver. The Democrats question whether operational separation, to be defined by Telstra, is going to be enough. We again call on the government to initiate a review of the structural impediments to effective competition as recommended by the ACCC and the National Competition Council.
While I have indicated that this bill is inadequate in terms of its attempt to future proof Australia—whatever that means; we are not sure whether the future is the next three years, 20 years or 100 years and, in any case, it is a silly notion, in my view—before the sale of Telstra, we do support many of the recommendations of the Estens report and we want to see them implemented. However, we share the disappointment expressed by the National Farmers Federation in their submission to the inquiry into this bill, which said:
... after nearly two years the Bill is simply a ‘cut and paste’ of the earlier Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003.
The opportunity to modify and strengthen the Bill to better reflect the relevant recommendations has not been taken.
In a blow to the government and The Nationals, the National Farmers Federation said last week that substantially more work needed to be done to bring telecommunications services in rural Australia up to an acceptable standard. They cited telephone repair performance figures which showed a decline in performance by as much as five per cent. In an interview with the ABC, the President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Peter Corish, said that the NFF report dismissed the government’s claims that 28 out of the 39 recommendations had been implemented and that, in their view, only about half of those recommendations had been implemented to a satisfactory level.
According to the government majority report on this bill, most submissions were concerned with whether the recommendations of the Estens report had been addressed by the bill and whether they had been implemented in a satisfactory way. The government majority report made six recommendations. Given the concerns raised in submissions to the inquiry and most recent concerns raised by the National Farmers Federation, I believe that it would be in the government’s best interests to implement those six recommendations—but no. Surely the government cannot afford to continue to ignore the advice of key organisations and industry experts.
Given that this bill directly affects the key constituents of the National Party, I am surprised that they themselves have not moved amendments to implement the committee’s recommendations. In fact, I would have thought that the National Party would be asking the government to delay the bill for the full sale of Telstra until those issues flagged by the National Farmers Federation had been addressed. Yet the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts announced last week that the bill would be tabled in parliament in August. It looks as though it is going to be left to the Democrats and other opposition parties to speak up for National Party constituents. The government should forget about its privatisation of Telstra and instead focus on upgrading the Telstra network to improve services and on making telecommunications more competitive. This remains our position and we have not been persuaded by anything the government has said in more recent times.
Before I finish, I will go back to the question of those recommendations. They are not in front of me at the moment, but, as I understand it, one of those recommendations was that there would be three-yearly reviews. As I understand it, that was also supported by the National Farmers Federation and others. In fact, the government members on the committee supported it. Instead of that, this bill allows for a review for up to five years. In other words, the government could choose to spin this out for five years and then five years after that instead of the three years that the committee recommended.
Things move very quickly in telecommunications, particularly in technology. You would think that this quite simple recommendation on the part of the committee at least would be adopted by the government—but no. The government says no to the National Farmers Federation and to almost every other organisation that has had anything to say about the likelihood that future proofing is even possible and so much to say about the risks associated with full privatisation. It is a sham and a ridiculous bill. It is hardly worth this chamber even dealing with it. I think it is shameful that this is the best the government can do in its absurd efforts to suggest that it is future-proofing this country against the risks of the privatisation of Telstra.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REGULAR REVIEWS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,43,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-06-20,"—I have heard the contributions of other members in this debate and the setting of the background to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Regular Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2005 as the sale of Telstra. I note those comments. I understand the position that Senator Allison has put in this debate. The Democrats believe that the best interests of country people are served by the retention of Telstra in public ownership. I have heard similar words from those opposite in the Labor Party. Although I fully believe Senator Allison and what she has to say on this subject, I am not quite so convinced that I am believing of what those in the Labor Party have to say about the sale of Telstra.
I see a party opposite that was a serial privatiser during its time in office. It privatised the Commonwealth Bank, the OTC, Qantas and so on. Yet we are to believe that, despite all this evidence of wanting to get the cash from the sale of those national assets, had it stayed in office after 1996 it would have drawn the line at the sale of Telstra. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will have to forgive me if I am ever so slightly sceptical about that. I have the feeling that, if there had not been a change of government in 1996, we would have seen the whole—not one-third or 49 per cent—of Telstra long gone from public ownership before this point in time.
We have this debate about what role these measures in this legislation might play in respect of a possible privatisation. This bill gives effect to the government’s response to the Estens report in respect of two broad components of that inquiry. The first component is to establish a mechanism which not just provides for but compels future governments to independently review telecommunications services. That clearly is meant to particularly address telecommunications services in the bush. The second component is to give the government power by the virtue of either the minister or the regulator to approve an acceptable local presence plan on the part of Telstra as a key telecommunications provider.
These are two very important components. Why should we particularly focus here implicitly, if not explicitly, on the issue of regional telecommunications services? Obviously, at the national level, with 84 per cent of the Australian population living densely within one per cent of the continent, you have a telecommunications company’s dream of a suitable market—a dense population, relative affluence and a need for telecommunications services. There is a very high chance of profitably rolling out high-quality services to those people. It is the other 16 per cent of the population, who live in a vast and very often sparsely populated area of the country, that the market may not provide for adequately. This bill is about making sure that we set standards in respect of those sorts of areas in Australia.
Some have linked the problem of supplying high-quality services to the bush with the sale of Telstra. The issue here is not that at all; the issue here is—and would be under any circumstances—about what the community can afford to provide, or needs to provide, to supply adequate services to these people, irrespective of what the ownership of a major telecommunications provider might be. It is irrespective of that fact. If you lot opposite had sold Telstra some years ago, as you were obviously contemplating, we would still be having a debate about what level of public subsidy or support needs to go into the provision of services in regional and rural Australia. That is undeniable. The only difference in the question of who owns Telstra is what mechanism you use to provide that kind of service—whether it is a subsidy, for example, to private sector operators, or whether it is some kind of licence condition or mandatory requirement operated through the fact that the government owns a particular provider.
Telstra in recent years has lifted its game with respect to its presence in rural and regional areas of Australia. Measures like Telstra Country Wide have been quite effective in imprinting on rural and regional Australia a sense of Telstra’s involvement in those areas. Cynics opposite will say that that is all about the sale of Telstra and it is only doing it to window-dress before the sale. From Telstra’s point of view it is very important to establish a strong market in those areas. There are still paying customers in those areas. Establishing a presence there is very important. It has done that quite successfully. We need to make sure that mechanisms are there for other providers, not necessarily just Telstra, to ensure that they also see the need to comprehensively serve customers in rural and regional Australia. It is very important that we address these mechanisms in legislation. These mechanisms are addressed in the legislation that is presently before the Senate. Mechanisms like those in the bill provide the means, through reviews, to ensure that we understand the nature of the problems and provide for, in the case of Telstra, licence conditions or a local presence plan to be rolled out to serve the needs of those people who might be identified in such reviews.
In this debate I have heard Senator Lundy rail about the fact that the performance of the government—and when she says ‘government’ I suppose she means Telstra—in respect of telecommunications services in the bush has not been good enough and that Telstra has not delivered well enough in those areas. She asked: what is the government doing to ensure that there is a higher standard of service being rolled out in rural and regional Australia? First of all, I think there has been a clear lift in the standard of service being offered to people in rural and regional Australia, notwithstanding the fact that technology is rapidly changing and there is a need to leapfrog, more or less, to keep up with what is going on in the metropolitan areas of Australia. Telstra has done a good job in delivering that under market conditions in rural and regional Australia.
The other important point to make here is that, in the past, under a former Labor government, there were no such mechanisms of the kind that Senator Lundy and others on that side have spoken about when there were serious deficiencies with Telstra’s services. There were no devices to save the bush then. There were no devices to ensure that they did not miss out on services that were available in the city. Theoretically, they say that they were there, but were they delivered? No, they were not. The fact is that this government, for the first time under any government, is delivering mechanisms that will let people in rural and regional Australia see that there is going to be a regular process to undertake an assessment of what their needs are. It is the first time that this has been rolled out in Australian policy with respect to telecommunications. The mechanisms are built in there to follow that through, with the proper local presence plans or other licence conditions that will ensure that those needs, having been addressed, are met. I believe that that is an appropriate step and I support it.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2005-06-20,"—Tonight I would like to continue my speech of last Thursday night. I wanted to talk about how fortunate I have been, having been part of the Howard government’s program to involve the Australian people in rebuilding the Australian community. I used two examples of how we involve and support the community in delivering services in education and the environment. I particularly wanted to talk about the Green Corps program. It is not a large program in terms of funding; the budget brought down in May provides $24½ million for Green Corps for the year. But over the years since its establishment in 1996, over 12,000 young people have participated in over 1,200 Green Corps projects—10 people per project. Those projects are something which Senator Bartlett touched on last Wednesday night, when he was complaining about the very important Natural Heritage Trust. He claimed that the investment in the National Heritage Trust of $3 billion has been largely wasted. He said:
... we have just had a lot of feelgood projects that have done a little bit of good here and there but on the whole have not achieved anywhere near value for money.
Senator Bartlett, the Green Corps program would be one of those feelgood projects you so denigrate, yet, as I said, Green Corps has involved 12,000 young people across Australia in 1,200 projects. To you the projects may be only feelgood projects doing only a little good, but over 10 years the young people involved in them have planted 11 million trees. Perhaps Senator Bartlett has much higher targets than former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who believed that planting one million trees would be enough to reverse the depletion of the environment in Australia. These young people have planted 11 million trees through this little feelgood program.
I think Senator Bartlett is a little bit out of touch with what we are trying to do here. The important thing is actually not the 11 million trees—11 times more than former Prime Minister Bob Hawke wanted to plant—but getting 12,000 young Australians involved in the environment and with their peers, developing their leadership skills, their personality and their knowledge of the Australian environment. That is the value of the Green Corps projects. That is a perfect example of how a government should involve the people of Australia in delivering for the good of Australia.
I refer to another speech made by one of my Senate colleagues, Senator Lees, last week. On Monday night she spoke about environmental achievements. Of course, she was talking about her involvement. Senator Lees is not usually a fan of the government. Usually, any praise that she gives us is somewhat backhanded. But this time she talked about how we need to be involved and what we have to do in this place to advance our national course. She said that four things need to be done to be responsible in this place. Firstly, she said that we need to shine a light on the issues to make people understand what the issues are. Secondly—this is an important one from Senator Lees, an Independent—she said that it is important to suggest responsible policies. That is something not everyone here, apart from people on this side, is used to doing. Thirdly, she said that it is important to invest real resources, real money. Again, that is something that the government have done. Fourthly, Senator Lees said it is important to bring others with you. She was talking about bringing the people in this chamber with her, but I think it is just as important for the Australian government, when we do anything, to bring the people along with us.
Certainly, the government have invested resources in the environment and we have brought the Australian people with us. I will give an example. I know that throwing money is not the only thing to do, but I want to look at Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for the 1995-96 budget and Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for the current budget. I know that Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is not everything that the government wants to spend, but it has been a reasonably consistent indicator over the years of how much money is being spent. In the current budget, the appropriation for the Department of the Environment and Heritage is $991.8 million. That is 2.1 per cent of the total budget outlay provided in Appropriation Bill (No. 1). Ten years ago, in the 1995-96 budget, the last Labor budget, the total budget in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories was $547.6 million, which was 1.7 per cent of the total budget. The total budget in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) has increased by 50.6 per cent under this government.
I should say that 2.1 per cent is already a lot more than 1.7 per cent, but the total budget has increased by 50.6 per cent, so the real increase is much greater. But it is more than that, because in 1995-96 the budget for the department of the environment included the sport portfolio and the territories portfolio. I am not sure how that combination makes sense, but that was the case. If you take the sport and territory budgets out, the actual increase provided under this government in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is 136 per cent. That is how much this government has invested in our environment, and that is a real investment. It is also an investment committed to bringing people with us.
Another thing which I have been involved with—and, again, it is something involving Australian people—is the Work for the Dole program, which was the subject of Senator Buckland’s question this afternoon. I really appreciate Senator Buckland’s question and the minister responsible for responding to him, Senator Abetz, said it was almost like a question from our side because it brought out what this government has been trying to do in bringing communities together. Senator Buckland’s contribution—and perhaps he did not realise it—highlighted the fact that this government’s Work for the Dole program is not a labour market program; it is a program of bringing people in the communities closer to job opportunities, not of getting them into jobs. We have other programs that put people in jobs. These projects help people, particularly young people, to develop work habits. They involve the local communities in quality projects that provide community improvements through the efforts of these young people. Finally, they also help unemployed people, particularly unemployed young people, to find further career opportunities after the six-month period. They do not place people in jobs. People on the Work for the Dole program are not taken out of the unemployment calculation, unlike previous Labor government programs, where they came off the unemployment queue and were no longer counted once they got on one of those programs. Even so, the Labor government had a 10 per cent unemployment rate.
One of the complaints that Senator Buckland brought up was that only 40 per cent of the people who have gone through Work for the Dole found jobs. Hello? These people are the long-term unemployed. Without this Work for the Dole program, 100 per cent of them would not find jobs, and we have got jobs for 40 per cent of them. This is a vast improvement on anything that Labor ever managed in their 13 years in government. This is something that this government have done to bring people together: we take people out of the unemployment stream, bring them in with people in the community and show them what other opportunities exist, and that is a real success story.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Achievers</title>,ADJOURNMENT,44,1,speech
