Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  Mr Speaker, on indulgence, as members of the House would by now know, overnight in Afghanistan we lost an Australian commando, Sergeant Brett Wood. On another occasion we will have a formal condolence motion for Sergeant Wood, but it does seem appropriate, as the House sits today, to say a few words about him and also about his brothers who were injured. Overnight, we have had five Australian soldiers injured—two in the same incident in which Sergeant Wood lost his life, three in a separate engagement. This is a very tough day for our nation. As we speak, our soldiers continue in action, so there is a limit to what can be said about the operational circumstances in which Sergeant Wood was killed and in which other soldiers were injured. But nothing stops us paying tribute to Sergeant Wood in this place today.


Sergeant Wood was a 15-year veteran of our army. He was a genuine professional. He had been deployed overseas on a number of occasions—in Bougainville, in East Timor, in Iraq and on more than one occasion in Afghanistan. Sergeant Wood was a decorated man. He had won the Medal for Gallantry in action in Afghanistan. The Chief of the Defence Force today described him as a magnificent soldier, an inspirational leader with incredible operational experience. Sergeant Wood was a son and a husband, and our heart goes out today to his family, who would be grieving and still very much trying to absorb this devastating news. I am sure that our thoughts will be with them today and will continue to be with them.


With the five soldiers who are wounded, our thoughts are with them as we trust that they make a full recovery. Two of them are described as seriously ill. For their families this is a dreadful time of waiting and uncertainty. Of course our thoughts are with those families as well.


As I said earlier today, on days like this there can be some members of our nation who despair and who wonder at the losses in Afghanistan and the brutal nature of the engagement there. To those Australians who perhaps today might be despairing about our deployment in Afghanistan, I reaffirm that we are making progress, that it is difficult. But through the eyes of those who have regularly gone to Afghanistan—for example, Ben Roberts-Smith, our most recent VC winner—there can be no doubt: we are making progress. We make that progress because of the sacrifice and dedication of people like Sergeant Wood.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:04):  Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister. Australia has lost another fine soldier in Sergeant Brett Wood, who is the 24th Australian to be killed in action in Afghanistan. We remember him. We also think of the five others wounded on the same day. What we have is yet another reminder of the risks our soldiers run on our behalf, the tragedy that can befall our country's servants carrying out the decisions of this government and this parliament, and the high price that some people pay for our freedom and for our security. Like the Prime Minister, I reiterate my conviction that this is anything but a pointless death in a pointless war. Our soldiers are there to protect the Afghan people from religiously inspired barbarism, to help the Afghan state and the Afghan Army to ultimately protect themselves, to contribute to the stability of the region, and as far as we can to make the world safe from Islamic terrorism. This is the cause for which Sergeant Wood has given his life. This is the cause which our military are doing their best to uphold in Afghanistan. We salute Sergeant Wood and we extend our condolences to his family and to his comrades.

That this House calls on the Treasure

hy
:





(1)
 he falsely stated on ABC Radio on 20 May 2011 in relation to the removal of a concessional rate of iron ore royalty by the Western Australian Government that ""Mr Barnett did not communicate that he was going to do this to us… But what Mr Barnett has done here is just very 
strange. He didn't communicate with us about this move in this budget. He didn't get our tick. He didn't discuss it with us.""





(
2
)
 he failed to disclose that in early 2010, Western Australian Treasury officials advised the Commonwealth that WA proposed to remove this concessional royalty rate.





(
3
)
 he failed to disclose that on 10 May 2010 the WA Treasury wrote to the Commonwealth Treasury advising that the WA Government proposed to remove this concessional royalty rate.





(
4
)
 he failed to disclose that on 17 May 2010 the Commonwealth Treasury provided a brief to the Treasurer advising that WA proposed to remove this concessional royalty rate





(
5
)
 he failed to disclose that on 17 May 2010 he gave a press conference in which he acknowledged that WA was ""looking at very substantial increases in the royalties""





(6) 
he failed to disclose that on 17 May 2010 he gave a speech in which he stated ""We're prepared to talk further with state governments who might have been making their own plans to capture a fairer share of resource wealth through lifting royalties.""





(7) 
he failed to disclose that the minerals resources rent tax costings prepared by Commonwealth Treasury assumed a state royalty rate of 7.5%—which is the iron ore royalty rate in WA with the concession removed.





(8) 
he failed to disclose that in February 2011 he directed the Commonwealth Grants Commission not to modify its methodology in response to WA's proposals to remove concessional royalty rates.





(9) 
he failed to disclose that on 18 May 2011 the Chief of Staff of the WA Premier telephoned the Treasurer's Chief of Staff to advise that WA would be removing this concessional royalty rate in its Budget on 19 May 2011; and





(10) 
after these examples of evidence that he was aware of WA's proposal to remove this concessional royalty rate, that he stated on radio that WA had not communicated its intention to do this?



Can this government give a straight answer to a straight question?




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Leader of the House.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I move:


That the member be no longer heard.


Question put.


The House divided. [15:17]


(The Speaker—Mr Harry Jenkins)


Question negatived. 




Mr PYNE:
  I move:


That Mr Abbott be granted an extension of time.




The SPEAKER:
  It can only be extended by five minutes. Question put.


The House divided. [15:26]


(The Speaker—Mr Harry Jenkins)


Question agreed to.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I do thank the House for this extension of time. I particularly thank the crossbench members of parliament for their support in this matter. May I simply say: the government's efforts to gag this debate show just how desperate they are. It is urgent that standing orders be suspended.




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I refer to your ruling in the last week of the last parliamentary sitting in which you ruled that in a motion to suspend standing orders the speaker must address the issue of why it is urgent that standing orders should be suspended.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! I thank the Leader of the House for reminding me of such a great ruling and I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition is going to keep that in mind, but he has just started.




Mr ABBOTT:
  It is urgent that standing orders be suspended, because nothing could be more important than the Australian people and the Australian parliament understanding whether the ministers in this government are capable of giving a straight answer to a straight question. Nothing is more urgent for this parliament than to consider this vital matter. Last Friday, the Treasurer was asked a very straight question on national radio. He knew that Western Australia was going to increase its royalties. They gave you a lot of advance warning.




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition is going to the substance of the resolution he moved before the parliament. He must address the question of why standing and sessional orders should be suspended.



Opposition members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! Those interjecting are just not helping at all. The Leader of the Opposition is aware of his responsibility to actually speak to the reasons for the suspension of standing and sessional orders and not to the motion that would then be put.




Mr ABBOTT:
  It is absolutely urgent that the Treasurer has this matter cleared up before the parliament proceeds to anything else, because nothing could be more important than the question of whether this Treasurer is capable of telling the truth and whether this Treasurer did, in fact, tell the truth to the Australian people last Friday. This is very urgent, Mr Speaker. In response to a direct question, the Treasurer said:


Well first of all Mr Barnett did not communicate that he was going to do this to us.


We now know that this was absolutely false and this is why standing orders should be suspended—because the veracity of the government is just about the most important issue that any parliament can determine. This is the most important matter before this parliament. What we now know is the reason that standing orders should be suspended is so the Treasurer can finally clear this up. This is why standing orders should be suspended. It is absolutely necessary—




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Leader of the Opposition is straying from the question before the House. He is speaking about an issue that should be addressed by a substantive motion of the House not by a suspension of standing orders.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! I am listening carefully to the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition will speak on the reasons for the suspension of standing orders. Is the motion seconded?




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the time for the debate has expired.




Mr Hockey:
  I second the motion and I add here: nothing could be more urgent than dealing with a Treasurer who lies to the Australian people and does it in parliament.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The time allotted for the debate has concluded.




Mr Albanese:
   Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask that the member for North Sydney withdraw those remarks.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The member for North Sydney will withdraw.




Mr Abbott:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. What we have seen from this government today is a deliberate attempt to gag discussion in this parliament on an extremely important matter. Given the behaviour of the government, I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that under the special circumstances that pertain in the parliament today, it is not right that the shadow Treasurer should be asked to withdraw.




Mr Crean:
  He has been asked to. It is right.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Minister for regional Australia and the arts and all sorts of other things should sit there quietly. To assist the proceedings of the House, I have invited the member for North Sydney to withdraw.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I put it to you that during the Leader of the Opposition's five-minute extension the Leader of the House did absolutely everything in his power to ensure that the Leader of the Opposition did not have the chance to fulfil his time. He raised four points of order. I think that, with due respect to you, Mr Speaker, I would ask for your indulgence to the member for North Sydney given the extraordinary obfuscation and tactics that have been run by the government today to stop this being debated. I would ask you on this occasion to not ask the member for North Sydney to withdraw.




The SPEAKER:
  Both the member for Sturt and the Leader of the Opposition have not made points of order; they have made a point and it is on the record. Regrettably, as in many contests, provocation is not a defence and I have invited the member for North Sydney to withdraw. I have appreciated, and I do appreciate it today, that I had a member of the opposition frontbench withdraw without me having to invite her. I am simply inviting the member for North Sydney to withdraw because I wish to get on with proceedings which are going to be fairly sensitive. The next part of proceedings will be very sensitive and I would appreciate closure on this point.




Mr Abbott:
  Mr Speaker, we have noted your remarks. I am reluctant to continue this discussion, but I just wish to register, before this matter is concluded—and it will be concluded with honour by the shadow Treasurer—




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat.




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker—




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader of the House will resume his seat.




Mr Ruddock:
  He's a thug.




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Before we deal with the matter before me with the member for North Sydney, the member for Berowra, who as the father of the House knows better, will withdraw.




Mr Ruddock:
  I withdraw reluctantly.




The SPEAKER:
  I would prefer it without qualification but I thank the member. The Leader of the Opposition will come quickly to the point. He is getting the type of allowance that leaders get from time to time, and I think he appreciates that.




Mr Abbott:
  I understand and appreciate that, Mr Speaker, but the whole point of the debate which has been gagged by the government was to establish the issue about which you are now requiring the shadow Treasurer to withdraw. So it is only because—




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader of the Opposition has made his point.




Mr Abbott:
  the government has gagged debate that the shadow Treasurer felt the need to make that statement.




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.




Mr Hockey:
  I withdraw.




The SPEAKER:
  I thank the member for North Sydney.



Honourable members interjecting— 




Mr Christensen:
  You're still a liar, Swannie.




The SPEAKER:
  The member for Dawson will withdraw.




Mr Christensen:
  I withdraw, Mr Speaker.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, in due fairness to the House, as I also called the Treasurer a liar, I also withdraw.



Honourable members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The House will come to order. I will not be giving the call to anybody until we resolve certain matters that are not before the chair. At the moment we are still in question time.




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, in fact as it is past 3:30, under the standing orders we are not still in question time and we have not yet resolved the question that is before the chair, which is the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, seconded by the shadow Treasurer. That question must be resolved.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! Pleasantly, for once I was correct. It appears that I am the only person in the chamber at the moment, I suspect, that actually knows where we are at. The first thing is we are still in question time because I do not have, and the House does not have, a motion before the chair because the motion was not stated before the conclusion of time for the debate. People might actually listen to me when I say that there are sensitive matters that I am wishing to go to, over and above a withdrawal, on which I ask for cooperation. But there is nothing before the chair because the time allotted for the debate expired before I put the question. So I am in question time.




Mr Swan:
  Mr Speaker, I ask that  further questions be put on the Notice Paper.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2011-05-24,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:45):  All Australians want to receive a fair share of their state's mining and resource wealth, and state governments have an obligation under their royalty regimes to ensure that occurs. Australia's wealth is shifting west, much of it now located on the west and north-west coasts of Australia. Ninety per cent of our recoverable reserves of natural gas are located in these waters. The Gorgon gas development alone is expected to deliver eight per cent of the world's LNG needs. Ninety-seven per cent of total production of iron ore comes from the west, and Western Australia accounts for well over one-third of Australia's exports. By the end of the decade, this figure is expected to be closer to 50 per cent.


But the federal government has been on a massive tax grab to soak as much revenue out of the west as it can get its grasping fingers on. Last year, we witnessed the fiasco of the resource super profits tax. It was an illogical, ill-conceived tax that assisted in the downfall of Prime Minister Rudd but—miraculously, one would think—left unscathed its principal architect, the hapless Treasurer of this country. After that unmitigated failure, the Gillard government came up with a less ambitious but no less destructive mining resource rent tax. The mining tax has not been finalised despite the fact that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer claimed they secured a deal for it from three large mining companies last year—almost 12 months ago.


Now, in another development in this very sorry saga, the member for Lilley has been caught again 'gilding the lily'. Rather than being economical with his outrageous budget spending, Australians can instead always rely on this Treasurer to be economical with the truth. He has expressed 'surprise' that the Western Australian government has addressed an anomaly in its royalty regime. He has threatened retribution through the Commonwealth Grants Commission. He and the Prime Minister have said they will slash infrastructure funding to Western Australia but, importantly, he said on ABC Radio National last Friday that the decision of the Western Australian government was 'a surprise'. Further, he told the ABC:


Mr Barnett did not communicate that he was going to do this to us.


Today, the Treasurer said this announcement about the royalty regime in Western Australia was 'suddenly out of the blue'. The facts are to the contrary.


But before I detail his deception to this House and to the Australian people, let me briefly explain what was announced in last week's budget in Western Australia. The budget states that the state government will move to increase the royalty rate for iron ore fines to 6.5 per cent from 1 July 2012 and to 7.5 per cent from 1 July 2013, in line with the rate applying to lump ore. In other words, it is not an increase in the royalty rate of 7.5 per cent, which still exists; it is removing a concession, a historical anomaly, to bring in line all iron ore products—fines and lumps—to 7.5 per cent. This will deliver a fairer return to the Western Australian community. The Western Australian community owns those resources.


As I said, this different royalty treatment of iron ore is a historic anomaly—a discount given to iron ore products in the early days of the Pilbara when the industry was getting on its feet. But the Treasurer has said that Premier Barnett 'did not communicate he was going to do this to us'—in other words, to the government. He did not communicate that he was going to lift the fines rate to 7.5 per cent. Oh, really? Is that right? I have a pile of press clippings here from at least 12 months ago detailing how the Barnett government most certainly intended to increase the rate applicable to fines.


Premier Barnett did not say he was going to increase the royalty rate of 7.5 per cent across all minerals, and he has not done so. What he told the Treasurer, what he told the Australian people and the Western Australian public, as recorded in this handful of press clippings, time and time again was that they were going to increase fines to 7.5 per cent. As far back as 18 March 2010, Premier Colin Barnett announced his hopes to scrap all discounts on mining in Western Australia within three years. On 10 April 2010, another article in the West Australian newspaper reported Mr Barnett as saying he would end concessions on mining within three years. This is precisely what he has done.


On 10 May 2010, Premier Barnett again spoke of bringing the iron ore fines rate and the lump rate of 7.5 per cent into line. In the Australian on 13 May 2010, in an article written by Dennis Shanahan, Premier Barnett told the Australian he planned to raise the royalty rate for iron ore fines to 7.5 per cent by July 2011. The plan was so secret that Swanny did not know about it, but even industry bulletins in May last year were talking about the increase in concession for iron ore fines to 7.5 per cent. On 20 May 2010, Colin Barnett said he was going to increase the royalties across the board to 7.5 per cent but it was not going to happen until July 2011, which has happened. If ever evidence were needed that nothing escapes the attention of this Treasurer, he was actually directly asked at a public forum on 19 May 2010 about Premier Barnett's secret plan—the plan that he did not know anything about—to raise the royalty regime on fines to 7.5 per cent. This is a plan that came suddenly out of the blue; a plan that he was not informed about. A journalist says:


Premier Colin Barnett has flagged he wants to increase iron ore royalties to the global rate of 7½ per cent. He has flagged that before the Henry Review.


The Treasurer says, 'Well, they will have to establish that in discussions with Premier Barnett.' This is the plan that the Treasurer said in the House today came suddenly out of the blue. 


In question time the government tried to say that last October there was a report that Premier Barnett was not lifting the royalty rate. That is true—he has not lifted the royalty rate beyond 7.5 per cent. In March this year the Treasurer announced that all current and future state royalties would be credited back to mining companies. He knew about the proposed rate. Premier Barnett had already been talking for over 12 months about taking away the concession applicable to iron ore fines. So in March this year the Treasurer knew, and he wrote to the Commonwealth Grants Commission in February of this year asking them not to punish Western Australia when it increased the fines rate to 7.5 per cent. 


On 25 March this year, in an article in the Australian, it was spelt out clearly that Premier Barnett was raising fine rates to 7.5 per cent, that the Commonwealth knew about it and that they had already announced crediting back all future and current royalties. This article in the Australian makes it quite clear that Colin Barnett had flagged that his government was already raising the rates on fines from 5.6 to the lump rate of 7.5 per cent. So, again, on 25 March 2011 there was an article in the Australian pointing out that Colin Barnett as Premier of Western Australia was going to raise the fines rate to 7.5 per cent.


Let us assume that the Treasurer does not read the media and that nobody brought it to his attention, and let us assume that he did not understand what the journalists meant when they said that Colin Barnett had a plan to raise the royalty on fines to 7.5 per cent. Even more damaging than those press releases and those press statements are documents released by Treasury under a freedom of information request which make it abundantly clear that the Treasury and the Treasurer were aware of the exact details of these proposed changes in May last year. A letter from the Western Australian Under Treasurer received on 10 May by Dr Ken Henry, then Secretary to the Australian Treasury, explicitly states:


… I seek your urgent confirmation that ""scheduled increases"" in Western Australia would include the removal of existing iron ore royalty rate concessions, which would see both fine and lump iron ore royalty rates being levied at 7.5% … by 1 July 2012.


That is exactly what has been announced. It is an incremental increase—a per cent increase this year up to 7.5 per cent by July 2012. So the Treasurer knew in May of 2010 precisely what Colin Barnett was going to do. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt and say a letter to the Treasury Secretary is not the same thing as telling the Treasurer himself. However, the FOI documents reveal more. In a Treasury executive minute dated 17 May 2010 entitled 'Mining projects and royalties in Western Australia'—so you get the idea what this is about—the Treasurer himself was advised of this proposal. It is noted in the executive minute that the brief was provided because the Treasurer's office requested it urgently. So the Treasurer himself asked for the Treasury to provide advice on Premier Barnett's plan to raise the fine rates to 7.5 per cent. It states clearly on page 8:


Western Australia indicated at a recent Commonwealth Grants Commission meeting—


this is prior to the announcement of the resource super profits tax—


… it was considering increasing the royalty rate on iron ore fines from the current rate of 5.625 per cent, to the 7.5 per cent rate for lump ore.


So the Treasurer did know; there was communication; there was discussion; there were minutes from Treasury requested by the Treasurer. We now know, following questions from the shadow Treasurer in question time, that there were conversations between the Premier of Western Australia and the Treasurer. There was actually a phone call from the chief of staff of the Premier to the Treasurer's chief of staff before the Western Australian budget that set out explicitly what was going to occur. The Treasurer himself took action by writing to the Grants Commission in February 2011. So, the Treasurer has been well and truly caught out. His statement that this came suddenly out of the blue is a lie. His statement that he knew nothing about this and that they did not communicate to him is a lie.




Mr Martin Ferguson:
  Mr Speaker, I ask that that unparliamentary term be withdrawn.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  It would assist the House if the member for Curtin withdrew the use of the word 'lie'.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  I withdraw. It is evident that the Treasurer knew of the Western Australian plans to increase the royalties on iron ore well before he advised the Prime Minister to sign that mining deal with the three big miners. And this is the rub: the Treasurer knew that Western Australia was going to raise the royalty rate across the board to 7.5 per cent. They went into that meeting last year with the big miners—remember how they had to fix the mining tax debacle; they had to sack Kevin Rudd because the government had gone off the rails—knowing that Western Australia was going to raise the royalty rate, and yet they promised those miners that they would credit all current and future royalty rate increases. Now they are screaming blue murder, telling the Australian public they knew nothing about it when they knew all about it. The Treasurer knew before he made the commitment to credit all state and territory royalties against any national mining tax liability. It was interesting during Senate estimates last night how the Prime Minister's own department sought to distance itself from this debacle caused by the Treasurer. The Prime Minister's department pointed out very clearly that the advice to the Prime Minister on the mining tax deal came directly from the Treasurer on this occasion. In fact, the Prime Minister's own department was sidelined—this was all from the Treasurer. The question remains: why did the Treasurer not advise the Prime Minister that signing the mining tax deal would mean that the increases from Western Australia would be credited? Or did the Treasurer tell the Prime Minister and she thought she could get away with it before the election?


We are witnessing a huge deception of the Australian public, an enormous deception by the Treasurer to suggest he knew nothing about the Western Australian increase to 7.5 per cent when he knew all about it. He stood in this House today and said to the parliament and through the parliament to the Australian people that it came suddenly out of the blue. He has had over 12 months notice, in detailed discussions with the Western Australia government. Through a series of press announcements, he knew, yet he stood in this parliament and said it came suddenly out of the blue. This government is not only destroying the Australian mining industry but it also cannot be believed on anything. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (16:01):   I thank the House for the opportunity to address the very strong state of the Australian mining and petroleum industry at this point in time. I remind the House that that is what the MPI is about. It goes to the influence of government policy on the state of the mining industry in Australia. Let us deal with a few hard facts.


In the last 12 months, we have created an additional 27,700 new jobs in the mining industry. The reason we have created those jobs is that we are part and parcel of one of the most attractive nations for investment in the world when it comes to the petroleum and mining sectors. I was fortunate enough last Friday to be part of a further major announcement about where we are going as a nation. That was the Shell announcement concerning the construction of Prelude, the biggest ever floating LNG plant in the history of the world. That announcement effectively means that we now have the capacity to open up parts of the petroleum sector which were historically perceived as being stranded because of their distant nature in Australian waters—not Western Australian waters. Those petroleum products are to be developed for the benefit of all Australians, not just Western Australians.


In the development of the petroleum sector, 90 per cent of Australian projects are in Commonwealth waters. It is therefore our responsibility to continue to work with petroleum companies such as Shell to guarantee that we remain attractive and, in doing so, to create real jobs akin to the 27,700 new jobs created in the sector over the last 12 months. 


When you think about the attractiveness of Australia, think about some of the key investments over the last three years. Think about the Gorgon plant, a $43 billion investment, the biggest ever single investment in the history of the petroleum sector in Australia. At the same time and side by side with the Barrow Island development, we are almost at the completion of Pluto 1, a Woodside project, an investment of the order of $15 billion to $20 billion, with gas to be produced in the second half of this calendar year, opening up further LNG contracts for Australia. 


We also have the capacity in the foreseeable future to see the final investment decisions going to the Wheatstone project, a Chevron project at Onslow, and potentially the Browse project at James Price Point north of Broome. It is just not in Western Australia any longer; it is also in Northern Australia where Conoco-Philips at the moment has one gas train. There are opportunities to hopefully develop the Impex project—a development investment decision by Impex in association with Total, prior to the end of this calendar year, another investment of the order of $20 to $30 billion. Then we go to the east coast of Australia—investments in the first LNG exports in the world from the coal seam methane sector, a $31 billion new investment which will make Gladstone a major industrial centre in Australia, but that is just the petroleum sector. 


Let us go to a couple of other key commodities because in my opinion not only does the coal seam methane export industry have great potential for Australia over the next 10 to 20 years but so do the coal sector and the iron ore sector. And this is despite the best endeavours of the Greens to undermine and destroy the coal seam methane, LNG and coal industries in Australia. The coal industry and the coal seam methane industry in Australia have a bright future of investment and the creation of real jobs and training opportunities and, side by side with that, a capacity to create real export earnings for Australia, strengthening the overall foundations of the Australian economy.


Let us have a look at a couple of those investments over the last six to 12 months. On 25 March this year alone BHP Billiton, at one board meeting held in London, invested $400 million in the thermal coal industry in New South Wales, $5 billion in the coking coal industry in Queensland and then, when we go to Western Australia in the important iron ore industry, something of the order of $7 billion—that is, over $12 billion invested in the resources sector in Australia by one company at one board meeting in March this year. That is only a small example of a range of investment decisions going to the strength of the mining sector in Australia over the last six to 12 months.


We could go to the decision by Fortescue Metals on 10 November last year to invest another $8.4 billion in the iron ore sector in the north-west of Western Australia. That investment decision is very important. That company is now out raising capital for further investment opportunities in Australia. The decision of the Western Australia government last Thursday to increase mining royalties in Western Australia does not augur well in terms of that company's capacity to promote Australia as a safe haven for investment at this very important time in this investment cycle. We go also to other major investors. We go to Xstrata and the Ulan West underground project in New South Wales on 3 August, last year—$1.1 billion. We go to Xstrata and a range of other coking coal and thermal coal decisions around Australia. We should also not forget Rio Tinto, which on 20 October last year made an investment of $3.1 billion in a further expansion of its iron ore operations in north-west Western Australia.


The truth of the matter is that the mining and petroleum industry in Australia, be it in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania or Victoria, is in a very sound position at this moment. We are strong on investment. Our real challenge is to actually manage the investment pipeline in relation to a shortage of skilled labour in Australia.


What we have really got in Western Australia—and this is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wanted to talk about today—is a dogs breakfast when it comes to royalties and the understanding of the industry as to where the Western Australia government is going with the royalties regime not only over the last 12 months but also in the future. Let us look at what the Western Australian government has said about royalties since April last year. It is relatively recent history. Firstly, it was out there talking about increases in gold royalties that would occur in the May 2010 budget. As a result of a campaign by the coalition in the upper house, the Western Australian Premier backed off from that and abandoned the plan in the May 2010 budget. Norman Moore, the Minister for Mines and Petroleum, took the Western Australian Treasurer and Premier on and forced them to back off from a potential increase in gold royalties.


Then we had a proposal, over the last 12 months, to review the magnetite royalties paid in Western Australia. There was an expectation in the industry that they would be reduced. I say 'reduced', because the Argus-Ferguson report into the federal profits based tax showed that, where the magnetite industry exists in Australia in competitive terms compared with other states, the royalties rates in Western Australia were relatively high and made Western Australia uncompetitive. 


We go to the question of iron ore royalties. Following the budget last year, and a proposed joint venture operation between BHP and Rio Tinto, the Western Australian government reopened the state development agreements with the purpose of trying to increase the royalty take to assist the Western Australian community. That was agreed to by BHP and Rio Tinto, because they expected major synergies and improvements in efficiency arising from the proposed joint-venture operation. The joint-venture operation fell over, yet BHP and Rio Tinto continue to pay those increased royalties without gaining necessary efficiencies. As a result of the renegotiation of that agreement, they contributed about $350 million per year to the Western Australian state coffers. In addition, they made a one-off contribution of the order of $350 million to the Western Australian budget processes for the purposes of developing a new hospital in Perth.


Following that announcement, if I remember correctly, in June of last year, we had very bold and clear statements by the Western Australian Premier as to what he intended to do on royalties in the future. I refer to his statement that was reported in the West Australian newspaper of 20 October 2010. He said:


The State has no intention of increasing royalties, but we will certainly preserve the right to do so …


The mining industry took the Western Australian Premier at his word. Since October 2010 until more recently, not only was Mr Barnett the Premier of Western Australia but also he was its Treasurer. That is why the mining industry took him at his word. They regarded his statements as being set in stone. It is therefore not a surprise to see a range of media statements issued by the mining industry on Thursday of last week clearly nailing the Western Australian government for a lack of consultation with the industry on the recently announced increases in royalties. That is reflected, for example, in statements by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia and by the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies. The statement by AMEC, which was posted on 19 May 2011, said:


AMEC is extremely disappointed that industry bodies and individual companies have not been consulted in respect of the WA Government’s decision to increase the royalty rate on iron ore fines.


That sentiment is also reflected in a statement issued by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy on Thursday of last week. Its statement first referred to the endeavour by the Western Australian government to create a sense that this is just an anomaly. So when the coalition increases royalties in Australia it is an anomaly, but when you actually want to put in place at a federal level what the industry wanted—a profits based tax—then it is a major tax grab. After stating that the chamber is not opposed to reform, the chamber's statement continued:


We support genuine economic reform that protects against sovereign risk, improves the international competitiveness of the resources sector as an investment destination and promotes economic growth.


It has really become clear what it is that the Western Australian government was really about on Thursday of last week. It was focused on a mere short-term endeavour in order to have a political stoush with the Commonwealth government. If members have any doubts about that, I refer them to the comments of the Western Australian Premier today—and this goes to the issue of an own goal. He said:


Yes, we knew that we would get less funding by raising our royalties under the current arrangements.


That is what it is all about: a short-term political stoush. That position is also reflected in comments by the resources minister Norman Moore that were reported in the business pages of the Sunday Age and detailed today by the Treasurer in the House. Those comments referred to the fact that Mr Norman Moore advised journalist Michael Pascoe early last year that the last thing the Western Australian government should do is increase royalties because it would have a major impact on their GST grants under the Commonwealth-state grants system.


I therefore suggest to the House that the Western Australian government has potentially created an environment that will strangle the future of the resources sector in Western Australia. The Commonwealth government will stand by its agreement with the resources sector—both the petroleum and the mining components. We will credit the increase in royalties in accordance with our undertakings to industry. But the truth of the matter is that, in terms of royalties as against a profits based tax, royalties are paid in both good and bad times. The Commonwealth will only increase its revenue take under the mining tax on super profits during very good commodity price times.


In essence, in the future, from here on in as of last Thursday and as of June last year, the resources sector in Western Australia will confront a substantial increase in royalties. There have been two increases in royalties in the last 12 months that will have to be paid in both good and bad times—irrespective of the state of commodity prices. So not only have they kicked an own goal in terms of the potential loss of GST revenue, which they admitted today they had knowledge of, but they have also potentially set up an environment that will strangle the small and start-up companies which are so central to the future of the mining sector in Australia.


In conclusion, I simply say that the mining and petroleum sectors have never been better positioned. We are working with them on labour supply issues, opening up further opportunities for migration to assist them to make sure that their investment delivers further wealth and prosperity to Australia. The real problem in the resources sector in Australia is the lack of policy and understanding on the other side of the House. As we all appreciate, the leader of the coalition finds economics boring and has no interest in decent policy development in Australia, as reflected in the stoush reported in the newspapers of last weekend between the shadow Treasurer and the coalition leader.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2011-05-24,"



Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (16:16):  I appreciate the opportunity to rise and address this issue today. The mining industry in Australia is highly valued, and right now the centre of mining in Australia is Western Australia. Western Australia has a responsibility to this nation to pull its weight. We have heard a great deal from the Minister for Resources and Energy about why the actions of Premier Barnett are somehow illegitimate. All I can suggest is: check the records, look at the communications that took place and make up your own mind. Premier Colin Barnett has done the right thing by Western Australians and continues to do the right thing by all Australians in supporting this nation, being the state Premier of the coalface, if we may say, of the Australian Treasury. Mining in Western Australia, according to the best stats from 2007-08, made a contribution of $58.6 billion to the Western Australian economy. The Western Australian minerals and petroleum sector contributed 83 per cent of the state's merchandise exports. It contributes approximately 53 per cent of Australia's total value of mineral and petroleum sales. Royalties received by the state government from Western Australian mineral and petroleum producers totalled approximately $2.3 billion in the year.


This whole argument about fines and the rate of royalty levied on fines goes back to the development of the iron ore provinces of Western Australia in the early sixties. Fines were considered at the time to be an inferior product and not particularly required by the smelters of the world. Therefore, there was a reduction in the royalty charged of something like 1.375 per cent. That reduction or concession, in the light of the popularity today of iron ore of any description, has been removed. It is as simple as that. It is not an increase; it is a removal of a concession that the industry in Western Australia has known about for about the last two years. The statement by the Premier in the latest state budget simply gives the industry two full years to come up to speed in paying the full royalty rate of 7.5 per cent. This is much less of an impact than many would suggest is the case.


The mining industry in Western Australia, I might add, in the most recent annual report, contributes $70.9 billion. That is the resources sector in Western Australia. It is now 89 per cent of the state's total merchandise exports and it is 42 per cent of the nation's exports. And $176 billion is the value of projects underway, committed or close to commitment. It is those projects that are close to commitment that I wish to bring to the attention of the House. The imposition of this MRRT, the minerals resource rent tax, speaks to potential investors around the world, who used to believe that Australia was a good place to put their capital investment because, apart from many differences that occur around the world, sovereign risk in Australia is exceptionally low. Investors would say, 'We can deposit our capital funds there. We know that they will make profits for us into the future because Australia is secure.' Australia has had good governance and a reputation for low sovereign risk. With the introduction of the MRRT, all of that reputation goes out the window—forever. The real issue today is the decisions being made in boardrooms around the world as to where to put floating capital. If our reputation as a secure destination for those funds is trashed then we take the risk of reducing employment in the resources industry.


Keep in mind that when this government last year raised the spectre of the people of Australia not being compensated for the mineral wealth that this nation possesses they talked about Australians not getting their fair share of the wealth. What about the taxi drivers in suburban Melbourne and Sydney, the hairdressers and others who provide services to those households employed on a fly-in fly-out basis in the Western Australian iron ore province? That has all been discounted. The government seem to have a hypocritical view of the world. They talk about wanting to close the gap. They refer blithely to closing the gap. They are talking about the health and education differentials between Indigenous Australians and other Australians. Do they realise that, in imposing the MRRT, they run the risk of taking away all of the investment that the mining companies place in regional Australia for the assistance of education, employment and the consequential long-term health of Indigenous Australians?


The Martu people enjoy something like $6 million per annum from Telfer in the way of training and improved health and facilities on the ground like roads and airstrips that will allow flying doctors to come in and provide health services. When imposing a tax on the mining industry, albeit just on the iron ore and coal industries today—and remember that iron ore is the major mined substance in Western Australia—I remind you: what about tomorrow? It is the thin end of the wedge when you talk about the mining industry involving coal and iron ore. But with a greedy government in power that lives by the mantra of, 'Impose a new tax whenever the budget looks crook,' what about all of the other very wealthy, great contributors to this national economy such as goldminers, manganese miners and solar salt producers? Those industries are shivering right now because they fear that this greedy government will impose additional taxes on their industries as well, to say nothing of that hanging sword of Damocles called a carbon tax.


The mining industry is not always going to be the golden goose. This government want to impose a tax that will put the wealth of this nation at risk because they are short-sighted and, frankly, hypocritical in their view. If we are going to increase employment, another mantra of this government, why would we impose a tax on the very industry that has the potential to employ another 27,000 Australians this year? It makes no sense to be so two-faced in one's approach to solving problems for this nation.


There is a great deal to be said about improvements and the way forward in the mining industry. I have a long list of recommendations here. I will pick a couple from the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia. They talk about improving skilled migration. They talk about improving education and training in the industry. They talk about having a strategic policy of planning initiatives to fulfil their vision for the state of Western Australia and exploring innovative ways to manage water, one of our scarcest resources, for enabling growth. They say nothing about the necessity to impose a great big new tax to pave the way forward for this industry.


If we are serious about maintaining the wealth of this nation, if we could be serious for a moment about envisaging this government ever having a budget in surplus, why on earth would we impose a great big new tax on the very industry that sustains this Treasury? It does not make sense. Why would you impose a tax on the industry that provides such a resource for Indigenous people in health, education, training and employment? It is the height of hypocrisy to suggest that you could impose a tax and therefore improve the outcome for all of those other things that this government proposes. They put their hands on their hearts and talk about the necessity to improve life expectancy, education and employment opportunities. None of those things will be achieved if they impose this minerals resource rent tax on the very successful industries of this nation.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (16:26):  Last Friday I was in Moranbah, the largest of the mining towns in my electorate. I was there to open the BER projects—a new hall and a new library—at Moranbah East State School. As I was inspecting the buildings with the principal before the ceremony, he told me that the new buildings had arrived just in time to deal with the expansion the school is experiencing. The number of students at the school has gone from under 500 to over 700 in just a few years. That is because of more kids and more families of more miners coming to work and live in Moranbah. And the story is repeated wherever you look in Moranbah and throughout Central Queensland. Investment in mines and infrastructure is flooding in and workers are following. This is not the story of an industry suffering under any adverse impacts, as alleged by the coalition.


This MPI is about politics, pure and simple. It is about shifting attention away from the shafting the Premier of Western Australia is giving to mining companies in that state and the raw deal he cooked up in last week's budget for the people of Western Australia. Just look at who has put this topic up for today's MPI—not the shadow resources minister, the member for Groom, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Western Australian chief on the other side. She is doing it as a favour for her Western Australian mate Colin Barnett, even though he has just betrayed every promise she would have made in the boardrooms of Perth in the lead-up to the last election. Back then she would have been going from boardroom to boardroom collecting donations for the Liberal Party and promising her mining company donors that she would protect them from additional taxes.


This is the same deputy opposition leader who not so long ago was in Geraldton telling locals:


To impose an uncompetitive tax on this sector of the economy really does damage it.


Who is imposing uncompetitive taxes now? Who is going after an extra $2 billion in tax from mining companies, big and small, the profitable and the not so profitable, with the hike in royalties? Who is putting his state's budget position at risk with a $300 million gap in revenue, as reported on the front page of the Australian today? Who is giving away more GST revenue from the Grants Commission than the hike in royalties will raise for his state? Who is putting at risk infrastructure funding that would actually support the mining industry in Western Australia? It is the Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, and now we can see that he has the full backing of the federal opposition for his tax grab on mining in that state.


If the deputy opposition leader was serious about standing up for the mining industry, she would be gathering her Western Australian colleagues together and telling the Premier to stop milking WA's mining companies and to stop selling out Western Australia in terms of GST revenue and infrastructure spending. But, as we have seen, the opposition is happy to let the Western Australian Premier go right ahead with his mining tax grab and even to provide him with cover here in the parliament with stunts such as this one today. I noted before that it was not the shadow resources minister who put this matter of public importance up for debate today. He clearly does not feel the same obligation to defend the Premier of Western Australia.


Coming from Queensland and from an electorate which sits alongside the explosion in resource investment and activity associated with the coal seam gas industry, the member for Groom—as I know you do too, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott—must know that the claims made by the deputy opposition leader and the opposition generally just do not stack up against what anyone in Queensland can see with their own eyes. Every day I open the paper there is a new project being announced: a new mine, a new pipeline, a new port facility, more railway capacity—all driven by an industry that cannot keep up with demand for its commodities. It is an industry whose real life, on-the-ground concerns, away from negotiations and rhetoric about matters like the carbon price or the minerals resource rent tax, are all about dealing with the pressures of growth in the sector—how to get enough workers, how to house them and how to develop supporting infrastructure and industry quickly enough. There is not much evidence in that of these adverse impacts the opposition is talking about. Mr Deputy Speaker, these claims crumble in the face of what is happening all around us in Central Queensland and I know in your own electorate in the south-west of the state. The shadow minister knows it is the same where he is around Toowoomba.


If members do not believe their own eyes, the figures confirm the staggering truth about the scale of the boom we are living through and trying to manage as a government. A snapshot from Central Queensland which was reported in February this year talks about 50 mining projects identified in the Bowen Basin alone, with a potential value of about $20 billion. Twenty-four of these projects are at an advanced stage and include 12 new mines and 12 expansions of existing operations.


A large proportion of my time as the member in a mining region is spent keeping up with what these developments mean for the region and the people living in the mining towns and larger coastal centres, like Mackay and Rockhampton, because the impact a new or expanding mine can have on services and infrastructure—both physical and social—is enormous. As an example, in April the CEO of Anglo American came to Moranbah to announce a $2.7 billion growth plan for the town, including two new underground mines and the creation of 2,000 new jobs over the next five years. As part of the development, the company is going to provide $20 million towards community infrastructure for the town in recognition of the impact this is going to have and the pressure it is going to place on services. That is $2.7 billion just in one town of fewer than 10,000 people. I ask again: how is that indicative of the adverse impacts the opposition is talking about? The fact is that the opposition has to keep attention away from the tax grab by the Western Australian Premier and the betrayal of mining companies and residents of that state.


Sadly, when we should be talking about the substance of the mining industry and the challenges that the mining boom mark 2 presents to our country, this MPI is not about the realities of the mining industry. It is just a political stunt to give cover to the opposition's hypocrisy. On the other hand, the government is focused on the realities of mining boom mark 2. The current mining boom is a once-in-100-years opportunity that must be managed for the benefit of all Australians not just for now but for the future needs of our country—for that time when we do not have the mining boom to hold us up. That is why we have worked with mining companies to design a minerals resource rent tax—a tax that provides a greater return to Australians for their resources and allows the government to invest in other important initiatives that support mining, as well as broadening and strengthening our economy overall. 


The MRRT is funding important tax returns. The revenue collected will be returned to Australians in a number of ways. It will help us to broaden our economy by allowing for a tax cut to 29 per cent for all companies, starting from July 2013. Small businesses will get that new tax break from 1 July this year. All Australian workers will benefit from a boost to superannuation savings from 1 July 2013. I know that my electorate is particularly pleased about the $6 billion regional infrastructure fund that will come from the minerals resource rent tax. That is a fund that will pay for important projects like the $120 million for safety improvements to the Peak Downs Highway between the Bowen Basin and Mackay and $40 million to duplicate the Yeppin Bridge and relieve congestion at the southern entrance to Rockhampton. 


The MRRT is a tax that the government designed in close consultation with the mining companies that will be most affected by it. It is designed to be more efficient for the companies and fairer for the Australian people, who should benefit from the mineral wealth of the country. The mining sector sees that. Following the announcement of the MRRT on 2 July 2010, the Minerals Council of Australia said:


Today's proposal on a new Minerals Resource Rent Tax stands to deliver a positive outcome for Australia and its minerals industry.


Where is the bit about adverse impacts there? The reality is that the government is responding to the needs of mining companies and mining communities through extra spending on infrastructure in mining states like Queensland and through the funding provided in the budget for training and apprenticeships This is all geared towards creating the skilled workforce the resources sector so desperately needs and ensuring that more people in places like Central Queensland get a foothold in employment in industry. It is geared towards constructing the infrastructure mining regions need to drive the growth in the sector and to enable communities to live alongside that growth. This government will continue to work constructively with the mining industry and continue to show up the opposition for how hollow its claims are to be any kind of friend to the mining industry.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2011-05-24,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:36):  I am pleased to speak today on this matter of public importance about the adverse effects of the government's policies on the mining industry in Australia. Dare I say that we are here today because of what this government did under the leadership of the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan. The history of this is that the Treasurer, over the Christmas break, read the Henry tax review and out of the dozens of recommendations he picked 2½ of them and one of them was this so-called mining tax. The Rudd government's first incarnation of this tax, which was called the resource super profits tax, was condemned across the world. This tax on the Australian mining sector was the brainchild of those geniuses the Treasurer and former Prime Minister Rudd. I thank them for that, because that certainly played out well in seats like mine in Western Australia. Keep it up, because it really goes down well in resource areas where they know what is happening. This resource super profits tax really damaged the Labor brand. It really damaged the former Prime Minister, to the extent that the factional bosses whipped out their knives and executed him in June last year. It was a political execution, dare I say.




Mr Tony Smith:
  Fundamental injustice day!




Mr RANDALL:
  Fundamental injustice day. Then along came the current Prime Minister, delivered by the factional bosses. In the middle of an absolute row with the mining industry, where she asked the mining industry to stop their ads, to pull their ads and to sit down and negotiate, what did she do? She negotiated with the three major miners: BHP, Xstrata and Rio. She did a secret deal with these three majors on what they were going to pay. Canada was actually licking its lips at that stage. It thought: 'Isn't this fantastic? Australia, one of the pre-eminent resource areas of the world in terms of its mining industry, is now going to make itself uncompetitive.' Canada would be so much more competitive.


I will put this in context. I was speaking to the mine manager of potentially the largest goldmine in Australia, the Boddington goldmine in my electorate. He has just returned from South America and he confirmed what I have said. In Chile, the government tax, which is not set but negotiable, is 26 per cent. If we were to end up with a tax of 56 or 58 per cent, as proposed by the then Rudd government, where do you think they would take their money? As this person said to me: 'We would be taking it off to South America, we would be taking it off to Africa and we would be taking it off to Mongolia, where there are no impositions on us getting ahead and mining.' Money is fluid in this business. Those strange people out there who think that Australia is the only place that these large companies want to invest in should just think about BHP. The largest copper mine in the world is Escondida, in Chile, which they are going to expand. We have huge copper resources in Australia. Sandfire Resources outside Meekatharra is going to be a massive copper mine. But what is going to be put in its way? These sorts of impositions—not only a mining tax but a carbon tax. 


The previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, went to the 2007 election promising $100 million for WA in infrastructure. The only thing that happened was that he said: 


… in the West, so much money is generated for the public revenue in Canberra out of these great resource projects. But you know something? Not enough of that money is given back.


This government has not delivered one cent. None of that $100 million has materialised. The reincarnated tax, the minerals resource rent tax, of the Gillard government—done secretly with the large miners, leaving out the midcaps and juniors—will have a debilitating effect on the mining industry across Australia. Western Australia, where I come from, is not the only place where mining occurs. You only have to look at the massive resources of Olympic Dam in South Australia; at coal resources in New South Wales; right across the board—zinc, copper, gold, obviously massive amounts of coal—in Queensland; and uranium in the Northern Territory. I suspect no-one has mentioned uranium in the debate since Japan. There are all these potential opportunities. Western Australia is described by Colin Barnett as potentially the richest mining province in the world. 


We are told that the resource rent tax will deliver $2 billion back to Western Australia over 10 years if it goes ahead. It has to get through this place yet, even though it was announced in the budget. During the election campaign my opponent wanted to tell us it would happen over four years. He argued that on radio. I want to confirm again that it is over 10 years. It is $200 million a year. It is not much when you think of the billions of dollars that will come out of Western Australia. In fact, between 2012 and 2014, WA will generate $7 billion for this tax if it goes ahead and will only receive $400 million in those two years. In other words, for every dollar WA gives to the federal government it receives less than 6c in return. The member for Capricornia talked about this tax grab on mining. You cannot get a bigger tax grab on mining than the minerals resource rent tax. 


I want to make this point very clear before we move to the end of this debate. The Minister for Resources and Energy came in here and said how sneaky it was that Western Australia they did not tell them about this. We now know, through questions at question time and since through the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Curtin, that this government certainly did know and they knew well in advance. They knew that this would be added to the iron ore fines and it would not increase the overall royalty on iron ore. Obviously this government does not understand fines.


Let me put this into context. As a thief in the night, a couple of budgets ago, the Rudd government put a $2 billion tax on condensate in the gas industry. There was no prior knowledge and no prior warning. It was a by-product—a bit like the fines—that had not had any tax previously imposed on it, again to help the industry get on its feet. The gas companies did not know about it, they were not warned about it and they did not factor it in. Along came the government, tearing $2 billion a year out of that industry. The government complains about no knowledge, no prior warning, no consultation on this effort—which we now know from Western Australia is not true. What is true is this government put a tax on condensate, on a burgeoning resources industry which is going to supply clean energy to this country and to the rest of the world. They slapped a massive $2 billion tax on it without any warning. So much for this government saying that this is unjustified, terrible and something they would never do—they did. These threats that have been made by this government to Western Australia are just unparalleled. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this country are out there threatening Western Australia about its allocation of GST—and we know that we are only getting 63c in the dollar compared to Queensland's 91c, and I will not even mention Tasmania. But the fact is that this income will flow to Western Australia, because we are entitled to it. I had people stop me over the weekend and say to me, 'I thought the resources minister, Martin Ferguson, was a good bloke until I heard him coming out with these unbelievable threats.' If you are going to be a minister, you cannot carry on like a trade union thug, threaten sovereign states in this country and accuse them of doing a whole lot of things, as has been done over this last while. This is a bad tax. It is bad for Australia, it sends a very bad signal about the sovereign risk of this country and, at the end of the day, moneys will flow to areas where they do not have the same impositions. 


MagNet, a group of magnetite companies, came to see us the last time we were in parliament here and outlined the massive projects they are building in this country, particularly in the north-west—CITIC Pacific, for example, has a project with a mine life of 25 years which will put $125 million in royalties per annum into this country. They are very concerned about the direction of this government in terms of both its mining tax and its carbon tax. The lobbyist for this company, dare I say, is the former state member for Kalgoorlie Megan Anwyl, who is out there saying, 'This is terrible for mining, this is terrible for our magnetite industry and we should stop it.'

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:46):  This motion is typical of the coalition and their inconsistency and hypocrisy when it comes to economic issues. Those opposite are always claiming in this House that they are the party of low tax. They always claim that, yet when you look at the record they are the party of high tax. They are the party that squandered the mining boom mark 1. They did not invest in health, education and infrastructure and they never matched our contribution of $4.3 billion to the regions, in places like Queensland and Western Australia.


This motion is a disgrace. It simply shows just how many Western Australians in this place wag the dog when it comes to the coalition. It also shows the hypocrisy of the Western Australian Liberal Party and of the Leader of the Opposition. Have we had one question today about issues of economics? What about the budget reply speech? What about the National Press Club performance of the shadow Treasurer when it came to economics? On that side of the House, there are no economic credentials, there is no economic capability and there is no economic record that they can boast of.


What about the high-taxing government they were when they were in power last? Let us have a look at that. They claim that our policies impact on the mining sector and other sectors. In 2005-06, when they were in government, there was a 25.6 per cent tax to GDP ratio. In 2007-08, it was as high as 24.9 per cent. In the 2011-12 budget, it is 23.2 per cent. That is the reality. Those opposite always like a tax. Then they will squander it on middle-class welfare rorts. That is what they like to do.


They should have a talk to the mining industry. They went to those boardrooms and those business lunches in the lead-up to the last election and said: 'We won't do anything. We'll look after you, mates. We'll make sure we do.' When their state colleagues got in, they decided to whack on another $2 billion tax. I do not care if the member for Durack calls it a levy, a royalty or a tax; it is $2 billion. He knows that is what it is about. He knows this is a political strategy. He knows this is a tactic by those opposite. That is the reality. He knows also that, when it comes to the mining boom mark 2, in Queensland and Western Australia we are seeing massive investment.


The Treasurer, in a speech to the Brisbane North Chamber of Commerce on 13 May 2011, made the point very clearly when it comes to my home state of Queensland. I grew up in Ipswich and grew up with the coal mining industry. We still have New Hope colliery there and coalminers in rural parts of my electorate, around Rosewood et cetera. The coalmining industry is very, very important to Queensland. But it is not just that; the LNG industry is now growing. The Treasurer said in his speech: 


The total pipeline of investment in Queensland is about $180 billion. 


So much for the adverse impact of government policy on the mining industry in Queensland. He went on: 


And over the past year, the state's LNG industry has committed to more than $30 billion in investment, driven by the Queensland Curtis LNG and Gladstone LNG projects. Big projects like this are going to support rising incomes and export capacity, and strong economic growth in the years ahead.


Those opposite know that is true. They know that is the case. They know that, according to the Treasury, the mining industry is planning to invest $76 billion in 2011-12—about eight times the annual level before the mining boom mark 1. That will boost Australia's export capacity. Investment will increase, the LNG sector will have many large projects and we will see projects by Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Xstrata. We will see all kinds of minerals and energy projects across the board. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences estimates a total pipeline of resources investment of over $380 billion. That is going to increase export volumes and high commodity prices, and that will lead to increased incomes.


Nationally, Treasury estimates income from non-rural commodity exports over the next two years will increase by 15 per cent to $203 billion. I can tell you something, Mr Deputy Speaker: that really shows that somehow the federal Labor government is adversely impacting the mining sector! Our policies quite clearly are assisting in terms of economic capacity, investment in infrastructure and what we are doing in the regions. Locally I speak to blokes like John Berry, who is the CEO of JBS Swift, the big meat-processing plant in my electorate. John said to me a couple of months ago, when I had a conversation over lunch with him, 'We're finding it difficult to get workers because they're all going to the mining sector in Queensland and Western Australia.'


It was the same thing when we had the opening of the $2 million investment by the federal Labor government in Bremer TAFE, where the new machine shop has been entirely done. I was talking to apprentices and instructors there. What is happening is that the mining sector is grabbing hold of the apprentices and taking them up into Central Queensland and Western Australia. So much for the mining sector being adversely impacted by the federal Labor government's policies. It is just a nonsense. Those opposite know in their heart of hearts that this is a nonsense. It is a stupid MPI topic from those opposite. They know, of course, that we need to invest in skills and infrastructure.


That is why I was so pleased to see that we are building Australia's future workforce with $558 million for tailored quality training places through what we have called the National Workforce Development Fund. And we are giving $1.75 billion to the states and territories for vocational education and training. We are partnering with the states—for example, the department in Queensland known as DEEDI. I saw that on Friday when I was speaking to some women who were graduating from work ventures with a certificate II. I saw what they were doing. We have great organisations.


I was at the trade expo in Ipswich run by Apprenticeships Queensland. You can see what is happening. I spoke there to Brett Kitching, who is in charge of the Ipswich Turf Club. At the turf club in Ipswich they put on the trade expo. There you have a whole host of people from various sectors in vocational education and training, people from TAFE et cetera, including the federally funded Business Enterprise Centre Ipswich Region. Over lunch, Brett was saying to me that there is more interest in this trade expo than ever before. I was speaking to Anita Dwyer, from Apprenticeships Queensland, over lunch as well. I was talking to them about what is going on in the work that they are doing. Workers with qualifications in carpentry and building and construction trades, electricians et cetera are not just staying in South-East Queensland; they are going up to Central Queensland and Western Queensland and to the Western Australian regions because they are getting jobs there.


This is what the government is doing, spending $3.1 billion in trade training, skilling, increasing the capacity of our workforce and investing in the regions. Those opposite did not invest in regions. In my region alone, in South-East Queensland, it is quite clear that they did not invest. They did not take the benefit of the mining boom mark 1. We are taking the benefit of the mining boom mark 2, and in Regional Development Australia we are seeing an extra billion dollars put in for projects.


The Regional Infrastructure Fund that we have announced is part of the minerals resource rent tax. We are putting $6 billion in that fund, and locally we are seeing the benefit of it. We are seeing the benefit in my electorate with the $54 million to upgrade the Blacksoil Interchange. That is important not just for farmers but for the miners from the Surat Basin. You can see the mining trucks going through. You can see the farm produce going through. You can see the kids going to school. You can see the workers going to Ipswich and Brisbane and up to Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley as well. That is what we are doing: investing locally.


And we are investing in major projects in South-East Queensland that the coalition refused to do. We have used the money we have beneficially, and I think it is important to note that we are going to use the money from the minerals resource rent tax to invest in important infrastructure in Queensland and Western Australia. Those opposite would not provide that infrastructure. They would not invest in organisations. The shadow minister for energy and resources, the member for Groom, has gone missing in this debate. There is a great project that he should have funded in his electorate during the time he sat in the cabinet—that is, the Toowoomba Bypass. He did not fund that project, and he squandered the money from the resources. He talks about the Toowoomba Bypass all the time, but did they use the money from mining boom mark 1? No way. Those opposite did not fund that project. They would not fund that project. They would not fund the Ipswich Motorway. They would not fund so many projects in Queensland and Western Australia which we are doing through the minerals resource rent tax. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame over this MPI topic. It is a disgrace. They should go back to their Western Australian colleagues and tell them they should fix this—

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:00):  On Saturday, 14 May it was my pleasure to attend the Mount Evelyn Football Club for a very special celebration for a great club builder and stalwart in Ted Jenkinson. Ted started playing at the club in 1946. He became a club member in 1945. The Mount Evelyn Football Club was founded in 1931, which means that Ted Jenkinson has been part of the club's history for 66 of those 80 years. Not only did he play with the club, he has been instrumental in the club's development of nearly seven decades. He was the inspiration behind the founding of the junior football club back in 1970. He has been on the club committee too many times to remember. He is, of course, a life member of the club. He has been one of the key organisers of the club's website with the history of the club. It was a very special occasion for the Mount Evelyn Football Club and the Mount Evelyn community.


My friend, the member for Holt, who I know spends a bit of time like me looking at history would be interested in an anecdote I pointed out: if Ted started playing in 1945, two great things happened in 1945. One, of course, was the end of World War II. The other was Carlton defeating South Melbourne in the bloodbath grand final played at Princes Park. I pointed this out to Ted—he is not a Carlton supporter—but now we know three great things happened in 1945.


Ted has put in a wonderful contribution to the club and it was great to see all of his family there: Jennifer, Robyn, Aaron, James and Daryl, who came along for the special occasion. To the club President, John Stroud, who does a wonderful job, and the club committee: congratulations on a wonderful day. It culminated with the presentation to Ted of a plaque and the opening of the Ted Jenkinson Wing, known as Pinky's Wing, where he has watched countless games of football over many years. There is a sign on the wing at the Mount Evelyn football ground to mark his great service over the last 66 years to the Mount Evelyn Football Club.

Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (16:32):  In rising to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011 I indicate to the House that the coalition supports this bill.



Government members interjecting—




Mrs MIRABELLA:
  Do not get too excited! We do not support the government's approach or, more accurately, the lack of a detailed approach to antidumping more generally. To put it bluntly, there are a series of problems that are plaguing the current operation of antidumping arrangements in Australia. While Australian industries and Australian workers are rightly objecting to what is happening, Labor is simply not listening. If passed, the bill currently before the House will change the way in which antidumping measures are reviewed and revoked. The coalition believes that this does represent an appropriate response to the full Federal Court's decision in the Minister of State for Home Affairs v Siam Polyethylene, also called the Siam decision case. 


We agree with the government that the ways in which Customs powers relating to revocation were interpreted in that case are problematic and we share its view that as a result of the Siam decision it is now significantly more likely that a finding of no dumping or no injury during a review period will lead to revocation. We are fearful about the impact that that might have on Australian industry and we are of the view that it is difficult to predict or pre-assess the likely ramifications of the removal of antidumping measures, especially the potential for the subsequent resumption of dumping causing material injury. 


The idea that is at the heart of this bill, that the current revocation test should be strengthened to give Australian industry greater redress against unfair trading practices, is not contentious as far as we are concerned. Nor is the more general principal that improvements to the review process under the current system are necessary in order to strike a better balance between the interests of foreign and local companies. 


We also believe that the changes that are being legislated through this bill are consistent with Australia's World Trade Organisation obligations and the current practices of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. But we will naturally reserve our rights to make amendments following the Senate committee's review process that is not due to be completed until later this year. We make the broader point that the introduction of this bill really represents nothing more from the government than the application of a bandaid to a gaping wound. Whilst it will legislate for an improvement to one facet of Australia's antidumping system it is a move of small consequence when set against the government's complete unwillingness to engage in the broader debate about how effectively the overall system is working or, as the case may be, is not working.


What is long overdue is far more widespread serious and lasting action. For way too long—in fact, for close to the entirety of its time in office—this government has simply sat on its hands when it comes to antidumping. Under the Howard government, changes were made to the arrangements to try and ensure that they appropriately kept pace with broader trends in the manner in which goods were being imported into Australia. We did this on the basis that it is important to keep monitoring the operation of the system on a regular basis and making changes where they are necessary.




Ms Hall:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Is the member for Indi willing to give way?




Mrs MIRABELLA:
  No. These reviews are necessary on a regular basis but the Rudd and Gillard governments have opted for quite a different approach. Minister Bowen, in his previous role and during days that were far less fraught for him, told everyone who wanted to listen after a COAG meeting in 2008 that Labor would act to amend the system. But Rip Van Winkle might as well have inherited the mantle of implementing government policy after that, because we have witnessed a trademark tale of Labor inaction when it has come to any kind of serious policy reform in this area.


Following Mr Bowen's announcement, Labor dragged its feet and shuffled the matter off to the Productivity Commission in early 2009. When the commission's report came back at the end of 2009, Labor dithered again—so badly, in fact, that it then sent the matter off for an internal review of some kind so it could postpone doing anything until after the 2010 election.


In trademark Labor tradition, the sad reality was that the government was far more interested in attempting to take the political heat out of the issue than making constructive policy changes in the national interest and in the interests of Australian industry, particularly Australian manufacturing.  Inevitably, that has not done anybody any good, because the government has essentially been fiddling while Australian businesses have been suffering. All you need to do is go to any business that is affected by imported goods that are dumped and they will tell you about their frustration at a system that does not work and the impact on Australian industry, Australian manufacturing and how that is affecting investment decisions today.


In many ways, it is quite ironic that we should be having this debate so close to this year's budget. Because, even after all of this inactivity from Labor and after all the time that has passed without any decision whatsoever, it put its hand on its collective heart a few months ago, and said, 'Okay, we'll do something and we'll announce it as part of the 2011 budget'.


At least two ministers—the minister with the responsibility for Customs, and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research—publicly stated that this would be the government's approach.  There could well have been others as well, but you will have to forgive me for not exactly hanging off every worthless word of most of the senior officeholders of this government.


What have we seen? To our surprise, when looking through all the budget papers, we found nothing. Yet again, there was nothing. Again there was a shirking of the responsibility to look at this issue of antidumping.


Of course, this did not come as a particular shock or great revelation to anyone who is interested in this area of policy because, whenever anyone has tried to alert it throughout its time in government to the range of problems, to the flaws in the national anti-dumping regime, the Labor government has alternated between rolling its eyes, feigning concern, gazing uncomfortably at the ceiling or looking down at its shoes. And it has not done anything to address the very real and very serious issues involved.


Either it has not even recognised that significant problems exist in the system and that substantial remedies are needed or it has recognised them but it simply is incapable, unable, too frightened, weak or indecisive to do anything about it. I am not sure which one of those is true, but either would be equally as damning. 


It is sobering to note that in his second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for Justice, responsible for Customs, said that the government was committed to an anti-dumping system that effectively addressed injury faced by Australian industry as a result of unfair trading practices.


In a panicked response to calls from the AWU and the coalition to reform the arrangements, he also admitted in mid-February that the government 'believed that there are improvements to be made.' One could say that it was nice to hear that coming from the minister, but I am afraid it has remained little more than a quick confessional and just a passing admission of failure. Ultimately, nothing more than lip service has been paid to the idea of genuine reform.


Unlike the government, we on this side of the House want real and practical reform. That is why the coalition antidumping taskforce that I lead is already working on developing an anti-dumping policy that we will be ready to implement and to act upon as soon as we are elected to government, whenever that time may be. This was foreshadowed during the last election. This was our policy. We committed to doing this and we are following through with that. We have been saying consistently for some time that some foreign goods are being sold cheaply in Australia on the back of government subsidies from their origin nation. This is unfairly distorting our domestic market, harming Australian businesses and ultimately, and gradually sometimes, costing local jobs. You do not see it immediately but you do see the impacts over several years of job losses and businesses either closing down or going offshore. Plainly Australian businesses are frustrated with an inefficient, ineffective and very expensive antidumping system. There need to be reductions in the costs, the complexities and the time that businesses confront in seeking remedies under Australia's current anti-dumping system. 


In response to those problems and others like them the coalition has been on the record for some time about the need to take action to ensure that Australian manufacturers' products are not undercut by imported subsidised products. We do not believe that foreign governments should be in a position to distort our domestic market. That was our clearly stated position during the last election and we have built on that. It is essentially an important position to take at a time when Australian business and Australian manufacturing is looking for sensible, practical support from government as they confront the combined weight of factors like rising national debt and deficit, the prospect of further rate increases and the apparently inexhaustible appreciation of the Australian dollar. We understand and we appreciate that battling against unfairly priced imports is yet another pressure that they simply do not want or need or quite often can afford. 


By contrast, the government has said nothing serious or of substance about this particular issues. Its policies and programs that affect Australian manufacturers consistently have the same effect. They put manufacturers under siege. They put businesses struggling on wafer-thin profit margins under even more pressure. And they reflect a desire, whether it is intentional or otherwise, to give foreign companies more power in the marketplace than Australians.


This approach infuriates manufacturers across the nation and that is why so many of them are beginning to speak out publicly. Workers across this nation are fearful about what it means for the long-term viability of their jobs and businesses, whether small, medium or large, and are absolutely volcanic with fury about the lack of vision and inaction the government is showing regarding the broad concerns of manufacturing in this country. It is why Graham Kraehe, the chair of Australia's largest manufacturer, BlueScope Steel, says that manufacturing is on the wrong side of Australia's two-speed economy and this difficult economic position is now being exacerbated by political expediency. It is why BlueScope's CEO, Paul O'Malley, says that the policy framework at the moment is wrong and that it seems to be captured by people who do not care whether there are manufacturing jobs in Australia. It is also why he speculates that there is an antimanufacturing focus in Australia at the moment. Let some be reminded that there are one million Australians employed in the manufacturing sector in Australia.


We go on to hear from OneSteel CEO, Geoff Plummer, when he said that a number of the government's projected actions make competing internationally difficult and that this company is concerned about things that either have been introduced or are speculated to be introduced which will significantly disadvantage Australian manufacturers compared to offshore manufacturers. It is why the Australian Food and Grocery Council CEO, Kate Carnell, has been moved to ask whether policymakers even want a food and grocery manufacturing industry in this country anymore. And it is why the CEO of Coca-Cola Amatil in Australia, Terry Davis, says that an urgent review of the future of manufacturing in Australia is required. It is why even trade unions are vociferously calling for more support from this government for manufacturing and less of its inactivity on subjects like antidumping. Admittedly these are only a small representative sample but these views are nearly universally shared by thousands of others. Does any manufacturer take seriously a government that spins lines about a new program in the budget called 'Buy Australian at Home and Abroad' that is supposedly meant to encourage the purchase of local products, yet at the same time plunders the manufacturing sector for all manner of other budgetary savings and is planning to impose a toxic tax that will send manufacturing offshore and export Australian jobs? Regrettably, while it ploughs most of the money into measures that, like the one mentioned, create more bureaucracy, it does absolutely nothing whatsoever to provide even the most miserable counter to the impact of punitive, job-destroying measures like the introduction of a carbon tax and cuts to the R&D tax concession. Embarrassingly, it also seems to think, if it merely slings another $10 million at a program to help business in a geographic area where another firm has already been severely affected by its inaction, that might kill two birds with one stone. It might get some positive media coverage and its difficulties from its inaction on antidumping might go away. This is breathtaking arrogance and breathtaking stupidity.


Make no mistake about it, the manufacturing industry is under serious threat in Australia, but all the government does is sit idly by. It almost always fails to consult and even on the rare occasions when it makes a half-hearted effort to do so, it inevitably breaks its commitments anyway, leaving those who have given their valuable time to this sham consultative process wondering why on earth they wasted their time in the first place. It puts in place pathetic policies that not only fail to arrest the decline of jobs and the loss of businesses offshore that have already occurred under its watch but actually accelerate these trends. You would think that members of this government, or at least some of them, would be proactive and have some empathy and some concern for what manufacturing businesses are telling them in their own electorates. You would think they would muscle up and honour all the rhetoric and promises they have made to the manufacturing sector about creating a more promising future and valuing their innovation, which has been so integral, particularly from the small- to medium-sized manufacturing sector, to the technological advances and innovation in larger companies in Australia. Even after around 90,000 manufacturing jobs have already been lost in Australia and a string of businesses in the sector have gone to the wall under this government's feeble watch, it is almost like they wear it as a badge of honour and they are resisting all calls for them to fix this mess. I am not sure how loud the calls have to be from everyday Australians, from thousands of businesses and their workers, from the coalition and from independent members of this parliament, for them to actually start listening and to start delivering on policies like antidumping that will help the nation, that will say to hardworking businesses who are not subsidised and do not have the protection of tariffs: we value what you do and we are not going to allow the distortion of the domestic market to your disadvantage and the advantage of a foreign company.


For the moment, the coalition will give its in-principle support to this bill as a means of helping the Labor Party takes its first baby steps in the long and arduous task it has created for itself if it is to sensibly enhance our antidumping system. But at the same time we also call on the government to abandon its ineptitude and inactivity as well as its general indifference to everyone who is willingly providing it with sensible suggestions and solutions. Pretending there are no problems regarding antidumping and manufacturing does not make it so. It does not matter how loudly you say it; it does not matter how often you say it. It is time to face the reality of the problems that dumping is causing in Australia and the stress under which it is putting very successful and innovative Australian businesses. It is time to actually stand up for something and it is time to actually start doing something.

"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (16:49):  I was just amazed by the use of the slogan 'it's time'. I seem to recall that from a campaign in 1972—a great campaign. I am most pleased to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011 today, which will amend certain provisions of the Customs Act 1901 concerning reviews of antidumping measures. The legislative measures to counter dumping have been in operation since early last century. The first country to introduce antidumping legislation was Canada, in 1904. Australia's legislation dates back from the Industries Preservation Act 1906.


In brief, the amendments contained in this bill will clarify the circumstances in which the minister may revoke antidumping measures. Australian antidumping laws, which broadly follow the World Trade Organisation AntiDumping Agreement, aim to prevent the dumping of imports found to cause or threaten 'material injury'. Although dumping is not specifically prohibited, competition from imports can be considered by the Commonwealth to be unfair in certain circumstances and remedial action can be taken.


Dumping occurs when an overseas company exports its goods to another country, oversupplying it at a price that is below the price it charges in its home market or is below the cost of production. Antidumping measures are imposed to prevent an importer from unfairly damaging Australian manufacturing. Australia's antidumping and countervailing system is an important facet of our trade environment and helps to protect local industry and jobs. That is why this bill is so important. The Gillard Labor government supports local industry because local industry is important for our nation. It is important for Australian families.


The bill responds to a decision from last year of the full Federal Court in the Minister of State for Home Affairs and Siam Polyethylene—the Siam decision, as it is called—which considered the review provisions and, in particular, the test for determining whether antidumping measures should be revoked. As the Hon. Brendan O'Connor, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice, outlined in his speech on this bill, the government believes the Siam decision will lead to outcomes inconsistent with the objectives of Australia's antidumping system, and it is appropriate that we seek to rectify it.


Minister O'Connor detailed how the Siam decision is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, the case highlighted a lack of clarity in the current review process, where affected parties must request one of three things: (a) a complete revocation of existing antidumping measures, (b) an adjustment to existing measures or (c) a revocation or, failing that, an adjustment based on changed circumstances. Secondly, the court in its decision formulated a new test for determining whether antidumping measures ought to be revoked. The formulation will likely lead to measures being revoked where they remain warranted.


This government believes that the court's interpretation of the test would lead to antidumping measures being revoked where Australian industry remains at risk of being damaged by dumping. That is why this bill is so important. We need antidumping laws that are consistent with world best practice and the best interests of the Australian economy. If a party wants antidumping measures to be revoked they will have to provide evidence that the measures are no longer warranted. The bill clarifies that if a party wants the minister to revoke antidumping measures it must initiate the request or apply for it within 40 days of a review commencing. This move will make the review process more open and transparent. It will also give Australian manufacturers adequate time to respond to an application for revocation.


The amendments make it clear that, if affected parties want the minister to revoke measures, they must apply for it and they must do so at the outset of a review process or within 40 days of a review commencing. The amendments cement the existing practice of Customs to treat revocation reviews as different in kind from reviews adjusting or updating the level of the measures, and will require an affected party to provide evidence that there are reasonable grounds for asserting that measures are no longer warranted. The amendments will also improve procedural fairness by giving affected parties advance knowledge of the process for seeking the revocation of measures and will ensure that investigators have time to consider the issues before reporting to the minister. Importantly, the amendments will give interested parties adequate time to defend their interests.


The proposed amendments also insert a new test, which will provide that the Customs CEO must recommend that the minister revoke the measures unless satisfied that the removal of measures would lead, or would be likely to lead, to a continuation of, or recurrence of, the dumping or subsidisation and the material injury that the antidumping measures are intended to prevent. Ultimately, it is a clear test which will avert the unnecessary revocation of effective antidumping measures.


The Australian Labor government is committed to its antidumping system. These amendments will ensure, where measures have been put in place to address injury faced by Australian industry as a result of unfair trading practices, those measures remain effective. Members of the chamber, may I say: it is vitally important that laws in this area are clear, for the good of Australian industry and for our international trade relationships. I say to those opposite in this chamber: local industry is worth defending. Australian manufacturing employs at least five times the numbers in our mines. Including agriculture, it is close to seven times that number. Most of our manufacturing sector and agriculture is almost entirely trade exposed. This industry deserves fair treatment in international rights and trade. They need to be afforded a level playing field.


As stated in the AMWU, CFMEU and AWU roundtable paper on antidumping, a better deal for consumers is an illusion. Short-term price cuts come at the expense of local jobs and increase prices over the long term, as the local competition is killed off. The manufacturing industry is an important part of our nation. In terms of employment, our manufacturing industry directly employs 1.1 million Australians, around 12 per cent of the workforce. Tasmania has a small but vibrant manufacturing sector. In my capacity as the member for Bass I will do all I can to encourage this sector and to protect jobs.


Another aspect to look at is the gross domestic product, gross value-added, in the manufacturing sector. According to Manufacturing Skills Australia, as at July 2009 manufacturing, including beverage, timber and paper products, contributed almost $107 billion, 12 per cent of the value of the Australian economy. This is certainly significant.


The Gillard Labor government want Australia to be a high-tech, high-value producer, paying good wages and offering a good standard of living. That is the future we are aiming for. It is the future that Australia deserves. That is why we are delivering the biggest infrastructure program this nation has ever seen: the National Broadband Network. This government are about protecting workers' jobs and their rights into the future. The government are about providing Australian children with the very best of education. The government are ending the blame game with the states when it comes to health, so we can deliver the best outcomes for patients. The government are about tackling climate change. We do not have our heads in the sand; we are not a complacent government. The Gillard Labor government have created more than 300,000 new jobs in the last year alone—and 98 per cent of these jobs were full time. Unemployment is below five per cent. When I studied economics, that was full employment. We have raised pensions. Age pensions are $128 a fortnight higher for singles and $116 a fortnight higher for couples since 2009. Our stimulus packages staved off the global financial crisis, helped families with the cost of living and built new infrastructure in our cities and country towns. Where the Liberal government provided flagpoles, the Labor government has provided jobs and infrastructure in education for the 21st century. Our terms of trade are the best in 140 years, with record returns for our export industries. Let us keep Australia strong. I am pleased the opposition are going to support this bill.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2011-05-24,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:00):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011. The bill before the House will change the way in which antidumping measures are viewed, and it is supported by the coalition. This bill has its origins in a recent High Court decision. Although the coalition does not oppose the bill, the bill shows how confused and contradictory the government's policies are.


Dumping is defined as an act by a manufacturer in one country exporting a product to another country at a price that is below what it charges in its home market. Also, dumping has to cause a material injury to the local industry. It is very important to note that the test to prove dumping is not one where the goods are sold below cost and it is not one where the purpose of the dumper is to damage or eliminate a competitor, nor is there any need to demonstrate a substantial lessening of competition, as there is in many other competition laws. The only test required to establish dumping is that the goods are sold below the price that they are sold at in the home market.


It is easy to understand the logic of antidumping legislation. If a producer is large enough that they are able to divide up markets on a geographical basis and then discriminate in price between the different markets without facing different costs of supply, such a practice results in cross-subsidisation from one market to the other. This distorts the efficient operation of markets and it is clearly an unfair trade practice, one which we rightly condemn. In reality, dumping is just another name for international geographic price discrimination.


If we are to condemn geographic price discrimination on an international basis, where it causes or threatens injury to small competitors, equally we must condemn geographic price discrimination within a nation's borders. In the home of free market capitalism, the USA, geographic price discrimination has been considered an anticompetitive evil for over 100 years. Back in 1911, the US Supreme Court broke up the Standard Oil Company into 34 independent companies, and one of the reasons the court cited was that Standard Oil had engaged in geographic price discrimination. As the court noted:


The evidence is, in fact, absolutely conclusive that the Standard Oil Company charges altogether excessive prices where it meets no competition, and particularly where there is little likelihood of competitors entering the field, and that, on the other hand, where competition is active, it frequently cuts prices to a point which leaves even the Standard little or no profit, and which more often leaves no profit to the competitor ...


In 1936, when America's anti-trust laws were strengthened, they included a specific provision against geographic price discrimination which was known as the Borah-Van Nuys amendment. It stated:


It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce … to sell … goods in any part of the United States at prices lower than those exacted by said person elsewhere in the United States for the purpose of destroying competition, or eliminating a competitor in such part of the United States ...


and that law remains part of US law today.


However, under our Australian competition laws we have no provision to deal with the problem of geographic price discrimination. With such a glaring hole in our competition laws it comes as little surprise that over recent years the Austrian supermarket duopoly has used geographic price discrimination to destroy competition. In one recent highly disturbing case exposed by the major TV networks it was shown that one member of the supermarket duopoly was engaging in a practice of charging altogether excessive prices in markets where it had little or no likelihood of competitors entering the field and that, on the other hand, in markets where competition was active they had cut prices to a point which drove a small competitor out of the market and as soon as that smaller competitor left the market prices were jacked up again. All this occurred right under the nose of the then competition minister, a stone's throw from his own electorate office.


While the practice of dumping has damaged many industries, I would like to share a classic tale of the dangers of dumping with the story of Herbert Dow, the founder of the Dow Chemical Company, and his battles with the Germans in the market for bromine. Bromine is a valuable chemical that has many commercial uses, including as a sedative, a flame retardant and a bleaching agent. It is also used to disinfect water and to make chemicals that work as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, and was also used in the making of film. However, since bromine was first mass-marketed in the mid-1800s the world production of bromine was controlled by a cartel of German firms who, with the German government's support, pursued an aggressive policy of dumping bromine to destroy competition from any foreign country that tried to set up to manufacture it itself. 


Herbert Dow, born in 1866, was a technical whiz and an entrepreneur. During his senior year at school he watched the drilling of an oil well outside Cleveland and at the well site he noticed that the brine had come out to the surface and the brine was what the oilmen considered to be a nuisance. Dow took a sample back to his lab and tested it to see what it contained. He found it contained both lithium and bromine. So this set Dow to wondering whether the bromine could be extracted profitably from the abundant brine in the Cleveland area, as he knew that if he could find an economical way to separate the bromine from the brine he would be able to market the bromine throughout the world and break the German cartel. After many years of failure Dow developed a method of using electrolysis to produce bromine and sell it profitably for 36c a pound when at the time the Germans through their price-fixing cartel had established a worldwide price of 49c a pound. 


With their monopoly threatened by this new source of supply, the Germans made it clear to Dow that if he tried to sell bromine anywhere in the world other than the USA they would dump unlimited quantities of cheap bromine on the American market and drive Dow out of business at whatever cost. But one of Dow's greatest strengths was that he was stubborn and he hated being dictated to by a bully. So he took on the German cartel and sold bromine back into Europe at 36c a pound, undercutting the German price which had been established at 49c. As soon as the Germans discovered what Dow was doing they dumped bromine into America at just 15c a pound, well below the previous world price of 49c and also below Dow's 36c, determined to drive Dow out of business. But rather than bowing down to the Germans and withdrawing from the world market because of this dumping practice, Dow had his agent in New York discreetly buy up hundreds of thousands of pounds of the dumped German bromine at the 15c price. He then repackaged it and sold it back to Europe, including Germany, at 27c a pound, making a tidy profit along the way. Dow then diverted all his US production to supply foreign demand throughout the world at 36c a pound, taking further market share from the Germans. 


Expecting to run Dow out of business, the Germans were befuddled and Dow only became stronger. So the confused Germans kept dumping bromine into the US at lower and lower prices, first at 12c and then 10c a pound, trying to run Dow out of business. Meanwhile Dow kept buying all the bromine he could, repackaging it and selling it back into Europe for 27c a pound, pocketing an even greater profit at the expense of the Germans. Once the Germans finally discovered what was going on it was too late. The Germans had lost millions, depleting their ability to develop new products. Meanwhile Dow had more capital courtesy of the Germans' dumping. That enabled Dow to expand his business and challenge the Germans' dominance in many other chemicals. For example, Dow entered the dye industry and began producing indigo more cheaply than did the dominant German dye cartel. During World War I, when Germany quit trading with the allies, Dow was able to produce products such as aspirin, phenol for explosives and chemicals used to strengthen aeroplane wings, and he did so more efficiently and at lower cost than the previously dominant Germans had. One of the great counterfactuals of world history is what would have happened if the Germans' plan to maintain their worldwide monopoly in bromine and other chemicals had not been thwarted by Herbert Dow.


While this bill is concerned with goods being sold in Australia at prices below those at which they are sold in other countries, what Australian consumers should really be concerned about is goods being sold in Australia at prices far in excess of those available to consumers in other countries. Take the example of Coca-Cola, a commodity that is sold in supermarkets in almost every country throughout the world. One would expect that there would be only marginal differences in the prices of such a popular product in supermarkets throughout the world. In Australia, the 'everyday low price' of a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola currently being offered by the supermarket duopoly is $3.65. Yet a quick check on the internet shows that consumers can buy the same two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola in England for the everyday low price of $2.48. In the USA they pay the equivalent of $1.83. Even in New Zealand, at Woolworths supermarkets the everyday low price is the equivalent of $2.66; in Hong Kong, just $1.65; in South Africa, $2.22; and in Singapore, $2.25—in comparison to Australia's $3.65. It not just Coca-Cola. Compared to countries elsewhere throughout the world, Australian consumers pay grossly excessive prices for many basic supermarket items. So either Australian consumers are the victims of reverse dumping or there is something fundamentally flawed in the competition in our supermarket sector.


The government has failed miserably and repeatedly to protect competition in Australian markets. Before the last election the government made a big song and dance about lack of competition, but all we have seen since it has been elected is a shameful whitewash of the grocery inquiry. Its only initiative has been the high farce of GroceryWatch, the most useless website every created. Now, to show what the government thinks of competition, instead of being a ministry competition has been downgraded to the level of a parliamentary secretary. And this is all before the introduction of a carbon tax, which will push up the price of goods for all in Australia. It is a tax that will place Australian products at a significant competitive disadvantage. The real impact of a domestic carbon tax will be that overseas goods will be shipped into Australia at lower prices than those for which similar goods can be made in Australia. It will damage Australian manufacturers 100 times more than will the problem of dumped goods.


So, while we should be rightly concerned about goods being dumped onto Australian markets below the price at which they are sold in other countries, our real concern should be the fact that Australian consumers are currently paying significantly higher prices than consumers in the rest of the world do. This problem will only be made worse by the carbon tax, irrespective of any changes to our laws on dumping.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,8,1
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (17:13):  The bill before us, the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011, is a really important bill, because it is actually about this Labor government getting serious on dumping and it is about fixing some of the long-term problems and established mechanisms that have been part of the market for quite some time. It is also about making sure we get the balance right between our WTO and free trade obligations, supporting local industry and making sure consumers get a fair price. It is not just about a cheap price; it is about a fair price—an equivalent price.


While I appreciate the comments and the history lesson from the previous member speaking, the member for Hughes, what he said really does not put into context the issues he raised—or dumping issues or the complex and sophisticated nature of what occurs today compared with what used to happen in the 1800s. But I do appreciate what he said. I thought it was quite interesting.


This bill clarifies for the first time when the minister may revoke antidumping measures as a consequence of a particular review. It responds to a very important decision of the full bench of the Federal Court—the Minister of State for Home Affairs v Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd, referred to as the Siam decision. This is really important, because the decision set up a catch-22 mechanism, which is quite dangerous and very problematic. What it meant for the minister was that he was compelled to act in a particular way which would not be in the best interests of this country or of industry in this country. It actually would have led to more frequent revocations and an inconsistency in the way that we dealt with antidumping in this country.


It is good to acknowledge that the opposition support this amendment we are putting forward today. They could not oppose it because it is a really good amendment and it has been really good work by this government in terms of getting this right. We are proposing to insert a new test that will provide that the Customs CEO must recommend the minister revoke measures unless he is satisfied that the removal of those measures would actually lead to continued dumping, further dumping or new dumping. I think it gives the right balance, particularly with reference to dumping, the recurrence of dumping or subsidisation and whether there would be material injury, which the antidumping measures are intended to prevent.


There are a whole range of technical issues all revolving around the capacity for the minister and the CEO of Customs to get the balance right and make those decisions in the right way. For me, it is about making a better and clearer process. It is about getting it right and doing that in the best way that we can. If you have a look at the antidumping measures and the processes attached to them, they are quite involved and quite complex and people would understand why there is the necessity for change. We just need to make it a workable and practical process that recognises the difficulties that Australian industry faces when it is up against actions that are really difficult to prove or interactions at arm's length in another country that might be dumping here in Australia. This amendment will also provide fairness by giving parties advance knowledge of the process for seeking revocation. It will give investigators time to properly consider the issues before reporting back to the minister. One of the big problems has been that not everyone gets the same access to information. That actually causes a problem, particularly for those who are seeking to amend or get right the antidumping measures or countervailing measures.


These amendments are sensible and they take us forward on the really complex matters of antidumping and how Australia plays a fair and robust role in the application of these measures. It is my view, and I would say it is the view of all of us in this place, that Australia has a great track record on these matters. We play a fair game. We seek to trade freely across the globe. We seek to interact with our trading partners on that basis. But the reality is simple—that is, dumping is real and does occur. At a simplistic level, dumping occurs when a foreign company sells products in Australia below the price they sell it for in their own country. It is a bit more involved and complex than that, but as a basic approach that is what is about. Let us understand that this occurs regularly and that it has an enormous impact on our industries, on our jobs here in this country, on our capacity to manufacture, to produce and to keep prices down and on our capacity to make sure that the Australian consumer has the best possible access to good quality products that meet our requirements at good, fair and cheap prices. If we do not get that balance right, it makes it very hard for Australian companies to compete with dumped imports. I hold firmly to the view that Australian companies ought to compete. They ought to innovate and do everything they can. They should not use dumping or antidumping as a surrogate for not fulfilling their part of the bargain, which is that they have to work hard and make sure that they can compete against equal products. If they are being provided fairly and cheaply in this country then we need to be able to compete with that. But as I have said a number of times, we want free trade that is also fair. It has to be a two-way street.


This is not just an Australian problem. Dumping is bad for any nation in which it occurs. When I say it is bad, it can mean the end of an industry altogether, particularly where that industry is a 100 per cent import replacement industry. Whether such an industry survives or not hinges on getting that balance right in terms of antidumping. You cannot come back from that position. Once an industry disappears, you cannot rebuild it. The capital cost and the fear of investment and everything that is attached means that once we lose a particular industry then it is gone and it is gone forever. There is plenty of evidence of that happening in this country. In fact, the Productivity Commission report shows a really interesting graph which they say shows that there is less and less need for antidumping measures because there are fewer and fewer cases. But if you actually track that through history you find that the fewer cases represent less being manufactured in this country. There are fewer cases to compete against because we have less manufacturing. I do not want to see that graph get to a point where there are no cases of antidumping because nothing is produced or manufactured in this country any longer. I think the Productivity Commission actually got that part of it wrong when they looked at what that meant for Australian industry and for competition.


This bill is about strengthening our antidumping legislation. It is about making certain it is fair, free trade that we are dealing with. It is about making clear, for all affected parties, the process to be followed in giving all affected parties more opportunities to have their voices heard when a review does occur. Dumping is complex. It is complex in a whole range of areas. It is complex because not everyone plays by the same rules and in the way they apply those rules. For example, Australia does recognise China as a market economy, whereas the US, Canada and the EU do not. That sets up a whole range of circumstances which make it much more complex for the Australian market and manufacturing and industry in Australia. 


Australia must, under the rules, use Chinese domestic prices when establishing whether dumping is occurring. All other information available to make sure that dumping does not occur does not necessarily play a role, which makes it very complex in determining whether dumping is or is not occurring and, for that matter, whether there is material injury to a particular organisation or company or the wider market. As other countries do not recognise China as a market economy they use a proxy or a surrogate price, which can often be a more representative value of the cost in-country compared to the cost in our own market. Because of this, Australia often becomes the target market for dumped products, and this has been evidenced by a whole range of recent incidents. Basically, we are seen as a soft touch in a whole range of other areas. 


I know the Senate economics committee is currently considering a separate bill sponsored by Senator Xenophon, which is aimed at strengthening antidumping provisions. While there may be some debate about all of the terms and what those provisions might be, I broadly support what Senator Xenophon is trying to achieve and I appreciate the work that he has done with this bill. I look forward to reading the report by the Senate economics committee on this legislation. 


The reality is that we can do more to strengthen our antidumping legislation while still meeting our WTO obligations, because of the flexibility and judgment that is allowed by the current regulations to respond to genuine cases. We need to make sure that we get that right. 


I have been saying, 'Let's do the right thing by industry. Let's do the right thing in terms of consumers as well, to make sure they have access to good-quality and cheap products.' But let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Let us not kill our industries on the basis of inflexibility in terms of our regulations. There is plenty of evidence to support that case. As one submission to the committee points out:


The current provisions within the antidumping system, for example tariff measures, that may be applied to international companies' exports into Australia are less than those which would apply if the same anticompetitive and predatory pricing activities were undertaking in Australia between Australian domiciled companies—for example, as contained within the Trade Practices Act or the ACCC regulations.


To put it simply, we are harder on our own than we are on foreign imports. 


I also want to take this opportunity to look at the real impact of dumping by bringing some other examples to the table. I want to mention the very good and serious work and the good campaign that is being carried out at the moment by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the Australian Workers Union to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. It is a really good submission, which really takes this issue seriously because it affects so many workers and so many people across industry. And it will have a long-term affect on consumers in this country when certain industries are no longer with us.


In particular I want to raise the issue of Capital Limited, which over the past 10 years has been competing against Chinese imports, particularly on subsidised aluminium extrusions, which have taken a substantial market share in Australia. Capital, like many other businesses, are competing internationally. They are competing globally. They produce a fantastic local product but find it very difficult to compete where there are cases of dumping.


The reality is that we did find dumping. As a result of that dumping occurring, action has been taken. Unfortunately, in most cases, that action took place way too slowly and way too late. The damage has already been done or the size of the antidumping measure or countervailing measure was just too small. There are also the cases of Carter Holt Harvey Woodproducts, Big River Timbers and Boral in the Australian plywood production market, which has contracted by more than half since 2000. Dumping was also identified in that market, and measures were put in place against imports from China, Malaysia, Chile and Brazil. The reason I mention this is to make the point that this is real stuff that happens every single day. We need to ensure that our antidumping measures are responsive to what actually happens in the marketplace—and that is harder to prove. I am talking about situations where countries provide free products or do not act at arm's length in their in-country transactions, and that makes it very difficult for Australia to compete.


This is not a question of protectionism versus free trade; it is much more complex than that. I think we all agree that, being a globalised country which has formed the basis of its wealth creation on trade, we believe in free trade and that we are a robust trading nation. But trade has to be fair; we cannot be the soft touch—the patsy—allowing the dumping of products in this country. There are plenty of examples of good, strong manufacturing—globally competitive manufacturing—in this country having been put out of business because of cheap imports.


I am all for consumers having access to really good, cheap products; I have spoken on this in the House before. I do not mind cheap imported cars—I do not care how cheap they get—but I think there needs to be a fairness about the way it is done. We cannot just be used as a dumping ground for other people's exports and prop up their industries while ours suffer as a consequence. I think we need to get that right.


I believe very strongly that this country and our response ought to be as courageous in supporting industry and jobs and fair trade as we are in supporting free trade globally, free trade agreements and World Trade Organisation rules. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Banks) (17:27):  It falls to me to do a bit of filibustering, if I might use that word, until the next speaker comes before the Committee. We are dealing with a bill, the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011, to introduce procedural requirements in order for the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to recommend, and for the minister to declare, that antidumping measures be revoked at the conclusion of the review and to insert a legislative test outlining when the CEO may recommend that the minister revoke antidumping measures. The position is that it is a fairly uncontroversial bill. There is no need for me to say much more, because I think have summarised it, and the next speaker has arrived.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2011-05-24,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (17:28):  I welcome the opportunity to debate the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011. My electorate of Tangney has two strong industrial manufacturing regions: Canning Vale and Myaree. Many residents of my electorate are employed in each of these regions. As well as heavy industry and manufacturing, Canning Vale especially—but also Myaree—has small- to medium- sized enterprises and many mum-and-dad industries. Why is strengthening antidumping laws important? 


Recently a number of business owners and operators have approached my office to discuss how the flood of cheap products and materials into the market is affecting the competitiveness of their businesses. These local businesspeople feel cheap imports are undermining their profitability and in some cases their very survival. Each and every individual felt they could identify a case of dumping that was directly responsible for hurting their business and few felt they would get fair judgment of their case under current antidumping laws. All agreed that stronger and more flexible antidumping laws are a welcome measure for business in Tangney.


Complaints from local businesses in my electorate demonstrate that the present system is too cumbersome and that it places the onus of proof on domestic business rather than on their competitors. Other complaints are that it applies retrospectively, often after irreversible damage has already been done, and that it is generally prohibitively expensive to access. Make no mistake: while the businesses in my electorate thrive and encourage open and free trade, a foreign manufacturer or producer exporting product into Australia below the price it charges in its home market is the unfair predatory pricing that dumping creates. As many of Tangney's businesses are trade and import exposed small- to medium- sized enterprises, I am certain many more businesses than have come to see me are directly affected by dumping, with little recourse.


Dumping is a modern form of protectionism with many international trade experts citing it as the most serious impediment to international trade. Many countries, especially in the EU, have over the past 20 to 30 years increasingly turned to dumping in order to offer protection to import-competing industries. Yet, while Australia's industrial products market is one of the most open markets in the world, the government only pursues a small number of dumping cases. Antidumping measures allow our government to apply for countervailing duties on goods that have been subsidised by the government of the country of export. Where dumping or subsidisation results in material injury to local industry, antidumping or countervailing duties can be applied. To demonstrate its seriousness, since 1980 GATT and WTO members have filed more complaints under the international anti-dumping statute than under all other trade laws combined. Further, more antidumping duties are now levied in any one year worldwide than were levied in the entire period 1947-1970.


Dumping hurts the competitiveness of businesses in my electorate and I welcome these changes. From an international law perspective we must be aware that, while the Australian antidumping system is based on agreed WTO rules and procedures, these measures only benefit a small number of import-competing firms while imposing greater costs on the rest of the economy. In short, international trade policy has little effect on antidumping legislation. Foreign industry can almost guarantee it will not be subject to antidumping tariffs if it charges high enough prices in its export markets. Domestic industry might resist lowering its prices because doing so improves its chances of winning an antidumping case. The same domestic industry might also lay off more workers than expected because doing so indicates injury. My point is, the intricacies of antidumping measures are immense and that is why the Productivity Commission was asked to investigate our current regime in 2009.


The Productivity Commission's report looked at some of the ways the current antidumping laws impact on the wider economy, with certain antidumping measures too easily becoming akin to long-term protection measures or becoming outdated in the face of changing market circumstances. The task force will examine the problems with the current regime with the aim of developing substantive policy designed to stop foreign companies dumping cheap products on Australian markets. The task force honours a coalition election commitment to ensure that Australian manufacturers' products are not undercut by imported or subsidised products or by products that do not comply with appropriate quality standards. Again, as the federal member of an electorate with a heavy import orientated sector, I am proud to say the coalition is standing up for local industry. The establishment of this task force also acknowledges the widespread call from industry groups for improved access to the current antidumping system. Worldwide dumping concerns are not new, and Australia is playing catch-up to the European Union, Japan and the United States. This coalition task force represents the most serious attempt to remedy what is a huge issue for industry in Tangney.


I noticed the budget contained no new money to combat dumping, as was pointed out by the Australian Industry Group CEO, Heather Ridout. If the Labor Party is serious about antidumping measures it should listen to AWU secretary Paul Howes, who has called on his members to write to their local member about dumping. I welcome Mr Howe's sentiment, but, given his influence in the Labor Party, I wonder why he is putting the onus on his members to force change. He also has not committed his union to the measures in this bill.


Questions I believe we need to address include whether antidumping action should be available in response to imports that only threaten to cause material injury to an industry, the period Customs have to investigate cases, and whether the minister should be expected to take action where dumping is found to exist.


Competition is good for consumers and drives business innovation. But I am not confident this bill amends all the problems with the existing scheme. Opposition leader Tony Abbott has highlighted two high-profile examples of dumping. In 2008 and last year we saw a situation where toilet paper from overseas was coming into this country at up to 45 per cent below cost. Initially, antidumping action was taken, but then the government failed to proceed with the case. Another situation saw biodiesel coming into this country at, it is believed, 40 per cent below cost. A Customs report highlighting this dumping case has been sitting on the minister's desk since late last year. I understand no action has been taken.


I do not think any Australian manufacturer objects to strong competition, but it has to be fair competition—and when you have materials coming into this country well below the cost of manufacture and transport that is dumping. Australia must make sure that our manufacturing industries and producers are not needlessly put at risk by an ineffective antidumping regime. Free trade requires a level playing field, again something I am not confident this bill provides. Local business in Tangney is not looking for a handout or a hand-up, simply the freedoms needed to compete in the local market. I do not think this bill goes far enough to address dumping, but it is a start.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (17:39):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas. Before I start my discussion of the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011 I will just inform you that we had the Paniyiri Festival in Brisbane on the weekend and your name was mentioned, and I did mention you in my speech to the crowd—you and Maria Vamvakinou rated a mention.


I rise to speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011. As we have heard from other speakers, Australian manufacturers have been doing it tough lately. They have been copping it from all sides. We see the drop in demand for manufacturing exports as a result of the global financial crisis and flowing on from that the rising dollar making it harder for our manufacturers to compete because our wages and costs are that little bit higher. In my electorate of Moreton, manufacturers are just starting to get back on their feet after the January floods wiped out much of our industrial zones in Rocklea, Archerfield and Acacia Ridge and even in patches of my home suburb of Moorooka. Over 1,000 businesses had water over the floorboards and many of those were manufacturing businesses. Obviously it is relatively easy to move transport or even to move stock to higher parts with forklifts and the like but with some of the heavy engineering equipment it is different. There was a sad story of the business I visited with the Prime Minister and they had a $2 million piece of engineering equipment that they just could not physically move, even though they knew the waters were coming. Even with insurance paying, it takes six months or a year to bring out something like that from Germany as a replacement piece of equipment. So manufacturers in my patch and around Australia are doing it tough.


As this legislation has indicated, they are also particularly under threat from overseas firms who dump their products in the Australian market at short-term lower prices that undercut and damage Australian manufacturers. Previous speakers mentioned lots of examples but the most appropriate one when we are talking about dumping was the toilet paper that had been on the market at 40 per cent below the cost. I have spoken to unions about this, and particularly unions such as the AMWU, who say this has impacted particularly on the steel, aluminium, paper and paper products industries, and some of those are in my electorate.


By dumping products on the Australian market, overseas manufacturers are trying to gain market share and put Australian manufacturers out of business. Once they achieve this and claim the market share, they then bump the prices back up, and obviously in the long run Australian consumers lose out. Dumping presents a clear and present danger to Australian firms and Australian manufacturing employees. I would stack our Australian companies up against any manufacturer in the world. We can match them in terms of innovation and in terms of the sweat of employees. However, the reality is that dumping is an extra danger for them. The last thing our manufacturers need is to be undercut by overseas firms, especially those that have been propped up artificially by foreign government money. What we obviously need is a level playing field and that Australian can-do attitude and Australian initiative can come to the fore. It does Australia no good in the long run if our manufacturers are forced to shut down, to put their employees out of work merely to make way for cheaper overseas products in the short term, especially, as I said, if the prices go up once the Australian company is out of business. It is quite simple, really: we make it here or jobs disappear. That is why we need strong and effective antidumping measures in place. Obviously some people rather simplistically say that we can just impose duties on imports to get them back to a fair value with local products. But the Australian Labor Party see Australia as fundamentally a nation that believes in free trade, and that the tit-for-tat duties and levies help nobody in the long run. That way trading madness lies. This bill is urgently required to overcome the unintended consequences that have arisen as a result of the Federal Court decision in the Siam Polyethylene case. The court determined that, in the absence of a legislative test to determine an application to revoke dumping measures, the minister must revoke measures unless the dumping would cause material injury to the Australian industry. The problem with this ruling is that where dumping measures are in place there should be no material injury to Australian industry. Therefore, this commonsense bill before the chamber amends the Customs Act 1901 to clarify the circumstances in which the minister may revoke antidumping measures in light of a review of such measures. It introduces a new test where the Customs CEO must recommend that the minister revoke measures unless satisfied that the removal of the measures would lead, or be likely to lead, to a continuation of dumping and the material injury that the antidumping measures are intended to prevent.


As I said from the outset, Australian manufacturers and their employees face many threats. Who would have thought back in your younger days, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you might have been travelling around Europe, that we would have the dollar at $US1.05 or US$1.06. When I was backpacking in Europe in 1988 it was completely different. You used to have to work for a month just to be able to buy beer or something like that. Now the dollar has completely changed. While it is good if you are going on a holiday overseas or buying stuff from overseas on the web, it does not help our manufacturers or even our farmers or our miners in certain circumstances. Dumping is only one of the challenges that we face but it is a very significant threat to the manufacturing industry. That is the industry I am particularly keen to make sure that we look after as much as possible. There are other challenges of markets being rattled by the global financial crisis and, in my local area, the flood damaging so many businesses. Also we have got those circumstances where, since the floods and cyclones and the GFC, I think it is true that many Australians are knocking off their debt, which is a good thing; we see credit card debt coming down. But the problem for retailers, part of the chain that manufacturers supply to, is that people are not digging into their wallets and their pockets to spend money, which is a problem for many of our retailers. The amendments in this bill are separate to the government's consideration of the Productivity Commission's recommendations. That work is still ongoing but these amendments are urgently required in response to the Federal Court decision.


I have not had a tour of the factory yet but I have certainly had a meeting with one of the manufacturers in my electorate that makes doors. I cannot remember the name of the factory and I do apologise, but I have had a couple of meetings with them. Many of the doors in new estates come from this factory in Rocklea, but they were unfairly targeted, I would suggest, by something as close to dumping as you would get from the Thai industry. But for the intervention of the minister, it would have meant that this factory would have closed down and its jobs would have gone and so too the quite significant skills associated with carpenters, joiners, fitters and turners and the like to make these doors that then go out into people's homes. It is the case when something like this happens that you do not just set up a door assembly plant overnight; it is expensive equipment and costs a lot of money. If they are not able to turn over enough, Australian wages being what they are, it is hard to keep workers at a factory if they are not selling enough doors. We have already got enough problems with building downturns in Queensland at the moment and there is not a lot of money flying around. There will be some renovations that come with the flood recovery effort, but too many people in my electorate are having trouble waiting for the insurance companies to make a decision one way or the other. At least if they get a no they can then go off to the Queensland Premier's Flood Appeal and maybe get some money through there. If they get a yes then hopefully there will be more doors made from the factory in my electorate.


It has always been the way of the modern Labor Party that we need Australia to be much more than something that sells materials overseas that come back to us as manufactured products. We believe in skills, the high road. We believe in Australia being much more than just a quarry and a farm. We need to turn those things that we dig out of the ground into products that we can then send around the world, which is good for our balance of trade and is good not just in terms of skills but in terms of defence, where you need to have certain skills. I am sure that as a South Australian MP, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, you are aware of the important role that the car industry plays in terms of making sure there are sufficient skills that can then lead on to defence type skills. That is the smart road, the high road that the Labor Party believes Australia should go down. That is why the NBN is such a priority for us. We believe in services that can be sold around the world. I remember during the election campaign those on the opposite side laughing and asking how we could become a focus for money, banking services and the like. But now look at what we are doing in terms of the funds that have been administered and in terms of superannuation. Places like Sydney, and hopefully Brisbane as well, will have a rightful role in showing the rest of the world that we can look after and provide services to the banking industry and the like.


Before becoming a lawyer my background was in education. We have such a great story to tell in providing a great example around the world of how we educate people, not only at the school level but also at the university level and in between, in the TAFE sector. Australia has that proud role, going back to the Colombo Plan. So often we have been able to provide a great education to people who then go back around the world. We have some of the best universities in the world; certainly in my electorate of Moreton, Griffith University is well known throughout the world as a great leader in innovations in health and the environment. I commend the bill to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Moreton for his assistance in this rearrangement.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (17:51):  I also thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, for filling in because of the rearrangements of speakers we have had up here. I rise in support of the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011. Before I speak about the changes the bill will make I will make a few observations to relay to the House concerns that are repeatedly expressed in my electorate office by members of the Hindmarsh constituency and community and, of course, by the wider population. These concerns have as their route insecurity stemming from a dynamic, competitive global economy and the continual shifting we have seen in the last 20 or 30 years of global capital and manufacturing from country to country and region to region.


Just looking at the electorate of Hindmarsh I can name half a dozen businesses—manufacturing industries—that were there but are no longer there. They have disappeared over the last 20-odd years. We had a great employer, Clarks shoes, in the electorate, in the suburb of Marleston. They moved offshore about 10 years ago. Approximately 300 people worked in that particular factory. We also had Griffin Press, who used to print all the Mills and Boon novels—which is a little hidden secret in Adelaide—for the Asian market. They have now moved their printing overseas as well—another 200 jobs there.


So we have seen a huge shift of global capital and manufacturing moved from country to country and region to region over the last couple of decades. But people have an insecurity from this changing profitability of domestic and local production; the questionable sustainability of old, long-held jobs, the divergence of which industries we have and what we consider normal and good and, ultimately, insecurity breeding fear of change and loss, which is often a consequence of change.


Our community has inferred over many years what Australian industry is—what our industrial landscape should consist of and what jobs should be expected to remain open to successive generations. In South Australia, as we heard earlier, we have the car manufacturing industry, which has employed thousands of people over the years. In South Australia we saw Mitsubishi close down a few years ago with the loss of 1,000-odd jobs. If we have not imported a pest or disease with foreign apples or pears for a certain period of time, should we discard our quarantine and inspection services? Certainly not. The purpose of Australian law is not only to stop a proscribed activity already commenced but to prevent a proscribed activity, the threat of which hangs over us waiting for an opportunity.


The law we address here today is that of the Customs Act 1901, which became the unwitting victim of our legal system. The Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, the Hon. Brendan O'Connor, explained in his second reading speech on the bill the unfortunate situation that arose from the judgment of the full Federal Court last year. We cannot have a situation in which a law devised for the proper implementation and enforcement of trade rules is undermined or removed from potential application simply because there has been no unlawful activity in the recent past. We have the law not only to enforce proper behaviour when a party is tempted to cross the line but to establish acceptable behaviour and to proclaim what is right and what will not be tolerated. So I would fully expect all members and senators to get behind the government on this matter and to support the community in its concern for the maintenance of fair trade and antidumping rules within our states and cities and within our wider jurisdiction.


In South Australia, an antidumping case recently took place involving one of the big toilet paper manufacturers in the south-east. The company bringing the products in was found to be dumping. That finding was appealed and the case was upheld. The problem is that we have many cases around the country similar to that one that, for whatever reason, are extremely difficult to prosecute. We need good laws for the protection of our businesses and all the manufacturers to ensure that we keep those very important jobs in our cities, in our electorates and in our wonderful country.


I could not go on without mentioning a particular manufacturer in my electorate, Rossiters Boots. They have been manufacturing boots there for over 100 years now. Through difficult circumstances and difficult times when manufacturing is becoming unprofitable, Dean Rossiter, the owner of Rossiters Boots is determinedly persisting and continues to produce boots in the suburb of Hilton in my electorate. I have had discussions with him over the years. It would be very easy for him to get up and move overseas, as other shoe companies have done in the past. But he is persisting and persevering, employing people locally and trying to do the best that he possibly can. In fact, in some cases, he has second and third generation people working in the shoe factory where their grandfathers and their parents were employed. They produce a very good shoe, a great product.


A few months ago, I was in Bali. We saw massive shoe production factories everywhere. People were working for $70 a week. You can see how difficult it is to compete with those lower wages in some of those countries, where these same products are being made. You can also see the temptation of those particular companies overseas to come into our market. They know that they can sell the product cheaper. They can also dump the product on the market, bringing the prices artificially low and therefore sending businesses out of business.


I am very pleased that this bill has been introduced. It will amend certain provisions of the Customs Act. The bill responds to, as I said, a decision last year by the full Federal Court, which considered the review provisions and, in particular, the test for determining whether antidumping measures should be revoked. The proposed amendments in this bill insert a new test which will provide that the Customs CEO must recommend that the minister revoke measures unless satisfied that the removal of the measures would lead, or be likely to lead to a continuation of, or recurrence of the dumping and the material injury that the antidumping measures are intended to prevent. It is a clear test which will avert the unnecessary revocation of effective antidumping measures.


The government is committed to its antidumping system. These amendments will ensure that where measures have been put in place to address injury faced by Australian industry as a result of unfair trading practices that those measures remain effective.


As I said earlier, I would fully expect all members in this place to get behind this bill, to support the community in its concern for the maintenance of fair trade and antidumping rules within our jurisdiction and support the government's bill. I commend the bill to the House.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (18:06):  These proposed amendments to the Customs Act seek to clarify the circumstances under which dumping measures should be revoked. These amendments are sought to address the unintended consequences of a decision of the full Federal Court–the Siam decision–which formulated a test for revocation that will lead to outcomes inconsistent with the objectives of the antidumping system.


As a result of the full Federal Court's decision in Siam, it is much more likely that a finding of no dumping or no injury during a review period will lead to revocation. This outcome would be inconsistent with the objects of the antidumping system. The review provisions therefore need to be urgently amended to clarify the revocation test. These amendments would clarify that the Customs CEO may only examine whether the measures should be revoked where affected parties provide sufficient evidence in the approved form that there are reasonable grounds for asserting that the measure is no longer warranted, or where the minister requests such a review.


The amendments would also insert an express revocation test. Once the evidentiary requirements for initiating a revocation review have been met and a revocation review has been notified the CEO must recommend that the minister revoke measures unless satisfied that the removal of the measures would lead, or be likely to lead, to a continuation of, or a recurrence of, the dumping or subsidisation and the material injury that the antidumping measures are intended to prevent.


It is imperative that the legislation governing reviews of antidumping and countervailing measures is amended in order to minimise the number of existing measures that are revoked which would not otherwise be revoked under the proposed changes that clarify and restore the intended operation of the review provisions.


I believe that it is very timely that the issue of antidumping measures is before the House. I believe it is a very important and serious issue, especially at a time when Australian exporting and import-competing firms are struggling under the difficulties of the high Australian dollar. The Australian Workers Union has launched a campaign to raise worker and community awareness about the damage that illegal dumping is doing to Australia's manufacturing industry. The AWU says that there has been dumping of a wide range of finished goods competing with Australian producers. It says that products like solar panels, rail track, wind towers, mining infrastructure equipment, steel frames et cetera are being produced overseas, primarily by China, and dumped on the Australian market. The AWU has resolved to call on the federal government to establish an independent commission to investigate dumping allegations and to legislate to enable affected groups and unions to ask for investigations to be undertaken by this body.


The union has warned that the sustainability of Australia's manufacturing sector is under threat, and has also called on the Australian government to help local industry by adopting a strict rule-of-law approach to illegal trade practices consistent with our WTO entitlements. The AWU has informed a Senate enquiry that Australia's commitment to a global free-trade regime should be on the basis that all our trading partners consistently apply World Trade Organisation trade laws and regulations. As the AWU has stated, it is committed to free trade. Over the last 30 years, coinciding with the reforming Hawke-Keating governments, this union has played its part in ensuring the benefits of trade liberalisation. This is shared by AWU members—along with the nation as a whole—in increased investment, job creation and national income. The benefits of free trade are not in doubt. Reciprocity of access to foreign markets has also been a key driver to enhancing the competitiveness of many of the trade exposed industries represented by the AWU including, steel, aluminium, plastics, petrochemical, agribusiness and horticultural industries.


However, just as with other activities in the marketplace, rules about free trade should apply, and trade on any terms does not constitute free trade. Unfortunately, in Australia there is a lack of regulatory action and oversight, which means Australian companies are ripe for exploitative trade practices aimed at dominating local markets through a range of subsidies and dumping strategies.


In a submission to the same Senate inquiry, the AWU spoke of its national Don't Dump on Australia campaign, which was launched earlier this year. In the submission the AWU outlined the following priorities to address product dumping: first, a properly resourced and independent antidumping agency responding proactively to dumping and subsidy complaints; second, improving the culture of Customs and compliance with Customs decisions; third, that Chinese exports by state owned enterprises should be treated like other state owned enterprises in other developed countries, notwithstanding China's market economy status; fourth, reflecting WTO rights in full in Australia's antidumping and countervailing system as trade defences rather than industry protection; fifth, amending the Customs Act to acknowledge that unions should have the right to petition for investigations; and, finally, strong local content requirements. Stronger local content requirements would serve to limit subsidised imports taking market share from local suppliers.


I support the AWU campaign. I believe that national self-sufficiency is important and I want Australia to continue to have a vibrant manufacturing industry. It is therefore important that our 'level playing fields' are genuinely level.


The fate of Australian workers in trade exposed industries rests with the creation and enforcement in Australia of a strong antidumping regime in order that nations do not take advantage of our generosity of spirit in trade matters. Many governments and in particular the Chinese government intervene directly and extensively in their economy to benefit their own industries. According to the WTO rules, however, WTO members including China can only do this in a manner which does not cause or threaten to cause injury to foreign suppliers of like goods. Of all the WTO members, China faces the most antidumping actions because of dumping of product below what is regarded as normal value and for recourse to export subsidies. There are two main ways Australian manufacturers of like goods are injured or threatened with injury by Chinese exporters assisted through government policies: first, by dumping and, second, by industry subsidies. The AWU submission says:


There is widespread evidence that China is engaging in a range of illegal practices to stimulate and protect its domestic producers of green technology, from wind and solar energy products to advanced batteries and energy-efficient vehicles.


These practices are enabling China to emerge as a dominant supplier of certain green technologies. They also have facilitated the transfer of manufacturing and research and development investment into China, costing otherwise efficient Australian companies and workers the green profits and high-skilled jobs of the future. Many of these practices are direct violations of the obligations China undertook when it joined the World Trade organisation.


The Australian Workers Union wants the federal government to understand that manufacturing workers take the brunt of deliberate Chinese government policies are not based on supply and demand, not based on WTO rules, but rather on a model of state capitalism aimed at winning dominant market share, by subsidising below the normal costs of production and giving other assistance at the expense of international competitors. 


Our manufacturers should be well placed to exploit the economic opportunities available from the growing clean energy global economy. In order for Australia to do this, though, we must ensure that we have an equal opportunity to compete where all nations observe the global free trade rules. Sadly, our manufacturers are not competing on a level playing field with Chinese competitors. Chinese competitors can offer dump prices in Australia, not because they are better at making certain products than Australia but because their state owned or state linked enterprises sell the inputs to their industries at less than the cost that it takes to produce them or their normal cost of production. China manages its exchange rate, and the yuan is undervalued by approximately 20 per cent to 40 per cent, affording yet another advantage. Many of the dumping and subsidy practices of the Chinese have been challenged by other jurisdictions, including the US, Canada and the European Union. The WTO has defended their right to take action, because these practices clearly disadvantage industries and workers.


In recent months, both the United States and Canada have begun to adopt a more aggressive position on China's disregard for WTO rules. If they can act against dumped products then Australia should be able to follow that lead. As the AWU has pointed out, we should not worry about claims that a strong antidumping regime is simply a new form of protectionism threatening free trade. Free trade is in reality being threatened by China's flouting of the WTO rules. If we do not act now then products that once were dumped in the US and Canadian markets will be redirected to naive Australia and we will suffer even more. China needs to abide by the international rules governing trade, investment and labour standards. To allow them to do otherwise would be to allow them to play us for economic mugs. As the Australian scholar Christian Jack said, accommodation of China does not necessitate abandonment of Australia's core values. Australia must enforce its right to apply effective antidumping and countervailing measures to prevent injury and loss to Australian industry and workers. I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,8,1
"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2011-05-24,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (16:32):  In rising to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011 I indicate to the House that the coalition supports this bill.



Government members interjecting—




Mrs MIRABELLA:
  Do not get too excited! We do not support the government's approach or, more accurately, the lack of a detailed approach to antidumping more generally. To put it bluntly, there are a series of problems that are plaguing the current operation of antidumping arrangements in Australia. While Australian industries and Australian workers are rightly objecting to what is happening, Labor is simply not listening. If passed, the bill currently before the House will change the way in which antidumping measures are reviewed and revoked. The coalition believes that this does represent an appropriate response to the full Federal Court's decision in the Minister of State for Home Affairs v Siam Polyethylene, also called the Siam decision case. 


We agree with the government that the ways in which Customs powers relating to revocation were interpreted in that case are problematic and we share its view that as a result of the Siam decision it is now significantly more likely that a finding of no dumping or no injury during a review period will lead to revocation. We are fearful about the impact that that might have on Australian industry and we are of the view that it is difficult to predict or pre-assess the likely ramifications of the removal of antidumping measures, especially the potential for the subsequent resumption of dumping causing material injury. 


The idea that is at the heart of this bill, that the current revocation test should be strengthened to give Australian industry greater redress against unfair trading practices, is not contentious as far as we are concerned. Nor is the more general principal that improvements to the review process under the current system are necessary in order to strike a better balance between the interests of foreign and local companies. 


We also believe that the changes that are being legislated through this bill are consistent with Australia's World Trade Organisation obligations and the current practices of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. But we will naturally reserve our rights to make amendments following the Senate committee's review process that is not due to be completed until later this year. We make the broader point that the introduction of this bill really represents nothing more from the government than the application of a bandaid to a gaping wound. Whilst it will legislate for an improvement to one facet of Australia's antidumping system it is a move of small consequence when set against the government's complete unwillingness to engage in the broader debate about how effectively the overall system is working or, as the case may be, is not working.


What is long overdue is far more widespread serious and lasting action. For way too long—in fact, for close to the entirety of its time in office—this government has simply sat on its hands when it comes to antidumping. Under the Howard government, changes were made to the arrangements to try and ensure that they appropriately kept pace with broader trends in the manner in which goods were being imported into Australia. We did this on the basis that it is important to keep monitoring the operation of the system on a regular basis and making changes where they are necessary.




Ms Hall:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Is the member for Indi willing to give way?




Mrs MIRABELLA:
  No. These reviews are necessary on a regular basis but the Rudd and Gillard governments have opted for quite a different approach. Minister Bowen, in his previous role and during days that were far less fraught for him, told everyone who wanted to listen after a COAG meeting in 2008 that Labor would act to amend the system. But Rip Van Winkle might as well have inherited the mantle of implementing government policy after that, because we have witnessed a trademark tale of Labor inaction when it has come to any kind of serious policy reform in this area.


Following Mr Bowen's announcement, Labor dragged its feet and shuffled the matter off to the Productivity Commission in early 2009. When the commission's report came back at the end of 2009, Labor dithered again—so badly, in fact, that it then sent the matter off for an internal review of some kind so it could postpone doing anything until after the 2010 election.


In trademark Labor tradition, the sad reality was that the government was far more interested in attempting to take the political heat out of the issue than making constructive policy changes in the national interest and in the interests of Australian industry, particularly Australian manufacturing.  Inevitably, that has not done anybody any good, because the government has essentially been fiddling while Australian businesses have been suffering. All you need to do is go to any business that is affected by imported goods that are dumped and they will tell you about their frustration at a system that does not work and the impact on Australian industry, Australian manufacturing and how that is affecting investment decisions today.


In many ways, it is quite ironic that we should be having this debate so close to this year's budget. Because, even after all of this inactivity from Labor and after all the time that has passed without any decision whatsoever, it put its hand on its collective heart a few months ago, and said, 'Okay, we'll do something and we'll announce it as part of the 2011 budget'.


At least two ministers—the minister with the responsibility for Customs, and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research—publicly stated that this would be the government's approach.  There could well have been others as well, but you will have to forgive me for not exactly hanging off every worthless word of most of the senior officeholders of this government.


What have we seen? To our surprise, when looking through all the budget papers, we found nothing. Yet again, there was nothing. Again there was a shirking of the responsibility to look at this issue of antidumping.


Of course, this did not come as a particular shock or great revelation to anyone who is interested in this area of policy because, whenever anyone has tried to alert it throughout its time in government to the range of problems, to the flaws in the national anti-dumping regime, the Labor government has alternated between rolling its eyes, feigning concern, gazing uncomfortably at the ceiling or looking down at its shoes. And it has not done anything to address the very real and very serious issues involved.


Either it has not even recognised that significant problems exist in the system and that substantial remedies are needed or it has recognised them but it simply is incapable, unable, too frightened, weak or indecisive to do anything about it. I am not sure which one of those is true, but either would be equally as damning. 


It is sobering to note that in his second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for Justice, responsible for Customs, said that the government was committed to an anti-dumping system that effectively addressed injury faced by Australian industry as a result of unfair trading practices.


In a panicked response to calls from the AWU and the coalition to reform the arrangements, he also admitted in mid-February that the government 'believed that there are improvements to be made.' One could say that it was nice to hear that coming from the minister, but I am afraid it has remained little more than a quick confessional and just a passing admission of failure. Ultimately, nothing more than lip service has been paid to the idea of genuine reform.


Unlike the government, we on this side of the House want real and practical reform. That is why the coalition antidumping taskforce that I lead is already working on developing an anti-dumping policy that we will be ready to implement and to act upon as soon as we are elected to government, whenever that time may be. This was foreshadowed during the last election. This was our policy. We committed to doing this and we are following through with that. We have been saying consistently for some time that some foreign goods are being sold cheaply in Australia on the back of government subsidies from their origin nation. This is unfairly distorting our domestic market, harming Australian businesses and ultimately, and gradually sometimes, costing local jobs. You do not see it immediately but you do see the impacts over several years of job losses and businesses either closing down or going offshore. Plainly Australian businesses are frustrated with an inefficient, ineffective and very expensive antidumping system. There need to be reductions in the costs, the complexities and the time that businesses confront in seeking remedies under Australia's current anti-dumping system. 


In response to those problems and others like them the coalition has been on the record for some time about the need to take action to ensure that Australian manufacturers' products are not undercut by imported subsidised products. We do not believe that foreign governments should be in a position to distort our domestic market. That was our clearly stated position during the last election and we have built on that. It is essentially an important position to take at a time when Australian business and Australian manufacturing is looking for sensible, practical support from government as they confront the combined weight of factors like rising national debt and deficit, the prospect of further rate increases and the apparently inexhaustible appreciation of the Australian dollar. We understand and we appreciate that battling against unfairly priced imports is yet another pressure that they simply do not want or need or quite often can afford. 


By contrast, the government has said nothing serious or of substance about this particular issues. Its policies and programs that affect Australian manufacturers consistently have the same effect. They put manufacturers under siege. They put businesses struggling on wafer-thin profit margins under even more pressure. And they reflect a desire, whether it is intentional or otherwise, to give foreign companies more power in the marketplace than Australians.


This approach infuriates manufacturers across the nation and that is why so many of them are beginning to speak out publicly. Workers across this nation are fearful about what it means for the long-term viability of their jobs and businesses, whether small, medium or large, and are absolutely volcanic with fury about the lack of vision and inaction the government is showing regarding the broad concerns of manufacturing in this country. It is why Graham Kraehe, the chair of Australia's largest manufacturer, BlueScope Steel, says that manufacturing is on the wrong side of Australia's two-speed economy and this difficult economic position is now being exacerbated by political expediency. It is why BlueScope's CEO, Paul O'Malley, says that the policy framework at the moment is wrong and that it seems to be captured by people who do not care whether there are manufacturing jobs in Australia. It is also why he speculates that there is an antimanufacturing focus in Australia at the moment. Let some be reminded that there are one million Australians employed in the manufacturing sector in Australia.


We go on to hear from OneSteel CEO, Geoff Plummer, when he said that a number of the government's projected actions make competing internationally difficult and that this company is concerned about things that either have been introduced or are speculated to be introduced which will significantly disadvantage Australian manufacturers compared to offshore manufacturers. It is why the Australian Food and Grocery Council CEO, Kate Carnell, has been moved to ask whether policymakers even want a food and grocery manufacturing industry in this country anymore. And it is why the CEO of Coca-Cola Amatil in Australia, Terry Davis, says that an urgent review of the future of manufacturing in Australia is required. It is why even trade unions are vociferously calling for more support from this government for manufacturing and less of its inactivity on subjects like antidumping. Admittedly these are only a small representative sample but these views are nearly universally shared by thousands of others. Does any manufacturer take seriously a government that spins lines about a new program in the budget called 'Buy Australian at Home and Abroad' that is supposedly meant to encourage the purchase of local products, yet at the same time plunders the manufacturing sector for all manner of other budgetary savings and is planning to impose a toxic tax that will send manufacturing offshore and export Australian jobs? Regrettably, while it ploughs most of the money into measures that, like the one mentioned, create more bureaucracy, it does absolutely nothing whatsoever to provide even the most miserable counter to the impact of punitive, job-destroying measures like the introduction of a carbon tax and cuts to the R&D tax concession. Embarrassingly, it also seems to think, if it merely slings another $10 million at a program to help business in a geographic area where another firm has already been severely affected by its inaction, that might kill two birds with one stone. It might get some positive media coverage and its difficulties from its inaction on antidumping might go away. This is breathtaking arrogance and breathtaking stupidity.


Make no mistake about it, the manufacturing industry is under serious threat in Australia, but all the government does is sit idly by. It almost always fails to consult and even on the rare occasions when it makes a half-hearted effort to do so, it inevitably breaks its commitments anyway, leaving those who have given their valuable time to this sham consultative process wondering why on earth they wasted their time in the first place. It puts in place pathetic policies that not only fail to arrest the decline of jobs and the loss of businesses offshore that have already occurred under its watch but actually accelerate these trends. You would think that members of this government, or at least some of them, would be proactive and have some empathy and some concern for what manufacturing businesses are telling them in their own electorates. You would think they would muscle up and honour all the rhetoric and promises they have made to the manufacturing sector about creating a more promising future and valuing their innovation, which has been so integral, particularly from the small- to medium-sized manufacturing sector, to the technological advances and innovation in larger companies in Australia. Even after around 90,000 manufacturing jobs have already been lost in Australia and a string of businesses in the sector have gone to the wall under this government's feeble watch, it is almost like they wear it as a badge of honour and they are resisting all calls for them to fix this mess. I am not sure how loud the calls have to be from everyday Australians, from thousands of businesses and their workers, from the coalition and from independent members of this parliament, for them to actually start listening and to start delivering on policies like antidumping that will help the nation, that will say to hardworking businesses who are not subsidised and do not have the protection of tariffs: we value what you do and we are not going to allow the distortion of the domestic market to your disadvantage and the advantage of a foreign company.


For the moment, the coalition will give its in-principle support to this bill as a means of helping the Labor Party takes its first baby steps in the long and arduous task it has created for itself if it is to sensibly enhance our antidumping system. But at the same time we also call on the government to abandon its ineptitude and inactivity as well as its general indifference to everyone who is willingly providing it with sensible suggestions and solutions. Pretending there are no problems regarding antidumping and manufacturing does not make it so. It does not matter how loudly you say it; it does not matter how often you say it. It is time to face the reality of the problems that dumping is causing in Australia and the stress under which it is putting very successful and innovative Australian businesses. It is time to actually stand up for something and it is time to actually start doing something.

"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (16:49):  I was just amazed by the use of the slogan 'it's time'. I seem to recall that from a campaign in 1972—a great campaign. I am most pleased to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011 today, which will amend certain provisions of the Customs Act 1901 concerning reviews of antidumping measures. The legislative measures to counter dumping have been in operation since early last century. The first country to introduce antidumping legislation was Canada, in 1904. Australia's legislation dates back from the Industries Preservation Act 1906.


In brief, the amendments contained in this bill will clarify the circumstances in which the minister may revoke antidumping measures. Australian antidumping laws, which broadly follow the World Trade Organisation AntiDumping Agreement, aim to prevent the dumping of imports found to cause or threaten 'material injury'. Although dumping is not specifically prohibited, competition from imports can be considered by the Commonwealth to be unfair in certain circumstances and remedial action can be taken.


Dumping occurs when an overseas company exports its goods to another country, oversupplying it at a price that is below the price it charges in its home market or is below the cost of production. Antidumping measures are imposed to prevent an importer from unfairly damaging Australian manufacturing. Australia's antidumping and countervailing system is an important facet of our trade environment and helps to protect local industry and jobs. That is why this bill is so important. The Gillard Labor government supports local industry because local industry is important for our nation. It is important for Australian families.


The bill responds to a decision from last year of the full Federal Court in the Minister of State for Home Affairs and Siam Polyethylene—the Siam decision, as it is called—which considered the review provisions and, in particular, the test for determining whether antidumping measures should be revoked. As the Hon. Brendan O'Connor, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice, outlined in his speech on this bill, the government believes the Siam decision will lead to outcomes inconsistent with the objectives of Australia's antidumping system, and it is appropriate that we seek to rectify it.


Minister O'Connor detailed how the Siam decision is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, the case highlighted a lack of clarity in the current review process, where affected parties must request one of three things: (a) a complete revocation of existing antidumping measures, (b) an adjustment to existing measures or (c) a revocation or, failing that, an adjustment based on changed circumstances. Secondly, the court in its decision formulated a new test for determining whether antidumping measures ought to be revoked. The formulation will likely lead to measures being revoked where they remain warranted.


This government believes that the court's interpretation of the test would lead to antidumping measures being revoked where Australian industry remains at risk of being damaged by dumping. That is why this bill is so important. We need antidumping laws that are consistent with world best practice and the best interests of the Australian economy. If a party wants antidumping measures to be revoked they will have to provide evidence that the measures are no longer warranted. The bill clarifies that if a party wants the minister to revoke antidumping measures it must initiate the request or apply for it within 40 days of a review commencing. This move will make the review process more open and transparent. It will also give Australian manufacturers adequate time to respond to an application for revocation.


The amendments make it clear that, if affected parties want the minister to revoke measures, they must apply for it and they must do so at the outset of a review process or within 40 days of a review commencing. The amendments cement the existing practice of Customs to treat revocation reviews as different in kind from reviews adjusting or updating the level of the measures, and will require an affected party to provide evidence that there are reasonable grounds for asserting that measures are no longer warranted. The amendments will also improve procedural fairness by giving affected parties advance knowledge of the process for seeking the revocation of measures and will ensure that investigators have time to consider the issues before reporting to the minister. Importantly, the amendments will give interested parties adequate time to defend their interests.


The proposed amendments also insert a new test, which will provide that the Customs CEO must recommend that the minister revoke the measures unless satisfied that the removal of measures would lead, or would be likely to lead, to a continuation of, or recurrence of, the dumping or subsidisation and the material injury that the antidumping measures are intended to prevent. Ultimately, it is a clear test which will avert the unnecessary revocation of effective antidumping measures.


The Australian Labor government is committed to its antidumping system. These amendments will ensure, where measures have been put in place to address injury faced by Australian industry as a result of unfair trading practices, those measures remain effective. Members of the chamber, may I say: it is vitally important that laws in this area are clear, for the good of Australian industry and for our international trade relationships. I say to those opposite in this chamber: local industry is worth defending. Australian manufacturing employs at least five times the numbers in our mines. Including agriculture, it is close to seven times that number. Most of our manufacturing sector and agriculture is almost entirely trade exposed. This industry deserves fair treatment in international rights and trade. They need to be afforded a level playing field.


As stated in the AMWU, CFMEU and AWU roundtable paper on antidumping, a better deal for consumers is an illusion. Short-term price cuts come at the expense of local jobs and increase prices over the long term, as the local competition is killed off. The manufacturing industry is an important part of our nation. In terms of employment, our manufacturing industry directly employs 1.1 million Australians, around 12 per cent of the workforce. Tasmania has a small but vibrant manufacturing sector. In my capacity as the member for Bass I will do all I can to encourage this sector and to protect jobs.


Another aspect to look at is the gross domestic product, gross value-added, in the manufacturing sector. According to Manufacturing Skills Australia, as at July 2009 manufacturing, including beverage, timber and paper products, contributed almost $107 billion, 12 per cent of the value of the Australian economy. This is certainly significant.


The Gillard Labor government want Australia to be a high-tech, high-value producer, paying good wages and offering a good standard of living. That is the future we are aiming for. It is the future that Australia deserves. That is why we are delivering the biggest infrastructure program this nation has ever seen: the National Broadband Network. This government are about protecting workers' jobs and their rights into the future. The government are about providing Australian children with the very best of education. The government are ending the blame game with the states when it comes to health, so we can deliver the best outcomes for patients. The government are about tackling climate change. We do not have our heads in the sand; we are not a complacent government. The Gillard Labor government have created more than 300,000 new jobs in the last year alone—and 98 per cent of these jobs were full time. Unemployment is below five per cent. When I studied economics, that was full employment. We have raised pensions. Age pensions are $128 a fortnight higher for singles and $116 a fortnight higher for couples since 2009. Our stimulus packages staved off the global financial crisis, helped families with the cost of living and built new infrastructure in our cities and country towns. Where the Liberal government provided flagpoles, the Labor government has provided jobs and infrastructure in education for the 21st century. Our terms of trade are the best in 140 years, with record returns for our export industries. Let us keep Australia strong. I am pleased the opposition are going to support this bill.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:00):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011. The bill before the House will change the way in which antidumping measures are viewed, and it is supported by the coalition. This bill has its origins in a recent High Court decision. Although the coalition does not oppose the bill, the bill shows how confused and contradictory the government's policies are.


Dumping is defined as an act by a manufacturer in one country exporting a product to another country at a price that is below what it charges in its home market. Also, dumping has to cause a material injury to the local industry. It is very important to note that the test to prove dumping is not one where the goods are sold below cost and it is not one where the purpose of the dumper is to damage or eliminate a competitor, nor is there any need to demonstrate a substantial lessening of competition, as there is in many other competition laws. The only test required to establish dumping is that the goods are sold below the price that they are sold at in the home market.


It is easy to understand the logic of antidumping legislation. If a producer is large enough that they are able to divide up markets on a geographical basis and then discriminate in price between the different markets without facing different costs of supply, such a practice results in cross-subsidisation from one market to the other. This distorts the efficient operation of markets and it is clearly an unfair trade practice, one which we rightly condemn. In reality, dumping is just another name for international geographic price discrimination.


If we are to condemn geographic price discrimination on an international basis, where it causes or threatens injury to small competitors, equally we must condemn geographic price discrimination within a nation's borders. In the home of free market capitalism, the USA, geographic price discrimination has been considered an anticompetitive evil for over 100 years. Back in 1911, the US Supreme Court broke up the Standard Oil Company into 34 independent companies, and one of the reasons the court cited was that Standard Oil had engaged in geographic price discrimination. As the court noted:


The evidence is, in fact, absolutely conclusive that the Standard Oil Company charges altogether excessive prices where it meets no competition, and particularly where there is little likelihood of competitors entering the field, and that, on the other hand, where competition is active, it frequently cuts prices to a point which leaves even the Standard little or no profit, and which more often leaves no profit to the competitor ...


In 1936, when America's anti-trust laws were strengthened, they included a specific provision against geographic price discrimination which was known as the Borah-Van Nuys amendment. It stated:


It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce … to sell … goods in any part of the United States at prices lower than those exacted by said person elsewhere in the United States for the purpose of destroying competition, or eliminating a competitor in such part of the United States ...


and that law remains part of US law today.


However, under our Australian competition laws we have no provision to deal with the problem of geographic price discrimination. With such a glaring hole in our competition laws it comes as little surprise that over recent years the Austrian supermarket duopoly has used geographic price discrimination to destroy competition. In one recent highly disturbing case exposed by the major TV networks it was shown that one member of the supermarket duopoly was engaging in a practice of charging altogether excessive prices in markets where it had little or no likelihood of competitors entering the field and that, on the other hand, in markets where competition was active they had cut prices to a point which drove a small competitor out of the market and as soon as that smaller competitor left the market prices were jacked up again. All this occurred right under the nose of the then competition minister, a stone's throw from his own electorate office.


While the practice of dumping has damaged many industries, I would like to share a classic tale of the dangers of dumping with the story of Herbert Dow, the founder of the Dow Chemical Company, and his battles with the Germans in the market for bromine. Bromine is a valuable chemical that has many commercial uses, including as a sedative, a flame retardant and a bleaching agent. It is also used to disinfect water and to make chemicals that work as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, and was also used in the making of film. However, since bromine was first mass-marketed in the mid-1800s the world production of bromine was controlled by a cartel of German firms who, with the German government's support, pursued an aggressive policy of dumping bromine to destroy competition from any foreign country that tried to set up to manufacture it itself. 


Herbert Dow, born in 1866, was a technical whiz and an entrepreneur. During his senior year at school he watched the drilling of an oil well outside Cleveland and at the well site he noticed that the brine had come out to the surface and the brine was what the oilmen considered to be a nuisance. Dow took a sample back to his lab and tested it to see what it contained. He found it contained both lithium and bromine. So this set Dow to wondering whether the bromine could be extracted profitably from the abundant brine in the Cleveland area, as he knew that if he could find an economical way to separate the bromine from the brine he would be able to market the bromine throughout the world and break the German cartel. After many years of failure Dow developed a method of using electrolysis to produce bromine and sell it profitably for 36c a pound when at the time the Germans through their price-fixing cartel had established a worldwide price of 49c a pound. 


With their monopoly threatened by this new source of supply, the Germans made it clear to Dow that if he tried to sell bromine anywhere in the world other than the USA they would dump unlimited quantities of cheap bromine on the American market and drive Dow out of business at whatever cost. But one of Dow's greatest strengths was that he was stubborn and he hated being dictated to by a bully. So he took on the German cartel and sold bromine back into Europe at 36c a pound, undercutting the German price which had been established at 49c. As soon as the Germans discovered what Dow was doing they dumped bromine into America at just 15c a pound, well below the previous world price of 49c and also below Dow's 36c, determined to drive Dow out of business. But rather than bowing down to the Germans and withdrawing from the world market because of this dumping practice, Dow had his agent in New York discreetly buy up hundreds of thousands of pounds of the dumped German bromine at the 15c price. He then repackaged it and sold it back to Europe, including Germany, at 27c a pound, making a tidy profit along the way. Dow then diverted all his US production to supply foreign demand throughout the world at 36c a pound, taking further market share from the Germans. 


Expecting to run Dow out of business, the Germans were befuddled and Dow only became stronger. So the confused Germans kept dumping bromine into the US at lower and lower prices, first at 12c and then 10c a pound, trying to run Dow out of business. Meanwhile Dow kept buying all the bromine he could, repackaging it and selling it back into Europe for 27c a pound, pocketing an even greater profit at the expense of the Germans. Once the Germans finally discovered what was going on it was too late. The Germans had lost millions, depleting their ability to develop new products. Meanwhile Dow had more capital courtesy of the Germans' dumping. That enabled Dow to expand his business and challenge the Germans' dominance in many other chemicals. For example, Dow entered the dye industry and began producing indigo more cheaply than did the dominant German dye cartel. During World War I, when Germany quit trading with the allies, Dow was able to produce products such as aspirin, phenol for explosives and chemicals used to strengthen aeroplane wings, and he did so more efficiently and at lower cost than the previously dominant Germans had. One of the great counterfactuals of world history is what would have happened if the Germans' plan to maintain their worldwide monopoly in bromine and other chemicals had not been thwarted by Herbert Dow.


While this bill is concerned with goods being sold in Australia at prices below those at which they are sold in other countries, what Australian consumers should really be concerned about is goods being sold in Australia at prices far in excess of those available to consumers in other countries. Take the example of Coca-Cola, a commodity that is sold in supermarkets in almost every country throughout the world. One would expect that there would be only marginal differences in the prices of such a popular product in supermarkets throughout the world. In Australia, the 'everyday low price' of a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola currently being offered by the supermarket duopoly is $3.65. Yet a quick check on the internet shows that consumers can buy the same two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola in England for the everyday low price of $2.48. In the USA they pay the equivalent of $1.83. Even in New Zealand, at Woolworths supermarkets the everyday low price is the equivalent of $2.66; in Hong Kong, just $1.65; in South Africa, $2.22; and in Singapore, $2.25—in comparison to Australia's $3.65. It not just Coca-Cola. Compared to countries elsewhere throughout the world, Australian consumers pay grossly excessive prices for many basic supermarket items. So either Australian consumers are the victims of reverse dumping or there is something fundamentally flawed in the competition in our supermarket sector.


The government has failed miserably and repeatedly to protect competition in Australian markets. Before the last election the government made a big song and dance about lack of competition, but all we have seen since it has been elected is a shameful whitewash of the grocery inquiry. Its only initiative has been the high farce of GroceryWatch, the most useless website every created. Now, to show what the government thinks of competition, instead of being a ministry competition has been downgraded to the level of a parliamentary secretary. And this is all before the introduction of a carbon tax, which will push up the price of goods for all in Australia. It is a tax that will place Australian products at a significant competitive disadvantage. The real impact of a domestic carbon tax will be that overseas goods will be shipped into Australia at lower prices than those for which similar goods can be made in Australia. It will damage Australian manufacturers 100 times more than will the problem of dumped goods.


So, while we should be rightly concerned about goods being dumped onto Australian markets below the price at which they are sold in other countries, our real concern should be the fact that Australian consumers are currently paying significantly higher prices than consumers in the rest of the world do. This problem will only be made worse by the carbon tax, irrespective of any changes to our laws on dumping.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (17:13):  The bill before us, the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011, is a really important bill, because it is actually about this Labor government getting serious on dumping and it is about fixing some of the long-term problems and established mechanisms that have been part of the market for quite some time. It is also about making sure we get the balance right between our WTO and free trade obligations, supporting local industry and making sure consumers get a fair price. It is not just about a cheap price; it is about a fair price—an equivalent price.


While I appreciate the comments and the history lesson from the previous member speaking, the member for Hughes, what he said really does not put into context the issues he raised—or dumping issues or the complex and sophisticated nature of what occurs today compared with what used to happen in the 1800s. But I do appreciate what he said. I thought it was quite interesting.


This bill clarifies for the first time when the minister may revoke antidumping measures as a consequence of a particular review. It responds to a very important decision of the full bench of the Federal Court—the Minister of State for Home Affairs v Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd, referred to as the Siam decision. This is really important, because the decision set up a catch-22 mechanism, which is quite dangerous and very problematic. What it meant for the minister was that he was compelled to act in a particular way which would not be in the best interests of this country or of industry in this country. It actually would have led to more frequent revocations and an inconsistency in the way that we dealt with antidumping in this country.


It is good to acknowledge that the opposition support this amendment we are putting forward today. They could not oppose it because it is a really good amendment and it has been really good work by this government in terms of getting this right. We are proposing to insert a new test that will provide that the Customs CEO must recommend the minister revoke measures unless he is satisfied that the removal of those measures would actually lead to continued dumping, further dumping or new dumping. I think it gives the right balance, particularly with reference to dumping, the recurrence of dumping or subsidisation and whether there would be material injury, which the antidumping measures are intended to prevent.


There are a whole range of technical issues all revolving around the capacity for the minister and the CEO of Customs to get the balance right and make those decisions in the right way. For me, it is about making a better and clearer process. It is about getting it right and doing that in the best way that we can. If you have a look at the antidumping measures and the processes attached to them, they are quite involved and quite complex and people would understand why there is the necessity for change. We just need to make it a workable and practical process that recognises the difficulties that Australian industry faces when it is up against actions that are really difficult to prove or interactions at arm's length in another country that might be dumping here in Australia. This amendment will also provide fairness by giving parties advance knowledge of the process for seeking revocation. It will give investigators time to properly consider the issues before reporting back to the minister. One of the big problems has been that not everyone gets the same access to information. That actually causes a problem, particularly for those who are seeking to amend or get right the antidumping measures or countervailing measures.


These amendments are sensible and they take us forward on the really complex matters of antidumping and how Australia plays a fair and robust role in the application of these measures. It is my view, and I would say it is the view of all of us in this place, that Australia has a great track record on these matters. We play a fair game. We seek to trade freely across the globe. We seek to interact with our trading partners on that basis. But the reality is simple—that is, dumping is real and does occur. At a simplistic level, dumping occurs when a foreign company sells products in Australia below the price they sell it for in their own country. It is a bit more involved and complex than that, but as a basic approach that is what is about. Let us understand that this occurs regularly and that it has an enormous impact on our industries, on our jobs here in this country, on our capacity to manufacture, to produce and to keep prices down and on our capacity to make sure that the Australian consumer has the best possible access to good quality products that meet our requirements at good, fair and cheap prices. If we do not get that balance right, it makes it very hard for Australian companies to compete with dumped imports. I hold firmly to the view that Australian companies ought to compete. They ought to innovate and do everything they can. They should not use dumping or antidumping as a surrogate for not fulfilling their part of the bargain, which is that they have to work hard and make sure that they can compete against equal products. If they are being provided fairly and cheaply in this country then we need to be able to compete with that. But as I have said a number of times, we want free trade that is also fair. It has to be a two-way street.


This is not just an Australian problem. Dumping is bad for any nation in which it occurs. When I say it is bad, it can mean the end of an industry altogether, particularly where that industry is a 100 per cent import replacement industry. Whether such an industry survives or not hinges on getting that balance right in terms of antidumping. You cannot come back from that position. Once an industry disappears, you cannot rebuild it. The capital cost and the fear of investment and everything that is attached means that once we lose a particular industry then it is gone and it is gone forever. There is plenty of evidence of that happening in this country. In fact, the Productivity Commission report shows a really interesting graph which they say shows that there is less and less need for antidumping measures because there are fewer and fewer cases. But if you actually track that through history you find that the fewer cases represent less being manufactured in this country. There are fewer cases to compete against because we have less manufacturing. I do not want to see that graph get to a point where there are no cases of antidumping because nothing is produced or manufactured in this country any longer. I think the Productivity Commission actually got that part of it wrong when they looked at what that meant for Australian industry and for competition.


This bill is about strengthening our antidumping legislation. It is about making certain it is fair, free trade that we are dealing with. It is about making clear, for all affected parties, the process to be followed in giving all affected parties more opportunities to have their voices heard when a review does occur. Dumping is complex. It is complex in a whole range of areas. It is complex because not everyone plays by the same rules and in the way they apply those rules. For example, Australia does recognise China as a market economy, whereas the US, Canada and the EU do not. That sets up a whole range of circumstances which make it much more complex for the Australian market and manufacturing and industry in Australia. 


Australia must, under the rules, use Chinese domestic prices when establishing whether dumping is occurring. All other information available to make sure that dumping does not occur does not necessarily play a role, which makes it very complex in determining whether dumping is or is not occurring and, for that matter, whether there is material injury to a particular organisation or company or the wider market. As other countries do not recognise China as a market economy they use a proxy or a surrogate price, which can often be a more representative value of the cost in-country compared to the cost in our own market. Because of this, Australia often becomes the target market for dumped products, and this has been evidenced by a whole range of recent incidents. Basically, we are seen as a soft touch in a whole range of other areas. 


I know the Senate economics committee is currently considering a separate bill sponsored by Senator Xenophon, which is aimed at strengthening antidumping provisions. While there may be some debate about all of the terms and what those provisions might be, I broadly support what Senator Xenophon is trying to achieve and I appreciate the work that he has done with this bill. I look forward to reading the report by the Senate economics committee on this legislation. 


The reality is that we can do more to strengthen our antidumping legislation while still meeting our WTO obligations, because of the flexibility and judgment that is allowed by the current regulations to respond to genuine cases. We need to make sure that we get that right. 


I have been saying, 'Let's do the right thing by industry. Let's do the right thing in terms of consumers as well, to make sure they have access to good-quality and cheap products.' But let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Let us not kill our industries on the basis of inflexibility in terms of our regulations. There is plenty of evidence to support that case. As one submission to the committee points out:


The current provisions within the antidumping system, for example tariff measures, that may be applied to international companies' exports into Australia are less than those which would apply if the same anticompetitive and predatory pricing activities were undertaking in Australia between Australian domiciled companies—for example, as contained within the Trade Practices Act or the ACCC regulations.


To put it simply, we are harder on our own than we are on foreign imports. 


I also want to take this opportunity to look at the real impact of dumping by bringing some other examples to the table. I want to mention the very good and serious work and the good campaign that is being carried out at the moment by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the Australian Workers Union to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. It is a really good submission, which really takes this issue seriously because it affects so many workers and so many people across industry. And it will have a long-term affect on consumers in this country when certain industries are no longer with us.


In particular I want to raise the issue of Capital Limited, which over the past 10 years has been competing against Chinese imports, particularly on subsidised aluminium extrusions, which have taken a substantial market share in Australia. Capital, like many other businesses, are competing internationally. They are competing globally. They produce a fantastic local product but find it very difficult to compete where there are cases of dumping.


The reality is that we did find dumping. As a result of that dumping occurring, action has been taken. Unfortunately, in most cases, that action took place way too slowly and way too late. The damage has already been done or the size of the antidumping measure or countervailing measure was just too small. There are also the cases of Carter Holt Harvey Woodproducts, Big River Timbers and Boral in the Australian plywood production market, which has contracted by more than half since 2000. Dumping was also identified in that market, and measures were put in place against imports from China, Malaysia, Chile and Brazil. The reason I mention this is to make the point that this is real stuff that happens every single day. We need to ensure that our antidumping measures are responsive to what actually happens in the marketplace—and that is harder to prove. I am talking about situations where countries provide free products or do not act at arm's length in their in-country transactions, and that makes it very difficult for Australia to compete.


This is not a question of protectionism versus free trade; it is much more complex than that. I think we all agree that, being a globalised country which has formed the basis of its wealth creation on trade, we believe in free trade and that we are a robust trading nation. But trade has to be fair; we cannot be the soft touch—the patsy—allowing the dumping of products in this country. There are plenty of examples of good, strong manufacturing—globally competitive manufacturing—in this country having been put out of business because of cheap imports.


I am all for consumers having access to really good, cheap products; I have spoken on this in the House before. I do not mind cheap imported cars—I do not care how cheap they get—but I think there needs to be a fairness about the way it is done. We cannot just be used as a dumping ground for other people's exports and prop up their industries while ours suffer as a consequence. I think we need to get that right.


I believe very strongly that this country and our response ought to be as courageous in supporting industry and jobs and fair trade as we are in supporting free trade globally, free trade agreements and World Trade Organisation rules. I commend the bill to the House.

We are dealing with a bill, the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011, to introduce procedural requirements in order for the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to recommend, and for the minister to declare, that antidumping measures be revoked at the conclusion of the review and to insert a legislative test outlining when the CEO may recommend that the minister revoke antidumping measures. The position is that it is a fairly uncontroversial bill. There is no need for me to say much more, because I think have summarised it, and the next speaker has arrived.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2011-05-24,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (17:28):  I welcome the opportunity to debate the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011. My electorate of Tangney has two strong industrial manufacturing regions: Canning Vale and Myaree. Many residents of my electorate are employed in each of these regions. As well as heavy industry and manufacturing, Canning Vale especially—but also Myaree—has small- to medium- sized enterprises and many mum-and-dad industries. Why is strengthening antidumping laws important? 


Recently a number of business owners and operators have approached my office to discuss how the flood of cheap products and materials into the market is affecting the competitiveness of their businesses. These local businesspeople feel cheap imports are undermining their profitability and in some cases their very survival. Each and every individual felt they could identify a case of dumping that was directly responsible for hurting their business and few felt they would get fair judgment of their case under current antidumping laws. All agreed that stronger and more flexible antidumping laws are a welcome measure for business in Tangney.


Complaints from local businesses in my electorate demonstrate that the present system is too cumbersome and that it places the onus of proof on domestic business rather than on their competitors. Other complaints are that it applies retrospectively, often after irreversible damage has already been done, and that it is generally prohibitively expensive to access. Make no mistake: while the businesses in my electorate thrive and encourage open and free trade, a foreign manufacturer or producer exporting product into Australia below the price it charges in its home market is the unfair predatory pricing that dumping creates. As many of Tangney's businesses are trade and import exposed small- to medium- sized enterprises, I am certain many more businesses than have come to see me are directly affected by dumping, with little recourse.


Dumping is a modern form of protectionism with many international trade experts citing it as the most serious impediment to international trade. Many countries, especially in the EU, have over the past 20 to 30 years increasingly turned to dumping in order to offer protection to import-competing industries. Yet, while Australia's industrial products market is one of the most open markets in the world, the government only pursues a small number of dumping cases. Antidumping measures allow our government to apply for countervailing duties on goods that have been subsidised by the government of the country of export. Where dumping or subsidisation results in material injury to local industry, antidumping or countervailing duties can be applied. To demonstrate its seriousness, since 1980 GATT and WTO members have filed more complaints under the international anti-dumping statute than under all other trade laws combined. Further, more antidumping duties are now levied in any one year worldwide than were levied in the entire period 1947-1970.


Dumping hurts the competitiveness of businesses in my electorate and I welcome these changes. From an international law perspective we must be aware that, while the Australian antidumping system is based on agreed WTO rules and procedures, these measures only benefit a small number of import-competing firms while imposing greater costs on the rest of the economy. In short, international trade policy has little effect on antidumping legislation. Foreign industry can almost guarantee it will not be subject to antidumping tariffs if it charges high enough prices in its export markets. Domestic industry might resist lowering its prices because doing so improves its chances of winning an antidumping case. The same domestic industry might also lay off more workers than expected because doing so indicates injury. My point is, the intricacies of antidumping measures are immense and that is why the Productivity Commission was asked to investigate our current regime in 2009.


The Productivity Commission's report looked at some of the ways the current antidumping laws impact on the wider economy, with certain antidumping measures too easily becoming akin to long-term protection measures or becoming outdated in the face of changing market circumstances. The task force will examine the problems with the current regime with the aim of developing substantive policy designed to stop foreign companies dumping cheap products on Australian markets. The task force honours a coalition election commitment to ensure that Australian manufacturers' products are not undercut by imported or subsidised products or by products that do not comply with appropriate quality standards. Again, as the federal member of an electorate with a heavy import orientated sector, I am proud to say the coalition is standing up for local industry. The establishment of this task force also acknowledges the widespread call from industry groups for improved access to the current antidumping system. Worldwide dumping concerns are not new, and Australia is playing catch-up to the European Union, Japan and the United States. This coalition task force represents the most serious attempt to remedy what is a huge issue for industry in Tangney.


I noticed the budget contained no new money to combat dumping, as was pointed out by the Australian Industry Group CEO, Heather Ridout. If the Labor Party is serious about antidumping measures it should listen to AWU secretary Paul Howes, who has called on his members to write to their local member about dumping. I welcome Mr Howe's sentiment, but, given his influence in the Labor Party, I wonder why he is putting the onus on his members to force change. He also has not committed his union to the measures in this bill.


Questions I believe we need to address include whether antidumping action should be available in response to imports that only threaten to cause material injury to an industry, the period Customs have to investigate cases, and whether the minister should be expected to take action where dumping is found to exist.


Competition is good for consumers and drives business innovation. But I am not confident this bill amends all the problems with the existing scheme. Opposition leader Tony Abbott has highlighted two high-profile examples of dumping. In 2008 and last year we saw a situation where toilet paper from overseas was coming into this country at up to 45 per cent below cost. Initially, antidumping action was taken, but then the government failed to proceed with the case. Another situation saw biodiesel coming into this country at, it is believed, 40 per cent below cost. A Customs report highlighting this dumping case has been sitting on the minister's desk since late last year. I understand no action has been taken.


I do not think any Australian manufacturer objects to strong competition, but it has to be fair competition—and when you have materials coming into this country well below the cost of manufacture and transport that is dumping. Australia must make sure that our manufacturing industries and producers are not needlessly put at risk by an ineffective antidumping regime. Free trade requires a level playing field, again something I am not confident this bill provides. Local business in Tangney is not looking for a handout or a hand-up, simply the freedoms needed to compete in the local market. I do not think this bill goes far enough to address dumping, but it is a start.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (17:39):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas. Before I start my discussion of the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011 I will just inform you that we had the Paniyiri Festival in Brisbane on the weekend and your name was mentioned, and I did mention you in my speech to the crowd—you and Maria Vamvakinou rated a mention.


I rise to speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011. As we have heard from other speakers, Australian manufacturers have been doing it tough lately. They have been copping it from all sides. We see the drop in demand for manufacturing exports as a result of the global financial crisis and flowing on from that the rising dollar making it harder for our manufacturers to compete because our wages and costs are that little bit higher. In my electorate of Moreton, manufacturers are just starting to get back on their feet after the January floods wiped out much of our industrial zones in Rocklea, Archerfield and Acacia Ridge and even in patches of my home suburb of Moorooka. Over 1,000 businesses had water over the floorboards and many of those were manufacturing businesses. Obviously it is relatively easy to move transport or even to move stock to higher parts with forklifts and the like but with some of the heavy engineering equipment it is different. There was a sad story of the business I visited with the Prime Minister and they had a $2 million piece of engineering equipment that they just could not physically move, even though they knew the waters were coming. Even with insurance paying, it takes six months or a year to bring out something like that from Germany as a replacement piece of equipment. So manufacturers in my patch and around Australia are doing it tough.


As this legislation has indicated, they are also particularly under threat from overseas firms who dump their products in the Australian market at short-term lower prices that undercut and damage Australian manufacturers. Previous speakers mentioned lots of examples but the most appropriate one when we are talking about dumping was the toilet paper that had been on the market at 40 per cent below the cost. I have spoken to unions about this, and particularly unions such as the AMWU, who say this has impacted particularly on the steel, aluminium, paper and paper products industries, and some of those are in my electorate.


By dumping products on the Australian market, overseas manufacturers are trying to gain market share and put Australian manufacturers out of business. Once they achieve this and claim the market share, they then bump the prices back up, and obviously in the long run Australian consumers lose out. Dumping presents a clear and present danger to Australian firms and Australian manufacturing employees. I would stack our Australian companies up against any manufacturer in the world. We can match them in terms of innovation and in terms of the sweat of employees. However, the reality is that dumping is an extra danger for them. The last thing our manufacturers need is to be undercut by overseas firms, especially those that have been propped up artificially by foreign government money. What we obviously need is a level playing field and that Australian can-do attitude and Australian initiative can come to the fore. It does Australia no good in the long run if our manufacturers are forced to shut down, to put their employees out of work merely to make way for cheaper overseas products in the short term, especially, as I said, if the prices go up once the Australian company is out of business. It is quite simple, really: we make it here or jobs disappear. That is why we need strong and effective antidumping measures in place. Obviously some people rather simplistically say that we can just impose duties on imports to get them back to a fair value with local products. But the Australian Labor Party see Australia as fundamentally a nation that believes in free trade, and that the tit-for-tat duties and levies help nobody in the long run. That way trading madness lies. This bill is urgently required to overcome the unintended consequences that have arisen as a result of the Federal Court decision in the Siam Polyethylene case. The court determined that, in the absence of a legislative test to determine an application to revoke dumping measures, the minister must revoke measures unless the dumping would cause material injury to the Australian industry. The problem with this ruling is that where dumping measures are in place there should be no material injury to Australian industry. Therefore, this commonsense bill before the chamber amends the Customs Act 1901 to clarify the circumstances in which the minister may revoke antidumping measures in light of a review of such measures. It introduces a new test where the Customs CEO must recommend that the minister revoke measures unless satisfied that the removal of the measures would lead, or be likely to lead, to a continuation of dumping and the material injury that the antidumping measures are intended to prevent.


As I said from the outset, Australian manufacturers and their employees face many threats. Who would have thought back in your younger days, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you might have been travelling around Europe, that we would have the dollar at $US1.05 or US$1.06. When I was backpacking in Europe in 1988 it was completely different. You used to have to work for a month just to be able to buy beer or something like that. Now the dollar has completely changed. While it is good if you are going on a holiday overseas or buying stuff from overseas on the web, it does not help our manufacturers or even our farmers or our miners in certain circumstances. Dumping is only one of the challenges that we face but it is a very significant threat to the manufacturing industry. That is the industry I am particularly keen to make sure that we look after as much as possible. There are other challenges of markets being rattled by the global financial crisis and, in my local area, the flood damaging so many businesses. Also we have got those circumstances where, since the floods and cyclones and the GFC, I think it is true that many Australians are knocking off their debt, which is a good thing; we see credit card debt coming down. But the problem for retailers, part of the chain that manufacturers supply to, is that people are not digging into their wallets and their pockets to spend money, which is a problem for many of our retailers. The amendments in this bill are separate to the government's consideration of the Productivity Commission's recommendations. That work is still ongoing but these amendments are urgently required in response to the Federal Court decision.


I have not had a tour of the factory yet but I have certainly had a meeting with one of the manufacturers in my electorate that makes doors. I cannot remember the name of the factory and I do apologise, but I have had a couple of meetings with them. Many of the doors in new estates come from this factory in Rocklea, but they were unfairly targeted, I would suggest, by something as close to dumping as you would get from the Thai industry. But for the intervention of the minister, it would have meant that this factory would have closed down and its jobs would have gone and so too the quite significant skills associated with carpenters, joiners, fitters and turners and the like to make these doors that then go out into people's homes. It is the case when something like this happens that you do not just set up a door assembly plant overnight; it is expensive equipment and costs a lot of money. If they are not able to turn over enough, Australian wages being what they are, it is hard to keep workers at a factory if they are not selling enough doors. We have already got enough problems with building downturns in Queensland at the moment and there is not a lot of money flying around. There will be some renovations that come with the flood recovery effort, but too many people in my electorate are having trouble waiting for the insurance companies to make a decision one way or the other. At least if they get a no they can then go off to the Queensland Premier's Flood Appeal and maybe get some money through there. If they get a yes then hopefully there will be more doors made from the factory in my electorate.


It has always been the way of the modern Labor Party that we need Australia to be much more than something that sells materials overseas that come back to us as manufactured products. We believe in skills, the high road. We believe in Australia being much more than just a quarry and a farm. We need to turn those things that we dig out of the ground into products that we can then send around the world, which is good for our balance of trade and is good not just in terms of skills but in terms of defence, where you need to have certain skills. I am sure that as a South Australian MP, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, you are aware of the important role that the car industry plays in terms of making sure there are sufficient skills that can then lead on to defence type skills. That is the smart road, the high road that the Labor Party believes Australia should go down. That is why the NBN is such a priority for us. We believe in services that can be sold around the world. I remember during the election campaign those on the opposite side laughing and asking how we could become a focus for money, banking services and the like. But now look at what we are doing in terms of the funds that have been administered and in terms of superannuation. Places like Sydney, and hopefully Brisbane as well, will have a rightful role in showing the rest of the world that we can look after and provide services to the banking industry and the like.


Before becoming a lawyer my background was in education. We have such a great story to tell in providing a great example around the world of how we educate people, not only at the school level but also at the university level and in between, in the TAFE sector. Australia has that proud role, going back to the Colombo Plan. So often we have been able to provide a great education to people who then go back around the world. We have some of the best universities in the world; certainly in my electorate of Moreton, Griffith University is well known throughout the world as a great leader in innovations in health and the environment. I commend the bill to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Moreton for his assistance in this rearrangement.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (17:51):  I also thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, for filling in because of the rearrangements of speakers we have had up here. I rise in support of the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2011. Before I speak about the changes the bill will make I will make a few observations to relay to the House concerns that are repeatedly expressed in my electorate office by members of the Hindmarsh constituency and community and, of course, by the wider population. These concerns have as their route insecurity stemming from a dynamic, competitive global economy and the continual shifting we have seen in the last 20 or 30 years of global capital and manufacturing from country to country and region to region.


Just looking at the electorate of Hindmarsh I can name half a dozen businesses—manufacturing industries—that were there but are no longer there. They have disappeared over the last 20-odd years. We had a great employer, Clarks shoes, in the electorate, in the suburb of Marleston. They moved offshore about 10 years ago. Approximately 300 people worked in that particular factory. We also had Griffin Press, who used to print all the Mills and Boon novels—which is a little hidden secret in Adelaide—for the Asian market. They have now moved their printing overseas as well—another 200 jobs there.


So we have seen a huge shift of global capital and manufacturing moved from country to country and region to region over the last couple of decades. But people have an insecurity from this changing profitability of domestic and local production; the questionable sustainability of old, long-held jobs, the divergence of which industries we have and what we consider normal and good and, ultimately, insecurity breeding fear of change and loss, which is often a consequence of change.


Our community has inferred over many years what Australian industry is—what our industrial landscape should consist of and what jobs should be expected to remain open to successive generations. In South Australia, as we heard earlier, we have the car manufacturing industry, which has employed thousands of people over the years. In South Australia we saw Mitsubishi close down a few years ago with the loss of 1,000-odd jobs. If we have not imported a pest or disease with foreign apples or pears for a certain period of time, should we discard our quarantine and inspection services? Certainly not. The purpose of Australian law is not only to stop a proscribed activity already commenced but to prevent a proscribed activity, the threat of which hangs over us waiting for an opportunity.


The law we address here today is that of the Customs Act 1901, which became the unwitting victim of our legal system. The Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, the Hon. Brendan O'Connor, explained in his second reading speech on the bill the unfortunate situation that arose from the judgment of the full Federal Court last year. We cannot have a situation in which a law devised for the proper implementation and enforcement of trade rules is undermined or removed from potential application simply because there has been no unlawful activity in the recent past. We have the law not only to enforce proper behaviour when a party is tempted to cross the line but to establish acceptable behaviour and to proclaim what is right and what will not be tolerated. So I would fully expect all members and senators to get behind the government on this matter and to support the community in its concern for the maintenance of fair trade and antidumping rules within our states and cities and within our wider jurisdiction.


In South Australia, an antidumping case recently took place involving one of the big toilet paper manufacturers in the south-east. The company bringing the products in was found to be dumping. That finding was appealed and the case was upheld. The problem is that we have many cases around the country similar to that one that, for whatever reason, are extremely difficult to prosecute. We need good laws for the protection of our businesses and all the manufacturers to ensure that we keep those very important jobs in our cities, in our electorates and in our wonderful country.


I could not go on without mentioning a particular manufacturer in my electorate, Rossiters Boots. They have been manufacturing boots there for over 100 years now. Through difficult circumstances and difficult times when manufacturing is becoming unprofitable, Dean Rossiter, the owner of Rossiters Boots is determinedly persisting and continues to produce boots in the suburb of Hilton in my electorate. I have had discussions with him over the years. It would be very easy for him to get up and move overseas, as other shoe companies have done in the past. But he is persisting and persevering, employing people locally and trying to do the best that he possibly can. In fact, in some cases, he has second and third generation people working in the shoe factory where their grandfathers and their parents were employed. They produce a very good shoe, a great product.


A few months ago, I was in Bali. We saw massive shoe production factories everywhere. People were working for $70 a week. You can see how difficult it is to compete with those lower wages in some of those countries, where these same products are being made. You can also see the temptation of those particular companies overseas to come into our market. They know that they can sell the product cheaper. They can also dump the product on the market, bringing the prices artificially low and therefore sending businesses out of business.


I am very pleased that this bill has been introduced. It will amend certain provisions of the Customs Act. The bill responds to, as I said, a decision last year by the full Federal Court, which considered the review provisions and, in particular, the test for determining whether antidumping measures should be revoked. The proposed amendments in this bill insert a new test which will provide that the Customs CEO must recommend that the minister revoke measures unless satisfied that the removal of the measures would lead, or be likely to lead to a continuation of, or recurrence of the dumping and the material injury that the antidumping measures are intended to prevent. It is a clear test which will avert the unnecessary revocation of effective antidumping measures.


The government is committed to its antidumping system. These amendments will ensure that where measures have been put in place to address injury faced by Australian industry as a result of unfair trading practices that those measures remain effective.


As I said earlier, I would fully expect all members in this place to get behind this bill, to support the community in its concern for the maintenance of fair trade and antidumping rules within our jurisdiction and support the government's bill. I commend the bill to the House.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (18:06):  These proposed amendments to the Customs Act seek to clarify the circumstances under which dumping measures should be revoked. These amendments are sought to address the unintended consequences of a decision of the full Federal Court–the Siam decision–which formulated a test for revocation that will lead to outcomes inconsistent with the objectives of the antidumping system.


As a result of the full Federal Court's decision in Siam, it is much more likely that a finding of no dumping or no injury during a review period will lead to revocation. This outcome would be inconsistent with the objects of the antidumping system. The review provisions therefore need to be urgently amended to clarify the revocation test. These amendments would clarify that the Customs CEO may only examine whether the measures should be revoked where affected parties provide sufficient evidence in the approved form that there are reasonable grounds for asserting that the measure is no longer warranted, or where the minister requests such a review.


The amendments would also insert an express revocation test. Once the evidentiary requirements for initiating a revocation review have been met and a revocation review has been notified the CEO must recommend that the minister revoke measures unless satisfied that the removal of the measures would lead, or be likely to lead, to a continuation of, or a recurrence of, the dumping or subsidisation and the material injury that the antidumping measures are intended to prevent.


It is imperative that the legislation governing reviews of antidumping and countervailing measures is amended in order to minimise the number of existing measures that are revoked which would not otherwise be revoked under the proposed changes that clarify and restore the intended operation of the review provisions.


I believe that it is very timely that the issue of antidumping measures is before the House. I believe it is a very important and serious issue, especially at a time when Australian exporting and import-competing firms are struggling under the difficulties of the high Australian dollar. The Australian Workers Union has launched a campaign to raise worker and community awareness about the damage that illegal dumping is doing to Australia's manufacturing industry. The AWU says that there has been dumping of a wide range of finished goods competing with Australian producers. It says that products like solar panels, rail track, wind towers, mining infrastructure equipment, steel frames et cetera are being produced overseas, primarily by China, and dumped on the Australian market. The AWU has resolved to call on the federal government to establish an independent commission to investigate dumping allegations and to legislate to enable affected groups and unions to ask for investigations to be undertaken by this body.


The union has warned that the sustainability of Australia's manufacturing sector is under threat, and has also called on the Australian government to help local industry by adopting a strict rule-of-law approach to illegal trade practices consistent with our WTO entitlements. The AWU has informed a Senate enquiry that Australia's commitment to a global free-trade regime should be on the basis that all our trading partners consistently apply World Trade Organisation trade laws and regulations. As the AWU has stated, it is committed to free trade. Over the last 30 years, coinciding with the reforming Hawke-Keating governments, this union has played its part in ensuring the benefits of trade liberalisation. This is shared by AWU members—along with the nation as a whole—in increased investment, job creation and national income. The benefits of free trade are not in doubt. Reciprocity of access to foreign markets has also been a key driver to enhancing the competitiveness of many of the trade exposed industries represented by the AWU including, steel, aluminium, plastics, petrochemical, agribusiness and horticultural industries.


However, just as with other activities in the marketplace, rules about free trade should apply, and trade on any terms does not constitute free trade. Unfortunately, in Australia there is a lack of regulatory action and oversight, which means Australian companies are ripe for exploitative trade practices aimed at dominating local markets through a range of subsidies and dumping strategies.


In a submission to the same Senate inquiry, the AWU spoke of its national Don't Dump on Australia campaign, which was launched earlier this year. In the submission the AWU outlined the following priorities to address product dumping: first, a properly resourced and independent antidumping agency responding proactively to dumping and subsidy complaints; second, improving the culture of Customs and compliance with Customs decisions; third, that Chinese exports by state owned enterprises should be treated like other state owned enterprises in other developed countries, notwithstanding China's market economy status; fourth, reflecting WTO rights in full in Australia's antidumping and countervailing system as trade defences rather than industry protection; fifth, amending the Customs Act to acknowledge that unions should have the right to petition for investigations; and, finally, strong local content requirements. Stronger local content requirements would serve to limit subsidised imports taking market share from local suppliers.


I support the AWU campaign. I believe that national self-sufficiency is important and I want Australia to continue to have a vibrant manufacturing industry. It is therefore important that our 'level playing fields' are genuinely level.


The fate of Australian workers in trade exposed industries rests with the creation and enforcement in Australia of a strong antidumping regime in order that nations do not take advantage of our generosity of spirit in trade matters. Many governments and in particular the Chinese government intervene directly and extensively in their economy to benefit their own industries. According to the WTO rules, however, WTO members including China can only do this in a manner which does not cause or threaten to cause injury to foreign suppliers of like goods. Of all the WTO members, China faces the most antidumping actions because of dumping of product below what is regarded as normal value and for recourse to export subsidies. There are two main ways Australian manufacturers of like goods are injured or threatened with injury by Chinese exporters assisted through government policies: first, by dumping and, second, by industry subsidies. The AWU submission says:


There is widespread evidence that China is engaging in a range of illegal practices to stimulate and protect its domestic producers of green technology, from wind and solar energy products to advanced batteries and energy-efficient vehicles.


These practices are enabling China to emerge as a dominant supplier of certain green technologies. They also have facilitated the transfer of manufacturing and research and development investment into China, costing otherwise efficient Australian companies and workers the green profits and high-skilled jobs of the future. Many of these practices are direct violations of the obligations China undertook when it joined the World Trade organisation.


The Australian Workers Union wants the federal government to understand that manufacturing workers take the brunt of deliberate Chinese government policies are not based on supply and demand, not based on WTO rules, but rather on a model of state capitalism aimed at winning dominant market share, by subsidising below the normal costs of production and giving other assistance at the expense of international competitors. 


Our manufacturers should be well placed to exploit the economic opportunities available from the growing clean energy global economy. In order for Australia to do this, though, we must ensure that we have an equal opportunity to compete where all nations observe the global free trade rules. Sadly, our manufacturers are not competing on a level playing field with Chinese competitors. Chinese competitors can offer dump prices in Australia, not because they are better at making certain products than Australia but because their state owned or state linked enterprises sell the inputs to their industries at less than the cost that it takes to produce them or their normal cost of production. China manages its exchange rate, and the yuan is undervalued by approximately 20 per cent to 40 per cent, affording yet another advantage. Many of the dumping and subsidy practices of the Chinese have been challenged by other jurisdictions, including the US, Canada and the European Union. The WTO has defended their right to take action, because these practices clearly disadvantage industries and workers.


In recent months, both the United States and Canada have begun to adopt a more aggressive position on China's disregard for WTO rules. If they can act against dumped products then Australia should be able to follow that lead. As the AWU has pointed out, we should not worry about claims that a strong antidumping regime is simply a new form of protectionism threatening free trade. Free trade is in reality being threatened by China's flouting of the WTO rules. If we do not act now then products that once were dumped in the US and Canadian markets will be redirected to naive Australia and we will suffer even more. China needs to abide by the international rules governing trade, investment and labour standards. To allow them to do otherwise would be to allow them to play us for economic mugs. As the Australian scholar Christian Jack said, accommodation of China does not necessitate abandonment of Australia's core values. Australia must enforce its right to apply effective antidumping and countervailing measures to prevent injury and loss to Australian industry and workers. I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2011-05-24,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (19:33):  I rise tonight to pay tribute to Ralph James Dunnet Hunt, who was born at Narrabri on 31 March 1928 into a long-established grazing family.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  He didn't have a good start then, did he?




Mr NEVILLE:
  No, he did not—he started before the Depression and probably saw a few along the way. Ralph's interest in politics was evidently fostered around the kitchen table, with his father, Claude, being one of the central characters in the formation of the Australian Country Party in northern New South Wales. His initial foray into party politics was during his school years, when he boarded at the Scots College in Sydney. It prompted him to join the then fledgling Liberal Party. But, on his return home, a Country Party representative visited the family farm to encourage Ralph's dad to pull together a local branch. Fortuitously, Claude suggested that Ralph would be just the man for the job, and so began a lifelong commitment to the party. He would have been in his early 20s at that time. Ralph joined the party in 1950 and was on the Central Council of the Country Party of Australia, New South Wales, by 1953. In the same year, he took the chairman's role in the Gwydir Federal Electorate Council—the body for the federal seat. It was a position he held until 1969. Between 1956 and 1968 he served his local community as councillor on the Boomi Shire Council and he also held the position of vice-president of the council between 1962 and 1968. About the same time, between 1964 and 1969, Ralph served as the New South Wales party chairman, and in 1968 and 1969 he served as the federal party chairman. It is unusual for someone to hold those two roles simultaneously. 


Also during this time as New South Wales party chairman, he got right behind the idea of establishing the youth wing of the party and worked hard to see it come to fruition. In 1965 the Young Country Party was formed in New South Wales. This was a few years after it had been formed in southern Queensland. In his role as executor of the organisation of the party, you would think that he had taken on enough roles, but in 1969 he contested the by-election for the seat of Gwydir. He won the seat and held it for the next 20 years, until his retirement in 1989. 


He was initially appointed Minister for the Interior in the Gorton-Anthony ministry in February 1971 and held that position until the defeat of the government in 1972, with the start of the Whitlam era. That was the period in which I knew him well in a number of capacities. I was active in the Young Country Party and in 1969 I was actually its state president in Queensland. We were agitating to get a seat on the federal council of the party because we knew the youth were going to have to have a voice in the party. To have a role in the decision making, they had to have a voice. So I took off for the federal council meeting as an observer in 1969. I remember typing up the submission in what is now the Hyatt. It was quite an experience for me because, in those days, the giants of the party were Charles Cutler, the education minister and Deputy Premier of New South Wales, and John McEwen—Black Jack McEwen. They were heady days. In fact, I remember the two of them having a fight at that meeting—which Ralph was chairing, of course, as the federal president—about the first money that was going into high school science blocks and libraries. It was the first time this money was moving into the state high school system. I remember the two of them having a blazing row, but when it really got down to their respective arguments, it was all about whether the corridors of the Dubbo High School needed to be 4-foot six or 4-foot nine wide. It was a very interesting introduction to politics under his chairmanship. 


At that meeting Ralph said, 'Look, Paul, you can't move that motion because you're not yet a member of the council.' I was feeling quite despondent, having come all that way to present the case. But Kevin Lyons, who was the Deputy Premier of Tasmania and a member of the Centre Party, as they called the Country Party in Tasmania, said to Ralph, 'No, I'll move it.' So I got my day in court, so to speak, to argue the case for the youth party to have a seat on the council. I presented the case but I did not win it. Nevertheless, Ralph was a very fair man. He certainly nurtured a youth movement in politics, initially in New South Wales and then throughout the Commonwealth.


I grew to know him at the time he became minister and at the various state and federal conferences we attended. The second capacity in which I met him was in my home town of Bundaberg. We were going through a bad economic downturn, and it was decided to form a development board—but not one of these flash-in-the-pan ones where you raise a bit of money on the spur of the moment at a meeting one night, you have spent it the next year and then it all fizzles out the year after. In fact, we engaged someone that honourable members would be familiar with, Everald Compton, who in those days had Compton and Associates, which was a fundraising organisation. We decided that, if we were going to have a development board, it was going to be the best in Queensland, so we decided we would raise the money for the first five years so there would be no doubt that the thing would get off to a flying start. But we needed a big launch pad. We needed to impress on the local district how important this new board would be. So we put it to Ralph Hunt, who was the Minister for the Interior at the time; we asked whether he would come up and launch it, and indeed he did. It had the required effect: hundreds of people came on board and it was a model among development boards for many years to come.


Returning to his career, 1972 to 1975 was the Whitlam era, and that was a tough time for all those Country Party members. But, at the end of that period, Malcolm Fraser and Doug Anthony came to office in 1975, and they appointed Ralph Hunt to be Minister for Health. Fraser said to him, 'I've got a good one for you, Ralph: Health and Medibank.' Ralph responded by saying he had never made a speech in parliament on either of those two subjects. 'Good,' replied Fraser. 'Then they can't quote anything back to you.' In December 1979 he was made Minister for Transport, and his portfolio was expanded in 1982 to make him Minister for Transport and Construction. Ralph Hunt oversaw the massive highway development under the famous 3c-per-litre levy on all vehicle fuels. He became deputy leader of the party between 1984 and 1987 and retired from parliament in 1989.


At that point, you would think, Mr Deputy Speaker, he would probably have had enough. He had worked on the land, he had worked in his local council, he had worked in the administration of the party, he had worked in parliament and he had been a minister. You would think he would want to walk away; he had done his bit. I am sure we see in all three major parties in this parliament that there are some people who enjoy the fruits of being part of a party and then, when they come to retirement, they walk away, not doing anything to enhance the role of those who follow them. But not so with Ralph Hunt. His commitment to the party went on, and he served as federal treasurer of the party from 1987 to the year 2000. He was instrumental in the development of our federal secretariat, John McEwen House, and that was at the time a very risky financial move. Ralph and a handful of people really steered the party through that very important phase, which gave the National Party—no longer the Country Party by that stage—a very fine national headquarters.


In 1990 Ralph was made an officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of his work in the parliament. Last year, after 60 years of service, at our federal conference we awarded him a rare honour, the Earle Page Medal for Meritorious Service. The Nationals federal president, John Tanner, paid tribute to Ralph's work and legacy over recent days, saying that he would 'be remembered as a tireless servant of the people of regional Australia and a champion of the Nationals'. I can echo those sentiments, because I think a man's worth cannot be gauged just by dates and titles he has held. Ralph was much more than that. He was a farmer. He was a worker. He was a much-loved family man, a good husband to Mim—whom he married in 1953—and a wonderful father to his three children. On behalf of my family, my colleagues and the party itself I offer my sincere condolences to Ralph's family and hope they realise the incredible impact he had. He was more than just a participant; he was a champion, and I salute him.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (19:44):  It is indeed a great honour for me to be speaking here tonight on this condolence motion in memory of the life of the Hon. Ralph Hunt. I will not go into the detail in the House. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition very eloquently went through Ralph's accomplishments, and my colleague the member for Hinkler has done a very fine job of that. 


Ralph Hunt represented the seat of Gwydir, which was abolished in 2007. The former seat of Gwydir fits wholly and solely inside the seat of Parkes, so I am now representing the same area of New South Wales that Ralph did. My recollections of my earlier years are entirely of Ralph Hunt being the member for 20 years, from my time in primary school until the first time I ever voted in a federal election. I am proud to say that I voted for Ralph Hunt. Following Ralph Hunt and his successor John Anderson in this place means that sometimes I have to pinch myself to realise I am in the role that they had. My memory of Ralph Hunt from when I was growing up was of someone who was very much respected, someone who was considered a true champion for the area that he represented. To find myself in that same position is a very humbling experience.


Ralph's road to federal parliament was not dissimilar to my own. He started off his public life as a councillor of Boomi Shire Council and he was also the chairman of the Gwydir Electorate Council. I am very proud to say that I was also a shire councillor and chairman of the Gwydir Electorate Council before I came to this place. Ralph was very much loved and adored by nearly everyone he represented, except probably the owners of hire car companies. He had a fearsome reputation of being a very fast driver on what can only be described as substandard roads. I know that when Ralph retired the hire car firm in Moree heaved a sigh of relief that he would no longer be knocking their vehicles around to the extent that he had. Ralph Hunt spent a large part of his life living on the farm property Dunumbral, which is between Lightning Ridge and Collarenebri and quite an isolated place. To represent an area the size that he did pre mobile phones, pre internet and pre computers was a remarkable achievement. To be the deputy leader of a party and a cabinet minister from a property at Collarenebri was a remarkable achievement.


Ralph rose to great heights in this place, being a minister in two different governments. He was also a great champion of the Country Party and later the National Party and a very much loved member of the north-west of New South Wales. I would like to express my sincere condolences to Mim and Ralph's family, including Ralph's brother John, who now lives at Narrabri. I know him quite well. As the current member for Parkes, formerly Gwydir, I would like to pay my respects.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2011-05-24,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (19:49):  Anybody who does not like the fact that I am in parliament or wishes that I were not here will need to blame Ralph Hunt. I knew Ralph Hunt, but I did not know him at all well until after he had left politics, and then I got to know him very well indeed. Ralph was somebody who put his money where his mouth was. After 20 years in politics and, as you have heard from other people, a very full life otherwise in local government and various other things, Ralph did a lot of things for which he got no recompense, and probably no recognition, but he did them because he believed that he should. When Ian Causley, a former member of the federal parliament, was Minister for Lands in New South Wales back in the early 1990s he formed the Western Lands Advisory Board, and he asked Ralph to chair it. Ralph did that and I was one of the first members on it. For the next few years I got to know an absolute gentleman very well.


As my leader, the member for Wide Bay, said yesterday during the condolence motion, Ralph was one of nature's gentlemen. He was a gentleman in politics. He was very tough but he was a gentleman at all times. He just believed that he had a duty to help agriculture and he had a duty to help people. He chaired a western lands board but he had never owned land in the western lands. He had certainly been the member for a lot of the western division in New South Wales. In fact, I remember Ralph telling me that when Bourke was added to the seat of Gwydir the then mayor of Bourke took him into one of the hotels. He said: 'I'm trying to make the right impression, as you do. This big chap walked up, said something to the mayor and the mayor king hit him, and bang, he went out like a light.' Ralph said he thought to himself: 'This is not going to be a good look. Front page: ""Candidate for Gwydir involved in brawl,""' at a particular hotel in Bourke. He said: 'Everybody in the pub yelled out, ''Good on you, Wally, the bloke deserved it,'' and so we were heroes.'


Ralph was one of nature's gentlemen and a lovely man. Ralph was actually a redhead, but I guess he had lost most of his red hair when we knew him. But the red hair was as true on him as it is on most redheads: he certainly could get stirred up. I knew a couple of blokes who went to school with him at Scots in Sydney and they said that the red hair belonged on him. He was a tough bloke, even though he was a gentleman.


More than anything, the more I got to know Ralph the more I thought, 'Whatever parliament does, it must make you aware of everybody you look after and are responsible for.' We had an awful lot of fun, and he taught me a heck of a lot about the side of politics that is not talked about very much, about how people in politics can be of different persuasions but still be very good friends, as rigorous as it might get. Even with somebody like Ralph, who you might think everything went well for, he and Mim had issues. I do not mean between them, but they had family issues and things they had to deal with that would have put stress upon anybody, and they dealt with them magnificently. Their children would go through hell and back for them, pretty much as they did for one another and for their family.


For the National Party I guess Ralph was—to use a Labor saying—a 'true believer'. He did a lot towards McEwen House. He and Doug Anthony were very good mates. Ralph would be on the phone and would be talking to Doug and they would be trying to coerce someone to do something. It would not matter much who it was for and Ralph would say, 'I rang him last time, Doug; it's your turn to ring this time and stir him up and get him going.' As time goes on, you always think that it was simpler before you. But they had very clear lines of demarcation, if I can put it that way. They stood by one another. He and Peter Nixon and Ian Sinclair were a very tough and motivated crew. They all worked together. They worked with the Liberals very well. I would like to think that Mim knew how much we all appreciated everything Ralph did for the Australian parliament, for the coalition and for the National Party. He gave his heart and soul to it. After he left—after he walked away from this place—he still gave his heart and soul to the people he had represented for all those years. He still did things that the rest of us hope to do after we leave here. He was a very unselfish man and I am very proud to have known him.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-05-24,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (19:55):  Ralph James Dunnet Hunt was a man who built up his outstanding reputation through dedication and hard work but most of all his sense of staying true to himself and his country values. A farmer and grazier, Mr Hunt served on the Boomi Shire Council on the Moree Plains from 1956 to 1968 and, after the retirement of Ian Allan in 1969, served in the House of Representatives from 7 June 1969 until his retirement on 24 February 1989. Mr Hunt originally started out in the Country Party, which then became the National Country Party in 1975, before broadening to the National Party of Australia in 1982.


In Mr Hunt's inaugural speech on 21 August 1969 he declared that he joined the party to lend his support to the sound national policies of this committee but also to help ensure that those who live outside the great metropolitan areas of this country enjoy their full share of this new and exciting era of development and prosperity. This was an exciting time for Mr Hunt and for his electorate of Gwydir, a Federation seat. He was to represent his electorate with an agricultural background which was vast. He served it with distinction and honour for more than two decades, with the clear objective to see that those regional areas were helped so that they would make an increasing contribution to an even greater nation in the future. This is the attitude of a man of integrity, an attitude that flows through the roots of the entire National Party. His passion for and commitment to regional Australia is what makes me proud to be a Nationals member following in his footsteps.


Mr Hunt held four portfolios while serving in the House of Representatives. From 1971 to 1972, he was the Minister for the Interior. From 1975 to 1979, he was Minister for Health. From 1979 to 1982, he was Minister for Transport. From 1982 to 1983, he was Minister for Transport and Construction. He continued a high standard as Deputy Leader of the Nationals and that benchmark has been emulated by all of those who have followed: Bruce Lloyd, John Anderson, Mark Vaile, Warren Truss and now Senator Nigel Scullion.


However, what saddens me is that the amount of dedication and energy that one man put into regional Australia is sometimes ignored today. One of Mr Hunt's greatest passions was equality and fairness for country students, things that are not always achieved in the present. Hailing from a farming background, Mr Hunt knew the importance of advanced education in rural areas not only for the men and women living in towns but for the ones who decided to go back and manage their properties. While there has been a great leap in rural education since 1969, with more colleges, universities and schools opening in regional Australia, there is still a large education barrier dividing regional and metropolitan students.


Here are the words of Mr Hunt's successor in Gwydir, John Anderson: 'From the night of 21 August 1969 there followed all but 20 years of dedicated service to the people of Gwydir and to the people of this nation. I am constantly reminded, both in this place and at home in the electorate, of the regard in which he was held and the thankfulness which people feel for the contribution that he made'. At this time, the Nationals in particular extend our deepest sympathy to Ralph's wife Miriam and their three children. His family was his greatest achievement. I thank them for giving our party so much of Ralph's wonderful life. Ralph's energy for and commitment to public life, to the Nationals and to regional Australia will be evident for years to come. His legacy will be long lasting. May he rest in peace.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (20:00):  I rise to speak on the report School libraries and teacher librarians in 21st century Australia. By way of background to the report, notifications announcing the establishment of the inquiry were made on 18 March 2010 for the 42nd parliament and on 25 November 2010 for the 43rd parliament. Through the committee's website and the Australian, the inquiry was advertised to the public. As a consequence, a total of 386 submissions and nine supplementary submissions were received from a variety of sources, including individuals, education departments, schools, teachers and community groups.


The inquiry offered relevant stakeholders the opportunity to comment on the contribution made by school libraries and teacher librarians to education in Australia as well as to examine what else might be done to increase their value. This report is the result of both the submissions and the evidence gathered for the inquiry into school libraries and teacher librarians in the last parliament.


On 23 May 2011 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment, of which I am a member, tabled its report. The library and information management sector has for some time now called for an inquiry such as this so that the work of school libraries and teacher librarians could be reviewed. I note particularly the positive role the inquiry and report have made in raising the often unassuming and understated role of teacher librarians and the constructive contributions they make to our education system. Having said that, I share the concern of my colleague and deputy chair of the committee, the member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, that teacher librarians are probably not as valued by schools as an educational source as much as they should be—although I do note that, anecdotally, teacher librarians are more likely to be given higher seniority when the schools are more engaged with their librarians.


There is a widespread lack of understanding about the role of a teacher librarian, not only within schools but also in the broader community. A New South Wales teacher librarian stated to the inquiry:


Students and teachers expect to be able to select and use resources in a library but have no idea of the time and effort it takes to develop and maintain a library collection. Many primary school parents are surprised to learn that the teacher librarian actually teaches their children.


I will now briefly discuss some of the recommendations set out in the report. Eleven recommendations were made, revolving around four central areas: the impact of recent Commonwealth government policies and investments on school libraries; the potential of school libraries and librarians to contribute to improved educational and community outcomes; the recruitment and development of teacher librarians; and partnering and supporting school libraries and teacher librarians.


The important role the internet and online technology now plays in educating our children in the 21st century was recognised, and it was recommended that a discrete national policy statement be developed with cooperation from the Commonwealth government and the states and territories. This statement will define the importance of digital and information literacy for learning and will be an effective guide for our educators. It was also recommended that all Australian schools have access to online database resources through Commonwealth funded partnerships with education authorities. Emphasis was also placed on the need for the Commonwealth government to provide support for the promotion of reading as well as an assessment and study of the links between library programs and student literacy achievements. It was also recommended that a component of training for teacher librarians should be included in the rollout of the new national curriculum. Having met with nearly all of the principals, headmasters and heads of school from both independent and state schools in McPherson, I know that this would be something that they would most likely support.


A further recommendation was made that the Commonwealth government, through the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood and Youth Affairs, discuss ways to enhance partnerships with the state, territory and local levels of government to support school libraries and teacher librarians. The report demonstrates a clear theme that centres on the promotion of improved federal, state and local government relations to support school libraries and teacher librarians. This has been a theme in discussions that I have had with educational leaders in my electorate of McPherson.


Soon after my election, I took the opportunity to convene a meeting with most of the lead educators in McPherson. The consistent issue raised by those educators was the need for increased support, certainty and uniformity from all levels of government. This view is relevant not only to teacher librarians but to a range of education issues. At a local level, I have seen the wonderful work done by teacher librarians as they work directly with students and I will continue to support the schools in McPherson and especially the teachers, principals, headmasters, heads of school, students and teacher librarians.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2011-05-24,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (20:07):  I also rise to speak on the School libraries and teacher librarians in 21st century Australia report. I would like to make some brief comments in relation to it. Like the previous speaker, the member for McPherson, I was not a member of the primary committee that did most of the work in this area, a committee in the 42nd parliament. We, the present House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment, took most of their work and the findings of their inquiry and finetuned it. The purpose of the inquiry was to look into and report on the role, adequacy and resourcing of school libraries and teacher librarians in Australia's public and private schools. Specifically, the committee was to focus on the impact of recent policies, the future potential of school librarians and the factors influencing the school librarian workforce.


While libraries are just a small component in some respects of a school, the report was quite timely, because school libraries—indeed, libraries in general—are going through a period of fundamental change due to rapid technological advances. When we went to school, all of the information was contained physically at the library, and that is where you went. Maybe it was a little bit different for the member for Longman, who is sitting behind me in this chamber, but when I went to school that was the case. But these days a lot of the information is indeed online. Certainly at the secondary school level, in doing research projects and the like, students are searching online for their information and so do not necessarily have to go to the physical location of the library to find that information. And it is similar even at the primary school level. Increasingly, primary school students are accessing information through online media. That changes the fundamental nature, purpose, role, structure and staffing of libraries. So the report was timely in that regard in that it could examine a lot of those issues and determine therefore what the right policy responses should be to support the evolving nature of the school library.


I should point out, of course, that the federal role in school libraries is quite a small one. The federal parliament has no jurisdiction over employing librarians, it does not manage the schools, it does not allocate the resources as such—they are all the role of state and territory governments, in the case of state schools, and non-government authorities or non-government individual school principals in the case of the independents and Catholic school sectors. So we have to bear that in mind that, in terms of the recommendations which were made in this report. We cannot be overly prescriptive in the recommendations made, and can really only provide some high-level policy overview and some guidance rather than detailed prescriptions, which are rightly left in the hands of the school authorities or the school principals themselves.


Some of the issues which did arise in this particular report—you should see them if you just pick up a copy of the report and scan through it—included accessing the databases of resources, which of course is a very important thing, and not all libraries are equal in that capacity; different libraries have a different number of resources to be able to purchase the databases which the students are relying upon.


The issue of cyber-safety arose, inevitably, and that is an issue that arises in almost every single school setting. It is certainly something that I hear in my electorate from parents, teachers and school principals. There were issues around technical support for teacher-librarians, and how that is provided these days. There were additional issues that came up through the inquiry about the status of librarians these days, and how arguably that has declined—and therefore how that contributes to fewer applicants applying to be librarians, it contributes to retention issues et cetera. Indeed, it was even pointed out in the inquiry by a number of submitters who said that there is a bit of a vicious circle as well—if you do not have enough senior librarians and senior staff to then be able to train more junior librarians, you start to be faced with a real issue.


So this particular committee, as I said, was largely the work of the 42nd parliament rather than the committee which I was part of in the 43rd parliament, but we did agree to a number of recommendations. They were largely established in the earlier parliament but we also agreed to them. They picked up some of the issues which I have just outlined. Probably the most important recommendation I would highlight is the first recommendation, which is to fund the provision of a core set of online database resources which are made available to all Australian schools. The rationale, really, for the Commonwealth to be involved in doing that was a belief by the committee that there would be economies of scale to be had by the Commonwealth being bulk-purchasers, if you like, of those databases. My natural inclination would be to leave it to the individual school principals to determine what databases they want, but I think there is some justification in this instance from a purchasing-power perspective.


Recommendation 2 was to develop a discrete national policy statement that defines the importance of digital and information literacy et cetera, which of course is relatively straightforward. It makes recommendations around the Commonwealth government initiating an Australian based longitudinal study into the links between library programs, literacy and student achievement. Again, it seems sensible to do further research into this to fully understand what the impact is on students' achievements. There are also some recommendations around the teacher-library workforce, in terms of doing some further research to understand what the gaps are and what additional training is needed. Finally there were some recommendations which concerned partnering relationships in terms of encouraging individual schools to partner with other schools and indeed for partnerships between states and territories to share learnings and best practice. Again, I think that is good common sense. Hopefully that would occur without necessarily the recommendation of a parliamentary inquiry to make it happen.


Let me conclude by reiterating the importance of the school library despite the changes that we see in today's school environment and despite the changes that we see in the broader community with the advent of technology. The library itself may have changed in terms of its focus and the technology and skills required; nevertheless it still has a very important place in Australia's schools. Hopefully the recommendations arising from this inquiry will further enhance the importance of school libraries in Australia's school systems.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (20:15):  I want to take the opportunity to welcome the report School libraries and teacher librarians in 21st century Australia  produced by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment given that I was the chair of the former House Standing Committee on Education and Training, which originally commenced the inquiry in the previous parliament. I was very pleased that post the election the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth asked the new committee to continue with the work of the previous committee and to produce this report. I commend the chair, Amanda Rishworth, the member for Kingston, for the work that has been done and all members of the committee in following up and producing this final report. I do so in particular because the issue was originally brought to my attention as a result of an online petition that had been running amongst teacher librarians. They were particularly concerned about the fact that in the digital age, for some reason—I think we gathered a lot of evidence that is reflected in this report about why this was happening—people were coming to the view that teacher librarians were not necessary in schools, where in fact quite the opposite could well be argued to be true. With the depth, complexity and breadth of information available to young people today, they need an experienced navigator more than ever to assist them in assessing the source, the legitimacy and the value of information that they are accessing, in particular, online. It was something that, particularly as a former teacher, caught my attention. We sought a reference from the minister, the current Prime Minister, and undertook to do a study into the matter. 


As previous speakers have said, the Commonwealth is not the direct employing authority, so some of the issues that particularly exercise teacher librarians around staffing formulas used in the provision of their expertise in schools are directly matters for employing authorities. In the quality agenda in terms of school leadership and digital education that the Commonwealth was involved in, there may well be some useful actions that we could take in order to provide national leadership on the issue of teacher librarians and the resourcing of school libraries. I commend the work in this report and hope that the government takes up every one of the recommendations and pursues them. The importance of this issue is reflected in a quote on page 36 of the report:


Each day we are inundated with vast amount of information [through television, radio and an immense array of online resources]. Though we may know how to find the information we need, we must also know how to evaluate it … This new type of literacy requires competency with communication technologies, including computers and mobile devices that can help in our day-to-day decision-making.


That is a quote from President Obama's proclamation of a digital literacy awareness month in October 2009, where he was emphasising the importance for all Americans to be adept in effectively navigating the information age. I think that there is a profound argument, which is made in this report and was brought to the attention of the committee by teacher librarians across the nation, about the significance of full digital citizenship, full participation in the digital age, enabling all of our students to manage this sort of information. I think there are real threats if we do not get on top of this. Cyberbullying, as some of the previous members have talked about, is an emerging issue that is very much at the forefront of the minds of educators and parents. But, more broadly, digital citizenship is an important issue that all young people are going to have to come to terms with. There are, for example, the privacy implications of digital participation. With the posting of photographs on social websites, the exposure of personal information will exist in that environment for a lifetime. All of these conversations are occurring now. 


It is important to acknowledge that the dual qualification of a teacher librarian—the teaching qualification, which helps them to understand the pedagogy, the curriculum and the developmental issues with the young people that they are working with, combined with the library qualification, which gives them the expertise in information management and assessment—is a unique combination that is invaluable in a school. We could see, when we took evidence from some of the more well-to-do private schools, that, where they had the capacity, they were investing in these resources in very significant ways. The teacher librarian leadership in their libraries was in fact part of the school leadership and was developing the schools' digital policies, digital citizenship policies and education programs. Teacher librarians across all sectors were very keen to take up the new responsibilities and to play a greater role in their schools in this way. 


There is much in this story of their involvement that should be shared. We found in some states—and it is identified in the report that a couple of states did not give evidence to the committee, although most did—that there was a very sad depletion in the numbers of teacher librarians. They were down to what you might call critical mass if you were looking at figures for the survival of a species. They were really, really low numbers. If you have gone through as the leader of the school never having had the value of a teacher librarian, then, not surprisingly, you are unlikely to seek that out and value it. And yet all the international evidence, including the Lonsdale report in Australia, backs up the argument that there is a direct link between a fully resourced library with a qualified teacher librarian working in it and improved literacy and numeracy results in a school. If more people in school leadership roles were aware of this evidence, they would be more likely to seek out and to utilise more effectively their teacher librarians. I think it is a real asset that we should be looking not only to maximise but to expand. 


I am encouraged by the fact that the member for Kingston, as chair of the committee, reports that there has actually been increased enrolment in teacher librarian courses at universities this year. Some of that may have been as a result of the conversations that occurred as this inquiry took place, raising the awareness.


In the few minutes I have left, I want to challenge some of the evidence that was given to us, when I was chairing the committee, that all teachers would do this and therefore there was no requirement to have a specialist in the school. As a former history teacher, I am acutely aware of the importance of resources. I am also acutely aware of the multiple pressures on the time of a classroom teacher. The thought that you would say to a history teacher in my day, 'There are a thousand text books published in this particular topic; go out and have a look at them and work out what is most appropriate for your curriculum,' is ridiculous. The average classroom teacher does not have the time or capacity to engage in that way. The teacher librarian is a specialist who does that for you and provides good quality resources for your classroom. It is a tremendous partnership that I relied on on many occasions. I think it is very short-sighted of education authorities to think that this role can just be subsumed into the classroom teacher's role. I would challenge them to have another look at what the evidence actually shows about the importance of the teacher librarian.


I want to commend the recommendation around the provision of at least a base level of online resources to schools. Schools reported to us widely variant amounts of resources that they had available to purchase products for their libraries. It is important that we keep books, that we keep reading and that we keep the love of literacy, but it is also important that we keep good quality based resources available online. I think that this is a good proposal.


Finally, because I did not have a chance in the former parliament, I also want to acknowledge the work of the secretariat: Glenn Worthington, the secretary; Justin Baker, the inquiry secretary; Ray Knight, a senior researcher who I worked with; and Daniel Miletic and Tarran Snape. They are not my committee secretariat anymore, but they were a fantastic group who did tremendous work. It is certainly reflected in the support that they have given to the current committee and I absolutely commend the recommendations in this report to the government. I look forward to seeing some action come out of all the work and the commitment of teacher-librarians who gave us evidence across the nation.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (20:30):  I rise to welcome the document too. As a new member of the parliament I did not get to be a participant in all of the hearings. But certainly, in the early part of my parliamentary career the latter part of this report was pulled together and I had the opportunity to hear some evidence from some key participants in the field of teacher-librarianship. I acknowledge the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham, and I come to this assessment of the inquiry and its report from the point of view of being a teacher myself. I have never been a librarian and I have always held them in great esteem. The access that teacher-librarians have provided for my own children in the primary context has been a transformational learning experience.


A teacher-librarian is an amazing asset to any school. Teachers have a curriculum to contend with. They have their own pedagogy to continue to work on. As the member for Cunningham has indicated, the capacity to be across the entire range of articles that are available, the entire range of resources that are available for your field and the entire range of literature that is available for your own students—particularly for me looking at it from that point of view as an English teacher—is simply impossible without an outstanding teacher-librarian. I think of my own experiences of how different the experiences were in the primary school setting, the secondary school setting and then the tertiary setting, not only because of the developmental differences that need to be addressed in those different contexts but also because of the different needs of students at those different points.


Being able to access your teacher-librarian outside of the classroom—during recess, at lunchtime, and before and after school—can become transformational learning moments for young people in school. I recall, very fondly, a teacher-librarian who worked at my school during my secondary schooling. As the eldest of six children I can say that our house was a very busy place. In the weekend leading up to the HSC she gave me access to the library so I had a bit of quiet time and a bit of space and access to the books on the shelves to do my final preparation. I am forever grateful to Miss White for giving me that opportunity. Sadly, for a whole generation of young Australians the role of teacher-librarian has become an indication of a crisis in staffing capacity.


I want to address the recommendations of the report in particular. There are five core recommendations. The first section relates to the impact of recent Commonwealth government policies and investments in school libraries. Recommendation 1 is particularly important at this time because it recommends that the Commonwealth government partner with all educational authorities to fund the provision of a core set of online databases which would then be made available to all Australian schools. Of course, books remain a very important part of what a library offers and many debates in many parts of academia and the general community abound about the difference between books and digital information. I note the digital engagement of my two colleagues in the chamber at the moment. We want information. We want to access information and we know that the digital world is out there. How then can we as Australian educators resile from the responsibility to make sure that excellent data access is available to those people in our schools who need to learn about how to responsibly use digital information? The capacity to interact with databases and high-quality academic literature is a very important element of preparing our senior students in secondary schooling to take on the breadth of information that is out there in the world and to be able to make very careful, informed decisions about the quality of the types of articles they are reading. To be able to do that before you get to university really enhances your learning as a student in the later parts of your senior secondary education. It also certainly sets you on the right path for engaging with that digital literacy in the tertiary context.


The second recommendation that comes under the impact statement is regarding the work that needs to be undertaken with the states and territories to develop a discrete national policy statement that defines the importance of digital and information literacy for learning in the 21st century. This needs to be used as a tool to guide teachers and principals on the centrality of deciding how we use resources in schools, how funds are allocated to and for learning in a digital way with the librarian and through a library or how they might be allocated to other things. Without a framework that articulates the importance and the centrality of our teacher librarians and the work that they do, they become extremely vulnerable. That is what we found in the inquiry. Although I only heard the end of the inquiry, certainly that remained the case as the inquiry closed.


The second section dealt with the potential of school libraries and librarians to contribute to improved community educational outcomes. This really goes without saying. The reality is that teacher librarians bring a special set of skills and competencies to any school community. They are an asset to the local community, who have come to use the library in many situations. Right now in Spencer on the Central Coast a community school library is being constructed with funds from the Building the Education Revolution. I also want to note in my own electorate the amazing facility that the Central Coast Grammar School have built. The access that they provide for the community to that resource is a fantastic thing. The teacher librarians were an absolutely vibrant part of the conversation about how that physical space could be shaped and also how that space could be used most effectively for the students.


One of the other critical recommendations that I want to address in the time that I have remaining regards perhaps the core issue that triggered this report, and that is the issue of recruitment and development of teacher librarians. As the member for Cunningham expressed in her speech just a few moments ago, we have hit a point where we have lost so many teacher librarians that they are nearly extinct. There are many reasons we could explore for the reality we currently face, but the reality of the future is what we need to be focused on. That is why this report offers us some very important signposts for the way we proceed.


One of the things that needs to be addressed is the reality of some teachers returning to work from periods of time where they may have been unwell, and instead of being supported adequately, they are simply farmed off to the library, which positions the library as a mere adjunct, something perhaps much less important than what happens in the classrooms. We have heard comments that the perception that teacher librarians do not make a significant contribution has actually become alive and well in some of our schools. It is hard to believe that we could have reached this point in an age when we talk about literacy so frequently and openly. And the multiplicity of literacy that we need to acquire demands that we have even more skilled teacher librarians than has been the case in the past. Instead, a number of principals have told me that they put the worst teachers in the library because that is where they will do the least damage. There can be no possible way that it would ever be okay, not only for the students but for the teacher themselves, to put a poor teacher—a teacher who is struggling in any situation where they are interacting with young people—in that situation, regardless of whether they are delivering a curriculum or delivering critical digital literacy, critical thinking and critical support for students in a teacher-librarian context inside a library. This goes to the heart of the professionalism that is required. The professionalism of the teacher librarians that I, along with my colleagues on the committee, took evidence from was absolutely outstanding. They deeply understand what a teacher librarian can bring to learning and to life outcomes for young people. 


I definitely commend the report to the House and I look forward to the minister's action in this area.

Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (20:36):  I would like to start off by thanking the member for Robertson for a very good speech, which went to the depth of the report. She has really expanded on a lot of the issues in it. The committee inquiry went for a long time. I have had the benefit of being in both the last parliament and the present one, but the member for Robertson had to start about three-quarters of the way through the inquiry, and I think she has truly grasped the gist of it.


As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training in the 42nd Parliament, which commenced this inquiry, and a member of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment in the 43rd parliament, which concluded the report, I have no hesitation in commending the report to the House. I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of the member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird, for her work in chairing the committee in the 42nd Parliament and the work of the member for Kingston, Amanda Rishworth, for her work in chairing the committee and in concluding the report in the 43rd Parliament. Although the terms of reference at first glance may seem quite limiting, this was one of those inquiries where the more questions were asked the wider our scope seemed to get. Because of the change of parliament, the inquiry actually went longer than planned. But I am very pleased, standing here tonight, to be able to say that we completed the job we were given, and I think the committee as a whole completed it very well.


The inquiry's schedule for hearings took us to every state and territory. There are vast differences between the state and territory systems, which we saw in our travels and heard about from witnesses. No two states or territories were the same but, having said that, there was nowhere that I would give a pass mark to. Everywhere we travelled we heard of the problems of teacher librarians in the system and with the resourcing of libraries, and in most cases it was a long-term trend that was heading down.


There were exceptions, however. I found the exceptions quite surprising, but on reflection they are probably not. We found that private sector schools overall greatly valued teacher librarians and used teacher librarians as a selling point to attract parents to their schools. It was a fairly simple argument that they put to us, and it came from many sources: having teacher librarians in our schools improves our results. I do not doubt that. Having heard from so many teacher librarians, their associations and various other groups during the inquiry, and seeing international evidence as well, this issue came up time and time again. Whereas some state systems were inclined to use teacher librarians as relief staff if a teacher was sick or could not attend class for some reason, that certainly was not the case in the evidence that we heard from the private schools. As a better qualified person than a 'standard' qualified teacher, if that is the right description, the teacher librarian has knowledge above and beyond, and to be put into a position where you can be called away from your job at any time to go and mind a class because someone is not available really undervalues the profession. I would also like to say that we took some very good evidence from the various professional associations. One thing I would really like to highlight in my time here is the summation of what a teacher librarian does, because many people do not quite understand. They think, 'A teacher, a librarian—maybe it's someone who files the books.' That really undervalues the profession in a huge way. The summation of what a teacher librarian does I will leave to the words of the Australian Library and Information Association. I think they got it quite right in their submission to the inquiry. What they said was:


Teacher librarians support and implement the vision of their school communities through advocating and building effective library and information services and programs that contribute to the development of lifelong learners …


The teacher librarian is both an educator and an information manager with integrated understandings from both areas. Professional staff qualified in teacher education and librarianship (teacher librarians) are responsible for both shaping and reflecting the school’s objectives with respect to library and information programs and services.


As an integral partner in the school’s teaching and learning team, the teacher librarian has a role in the planning, implementation and evaluation of education policies, curricula, learning outcomes and programs, with particular reference to the development of learners’ research and information literacies.


I think the key words in those few paragraphs are 'information literacies'.


As we conducted the inquiry, it became more and more apparent that the way many schools teach has changed rapidly in recent years. Information literacy now includes the digital world. We found too often that it was taken for granted that teachers and their students would know by instinct how to research on the internet. We heard large amounts of evidence as to why this was not the case. It was very interesting to hear that in many cases the role of a teacher librarian directly suited the role of a digital gatekeeper for information. I must say, I had not thought of that at the start of the inquiry, but by the end of the inquiry I was quite convinced that this is a new and expanded role for teacher librarians. It probably builds the case more than ever for having teacher librarians in greater numbers in as many schools as possible. There will always be the small schools that have only two dozen students where it is not going to be feasible to have a full-time teacher librarian, but there are many schools of hundreds or a thousand plus students where it should be an absolute necessity. The report certainly goes into some of those areas and the reasons why.


Talking of digital literacy, I have a school in my own electorate, Ringwood Secondary College, which did something that was at the time fairly new. It has caught on so quickly it is not notable anymore. In 2010 all 300 of their year 7 students were required to have an iPad instead of textbooks. From memory, I think they actually had one textbook and everything else was on the iPad. That is a 300-strong army of iPads, if you like, that need looking after from the school's point of view as well as the student's—someone to guide what goes on and how they are used. That is not going to happen without someone who has knowledge and understanding of where the information comes from. That was in 2010, and I note that in 2011 there are many schools in my local area that now have iPads as part of their school equipment. I am sure that in the next couple of years it will become a very standard item. It is good from the student's point of view—they do not have to carry around a schoolbag with a dozen or so textbooks in it—and it is good from the school's point of view because they can update texts as they go through the year. That is one of the great points going forward where teacher librarians can be a real asset to any school. There are, of course, many other things that they do, and I am not going to go over everything that is recommended in the report. I thoroughly agree with all 11 recommendations in the report, and I certainly recommend that report for reading by the wider public and especially the education sector.


Further to that, we heard a lot about access to online libraries and the price that schools had to pay to be able to do that. In many cases it was quite an exorbitant fee for not a whole lot of use. We heard evidence that school libraries could spend 25 per cent of their budget subscribing to an online database, and you cannot expect many schools to do that. There is a resource called Electronic Resources Australia that offers a very wide range of data and can be accessed across all schools. I think one of the key recommendations of the report was that governments at both levels put money and resources into allowing schools to be able to access that at a bulk rate as cheaply as possible. I commend the report to the House.

"D'Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (20:46):  It is certainly my pleasure to stand and support this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment, titled School libraries and teacher librarians in 21st century Australia. The member for Deakin and I were both members of the committee in the previous parliament, which commenced this inquiry, and I want to acknowledge the chair of that committee in the previous parliament, the member for Cunningham, who I know has spoken on this report. I also want to acknowledge the contributions of the member for Kingston, who is now the chair of the education and employment committee, and also the member for Robertson. I know all of these people are extremely passionate about education. This was a comprehensive inquiry. It received hundreds of submissions from teacher librarians across Australia to give evidence, and teacher librarians appeared in hearings in each state and territory. It just shows the importance of this issue to education.


The federal Labor government has made a strong commitment to investing in education. We have built, and continue to build, new libraries and resource centres, and we refurbish existing libraries and resource centres in every single primary school across this country. I have seen the benefits that have flowed from those facilities across the primary schools in the electorate of Petrie. What these facilities do is provide opportunities. It is what happens inside these facilities that is so important. That is where the learning truly happens. If we are going to optimise those opportunities, get the most from them and provide the best possible education for our children, we need to make sure that we have the skilled teachers to be able to utilise those facilities and work not just with the children but with their peers and the whole school community.


That is what we heard through this inquiry. We heard examples of teacher librarians who are working so closely with their school communities and with their principals. They are not just the teacher librarian; they are the head of curriculum. They are on the key body within the school to decide how that education is rolled out across all of the various curricula. Then we heard the examples where the teacher librarian has really become a relief teacher or is now there simply to teach people how to use the computers or the Smart Boards but not how to really utilise that resource. It was interesting that, as the report notes at 3.40, in the survey that was undertaken of librarians:


It was almost unanimously agreed (99 per cent) amongst librarians surveyed that:


Investing in school libraries and school librarians will improve literacy outcomes for students; and


School libraries and school librarians contribute to improved educational and community outcomes.


And they are seeing these results in NAPLAN results. That was the evidence of the teacher librarians.


I just want to go to some of the recommendations, and I know the member for Deakin has spoken about some of these as well. On the last point that the member for Deakin raised in relation to online database resources: how can we expect that every child in every school will get the same opportunity if they are not getting access to the same resources? That is clearly the case. That is the evidence we saw across the country. There are those schools that can afford it and are able to subscribe to the broader online databases and then there are those schools who just cannot find sufficient funds in the budget to subscribe adequately to those databases. You can put in computers and you can train the teachers but, if you do not have the resource there for them to use, the children will not get the benefit and the children will not get the same opportunities, irrespective of where they go to school. The first recommendation that we make in this report is:


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government partner with all education authorities to fund the provision of a core set of online database resources, which are made available to all Australian schools.


We also saw that there was an issue with the intake of students, those who are doing degrees in education who are going on and doing a masters of education in teacher librarianship, in that really this was not being promoted as a potential career path. I note the comment of the chair in the foreword of the report:


The Committee was advised that Charles Sturt University’s second semester intake of students into its Master of Education (Teacher Librarianship) had doubled in 2010, and, it was suggested that the publicity surrounding this inquiry may have been a factor in the increased numbers being attracted to the teacher librarian profession.


If that is what this inquiry did, if it does nothing else, that is a fantastic result.


But there is much more to be done. We need to make sure that, in the development of the curriculum and in every aspect of government policy and work being done to ensure the best education possible for our young people, we are looking at the role of our teacher librarians and the important function that they have within our schools. Recommendation 3 is:


The Committee recommends that the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority include statistical information about the breakdown of all specialist teachers, including teacher librarians, on the My School website.


This recommendation was made because it became clear that we do not know what specialist teachers we have in our schools. We found out in Queensland that you may have done a masters in teacher librarianship, you may be a specialist in this area, but when you register in Queensland as a teacher there is not even a category to identify yourself as a specialist in this area. That needs to be rectified. It also showed once again that we do not have consistency across the states. If we want consistent outcomes then we have to have consistency across the states on the value of teacher librarians and the recognition of this as a very important specialist teacher role.


There are many other recommendations in this report. I support each and every of one of those recommendations, as does every member who has spoken on this report. I know that this report was unanimously supported by all members from both sides of this parliament, as it should be. This is an extremely important report. It is one that I know many in my electorate have been eagerly awaiting the release of. I look forward to forwarding copies of this report out to those teacher librarians in the schools so that they can see what their effort to bring information to us has resulted in with these recommendations. I commend the report to the House. It is an extremely important report and one that I hope the government follows closely.


Debate adjourned.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (20:00):  I rise to speak on the report School libraries and teacher librarians in 21st century Australia. By way of background to the report, notifications announcing the establishment of the inquiry were made on 18 March 2010 for the 42nd parliament and on 25 November 2010 for the 43rd parliament. Through the committee's website and the Australian, the inquiry was advertised to the public. As a consequence, a total of 386 submissions and nine supplementary submissions were received from a variety of sources, including individuals, education departments, schools, teachers and community groups.


The inquiry offered relevant stakeholders the opportunity to comment on the contribution made by school libraries and teacher librarians to education in Australia as well as to examine what else might be done to increase their value. This report is the result of both the submissions and the evidence gathered for the inquiry into school libraries and teacher librarians in the last parliament.


On 23 May 2011 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment, of which I am a member, tabled its report. The library and information management sector has for some time now called for an inquiry such as this so that the work of school libraries and teacher librarians could be reviewed. I note particularly the positive role the inquiry and report have made in raising the often unassuming and understated role of teacher librarians and the constructive contributions they make to our education system. Having said that, I share the concern of my colleague and deputy chair of the committee, the member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, that teacher librarians are probably not as valued by schools as an educational source as much as they should be—although I do note that, anecdotally, teacher librarians are more likely to be given higher seniority when the schools are more engaged with their librarians.


There is a widespread lack of understanding about the role of a teacher librarian, not only within schools but also in the broader community. A New South Wales teacher librarian stated to the inquiry:


Students and teachers expect to be able to select and use resources in a library but have no idea of the time and effort it takes to develop and maintain a library collection. Many primary school parents are surprised to learn that the teacher librarian actually teaches their children.


I will now briefly discuss some of the recommendations set out in the report. Eleven recommendations were made, revolving around four central areas: the impact of recent Commonwealth government policies and investments on school libraries; the potential of school libraries and librarians to contribute to improved educational and community outcomes; the recruitment and development of teacher librarians; and partnering and supporting school libraries and teacher librarians.


The important role the internet and online technology now plays in educating our children in the 21st century was recognised, and it was recommended that a discrete national policy statement be developed with cooperation from the Commonwealth government and the states and territories. This statement will define the importance of digital and information literacy for learning and will be an effective guide for our educators. It was also recommended that all Australian schools have access to online database resources through Commonwealth funded partnerships with education authorities. Emphasis was also placed on the need for the Commonwealth government to provide support for the promotion of reading as well as an assessment and study of the links between library programs and student literacy achievements. It was also recommended that a component of training for teacher librarians should be included in the rollout of the new national curriculum. Having met with nearly all of the principals, headmasters and heads of school from both independent and state schools in McPherson, I know that this would be something that they would most likely support.


A further recommendation was made that the Commonwealth government, through the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood and Youth Affairs, discuss ways to enhance partnerships with the state, territory and local levels of government to support school libraries and teacher librarians. The report demonstrates a clear theme that centres on the promotion of improved federal, state and local government relations to support school libraries and teacher librarians. This has been a theme in discussions that I have had with educational leaders in my electorate of McPherson.


Soon after my election, I took the opportunity to convene a meeting with most of the lead educators in McPherson. The consistent issue raised by those educators was the need for increased support, certainty and uniformity from all levels of government. This view is relevant not only to teacher librarians but to a range of education issues. At a local level, I have seen the wonderful work done by teacher librarians as they work directly with students and I will continue to support the schools in McPherson and especially the teachers, principals, headmasters, heads of school, students and teacher librarians.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2011-05-24,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (20:07):  I also rise to speak on the School libraries and teacher librarians in 21st century Australia report. I would like to make some brief comments in relation to it. Like the previous speaker, the member for McPherson, I was not a member of the primary committee that did most of the work in this area, a committee in the 42nd parliament. We, the present House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment, took most of their work and the findings of their inquiry and finetuned it. The purpose of the inquiry was to look into and report on the role, adequacy and resourcing of school libraries and teacher librarians in Australia's public and private schools. Specifically, the committee was to focus on the impact of recent policies, the future potential of school librarians and the factors influencing the school librarian workforce.


While libraries are just a small component in some respects of a school, the report was quite timely, because school libraries—indeed, libraries in general—are going through a period of fundamental change due to rapid technological advances. When we went to school, all of the information was contained physically at the library, and that is where you went. Maybe it was a little bit different for the member for Longman, who is sitting behind me in this chamber, but when I went to school that was the case. But these days a lot of the information is indeed online. Certainly at the secondary school level, in doing research projects and the like, students are searching online for their information and so do not necessarily have to go to the physical location of the library to find that information. And it is similar even at the primary school level. Increasingly, primary school students are accessing information through online media. That changes the fundamental nature, purpose, role, structure and staffing of libraries. So the report was timely in that regard in that it could examine a lot of those issues and determine therefore what the right policy responses should be to support the evolving nature of the school library.


I should point out, of course, that the federal role in school libraries is quite a small one. The federal parliament has no jurisdiction over employing librarians, it does not manage the schools, it does not allocate the resources as such—they are all the role of state and territory governments, in the case of state schools, and non-government authorities or non-government individual school principals in the case of the independents and Catholic school sectors. So we have to bear that in mind that, in terms of the recommendations which were made in this report. We cannot be overly prescriptive in the recommendations made, and can really only provide some high-level policy overview and some guidance rather than detailed prescriptions, which are rightly left in the hands of the school authorities or the school principals themselves.


Some of the issues which did arise in this particular report—you should see them if you just pick up a copy of the report and scan through it—included accessing the databases of resources, which of course is a very important thing, and not all libraries are equal in that capacity; different libraries have a different number of resources to be able to purchase the databases which the students are relying upon.


The issue of cyber-safety arose, inevitably, and that is an issue that arises in almost every single school setting. It is certainly something that I hear in my electorate from parents, teachers and school principals. There were issues around technical support for teacher-librarians, and how that is provided these days. There were additional issues that came up through the inquiry about the status of librarians these days, and how arguably that has declined—and therefore how that contributes to fewer applicants applying to be librarians, it contributes to retention issues et cetera. Indeed, it was even pointed out in the inquiry by a number of submitters who said that there is a bit of a vicious circle as well—if you do not have enough senior librarians and senior staff to then be able to train more junior librarians, you start to be faced with a real issue.


So this particular committee, as I said, was largely the work of the 42nd parliament rather than the committee which I was part of in the 43rd parliament, but we did agree to a number of recommendations. They were largely established in the earlier parliament but we also agreed to them. They picked up some of the issues which I have just outlined. Probably the most important recommendation I would highlight is the first recommendation, which is to fund the provision of a core set of online database resources which are made available to all Australian schools. The rationale, really, for the Commonwealth to be involved in doing that was a belief by the committee that there would be economies of scale to be had by the Commonwealth being bulk-purchasers, if you like, of those databases. My natural inclination would be to leave it to the individual school principals to determine what databases they want, but I think there is some justification in this instance from a purchasing-power perspective.


Recommendation 2 was to develop a discrete national policy statement that defines the importance of digital and information literacy et cetera, which of course is relatively straightforward. It makes recommendations around the Commonwealth government initiating an Australian based longitudinal study into the links between library programs, literacy and student achievement. Again, it seems sensible to do further research into this to fully understand what the impact is on students' achievements. There are also some recommendations around the teacher-library workforce, in terms of doing some further research to understand what the gaps are and what additional training is needed. Finally there were some recommendations which concerned partnering relationships in terms of encouraging individual schools to partner with other schools and indeed for partnerships between states and territories to share learnings and best practice. Again, I think that is good common sense. Hopefully that would occur without necessarily the recommendation of a parliamentary inquiry to make it happen.


Let me conclude by reiterating the importance of the school library despite the changes that we see in today's school environment and despite the changes that we see in the broader community with the advent of technology. The library itself may have changed in terms of its focus and the technology and skills required; nevertheless it still has a very important place in Australia's schools. Hopefully the recommendations arising from this inquiry will further enhance the importance of school libraries in Australia's school systems.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (20:15):  I want to take the opportunity to welcome the report School libraries and teacher librarians in 21st century Australia  produced by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment given that I was the chair of the former House Standing Committee on Education and Training, which originally commenced the inquiry in the previous parliament. I was very pleased that post the election the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth asked the new committee to continue with the work of the previous committee and to produce this report. I commend the chair, Amanda Rishworth, the member for Kingston, for the work that has been done and all members of the committee in following up and producing this final report. I do so in particular because the issue was originally brought to my attention as a result of an online petition that had been running amongst teacher librarians. They were particularly concerned about the fact that in the digital age, for some reason—I think we gathered a lot of evidence that is reflected in this report about why this was happening—people were coming to the view that teacher librarians were not necessary in schools, where in fact quite the opposite could well be argued to be true. With the depth, complexity and breadth of information available to young people today, they need an experienced navigator more than ever to assist them in assessing the source, the legitimacy and the value of information that they are accessing, in particular, online. It was something that, particularly as a former teacher, caught my attention. We sought a reference from the minister, the current Prime Minister, and undertook to do a study into the matter. 


As previous speakers have said, the Commonwealth is not the direct employing authority, so some of the issues that particularly exercise teacher librarians around staffing formulas used in the provision of their expertise in schools are directly matters for employing authorities. In the quality agenda in terms of school leadership and digital education that the Commonwealth was involved in, there may well be some useful actions that we could take in order to provide national leadership on the issue of teacher librarians and the resourcing of school libraries. I commend the work in this report and hope that the government takes up every one of the recommendations and pursues them. The importance of this issue is reflected in a quote on page 36 of the report:


Each day we are inundated with vast amount of information [through television, radio and an immense array of online resources]. Though we may know how to find the information we need, we must also know how to evaluate it … This new type of literacy requires competency with communication technologies, including computers and mobile devices that can help in our day-to-day decision-making.


That is a quote from President Obama's proclamation of a digital literacy awareness month in October 2009, where he was emphasising the importance for all Americans to be adept in effectively navigating the information age. I think that there is a profound argument, which is made in this report and was brought to the attention of the committee by teacher librarians across the nation, about the significance of full digital citizenship, full participation in the digital age, enabling all of our students to manage this sort of information. I think there are real threats if we do not get on top of this. Cyberbullying, as some of the previous members have talked about, is an emerging issue that is very much at the forefront of the minds of educators and parents. But, more broadly, digital citizenship is an important issue that all young people are going to have to come to terms with. There are, for example, the privacy implications of digital participation. With the posting of photographs on social websites, the exposure of personal information will exist in that environment for a lifetime. All of these conversations are occurring now. 


It is important to acknowledge that the dual qualification of a teacher librarian—the teaching qualification, which helps them to understand the pedagogy, the curriculum and the developmental issues with the young people that they are working with, combined with the library qualification, which gives them the expertise in information management and assessment—is a unique combination that is invaluable in a school. We could see, when we took evidence from some of the more well-to-do private schools, that, where they had the capacity, they were investing in these resources in very significant ways. The teacher librarian leadership in their libraries was in fact part of the school leadership and was developing the schools' digital policies, digital citizenship policies and education programs. Teacher librarians across all sectors were very keen to take up the new responsibilities and to play a greater role in their schools in this way. 


There is much in this story of their involvement that should be shared. We found in some states—and it is identified in the report that a couple of states did not give evidence to the committee, although most did—that there was a very sad depletion in the numbers of teacher librarians. They were down to what you might call critical mass if you were looking at figures for the survival of a species. They were really, really low numbers. If you have gone through as the leader of the school never having had the value of a teacher librarian, then, not surprisingly, you are unlikely to seek that out and value it. And yet all the international evidence, including the Lonsdale report in Australia, backs up the argument that there is a direct link between a fully resourced library with a qualified teacher librarian working in it and improved literacy and numeracy results in a school. If more people in school leadership roles were aware of this evidence, they would be more likely to seek out and to utilise more effectively their teacher librarians. I think it is a real asset that we should be looking not only to maximise but to expand. 


I am encouraged by the fact that the member for Kingston, as chair of the committee, reports that there has actually been increased enrolment in teacher librarian courses at universities this year. Some of that may have been as a result of the conversations that occurred as this inquiry took place, raising the awareness.


In the few minutes I have left, I want to challenge some of the evidence that was given to us, when I was chairing the committee, that all teachers would do this and therefore there was no requirement to have a specialist in the school. As a former history teacher, I am acutely aware of the importance of resources. I am also acutely aware of the multiple pressures on the time of a classroom teacher. The thought that you would say to a history teacher in my day, 'There are a thousand text books published in this particular topic; go out and have a look at them and work out what is most appropriate for your curriculum,' is ridiculous. The average classroom teacher does not have the time or capacity to engage in that way. The teacher librarian is a specialist who does that for you and provides good quality resources for your classroom. It is a tremendous partnership that I relied on on many occasions. I think it is very short-sighted of education authorities to think that this role can just be subsumed into the classroom teacher's role. I would challenge them to have another look at what the evidence actually shows about the importance of the teacher librarian.


I want to commend the recommendation around the provision of at least a base level of online resources to schools. Schools reported to us widely variant amounts of resources that they had available to purchase products for their libraries. It is important that we keep books, that we keep reading and that we keep the love of literacy, but it is also important that we keep good quality based resources available online. I think that this is a good proposal.


Finally, because I did not have a chance in the former parliament, I also want to acknowledge the work of the secretariat: Glenn Worthington, the secretary; Justin Baker, the inquiry secretary; Ray Knight, a senior researcher who I worked with; and Daniel Miletic and Tarran Snape. They are not my committee secretariat anymore, but they were a fantastic group who did tremendous work. It is certainly reflected in the support that they have given to the current committee and I absolutely commend the recommendations in this report to the government. I look forward to seeing some action come out of all the work and the commitment of teacher-librarians who gave us evidence across the nation.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (20:30):  I rise to welcome the document too. As a new member of the parliament I did not get to be a participant in all of the hearings. But certainly, in the early part of my parliamentary career the latter part of this report was pulled together and I had the opportunity to hear some evidence from some key participants in the field of teacher-librarianship. I acknowledge the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham, and I come to this assessment of the inquiry and its report from the point of view of being a teacher myself. I have never been a librarian and I have always held them in great esteem. The access that teacher-librarians have provided for my own children in the primary context has been a transformational learning experience.


A teacher-librarian is an amazing asset to any school. Teachers have a curriculum to contend with. They have their own pedagogy to continue to work on. As the member for Cunningham has indicated, the capacity to be across the entire range of articles that are available, the entire range of resources that are available for your field and the entire range of literature that is available for your own students—particularly for me looking at it from that point of view as an English teacher—is simply impossible without an outstanding teacher-librarian. I think of my own experiences of how different the experiences were in the primary school setting, the secondary school setting and then the tertiary setting, not only because of the developmental differences that need to be addressed in those different contexts but also because of the different needs of students at those different points.


Being able to access your teacher-librarian outside of the classroom—during recess, at lunchtime, and before and after school—can become transformational learning moments for young people in school. I recall, very fondly, a teacher-librarian who worked at my school during my secondary schooling. As the eldest of six children I can say that our house was a very busy place. In the weekend leading up to the HSC she gave me access to the library so I had a bit of quiet time and a bit of space and access to the books on the shelves to do my final preparation. I am forever grateful to Miss White for giving me that opportunity. Sadly, for a whole generation of young Australians the role of teacher-librarian has become an indication of a crisis in staffing capacity.


I want to address the recommendations of the report in particular. There are five core recommendations. The first section relates to the impact of recent Commonwealth government policies and investments in school libraries. Recommendation 1 is particularly important at this time because it recommends that the Commonwealth government partner with all educational authorities to fund the provision of a core set of online databases which would then be made available to all Australian schools. Of course, books remain a very important part of what a library offers and many debates in many parts of academia and the general community abound about the difference between books and digital information. I note the digital engagement of my two colleagues in the chamber at the moment. We want information. We want to access information and we know that the digital world is out there. How then can we as Australian educators resile from the responsibility to make sure that excellent data access is available to those people in our schools who need to learn about how to responsibly use digital information? The capacity to interact with databases and high-quality academic literature is a very important element of preparing our senior students in secondary schooling to take on the breadth of information that is out there in the world and to be able to make very careful, informed decisions about the quality of the types of articles they are reading. To be able to do that before you get to university really enhances your learning as a student in the later parts of your senior secondary education. It also certainly sets you on the right path for engaging with that digital literacy in the tertiary context.


The second recommendation that comes under the impact statement is regarding the work that needs to be undertaken with the states and territories to develop a discrete national policy statement that defines the importance of digital and information literacy for learning in the 21st century. This needs to be used as a tool to guide teachers and principals on the centrality of deciding how we use resources in schools, how funds are allocated to and for learning in a digital way with the librarian and through a library or how they might be allocated to other things. Without a framework that articulates the importance and the centrality of our teacher librarians and the work that they do, they become extremely vulnerable. That is what we found in the inquiry. Although I only heard the end of the inquiry, certainly that remained the case as the inquiry closed.


The second section dealt with the potential of school libraries and librarians to contribute to improved community educational outcomes. This really goes without saying. The reality is that teacher librarians bring a special set of skills and competencies to any school community. They are an asset to the local community, who have come to use the library in many situations. Right now in Spencer on the Central Coast a community school library is being constructed with funds from the Building the Education Revolution. I also want to note in my own electorate the amazing facility that the Central Coast Grammar School have built. The access that they provide for the community to that resource is a fantastic thing. The teacher librarians were an absolutely vibrant part of the conversation about how that physical space could be shaped and also how that space could be used most effectively for the students.


One of the other critical recommendations that I want to address in the time that I have remaining regards perhaps the core issue that triggered this report, and that is the issue of recruitment and development of teacher librarians. As the member for Cunningham expressed in her speech just a few moments ago, we have hit a point where we have lost so many teacher librarians that they are nearly extinct. There are many reasons we could explore for the reality we currently face, but the reality of the future is what we need to be focused on. That is why this report offers us some very important signposts for the way we proceed.


One of the things that needs to be addressed is the reality of some teachers returning to work from periods of time where they may have been unwell, and instead of being supported adequately, they are simply farmed off to the library, which positions the library as a mere adjunct, something perhaps much less important than what happens in the classrooms. We have heard comments that the perception that teacher librarians do not make a significant contribution has actually become alive and well in some of our schools. It is hard to believe that we could have reached this point in an age when we talk about literacy so frequently and openly. And the multiplicity of literacy that we need to acquire demands that we have even more skilled teacher librarians than has been the case in the past. Instead, a number of principals have told me that they put the worst teachers in the library because that is where they will do the least damage. There can be no possible way that it would ever be okay, not only for the students but for the teacher themselves, to put a poor teacher—a teacher who is struggling in any situation where they are interacting with young people—in that situation, regardless of whether they are delivering a curriculum or delivering critical digital literacy, critical thinking and critical support for students in a teacher-librarian context inside a library. This goes to the heart of the professionalism that is required. The professionalism of the teacher librarians that I, along with my colleagues on the committee, took evidence from was absolutely outstanding. They deeply understand what a teacher librarian can bring to learning and to life outcomes for young people. 


I definitely commend the report to the House and I look forward to the minister's action in this area.

"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (20:36):  I would like to start off by thanking the member for Robertson for a very good speech, which went to the depth of the report. She has really expanded on a lot of the issues in it. The committee inquiry went for a long time. I have had the benefit of being in both the last parliament and the present one, but the member for Robertson had to start about three-quarters of the way through the inquiry, and I think she has truly grasped the gist of it.


As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training in the 42nd Parliament, which commenced this inquiry, and a member of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment in the 43rd parliament, which concluded the report, I have no hesitation in commending the report to the House. I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of the member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird, for her work in chairing the committee in the 42nd Parliament and the work of the member for Kingston, Amanda Rishworth, for her work in chairing the committee and in concluding the report in the 43rd Parliament. Although the terms of reference at first glance may seem quite limiting, this was one of those inquiries where the more questions were asked the wider our scope seemed to get. Because of the change of parliament, the inquiry actually went longer than planned. But I am very pleased, standing here tonight, to be able to say that we completed the job we were given, and I think the committee as a whole completed it very well.


The inquiry's schedule for hearings took us to every state and territory. There are vast differences between the state and territory systems, which we saw in our travels and heard about from witnesses. No two states or territories were the same but, having said that, there was nowhere that I would give a pass mark to. Everywhere we travelled we heard of the problems of teacher librarians in the system and with the resourcing of libraries, and in most cases it was a long-term trend that was heading down.


There were exceptions, however. I found the exceptions quite surprising, but on reflection they are probably not. We found that private sector schools overall greatly valued teacher librarians and used teacher librarians as a selling point to attract parents to their schools. It was a fairly simple argument that they put to us, and it came from many sources: having teacher librarians in our schools improves our results. I do not doubt that. Having heard from so many teacher librarians, their associations and various other groups during the inquiry, and seeing international evidence as well, this issue came up time and time again. Whereas some state systems were inclined to use teacher librarians as relief staff if a teacher was sick or could not attend class for some reason, that certainly was not the case in the evidence that we heard from the private schools. As a better qualified person than a 'standard' qualified teacher, if that is the right description, the teacher librarian has knowledge above and beyond, and to be put into a position where you can be called away from your job at any time to go and mind a class because someone is not available really undervalues the profession. I would also like to say that we took some very good evidence from the various professional associations. One thing I would really like to highlight in my time here is the summation of what a teacher librarian does, because many people do not quite understand. They think, 'A teacher, a librarian—maybe it's someone who files the books.' That really undervalues the profession in a huge way. The summation of what a teacher librarian does I will leave to the words of the Australian Library and Information Association. I think they got it quite right in their submission to the inquiry. What they said was:


Teacher librarians support and implement the vision of their school communities through advocating and building effective library and information services and programs that contribute to the development of lifelong learners …


The teacher librarian is both an educator and an information manager with integrated understandings from both areas. Professional staff qualified in teacher education and librarianship (teacher librarians) are responsible for both shaping and reflecting the school’s objectives with respect to library and information programs and services.


As an integral partner in the school’s teaching and learning team, the teacher librarian has a role in the planning, implementation and evaluation of education policies, curricula, learning outcomes and programs, with particular reference to the development of learners’ research and information literacies.


I think the key words in those few paragraphs are 'information literacies'.


As we conducted the inquiry, it became more and more apparent that the way many schools teach has changed rapidly in recent years. Information literacy now includes the digital world. We found too often that it was taken for granted that teachers and their students would know by instinct how to research on the internet. We heard large amounts of evidence as to why this was not the case. It was very interesting to hear that in many cases the role of a teacher librarian directly suited the role of a digital gatekeeper for information. I must say, I had not thought of that at the start of the inquiry, but by the end of the inquiry I was quite convinced that this is a new and expanded role for teacher librarians. It probably builds the case more than ever for having teacher librarians in greater numbers in as many schools as possible. There will always be the small schools that have only two dozen students where it is not going to be feasible to have a full-time teacher librarian, but there are many schools of hundreds or a thousand plus students where it should be an absolute necessity. The report certainly goes into some of those areas and the reasons why.


Talking of digital literacy, I have a school in my own electorate, Ringwood Secondary College, which did something that was at the time fairly new. It has caught on so quickly it is not notable anymore. In 2010 all 300 of their year 7 students were required to have an iPad instead of textbooks. From memory, I think they actually had one textbook and everything else was on the iPad. That is a 300-strong army of iPads, if you like, that need looking after from the school's point of view as well as the student's—someone to guide what goes on and how they are used. That is not going to happen without someone who has knowledge and understanding of where the information comes from. That was in 2010, and I note that in 2011 there are many schools in my local area that now have iPads as part of their school equipment. I am sure that in the next couple of years it will become a very standard item. It is good from the student's point of view—they do not have to carry around a schoolbag with a dozen or so textbooks in it—and it is good from the school's point of view because they can update texts as they go through the year. That is one of the great points going forward where teacher librarians can be a real asset to any school. There are, of course, many other things that they do, and I am not going to go over everything that is recommended in the report. I thoroughly agree with all 11 recommendations in the report, and I certainly recommend that report for reading by the wider public and especially the education sector.


Further to that, we heard a lot about access to online libraries and the price that schools had to pay to be able to do that. In many cases it was quite an exorbitant fee for not a whole lot of use. We heard evidence that school libraries could spend 25 per cent of their budget subscribing to an online database, and you cannot expect many schools to do that. There is a resource called Electronic Resources Australia that offers a very wide range of data and can be accessed across all schools. I think one of the key recommendations of the report was that governments at both levels put money and resources into allowing schools to be able to access that at a bulk rate as cheaply as possible. I commend the report to the House.

"D'Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2011-05-24,"



Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (20:46):  It is certainly my pleasure to stand and support this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment, titled School libraries and teacher librarians in 21st century Australia. The member for Deakin and I were both members of the committee in the previous parliament, which commenced this inquiry, and I want to acknowledge the chair of that committee in the previous parliament, the member for Cunningham, who I know has spoken on this report. I also want to acknowledge the contributions of the member for Kingston, who is now the chair of the education and employment committee, and also the member for Robertson. I know all of these people are extremely passionate about education. This was a comprehensive inquiry. It received hundreds of submissions from teacher librarians across Australia to give evidence, and teacher librarians appeared in hearings in each state and territory. It just shows the importance of this issue to education.


The federal Labor government has made a strong commitment to investing in education. We have built, and continue to build, new libraries and resource centres, and we refurbish existing libraries and resource centres in every single primary school across this country. I have seen the benefits that have flowed from those facilities across the primary schools in the electorate of Petrie. What these facilities do is provide opportunities. It is what happens inside these facilities that is so important. That is where the learning truly happens. If we are going to optimise those opportunities, get the most from them and provide the best possible education for our children, we need to make sure that we have the skilled teachers to be able to utilise those facilities and work not just with the children but with their peers and the whole school community.


That is what we heard through this inquiry. We heard examples of teacher librarians who are working so closely with their school communities and with their principals. They are not just the teacher librarian; they are the head of curriculum. They are on the key body within the school to decide how that education is rolled out across all of the various curricula. Then we heard the examples where the teacher librarian has really become a relief teacher or is now there simply to teach people how to use the computers or the Smart Boards but not how to really utilise that resource. It was interesting that, as the report notes at 3.40, in the survey that was undertaken of librarians:


It was almost unanimously agreed (99 per cent) amongst librarians surveyed that:


Investing in school libraries and school librarians will improve literacy outcomes for students; and


School libraries and school librarians contribute to improved educational and community outcomes.


And they are seeing these results in NAPLAN results. That was the evidence of the teacher librarians.


I just want to go to some of the recommendations, and I know the member for Deakin has spoken about some of these as well. On the last point that the member for Deakin raised in relation to online database resources: how can we expect that every child in every school will get the same opportunity if they are not getting access to the same resources? That is clearly the case. That is the evidence we saw across the country. There are those schools that can afford it and are able to subscribe to the broader online databases and then there are those schools who just cannot find sufficient funds in the budget to subscribe adequately to those databases. You can put in computers and you can train the teachers but, if you do not have the resource there for them to use, the children will not get the benefit and the children will not get the same opportunities, irrespective of where they go to school. The first recommendation that we make in this report is:


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government partner with all education authorities to fund the provision of a core set of online database resources, which are made available to all Australian schools.


We also saw that there was an issue with the intake of students, those who are doing degrees in education who are going on and doing a masters of education in teacher librarianship, in that really this was not being promoted as a potential career path. I note the comment of the chair in the foreword of the report:


The Committee was advised that Charles Sturt University’s second semester intake of students into its Master of Education (Teacher Librarianship) had doubled in 2010, and, it was suggested that the publicity surrounding this inquiry may have been a factor in the increased numbers being attracted to the teacher librarian profession.


If that is what this inquiry did, if it does nothing else, that is a fantastic result.


But there is much more to be done. We need to make sure that, in the development of the curriculum and in every aspect of government policy and work being done to ensure the best education possible for our young people, we are looking at the role of our teacher librarians and the important function that they have within our schools. Recommendation 3 is:


The Committee recommends that the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority include statistical information about the breakdown of all specialist teachers, including teacher librarians, on the My School website.


This recommendation was made because it became clear that we do not know what specialist teachers we have in our schools. We found out in Queensland that you may have done a masters in teacher librarianship, you may be a specialist in this area, but when you register in Queensland as a teacher there is not even a category to identify yourself as a specialist in this area. That needs to be rectified. It also showed once again that we do not have consistency across the states. If we want consistent outcomes then we have to have consistency across the states on the value of teacher librarians and the recognition of this as a very important specialist teacher role.


There are many other recommendations in this report. I support each and every of one of those recommendations, as does every member who has spoken on this report. I know that this report was unanimously supported by all members from both sides of this parliament, as it should be. This is an extremely important report. It is one that I know many in my electorate have been eagerly awaiting the release of. I look forward to forwarding copies of this report out to those teacher librarians in the schools so that they can see what their effort to bring information to us has resulted in with these recommendations. I commend the report to the House. It is an extremely important report and one that I hope the government follows closely.


Debate adjourned.
