"PRESIDENT, The",,2016-02-02,"



The PRESIDENT
 (12:31):  I wish to make a statement to the Senate. As we begin our sittings for this year, I would like to remind all senators about standards that will be applied by the chair, particularly during question time, based on standing orders, longstanding practice and rulings of past presidents. Before Christmas I wrote to party leaders and whips about some of these matters, which are often raised by members of the public with my office.


Firstly, arguing and backchatting with the chair after a decision or ruling has been given is disorderly. Standing order 197 does provide senators with a right to take points of order but must be used appropriately. Persistent failure to come to order when requested to do so by the chair is also disorderly. Similarly, the level of noise and interjections in the chamber often make it impossible for me and others to hear and adjudicate on questions and answers. This is the national parliament; this is not a sporting contest. I do not have access to instant replay, so it can sometimes be very difficult.


Moreover, chairing the Senate is not a group participation activity. It is for the President to apply the standing and other orders. All questions of relevance are a matter for the judgement of the chair, a duty confirmed by the Procedure Committee back in 1994.


Under current rules, ministers must be directly relevant in their answers to the question asked, but it is also important to recognise that relevance and responsiveness are not the same concepts. This is a point which has been made by several of my predecessors, explaining that the chair cannot direct a minister how to answer a question or to give a particular answer. If I consider that ministers are not being directly relevant to the question, I will continue to draw their attention to the question, ask them to return to the question and remind them of the time remaining in which to answer that question. My expectation is that ministers will respond appropriately.


It has often been pointed out that questions might be more effective if they contained less extraneous material, including quotes, assertions, allegations, insinuations or other such material. After all, questions in their purest sense are for the purpose of seeking information, and answers should be similarly confined to providing that information.


However, if a question does contain additional material, the minister is directly relevant in his or her answer if he or she refers to subjects raised in that material. If a question contains a political barb, the minister is entitled, while remaining relevant and within the standing orders, to return the compliment. If senators require ministers to confine their answers strictly to a defined subject then the question itself must be confined to that subject. Again, I would expect ministers to confine the answers to that question.


In addition, supplementary questions must comply with the existing rules—namely, that they are for the purpose of elucidating information arising from the original answer and not for the purpose of introducing new or additional material or proposing a new question, even though such a new question might be related to the subject matter in the original question.


I hope that if senators comply with these rules question time will be far better for it and the Australian people will hopefully respond more favourably to the conduct of the Senate. I thank senators.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2016-02-02,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (12:36):  It is a great honour to kick off 2016 with the first contribution. I am in continuation on a speech that I think I started back in May last year, so forgive me if I am a bit rusty on some of the details of this bill. I had a lovely break with the family over Christmas and, during that break, I forgot most of what was in the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. But I swotted up on it this morning and I am ready to make a further contribution on this very important bill. It is rather an administrative and process driven bill, but nonetheless it is important because it is about ensuring, ultimately, that we have a more financially robust and sound way of ensuring people who are injured at work receive appropriate compensation. As I am sure you are aware, Mr President, the Comcare scheme is the Australian government scheme to help and rehabilitate workers who are injured, largely in Commonwealth workplaces but other agencies can be members of this scheme. Some Commonwealth agencies have their own arrangements and are not members of the Comcare scheme. The ACT previously had an arrangement where it was a member of this scheme for the purposes of its employees and was defined as a Commonwealth agency for those purposes.


The need for this bill to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 has largely been brought about because the ACT has made a decision to leave this scheme, which is their right. They have previously been a member of the scheme, but they have decided that it is too costly and there are too many delays, and they are going to seek their own arrangements for their public servants and employees. It is perfectly their right to do so. This decision was announced last February; on 26 February The Canberra Times reported that the ACT government would be leaving the Comcare scheme. Because of that, the Commonwealth government has decided that it is important to ensure the continuing financial viability of the Comcare scheme, notwithstanding the ACT leaving, because many of the employees or former employees who require compensation under the scheme are or were ACT public servants. Of course, with the ACT government leaving the scheme, there will be fewer premiums going forward to fund those costs. Indeed, my understanding is that the ACT government is the fourth-largest premium payer in the Comcare scheme, so it is a sizeable contributor to the overall budget. Given the sizeable number of ACT public servants, there would also be a sizeable number of those receiving compensation through the Comcare scheme. So the ACT's leaving will leave a financial burden for Comcare, and is very important we maintain its financial viability. To do so, the government has proposed providing arrangements for an exit fee for members who seek to exit the Comcare scheme. In this case, when the ACT exits, a fee will be calculated based on the actuarial value of the future commitments for those former ACT public servants and their compensation needs, and the ACT government will pay to leave the scheme. 


It is not a particularly novel approach to these arrangements. I made the point back in May that we have similar arrangements for irrigators who leave an irrigation scheme without paying or amortising the full cost of the network. When they leave, they have to pay an exit fee so that the rest of the irrigators are not left with those costs. The same arrangements will apply here. The ACT government will be asked to pay a fee so that all the other Commonwealth agencies are not asked to pick up the bill for ACT government employees.


It is also something that exists in other parts of the country. While this is the first time we will establish such an arrangement for Commonwealth workplace compensation, my understanding is that workplace compensation arrangements in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia all allow for an exit fee to be charged to agencies or organisations that leave their schemes. Those arrangements are similar to what we are proposing. It is a perfectly sensible approach to this particular issue that has arisen as a result of the ACT decision. While it is the first time we will set up an ongoing, committed and generic arrangement for exit fees, the Commonwealth parliament established similar arrangements when Medibank Private was privatised and it left the Comcare scheme. A fee was calculated for it, and special legislation was agreed to by the Australian parliament at the time to establish the authority to levy that fee. What we are doing here is simply repeating that approach, but we are not doing something specific for the ACT government. Instead, we are setting up a process which would apply if, in the future, any payer that is currently a Comcare premium payer decided to leave the Comcare scheme. 


The Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, chaired by my colleague Senator McKenzie, has looked at this issue as well. It recommended we should pass this particular scheme. It noted in its report that the current Comcare scheme is actually not fully financially funded. It is not fully funded right now because, over time, premiums in the past were not set based on actuarial values. Premiums paid into the scheme did not fully cover the costs of workplace injuries. However, there has been a slight improvement over the past year. I believe it had 68 per cent of funds available for what was measured as the actuarial funds needed. Around 68 per cent were covered. I believe that has gone up above 70 per cent in the past year, but there is still a sizeable unfunded gap there. Given that gap, we cannot afford to have that gap grow by not appropriately levying the ACT government for the ongoing costs imposed on the Comcare scheme by leaving and, of course, no longer paying premiums for its workplace employees who have been injured.


As I said, the Senate committee in its majority report recommended the bill be passed. However, I note that Labor senators on that committee did not quite agree. I do not believe they made a recommendation, but in their report Labor senators urged the government to request that the ACT government provide written assurances to ensure its workers would not be worse off. What that was going to was that the ACTU made a submission to the inquiry, saying that the new ACT workplace compensation scheme that could be established may not fully compensate workers for their injuries to the same level that the Comcare scheme does. As the government said in response to that, it is a matter for the ACT government. It is not a matter for the Commonwealth government. The Comcare scheme was not established to take care of ACT government employees. It was set up to allow the ACT government to have access to a well-funded and liquid pool of workplace insurance to meet its required needs—needs that it would establish. It is not our job to establish those needs; it is up to the ACT government. It is not the Commonwealth government's responsibility to decide how the ACT wants to deal with and fund workplace injuries in its own workplaces. We had this option available as a product. The ACT government has decided not to buy our product going forward. That is their right, but it is not our job to try to second guess what they want to do over the other side of the lake in their legislative assembly.


What was also a little bit unusual and perplexing about the Labor senators' recommendation that we request the ACT government to provide such assurances is that, as I said earlier, the ACT government made this decision and it was announced on 26 February last year. As many senators would be aware, the ACT Chief Minister at that time was Katy Gallagher, who is now a Labor senator in this place. Labor senators are saying that the decision made by that ACT government in February last year was insufficient and denied workers their proper rights. Well, instead of asking the ACT government, could they not just ask their colleague Senator Gallagher? That would be a suggestion for the Labor Party if they have concerns about this.


If they have concerns about the decision that the ACT government made last February, surely they could ask the former chief minister, who made that decision and signed off on that decision last February. They signed off on that decision last February. It was a decision made by Ms Katy Gallagher. I make no particular complaint about that decision. I do not know the specifics of what the ACT government had to consider when they decided to leave the Comcare scheme, but they made a considered decision to do so. Ms Katy Gallagher is now Senator Gallagher, senator for the ACT, and surely if they want an explanation about the decision making of the ACT government they could go to their own senator.


What this indicates to me is not that the Labor Party have some principled objection to the arrangements that are being put in place here—which, as I said, are rather technical and are replicated over the rest of the country, but that the Labor Party simply want to oppose everything that is put up by this government. They do not want to do anything that may be constructive and forward moving for our country, as limited as this particular issue is. They are simply on the lookout for particular political differences that they can abuse and take advantage of for political purposes, not for national interest purposes. That to me needs to be called out. Why are they really opposing this bill? Is it because the ACTU have said to do so and they have made a submission against it? Is it because some of them see Senator Gallagher as a threat to their future positions? She has just been promoted recently. Is that the reason? Why are they opposing this? A territory government of their own political colour has decided to do this, and they are still opposing it. This is a legislative amendment being proposed as a consequence of that ACT decision, but it is being proposed by a Liberal-National government and not by a Labor government. That is why they are opposing this.


I know the federal Labor Party seem to like to pick fights with state and territory governments at the moment. They are warring with at least one state Labor government at the moment, South Australia, about their confused position on how to fund policies. At the moment it is World War III between South Australia and the federal Labor Party over the GST. But you would think they could at least get their story straight on something as administrative as workplace compensation arrangements. But they cannot even do that. They will oppose everything we put up.


I think later this afternoon or this evening we will debate in this chamber a motion about how the Liberal-National party coalition have not changed. We have not changed, because we are continuing to provide good government and are continuing to make decisions like this in the interests of the nation. But the Labor Party also have not changed. A new year may have ticked over, but it is the same Labor Party opposing everything we put up. It is the same Labor Party simply wanting to make political points and not wanting to deal with issues overall in the national interest. They just oppose everything that the coalition government does. They are good at negativity, but they are not good on policy, and that is what their approach is here today.


Maybe I am being too pessimistic, Mr President. Perhaps I should be less cynical in my first contribution here today in this chamber. Maybe I should be more positive. I did say that I would turn over a new leaf on a few things. So maybe I should give the Labor Party a bit more of a fair go. Perhaps the next speaker on this bill will get up and say that over the break the Labor Party have reconsidered, they have turned over a new leaf, they have made a new year's resolution not to simply oppose everything, and they will come out and support this bill because it is pretty simple, it is technical and administrative and it happens in other states. Perhaps they will get behind the government and support this bill. Perhaps that is what they will do.


It is a new year and it is a new opportunity. Hopefully they have made some new year's resolutions, like the rest of us, and perhaps that is what they will do. If they do, I will have to come into this place and eat humble pie and I will have to say, 'The Labor Party have turned over a new leaf and they are going to support this.' Perhaps their next step will be to support more transparency and oversight of trade unions that have shown themselves to be completely worried about their own back pockets and not their workers' interests. Hopefully their next step will be that they join us in making sure that we reform those arrangements.


Maybe their next step will be to actually join us in how to fix our budget situation, which is still far too negative. We need to do more on that front, but the Labor Party have produced no suggestions to help fund budget repair over the longer term. Perhaps they will join us in a proper tax reform debate, rather than going around and eating lettuce and annoying mums and dads in supermarkets and running a ridiculous scare campaign. Perhaps they will do that as well but, I am sorry, Mr President, despite it being a new year, I am not that hopeful that the Labor Party will be dragged that far. But let us just hold our breath and hope that they will reconsider and join the coalition government here, the Liberal Party, the National Party, many of the crossbenchers and at times the Greens and actually help us to get something done for this country and move this place forward.


As I said, this issue in front of the government is not a nation-changing issue. This is not going to be a watershed moment for our Commonwealth. But it is small example of how an inflexible negative approach stops us from making the little decisions that add up to making this a better place and enabling better government and better governance for our whole nation. So I implore the Labor Party and other senators to look at the detail of this bill. It is a sensible bill. It builds on what is already a good scheme in Comcare. It uses other states as examples of what should be done in this scheme. It will help make sure that we have a sound financial footing for what is a very important scheme and it will help ensure that we can continue to pay those unfortunate workers who are injured while at work for the Commonwealth.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2016-02-02,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (12:51):  Just at the outset I note that Senator Canavan would not be a true Nat if he was not always in the doldrums. Nothing much has changed in relation to this bill over the Christmas break. He may have wished them all Christmas cheer, but this bill does not bring workers any cheer. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, which provides for the rehabilitation and compensation of injured employees of the Commonwealth, its agencies and statutory authorities and of eligible corporations. What this government has not owned up to is that it has brought this bill in by itself. This bill is really one part of three; it is a trio of bills through which this government is seeking to implement changes to Comcare and which will, when put together, significantly and adversely impact workers in this country. This particular piece of legislation concerns the exit arrangements for a declared Commonwealth authority which decides to exit the scheme. The Australian Capital Territory announced back in February last year its intention to leave the Commonwealth scheme and design its own scheme after a six-week consultation process. 


The problem with debating this bill in isolation is that we are not privy to the two other bills that the government has been trying to bring through this parliament. They sought to claim that they are not interrelated and to claim that they are not part of a trio of changes which will negatively impact workers under this scheme. What Labor continues to be concerned about is that this government should own up to this. They should declare that it is one of three bills; they should deal with them concurrently; they should deal with them appropriately. But I do not think they are game to do that. They want to be able to introduce this as a noncontroversial piece of legislation and then to persuade the Senate that we should adopt this one—it is not a trouble—and let it pass, but the true aim of the coalition is to gut Comcare and to adversely affect workers compensation schemes. They want to do—or try to do—what they did in Queensland many years ago, and that was to move to self-insurance; that is, they want to put it into the market so that workers' rights would no longer be covered by schemes that would give them a fairness opportunity and protect their legitimate compensation rights. That happened in Queensland: a previous coalition or Liberal-National government allowed self-insurance to occur, but around 21 large companies, including the Brisbane City Council, opted out of the scheme. That meant that the pool of white-collar workers significantly decreased and the remainder were left with high premiums. Further, they were left with some challenging industries that needed to improve their workers compensation and the safety outcome for workers. 


Those with lower premiums exit the scheme and that makes the remainder even less viable. The whole idea in Queensland was to junk the state scheme, and in this case the Commonwealth scheme, and allow the private market to flourish. It all sounds laissez-faire, but it means Commonwealth workers lose out. They end up in poor and overly watched schemes; they end up with compensation payments that are not related to their income and so they lose out. Underpinning all of this is the coalition's intention to head towards what the Queensland government tried to achieve back then. Thankfully, that was reversed by an incoming Labor government, which implemented a much stronger state based scheme—a scheme which looked after workers' interests but which adopted a carrot-and-stick approach to ensure that employers were rewarded with lower premiums if they looked after the safety of their employees. However, a number of self-insured entities remain in Queensland. I do not think the coalition have a stronger scheme as their root cause or their root desire here. What they ultimately want to do is put it out into the field to the detriment of workers more broadly.


The impact of these bills would be to reduce the premium pools in state workers compensation schemes. Labor's priority is, however, to ensure that workers are looked after and their rights and entitlements are maintained. If a worker is injured on the job, they must be properly compensated; they and their families must be able continue as before during this difficult period. Labor remains concerned that, with the introduction of this legislation, the government does not have the workers' best interests at heart; it is also concerned that there has been a lack of consultation. 


This government has not come clean with its aim by serving up the three bills, by claiming them to be unrelated and by arguing them one at a time. It smacks of a concerted effort to drive workers compensation down into the hands of self-insurers. The government has said that these changes to the Comcare scheme are designed to make the scheme more sustainable over time. That seems to mean cutting money out of schemes, which would mean a worse outcome for employees. I do not think you can look at it any other way. The government certainly have not claimed there is going to be any significant administrative saving that they can pass on. These bills, if passed, will see cuts to lump-sum compensation payable for permanent impairment for the vast majority of injured workers and they will remove the already modest pain-and-suffering payment. These bills will also mean changes to eligibility requirements, where injured workers may be locked out of schemes altogether. There will be a reduction in incapacity payments and an expansion of sanctions against workers, including: the removal of medical support if a worker fails to attend a medical appointment and harsh job search requirements for injured workers if they say they have no suitable employment, in which case they will need to find a job with a new employer or take up self-employment. There will be a new, punishing approach to workers with psychiatric injuries. Employers will have the right to impose health related and work capacity decisions. Workers will have no independent right of review when an employer orders them back to work. That is the direction that this government wants to take, with this bill being the first of the related bills. I think they should be highlighted for the path and direction they are pursuing.


In dealing more broadly with this bill, I think that Labor senators in the Education and Employment Legislation Committee made some very apposite remarks in their additional comments. Whilst Labor senators support legislation to ensure that an exiting employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit, the real heart of this issue is that we must ensure that no workers will be worse off under this legislation and that the passage of this bill will not provide an incentive for employers to disadvantage workers. Ultimately, the majority report did not address this in any significant way. 


We have dealt with this bill as a bureaucratic piece of legislation which will allow the ACT to exit the Comcare scheme, but ultimately we have not dealt with it as an instrument of how workers will be worse off if it is passed. Ultimately, the aim of this coalition government is to pass the costs of workers' compensation not onto employers but back onto employees themselves. We note, as outlined in senators' additional comments, that the reason for referring this bill to the committee was to ensure a thorough investigation of the bill and to allow sufficient time to consider the bill. However, since this bill was referred to the committee, the government introduced what I referred to earlier as the third substantive bill relating to Comcare. Given we do not have that bill before us, I think it means ultimately that there is nothing stopping the government, now that those bills have been introduced, from bringing them all together, laying out this strategy and telling us in no uncertain words what their intentions are. When you look at the related bills, it seems to be crystal clear that the legislation is all about attacking workers' rights. Labor senators remain unconvinced by the Department of Employment submission that the passage of this bill would not result in a reduced premium pool in state workers' compensation schemes, about which concerns were raised by the ETU and the Victorian government.


If you were going to improve the outcomes for Comcare workers and broadly allow for exits out of the Comcare scheme into state based schemes, you would not do it this way, by simply allowing the ACT government to exit the scheme, reducing the premium pool, and allowing others in state systems to exit Comcare and jump into less onerous state schemes. You would deal with states and territories more holistically to ensure that workers did not lose significant benefits on the way through. I do not think this government has any intention of doing that. When you look at the range of parts to the bills that are not before us, the picture becomes a lot clearer. This is simply the first tranche in that direction that this government is pursuing. When you look at the proposals that have been put forward—that employees who have been injured would not be allowed to choose their own doctor under Comcare, that approval of doctors and amounts payable would be set by regulation, and that it is Comcare that would determine what is and is not considered reasonable treatment, not an employee's treating doctor—you then get a flavour of the direction in which this government wants to take Comcare. To suggest that any person other than the treating doctor should determine the necessary treatment for an injured worker is quite frankly beyond belief. The bill also proposes severe cuts to incapacity payments for all workers. This would be particularly detrimental and would have the toughest impact on those employees with injuries which take longer to resolve or those who are permanently and significantly disabled. You can see that this is simply an attack on workers' entitlements to workers' compensation.


The government has sought the support of Labor and the crossbench for this legislation. I would urge the crossbench to reject this bill as part of a trilogy of bills through which this government is seeking to cut compensation outcomes for workers. Our first priority should be to ensure that workers will not be worse off under the proposed federal government bill. There is no such clear guarantee coming from this government on that point. We have heard speakers talk about this bill but not give a guarantee that workers will not be made worse off as a consequence of its introduction. It is within the minister's power, in her summing up speech on the second reading, to state that it is not the intention to rip money out of workers' pockets, to short-change them on compensation payments, to make it difficult or impossible to achieve a reasonable workers' compensation outcome. It is important that this government does not make adverse changes to the Comcare scheme, because those proposed changes would directly and indirectly risk the workplace health and safety of Australian workers.


In the first Comcare bill that the government introduced it sought to hollow out state schemes by opening up the Comcare scheme to private sector companies by applying a very liberal definition of what a national employer is. The reduced premiums pools in state workers compensation schemes would mean increasing premiums for remaining businesses in those schemes and would add significant pressure on workers' entitlements. This bill, if constructed incorrectly, may provide leverage for the federal government to force entities to stay in the Comcare scheme, which the now Turnbull government is going to try and make further adverse changes to. We know that the government has more bills to come. It has at least made its plan more transparent than it was when this bill was first introduced. I think the time is now right for this government to lay out its entire plan of how it is going to address Comcare from go to whoa and what its intentions are, because we can only now glean it from the trilogy of bills it seeks to have passed in this parliament. This government should make plain what its intentions are in relation to workers compensation, particularly Comcare itself, when you look at its intentions more broadly. But I do not think they will. I think they will continue to say, 'This is one single bill. This is about allowing the ACT to exit the Comcare scheme and nothing more.' I do not think that is a reasonable answer to this.


When you look at self-insurance issues, these bills will widen the pool of employers' eligibility for self-insurance. It will enable an employer with employees in more than one state to apply for a self-insurance licence, which exempts them from paying premiums in those states where it is currently registered, and will allow an employer to be responsible for managing its own workers compensation claims. This occurred in Queensland in the nineties. It was unsuccessful and it did not last. It did have a significant adverse impact on the existing workers compensation scheme in that state. I think it would have ultimately driven it into oblivion. I think that is the underlying direction that this government wants to take—to drive workers compensation into self-insurance markets, drive it away from properly funded compensation schemes for employees and put it in the employers' hands so that they can drive premiums down. They can do that by driving outcomes for workers down by making it harder and harder for employees to be fairly compensated for when unfortunate injuries do occur in the workplace. Ultimately it will do nothing to improve and incentivise employers to provide good safety outcomes for their employees in the first instance, because, of course, the best way to avoid an injury is to have a safe place of work in the first place and not have to ultimately pay workers compensation. 


But I think the employers who have the ear of this government want the best of both worlds. They want the ability to not spend their money on ensuring a safe place of work and then not spend their money on premiums to assist workers should they be injured as a consequence of their own inactions or neglect. Of course, the most concerning aspects of these bills is the absence of a robust regulatory framework for managing self-insurers. What this government would do, if it was serious about dealing with this in a broad way, would be to also implement a regulatory framework for managing self-insurers. It would not be a trilogy of bills. There would be four bills to deal with this.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2016-02-02,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:11):  Can I indicate at the outset that I will be supporting the second reading stage of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. But I do reserve my position in respect of the third reading stage because there are a number of legitimate questions that need to be asked and ventilated in the committee stages. That is what the role of the Senate is on an important piece of legislation such as this. I want to thank the minister and her office for their assistance today, and I also thank the opposition. I met with the shadow minister, Brendan O'Connor, early today and spoke to his office about that. I do have a number of unanswered questions about the position of both the government and the opposition in respect of this.


I think it is interesting to note that in the additional comments to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's report on this bill from a number of months ago Labor senators expressed some reservations about the bill rather than outright opposition. I accept and respect that the opposition has since changed its position, as they are entitled to, to oppose the bill. But I want to take issue with one thing that Senator Ludwig said. It is not a criticism, but it is an issue—he is coming back into the chamber.



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator XENOPHON:
  I would not be too worried, Senator Ludwig. Senator Ludwig says that this bill will allow for a reduction in the benefits of injured workers. The only thing that will allow for the reduction of the benefits of injured workers will be if the ACT government imposes a scheme that will reduce the benefits for injured workers compared to the Commonwealth scheme. I suppose one argument is that, in respect of the Comcare scheme, it allows an exit to something that is unknown, so I will accept that. But ultimately it is up to the ACT government as to whether they want to take a draconian approach in respect of this.


I do want to disclose that I am still, for my sins, proprietor of a very small law firm that practices in the field of workers compensation law in South Australia. My understanding is that we do very little Comcare work. I was, in my previous prepolitical life, president of the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association in South Australia, as it then was, when we campaigned very hard against the then Olsen Liberal government's changes to workers compensation laws. I remember that Graham Ingerson, who I regard as a friend of mine and who was then Deputy Premier, asked me about my time as a member of the Communist Party at university. I had to tell him gently that, in fact, I was a member of the Liberal club, when he accused me of being a Marxist for opposing the legislation.


I can say this: whatever the then Brown and Olsen Liberal governments proposed in workers compensation changes was very mild in comparison to what a state Labor government ended up doing years later. From 1 July 2015, the Weatherill government has introduced draconian changes to workers' rights—much more sweeping and much more draconian than anything a Liberal government proposed. It has taken away workers' rights substantially, and it seems that some unions—including the peak body, SA Unions—rolled over in relation to those changes, which I will refer to briefly.


The framework established by this bill will allow Comcare to determine and collect exit contributions from former Commonwealth authorities. Senator Cash has characterised this—and I think it is not unfair to characterise it—as a procedural bill, a process bill, because, if an entity such as the ACT government wants to exit the scheme, it can do so but there will be some ambiguities or some uncertainty in respect of the transitional provisions. I guess the question I want to ask in respect of the committee stage is: will the absence of this bill make it impossible for the ACT government to exit this scheme? In other words, whilst I accept in good faith that the minister says that this is a process bill, if this bill is not passed, will it effectively mean that the ACT government cannot proceed with its plans to exit the scheme, or will it simply mean that it can exit the scheme but there will be a lot of uncertainty for workers? I think that is something that needs to be dealt with in the fullness and thoroughness of a committee stage.


I understand that the government say that they want an existing employer not to be able to leave the scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities, and I think that is one thing that needs to be taken into account. The bill also seeks to ensure that any employees injured before their employer exits the Comcare scheme continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority. The question that I will ask in the context of a committee stage is: what will that mean to injured workers? Will they still be subject to existing Comcare legislation for those injured before that date, and what will happen if there is an aggravation? This is a technical question: if somebody has a primary injury and then they are injured subsequently in the course of any new scheme, how is there an interplay between Comcare and any new scheme in respect of that? This is something that is coming to mind now—I just want to make that clear to the minister. It is not a trick question. I genuinely want to get to the bottom of this.


In essence, this bill provides a pathway for agencies to leave the Comcare scheme while requiring them to honour their obligations to injured workers. That, I think, characterises the government's position. The opposition is saying, 'Don't support this, because it will lead to a reduction in workers' benefits.' But if they can, under the current legislative framework, exit the scheme and you cannot stop them from exiting the scheme, are we at least providing more certainty? That, to me, is the nub of one of the issues.


The impetus for this bill is the ACT government's announcement that it wishes to leave the Comcare scheme. I understand the ACT government can do this whenever it likes and that it does not need permission or approval from the Commonwealth government to do so. But whether facilitating this bill would make the difference as to whether this goes ahead or not is one of the issues that I think need to be explored in the committee stage. There is currently missing from the ACT government's exit pathway a requirement that it honour its existing obligations to injured workers, and that, I understand, is the government's motivation for this bill: it is attempting to close this loophole.


But, in the bigger picture, the Comcare scheme covers employees working for Commonwealth government agencies and statutory authorities—excluding members of the Australian Defence Force—as well as the ACT government and agencies and corporations who have been granted a licence to self-insure, provided the date of the injury was after the date of the licence. I just want to understand—and this was raised by the Senate committee's report—the effect that the bill may have on workers and their entitlements. I think that is a legitimate question. There is also an issue as to the breadth of this scheme: what other agencies or authorities can avail themselves of this bill? In other words, will it make it easier for other agencies or authorities to exit the bill? The point that Senator Ludwig made is: will that affect the viability of Comcare in itself? Will it mean a shrinking pool of revenue? Has any advice been provided by Comcare to the government about its viability with a smaller premium pool, if you like, with these proposed legislative changes?


I just want to reflect briefly on the fact that Comcare is far from perfect. Comcare was established in order to support workers who have suffered a workplace injury or illness. It is there to help employees recover and, where appropriate, return to work. That is what all workers compensation schemes should be doing, and it carries with it a very heavy responsibility.


When I think of Comcare, there is one case that always comes to mind—and I can refer to this because I introduced a bill to this effect—and it relates to my constituent Barry Crush. In 1988, Mr Crush was the master and chief engineer of the lighthouse supply vessel MV Candela. During a supply run, the ship was caught in a gale with 35-foot waves and 70-kilometre-per-hour winds. Rushing to secure equipment on deck that could otherwise shift or possibly capsize the ship, Barry fell 10 metres onto the deck. He broke his back, his ankle and his knee and suffered massive soft tissue damage. He was forced to stay on the ship while the gale raged for another three days, and what occurred when he finally got to shore was nothing short of disgraceful. He was treated appallingly by Comcare. They lost his files. They ignored him. The man had to live in the most appalling conditions until his claim was resolved many years later.


I must pay tribute to the former head of Comcare Paul O'Connor, who made a specific trip to Adelaide to go to my office and personally meet Mr Crush and apologise for Comcare getting it so absolutely wrong. There was subsequently a mediation settled on confidential terms, where I believe there was a satisfactory resolution of Mr Crush's claim on a fair basis for all parties involved. But that was a case where Comcare got it absolutely wrong and where an ombudsman's report was very critical of Comcare. Legislation that I put up to try to remedy that, whilst it was not passed, did ventilate the issue, and the eventual apology from Comcare meant a lot to Mr Crush and the matter was resolved. It shows you that Comcare can get it wrong, as can other workers compensation agencies, but Comcare did demonstrate that it was capable of owning up to its mistakes and making amends for them.


The ACT government wants to get out of the Comcare scheme, and it has cited long processing delays, high premiums and ineffective rehabilitation services as the reasons for which it wishes to leave Comcare. On the one hand, there is the Electrical Trades Union supporting that exit from Comcare, saying that the ACT should get out of the Comcare scheme. On the other hand, there is the ACTU saying, 'Not so fast! We want to know what scheme workers will be left with.' If it is simply a matter of process—and this is something that I think the committee stage ought to look at—and this is an inevitable move that the ACT government will go ahead with, then it is appropriate to have some process measures in place. I wonder, though, whether the scope of this going beyond the ACT government is appropriate at this stage. That is something that needs to be dealt with in the committee stage.


A March 2015 Canberra Times article gave figures released by the ACT government which showed that, of the 531 current territory claims, only 45 were less than a year old—in fact, more than 200 of the claims dated back more than a decade. So you really wonder whether Comcare had fulfilled its role in terms of workers rehabilitation and getting people back to work. What concerns me is the absence of any comprehensive details of a replacement scheme that injured ACT government workers will be subject to once their employer leaves Comcare. The contrary argument is: 'If they can leave Comcare anyway, there is not much you can do about it.' But I would prefer that the ACT government provide details of how that scheme will work. The March 2015 Canberra Times article referred to the ACT's Minister for Workplace Safety and Industrial Relations, Mick Gentleman, who revealed that there would be no compensation payable for pain and suffering under the new scheme. That concerns me, but, if there is a statutory scheme for lump sum payments for permanent disability, that may ameliorate those concerns. We do not know what they are planning, and that is something that needs to be taken into account.


I want to reflect very briefly on how bad things are in South Australia. It was a Labor government that slashed benefits effective from 1 July 2015. WorkCover SA has been transformed to ReturnToWorkSA, but it could well be rebadged as 'ReturnToOblivionSA', because what has happened in that state, my home state, is that many injured workers will find themselves cut off from benefits, facing the loss of their homes and in extremely difficult situations because a Labor government in that state changed the law in a draconian way. It will be a disaster for injured workers. For instance—and it concerns me that the ACT government may go down this path—it changed the criteria for assessing workplace injuries. Under the Return to Work Act in South Australia, an injured worker's payments will cease after two years from the date the incapacity occurred, unless the injury is a 30 per cent whole-of-body impairment. Examples of a whole-of-body impairment would include a severe brain injury, multiple spinal fractures and, for instance, severe injuries to both shoulders together with carpal tunnel syndrome of both hands so that you cannot effectively use your hands and your arms. Short of that, one or two spinal fractures will not do it. You will lose your benefits, even though you will never be able to go back to your work if you were in a manual job. If you have a so-called mild brain injury which means that you cannot perform cognitively as you could before, and it is a requirement of your job to have even a moderate or high level of cognitive functioning, you will be pretty well gone in terms of benefits. What concerns me is that, if the ACT government adopts the South Australian legislation, it might involve a slight reduction in premiums but it will involve a massive reduction in the benefits for genuinely and seriously injured workers.


I understand the government's argument that we cannot stop this from happening, but I do think there are some legitimate questions to ask about the scope of this legislation, how it will work, what safeguards are in place and whether other government authorities and agencies can avail themselves of this facilitative legislation. That is where I am at. It is an issue I have a particular interest in, given my previous life working as a workers compensation lawyer. I do want to engage constructively with the government and my colleagues in the opposition in relation to this. I think it is worth supporting this bill at the second reading stage, but there are some reasonable and legitimate questions that need to be asked in the committee stage before a final decision is made.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-02-02,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:27):  I have only been in the chamber for a short period of time while the contributions have been made on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. I have had the opportunity to listen to Senator Ludwig's contribution and the contribution of Senator Xenophon. I have to say that there was an extraordinary contrast in the approaches of these two senators to this bill.


Senator Xenophon is taking a very sensible approach. Obviously, he is seeking more information about what the detail of this bill is and the consequences on the people that would be affected by this bill—most particularly and most importantly those people who are currently injured and off work and who are requiring the assistance of an insurer to get them back to work, hopefully, but in some instances to look after them because their injuries are such that they may not be able to return to the work that they had previously done. He has offered to engage in a constructive debate to try to reach an outcome that is in the best interests of these particular people. He also acknowledges that, in a situation where the federal government may not have the capacity or ability to have control over what a government such as the ACT government might do in this space, the Commonwealth has an obligation to make sure that we make the best of the situation so that, once again, the people who are impacted by this action are the ones that we seek to protect.


Contrasting with that was the contribution that I heard from Senator Ludwig, where he seems to have either purposely or through ignorance—I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt and suggest that he has probably not done this purposely—tried to confuse what has been proposed in this bill with other bills that may be proposed to be put before this place. At the moment before the Senate—I will start again—is the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. This bill is a process bill. It is not a substantive bill; it does not deal with arrangements specifically about compensation. It is a process bill—and I will say this quite clearly—that has no capacity to have any adverse effect on employees' entitlements to compensation. I think that is absolutely the key to this.


The fact that Senator Ludwig would come in here and state in the chamber that there is any capacity whatsoever for the passage of this bill to be likely to have a detrimental impact on the entitlements and the benefits that are currently being received by employees I think does a disservice to him and to this place because all this serves to do is to create uncertainty, fear and concern in the minds of the people who are impacted by this, when there is no need for that to happen.


I take my role as a senator very seriously in that I am here representing the people of Australia—and in this instance I am here to represent the interests of the people who, potentially, would be impacted on if the ACT chooses to follow through with its decision of February last year to exit this particular scheme—who are currently being compensated under that particular scheme, ensuring that their rights and entitlements are protected into the future. So it is not my job to use scaremongering tactics for political purposes, to make the lives of those people even more miserable than they currently are. As you would well know, Madam Acting Deputy President, to be injured in any situation—workplace or otherwise—is a very debilitating thing to have happen, and these people need all the support that we can give them. Carrying on with this kind of scaremongering activity that we saw from Senator Ludwig earlier on I think is very sad, and it would be very sad that he could use these people for political gain.


The reality is that this bill actually protects the rights of those employees. I really hope that it is possible, when we get into the committee stage of this bill, that Senator Ludwig comes into this place and properly clarifies to some extent what he was actually up to in his comments earlier on this morning so that he can put the minds of those people who are impacted at the moment by the requirement for compensation for a workplace injury in the ACT to rest. Let us be really clear: this bill is set to amend the compensation act of 1998—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1998, or the SRC Act, as it is known—to provide financial and other arrangements when a Commonwealth authority which is a premium payer exits the Comcare workers compensation scheme.


We saw in February 2015 that the ACT government announced that it intended to leave the Comcare scheme to establish its own workers compensation arrangements. It is interesting: if my memory serves me correctly I would suggest that Senator Katy Gallagher would still have been the Chief Minister of the ACT at the time. As Senator Xenophon rightly points out, sometimes you have to be a little bit careful about what you wish for in this space. Often you may think that a scheme is not particularly good, but the downside of trying to set up a scheme for yourself—as we found out in South Australia—needs to be taken into account. The one thing that needs to be very clear in this is that in a situation like we have seen in South Australia, under the workers compensation scheme that we have there, is that we need to make sure that the injured workers are not the ones who are disadvantaged because of mismanagement, bad management or inefficient management of a scheme. We take that as a given.


But the reality of the bill that we have before us at the moment is that it actually does not delve into those sorts of details. What it actually serves to do is just to make sure that anybody who is currently covered under the ACT scheme in this specific instance—or, for that matter, any other scheme—is not disadvantaged if that particular Commonwealth entity decides that it is going to exit this particular scheme.


The purpose of the bill is quite specifically to close that legislative gap. It would ensure that when the ACT—or, for that matter, any other employer—leaves the scheme that they pay a contribution to cover their liabilities as they currently exist so that the Commonwealth is not left to pick up the tab. As you would know, quite rightly, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds—coming from an economic background—when the Commonwealth is left to pick up the tab that means that the taxpayers of Australia are left to pick up the tab. We need to make sure that in every message we send from this place people understand that if we continually keep putting an expense on this government all we are doing is making sure that those people who currently pay the taxation in this country are being asked to pick up an ever-increasing burden because of these actions. It is our responsibility as federal legislators to make sure that we do what we can to minimise the impact on the taxpayers of Australia, who are our responsibility.


Currently, the act does not include any arrangements to enable an employer who leaves the scheme to be responsible for their liabilities after exit. What we are saying is that the ACT government is more than welcome to leave the scheme; the reality is that there is probably very little that we can do about it as a Commonwealth government—and you could possibly even question whether we should be doing anything about it as a federal government. But if they choose to leave the scheme they cannot just automatically pass the liability that they currently hold onto the new entity. So all this bill serves to do is to say to the ACT government, 'You need to be responsible for your existing liability.' If they want to transfer out of the scheme, obviously, they pick up their new liability when they start with their new scheme, but it is not for the taxpayers of the whole of Australia to pick up the tab for what currently exists and is currently a liability of the ACT.


As I said—and I think this is the most important thing—this bill does not impact on employees' benefits. I cannot say that often enough and I cannot stress that highly enough. The reality is that the content of this bill more broadly is not new. This has occurred in other jurisdictions around Australia before, so there is nothing new in this.


Specifically, the amendments to this bill will enable Comcare to calculate the liabilities of an existing employer—in this case the ACT—and issue them with a levy to ensure that the liabilities are covered once the employer leaves the scheme. This will ensure that the Commonwealth is not left picking up the tab. Contributions will be determined on a cost recovery basis, so it will not allow the Commonwealth to recover anything more than the debt that is currently owed. There is no capacity whatsoever for any gouging or anything to occur in this space; the Commonwealth will merely have a mechanism by which an existing liability that does not reside with us does not end up residing with us. It remains residing where it currently exists. This is sensible management on the part of the government.


It also ensures that employees who are injured before their employer leaves the scheme will continue to receive compensation from Comcare on the same terms as well as ongoing support for their rehabilitation and, hopefully, their return to work.


Obviously, on the basis of the information that is contained within this bill—for those who have had the opportunity to go through the detail of this bill—it is quite clear that this bill is a process bill, is responsible because it is ensuring liability rests where liability should rest and at no time and in no way threatens the benefits of employees. I think we need to be very clear in debating this particular bill that we understand what the bill actually does and that we do not confuse the debate by suggesting that we are actually in here talking about issues that relate to the entitlements, benefits or, most importantly, ongoing rehabilitation of employees and their capacity to go back to work. They are very important issues and at times will obviously be the subject of other pieces of legislation that come through this place, but to confuse this particular bill with something as important as that and to use it for political purposes are horrendous things for us to be doing.


Right now the SRC Act does not set out what happens if the ACT or any other Commonwealth employer leaves the scheme. The legislation does not currently require an employer to contribute towards its liabilities for claims when it leaves Comcare. As a result, there could be insufficient funds to cover claims made by employees of that employer after they have left the scheme. As I said before, it effectively leaves the responsibility or the liability at the foot of the taxpayer. This bill seeks to do nothing more than change that.


It says to any Commonwealth entity that is currently in the scheme, 'If you leave the scheme, you must accept your liabilities and your responsibilities as they currently exist.' If the bill is not passed then the Commonwealth will be left with the ACT's liabilities for its workers. Whilst at no time is there any suggestion whatsoever that those workers and the entitlements and benefits that those workers are entitled to are under question, we accept the fact that they will have to be, effectively, accepted by an entity. This bill responsibly says that that entity needs to remain the liability of the ACT and not be a burden on the taxpayers of Australia.


The reality is that the federal government does not have the power to prevent the ACT from leaving Comcare even though the ACT government made the announcement back on 25 February 2015. My understanding is that they actually have not taken the necessary actions to exit. Before they go rushing off down there, maybe they might like to think a little about some of the experiences of other jurisdictions when they have chosen to leave the scheme. But it will be very interesting to have a look at the contribution made by the Labor senator for the ACT, Katy Gallagher, to this given her very intimate involvement in the decision by the ACT government to go down this path in the first place.


Obviously it is quite clear that I believe it is very important that we see this bill passed. As I said, it is administrative. It is process. There is nothing about this bill that even needs to get anybody remotely exercised or concerned about it. It is just good government on behalf of the current government. We are seeking to make sure that we protect the interests of the people that we represent. At the same time, we are making sure that we protect the interests of those people who are affected directly by the actions of the ACT in saying that they are choosing to leave this particular scheme.


I commend the bill to this place but I most particularly commend the bill to those opposite, that they actually take a little bit of a step back and have a think about the consequences of allowing this bill to go through and most particularly about the consequences for the people who currently require the compensation and benefits that exist under this particular scheme. Think about the implications of scaremongering about this particular piece of legislation. Have a think about the impact on their state of health, their state of mind and their families, because they do not have, as we have in this place, the benefit of a number of people who assist us in interpreting legislation and making sure that we understand clearly the intent of the legislation and the consequences of the legislation if it is passed or not passed. All these people will see is possibly a headline in the paper: 'Federal government legislation'—or bill—'has the potential to reduce benefits to injured workers in the ACT.' That is an irresponsible thing to be saying in this place and a completely irresponsible thing to be saying anywhere.


So I would call on those opposite when they get up to make a contribution, when they ask questions or when they debate bills such as this that they restrict their debate to facts of the matter and make sure that they very clearly understand the consequences of anything they say not only for people in our community that are not as well equipped as we are to get the information about these things but also for people who are in a vulnerable state because they have suffered a workplace injury—and some of them have quite serious workplace injuries. So they might be sitting at home, they might have limited information, and all we are serving to do is to cause them to worry more about what their circumstances might be into the future and, in the process of doing that, probably hindering their recovery.


It has been a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on this bill. I commend the bill to the house. I hope that we will see some sensible debate about the substance of this bill and not a whole heap of scaremongering, which is what seems to have occurred by some who have spoken on this bill before me.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2016-02-02,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (13:45):  I rise to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. It is always a pleasure and a privilege to stand in this place and make a contribution to anything that is about the safety, rehabilitation and compensation of workers who may have tragically been injured in the workplace. I am no stranger to the topic because, in an eclectic career before coming into the Senate, I spent 20 years as the managing director of an insurance loss adjusting firm that worked all over the world on issues of compensation. So I am as familiar as anyone might be in the architectural environment that one works in when there are claims for compensation, particularly where people have been injured and/or killed in circumstances obviously beyond their control. It is a very significant area and I can tell you firsthand that I have met with hundreds and possibly thousands of victims of injury in the workplace, or of death or injury in events beyond their control, and I can give this chamber the assurance that I would not give my support to any piece of legislation that I thought diminished or weakened what arrangements were in place for genuinely injured people who find themselves in that situation.


Before I start on the specific facts of the bill, I would like to attach myself to the remarks of Senator Ruston, who talked about the circumstances of these people. I am sure that most of us know someone who was injured in the workplace. Indeed many of our colleagues from across the chamber, having been involved in the trade union movement, have a proud tradition of fighting for the rights of these workers in the time past and would also agree that this can be a monstrously depressing and difficult period of time not just for the person who is injured but indeed for their whole extended family and their friends. I have seen people whose lives have been put on hold for many years. It is almost as if in some instances they suffer a psychosis when they realise that their life has been so affected by an injury in their workplace that they will never recover to 100 per cent. I can say to you with some experience that they never ever come to terms with that 100 per cent either.


So I urge all who are making a contribution to the debate on this bill to be very careful with their language. This is no time to be exacerbating the circumstances of people who are watching, who have an interest in what we might do as a parliament with this legislation or who currently have, for example, a pending claim that might be affected by the changes that are being proposed here. I want for anyone listening to my contribution to understand there are no circumstances under which I would support any legislation that I thought diminished the circumstances that these people—current and future—might find themselves in.


This legislation is, amongst other things, a necessary and probably precautionary piece of legislation that has every right to anticipate that there may be departures from the current scheme; therefore, certain provisions have been made. There are no current arrangements for exits. If you accept the proposition put by some across the chamber, this does not worry those opposite. They think that the Commonwealth should necessarily pick up all these contingent liabilities in the event that one of the major clients of the scheme were to leave to go and self-insure or to go to the private sector for premiums.


This legislation is about three or four core issues and core values. It is about time. It is about an anticipation that things may happen in the future and it is responsible to ensure that the legislation has sufficient scope to cope with these departures in the event that they occur. I had the experience of working on cases all over the world where it could take well in excess of 20 years. In fact, the major piece of case law in the United States Supreme Court relating to compensation was the Chick Kam Choo case and it went for 21 years before the family were able to secure an adequate outcome for their action. That we might have a customer of Comcare leave—in this case, the ACT—and leave behind the potential of contingent liability, as you know, is a matter of law. An individual has the right to bring about a claim with respect to their circumstances all the way through until the age of majority. It is not just the affected person. The estate and the minors who might be entitled can bring a claim all the way through to their age of majority. In the worst possible circumstances, events could give rise to liability on the part of this insurance agency, and they would not even be aware of it for 17 years.


If one studies the international architectural structure of Lloyd's of London, their books traditionally will run for almost 30 years. When they put together what is called an insurance book, based in London, New York, Paris or wherever they decide to locate the book, it can have a life of some 30 years. Even on the retirement, even on the sunset closure, of that particular book scheme, it will have a reserve made for contingent liabilities. Actuaries sit, look and decide what that reserve ought to be when having regard to the circumstances before them and the types of liabilities that they might be responsible for, and then they make a financial provision. Indeed, if that provision fails, Lloyd's of London continue to have an ongoing liability within those arrangements. 


What this bill proposes to do, at the heart of the bill, is to create an environment where, if one of the participants in the current scheme decides to leave, an assessment will be made of the contingent liabilities, and they will be burdened with having to make provision for them into the future. You do not even need to be a legislator to understand the simple proposition that, if you are responsible, if you have received the benefit of a premium and you have provided an extension of cover to an individual, or you somehow have a related interest in their claim, you have an ongoing liability. I am certain that even colleagues opposite will not want to see us tracking around the countryside trying to recover money from the ACT in 10 years time. 


The presentation made by some opposite that somehow Henny Penny is going to become a big player in this exercise if this legislation is passed, and that the sky is going to fall in, is pure scaremongering. In fact, it is inconsistent. I listened very carefully to the contribution by Senator Ludwig. You always know when the Labor Party are struggling to make what sounds like a credible contribution on a very difficult issue to articulate. They roll out Senator Ludwig.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No. They roll out Senator Ludwig. You do not get a look in, Senator; I am sorry. The minute you start to talk on a subject, everyone listens intently, looking for all the gaps in the argument. But Senator Ludwig comes in here with a monotone—good afternoon, Senator; good to see you—and it is a bit like that saying: you should not operate heavy machinery while listening to Senator Ludwig. But today, if you did listen—and I did listen intently as I was preparing to make my contribution—Senator Ludwig simply concentrated 100 per cent on perceived negatives of this legislation. Some of the statements he made were completely unfounded. I would have to say that, had Senator Ludwig wanted to polish the shield of the Labor Party with his contribution, by talking about benefits for workers, he might have mentioned the fact that when the scheme transitioned under the Labor government—and they want to criticise our measures—the scheme was only funded actuarially by 68 per cent of its 100 per cent commitment. In less than two years the coalition government have lifted that to 76 per cent. Any of you who are students of commerce and insurance would know that that has been a phenomenal effort. At the same time, there has been a reduction in the premiums. 


This legislation is not about doing anything that might attack or diminish the cover that different employees have. It is about preserving it, and it is about ensuring that it will remain there into the future. It will close proposed loopholes in the event that the ACT, or any other entity, decides to leave the scheme for self-insurance. It will ensure that those who were in their employ, or under their insurance umbrella, who have been injured will have their rights preserved for a long period of time. It is all about confidence for the workers. It is not about scaring the workers. This legislation is about providing those workers with the confidence that what they thought was so is indeed so, and that in their circumstances nothing will change, notwithstanding that their employer may have decided to go and self-insure. 


I listened carefully to the contribution of Senator Xenophon, who on occasions does make a reasonable case on issues. I listened to his contribution about the behaviour of the government of South Australia as they went to self-insure for their workers compensation. I think he made a resounding argument as to why this legislation should go through and be supported in this place by any senator or any group of senators who have the interests of workers at the heart of their intentions. If you really believe in supporting the workers, if you believe in providing them with—





Senator Lines:
  You don't. That's for sure!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I know it is getting difficult, because over time the good work of this coalition government has been eroding your reputation with the workers. Indeed, over the next couple of weeks your position is going to be tested very thoroughly—as Senator Ludwig referred to in a coded way in his contribution to this debate.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Didn't you watch the news in New York?




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No; I have not watched TV since I watched The Killing Season triangulation on the Labor Party. I have been too frightened to go back! But the fact of the matter is that this is all about providing this stability and this security for workers. I am almost out of time, but let me make the important point: I invite you to join us to ensure this legislation passes and provides the workers with the security that they are entitled to and that this government is determined to give them.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, have you concluded your remarks or do you wish to be in continuation?




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I was burdened by the clock, Mr President.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you. You are in continuation, Senator O'Sullivan.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2016-02-02,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (12:36):  It is a great honour to kick off 2016 with the first contribution. I am in continuation on a speech that I think I started back in May last year, so forgive me if I am a bit rusty on some of the details of this bill. I had a lovely break with the family over Christmas and, during that break, I forgot most of what was in the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. But I swotted up on it this morning and I am ready to make a further contribution on this very important bill. It is rather an administrative and process driven bill, but nonetheless it is important because it is about ensuring, ultimately, that we have a more financially robust and sound way of ensuring people who are injured at work receive appropriate compensation. As I am sure you are aware, Mr President, the Comcare scheme is the Australian government scheme to help and rehabilitate workers who are injured, largely in Commonwealth workplaces but other agencies can be members of this scheme. Some Commonwealth agencies have their own arrangements and are not members of the Comcare scheme. The ACT previously had an arrangement where it was a member of this scheme for the purposes of its employees and was defined as a Commonwealth agency for those purposes.


The need for this bill to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 has largely been brought about because the ACT has made a decision to leave this scheme, which is their right. They have previously been a member of the scheme, but they have decided that it is too costly and there are too many delays, and they are going to seek their own arrangements for their public servants and employees. It is perfectly their right to do so. This decision was announced last February; on 26 February The Canberra Times reported that the ACT government would be leaving the Comcare scheme. Because of that, the Commonwealth government has decided that it is important to ensure the continuing financial viability of the Comcare scheme, notwithstanding the ACT leaving, because many of the employees or former employees who require compensation under the scheme are or were ACT public servants. Of course, with the ACT government leaving the scheme, there will be fewer premiums going forward to fund those costs. Indeed, my understanding is that the ACT government is the fourth-largest premium payer in the Comcare scheme, so it is a sizeable contributor to the overall budget. Given the sizeable number of ACT public servants, there would also be a sizeable number of those receiving compensation through the Comcare scheme. So the ACT's leaving will leave a financial burden for Comcare, and is very important we maintain its financial viability. To do so, the government has proposed providing arrangements for an exit fee for members who seek to exit the Comcare scheme. In this case, when the ACT exits, a fee will be calculated based on the actuarial value of the future commitments for those former ACT public servants and their compensation needs, and the ACT government will pay to leave the scheme. 


It is not a particularly novel approach to these arrangements. I made the point back in May that we have similar arrangements for irrigators who leave an irrigation scheme without paying or amortising the full cost of the network. When they leave, they have to pay an exit fee so that the rest of the irrigators are not left with those costs. The same arrangements will apply here. The ACT government will be asked to pay a fee so that all the other Commonwealth agencies are not asked to pick up the bill for ACT government employees.


It is also something that exists in other parts of the country. While this is the first time we will establish such an arrangement for Commonwealth workplace compensation, my understanding is that workplace compensation arrangements in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia all allow for an exit fee to be charged to agencies or organisations that leave their schemes. Those arrangements are similar to what we are proposing. It is a perfectly sensible approach to this particular issue that has arisen as a result of the ACT decision. While it is the first time we will set up an ongoing, committed and generic arrangement for exit fees, the Commonwealth parliament established similar arrangements when Medibank Private was privatised and it left the Comcare scheme. A fee was calculated for it, and special legislation was agreed to by the Australian parliament at the time to establish the authority to levy that fee. What we are doing here is simply repeating that approach, but we are not doing something specific for the ACT government. Instead, we are setting up a process which would apply if, in the future, any payer that is currently a Comcare premium payer decided to leave the Comcare scheme. 


The Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, chaired by my colleague Senator McKenzie, has looked at this issue as well. It recommended we should pass this particular scheme. It noted in its report that the current Comcare scheme is actually not fully financially funded. It is not fully funded right now because, over time, premiums in the past were not set based on actuarial values. Premiums paid into the scheme did not fully cover the costs of workplace injuries. However, there has been a slight improvement over the past year. I believe it had 68 per cent of funds available for what was measured as the actuarial funds needed. Around 68 per cent were covered. I believe that has gone up above 70 per cent in the past year, but there is still a sizeable unfunded gap there. Given that gap, we cannot afford to have that gap grow by not appropriately levying the ACT government for the ongoing costs imposed on the Comcare scheme by leaving and, of course, no longer paying premiums for its workplace employees who have been injured.


As I said, the Senate committee in its majority report recommended the bill be passed. However, I note that Labor senators on that committee did not quite agree. I do not believe they made a recommendation, but in their report Labor senators urged the government to request that the ACT government provide written assurances to ensure its workers would not be worse off. What that was going to was that the ACTU made a submission to the inquiry, saying that the new ACT workplace compensation scheme that could be established may not fully compensate workers for their injuries to the same level that the Comcare scheme does. As the government said in response to that, it is a matter for the ACT government. It is not a matter for the Commonwealth government. The Comcare scheme was not established to take care of ACT government employees. It was set up to allow the ACT government to have access to a well-funded and liquid pool of workplace insurance to meet its required needs—needs that it would establish. It is not our job to establish those needs; it is up to the ACT government. It is not the Commonwealth government's responsibility to decide how the ACT wants to deal with and fund workplace injuries in its own workplaces. We had this option available as a product. The ACT government has decided not to buy our product going forward. That is their right, but it is not our job to try to second guess what they want to do over the other side of the lake in their legislative assembly.


What was also a little bit unusual and perplexing about the Labor senators' recommendation that we request the ACT government to provide such assurances is that, as I said earlier, the ACT government made this decision and it was announced on 26 February last year. As many senators would be aware, the ACT Chief Minister at that time was Katy Gallagher, who is now a Labor senator in this place. Labor senators are saying that the decision made by that ACT government in February last year was insufficient and denied workers their proper rights. Well, instead of asking the ACT government, could they not just ask their colleague Senator Gallagher? That would be a suggestion for the Labor Party if they have concerns about this.


If they have concerns about the decision that the ACT government made last February, surely they could ask the former chief minister, who made that decision and signed off on that decision last February. They signed off on that decision last February. It was a decision made by Ms Katy Gallagher. I make no particular complaint about that decision. I do not know the specifics of what the ACT government had to consider when they decided to leave the Comcare scheme, but they made a considered decision to do so. Ms Katy Gallagher is now Senator Gallagher, senator for the ACT, and surely if they want an explanation about the decision making of the ACT government they could go to their own senator.


What this indicates to me is not that the Labor Party have some principled objection to the arrangements that are being put in place here—which, as I said, are rather technical and are replicated over the rest of the country, but that the Labor Party simply want to oppose everything that is put up by this government. They do not want to do anything that may be constructive and forward moving for our country, as limited as this particular issue is. They are simply on the lookout for particular political differences that they can abuse and take advantage of for political purposes, not for national interest purposes. That to me needs to be called out. Why are they really opposing this bill? Is it because the ACTU have said to do so and they have made a submission against it? Is it because some of them see Senator Gallagher as a threat to their future positions? She has just been promoted recently. Is that the reason? Why are they opposing this? A territory government of their own political colour has decided to do this, and they are still opposing it. This is a legislative amendment being proposed as a consequence of that ACT decision, but it is being proposed by a Liberal-National government and not by a Labor government. That is why they are opposing this.


I know the federal Labor Party seem to like to pick fights with state and territory governments at the moment. They are warring with at least one state Labor government at the moment, South Australia, about their confused position on how to fund policies. At the moment it is World War III between South Australia and the federal Labor Party over the GST. But you would think they could at least get their story straight on something as administrative as workplace compensation arrangements. But they cannot even do that. They will oppose everything we put up.


I think later this afternoon or this evening we will debate in this chamber a motion about how the Liberal-National party coalition have not changed. We have not changed, because we are continuing to provide good government and are continuing to make decisions like this in the interests of the nation. But the Labor Party also have not changed. A new year may have ticked over, but it is the same Labor Party opposing everything we put up. It is the same Labor Party simply wanting to make political points and not wanting to deal with issues overall in the national interest. They just oppose everything that the coalition government does. They are good at negativity, but they are not good on policy, and that is what their approach is here today.


Maybe I am being too pessimistic, Mr President. Perhaps I should be less cynical in my first contribution here today in this chamber. Maybe I should be more positive. I did say that I would turn over a new leaf on a few things. So maybe I should give the Labor Party a bit more of a fair go. Perhaps the next speaker on this bill will get up and say that over the break the Labor Party have reconsidered, they have turned over a new leaf, they have made a new year's resolution not to simply oppose everything, and they will come out and support this bill because it is pretty simple, it is technical and administrative and it happens in other states. Perhaps they will get behind the government and support this bill. Perhaps that is what they will do.


It is a new year and it is a new opportunity. Hopefully they have made some new year's resolutions, like the rest of us, and perhaps that is what they will do. If they do, I will have to come into this place and eat humble pie and I will have to say, 'The Labor Party have turned over a new leaf and they are going to support this.' Perhaps their next step will be to support more transparency and oversight of trade unions that have shown themselves to be completely worried about their own back pockets and not their workers' interests. Hopefully their next step will be that they join us in making sure that we reform those arrangements.


Maybe their next step will be to actually join us in how to fix our budget situation, which is still far too negative. We need to do more on that front, but the Labor Party have produced no suggestions to help fund budget repair over the longer term. Perhaps they will join us in a proper tax reform debate, rather than going around and eating lettuce and annoying mums and dads in supermarkets and running a ridiculous scare campaign. Perhaps they will do that as well but, I am sorry, Mr President, despite it being a new year, I am not that hopeful that the Labor Party will be dragged that far. But let us just hold our breath and hope that they will reconsider and join the coalition government here, the Liberal Party, the National Party, many of the crossbenchers and at times the Greens and actually help us to get something done for this country and move this place forward.


As I said, this issue in front of the government is not a nation-changing issue. This is not going to be a watershed moment for our Commonwealth. But it is small example of how an inflexible negative approach stops us from making the little decisions that add up to making this a better place and enabling better government and better governance for our whole nation. So I implore the Labor Party and other senators to look at the detail of this bill. It is a sensible bill. It builds on what is already a good scheme in Comcare. It uses other states as examples of what should be done in this scheme. It will help make sure that we have a sound financial footing for what is a very important scheme and it will help ensure that we can continue to pay those unfortunate workers who are injured while at work for the Commonwealth.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2016-02-02,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (12:51):  Just at the outset I note that Senator Canavan would not be a true Nat if he was not always in the doldrums. Nothing much has changed in relation to this bill over the Christmas break. He may have wished them all Christmas cheer, but this bill does not bring workers any cheer. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, which provides for the rehabilitation and compensation of injured employees of the Commonwealth, its agencies and statutory authorities and of eligible corporations. What this government has not owned up to is that it has brought this bill in by itself. This bill is really one part of three; it is a trio of bills through which this government is seeking to implement changes to Comcare and which will, when put together, significantly and adversely impact workers in this country. This particular piece of legislation concerns the exit arrangements for a declared Commonwealth authority which decides to exit the scheme. The Australian Capital Territory announced back in February last year its intention to leave the Commonwealth scheme and design its own scheme after a six-week consultation process. 


The problem with debating this bill in isolation is that we are not privy to the two other bills that the government has been trying to bring through this parliament. They sought to claim that they are not interrelated and to claim that they are not part of a trio of changes which will negatively impact workers under this scheme. What Labor continues to be concerned about is that this government should own up to this. They should declare that it is one of three bills; they should deal with them concurrently; they should deal with them appropriately. But I do not think they are game to do that. They want to be able to introduce this as a noncontroversial piece of legislation and then to persuade the Senate that we should adopt this one—it is not a trouble—and let it pass, but the true aim of the coalition is to gut Comcare and to adversely affect workers compensation schemes. They want to do—or try to do—what they did in Queensland many years ago, and that was to move to self-insurance; that is, they want to put it into the market so that workers' rights would no longer be covered by schemes that would give them a fairness opportunity and protect their legitimate compensation rights. That happened in Queensland: a previous coalition or Liberal-National government allowed self-insurance to occur, but around 21 large companies, including the Brisbane City Council, opted out of the scheme. That meant that the pool of white-collar workers significantly decreased and the remainder were left with high premiums. Further, they were left with some challenging industries that needed to improve their workers compensation and the safety outcome for workers. 


Those with lower premiums exit the scheme and that makes the remainder even less viable. The whole idea in Queensland was to junk the state scheme, and in this case the Commonwealth scheme, and allow the private market to flourish. It all sounds laissez-faire, but it means Commonwealth workers lose out. They end up in poor and overly watched schemes; they end up with compensation payments that are not related to their income and so they lose out. Underpinning all of this is the coalition's intention to head towards what the Queensland government tried to achieve back then. Thankfully, that was reversed by an incoming Labor government, which implemented a much stronger state based scheme—a scheme which looked after workers' interests but which adopted a carrot-and-stick approach to ensure that employers were rewarded with lower premiums if they looked after the safety of their employees. However, a number of self-insured entities remain in Queensland. I do not think the coalition have a stronger scheme as their root cause or their root desire here. What they ultimately want to do is put it out into the field to the detriment of workers more broadly.


The impact of these bills would be to reduce the premium pools in state workers compensation schemes. Labor's priority is, however, to ensure that workers are looked after and their rights and entitlements are maintained. If a worker is injured on the job, they must be properly compensated; they and their families must be able continue as before during this difficult period. Labor remains concerned that, with the introduction of this legislation, the government does not have the workers' best interests at heart; it is also concerned that there has been a lack of consultation. 


This government has not come clean with its aim by serving up the three bills, by claiming them to be unrelated and by arguing them one at a time. It smacks of a concerted effort to drive workers compensation down into the hands of self-insurers. The government has said that these changes to the Comcare scheme are designed to make the scheme more sustainable over time. That seems to mean cutting money out of schemes, which would mean a worse outcome for employees. I do not think you can look at it any other way. The government certainly have not claimed there is going to be any significant administrative saving that they can pass on. These bills, if passed, will see cuts to lump-sum compensation payable for permanent impairment for the vast majority of injured workers and they will remove the already modest pain-and-suffering payment. These bills will also mean changes to eligibility requirements, where injured workers may be locked out of schemes altogether. There will be a reduction in incapacity payments and an expansion of sanctions against workers, including: the removal of medical support if a worker fails to attend a medical appointment and harsh job search requirements for injured workers if they say they have no suitable employment, in which case they will need to find a job with a new employer or take up self-employment. There will be a new, punishing approach to workers with psychiatric injuries. Employers will have the right to impose health related and work capacity decisions. Workers will have no independent right of review when an employer orders them back to work. That is the direction that this government wants to take, with this bill being the first of the related bills. I think they should be highlighted for the path and direction they are pursuing.


In dealing more broadly with this bill, I think that Labor senators in the Education and Employment Legislation Committee made some very apposite remarks in their additional comments. Whilst Labor senators support legislation to ensure that an exiting employer does not leave the Comcare scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities that are not funded by premiums the employer has paid before exit, the real heart of this issue is that we must ensure that no workers will be worse off under this legislation and that the passage of this bill will not provide an incentive for employers to disadvantage workers. Ultimately, the majority report did not address this in any significant way. 


We have dealt with this bill as a bureaucratic piece of legislation which will allow the ACT to exit the Comcare scheme, but ultimately we have not dealt with it as an instrument of how workers will be worse off if it is passed. Ultimately, the aim of this coalition government is to pass the costs of workers' compensation not onto employers but back onto employees themselves. We note, as outlined in senators' additional comments, that the reason for referring this bill to the committee was to ensure a thorough investigation of the bill and to allow sufficient time to consider the bill. However, since this bill was referred to the committee, the government introduced what I referred to earlier as the third substantive bill relating to Comcare. Given we do not have that bill before us, I think it means ultimately that there is nothing stopping the government, now that those bills have been introduced, from bringing them all together, laying out this strategy and telling us in no uncertain words what their intentions are. When you look at the related bills, it seems to be crystal clear that the legislation is all about attacking workers' rights. Labor senators remain unconvinced by the Department of Employment submission that the passage of this bill would not result in a reduced premium pool in state workers' compensation schemes, about which concerns were raised by the ETU and the Victorian government.


If you were going to improve the outcomes for Comcare workers and broadly allow for exits out of the Comcare scheme into state based schemes, you would not do it this way, by simply allowing the ACT government to exit the scheme, reducing the premium pool, and allowing others in state systems to exit Comcare and jump into less onerous state schemes. You would deal with states and territories more holistically to ensure that workers did not lose significant benefits on the way through. I do not think this government has any intention of doing that. When you look at the range of parts to the bills that are not before us, the picture becomes a lot clearer. This is simply the first tranche in that direction that this government is pursuing. When you look at the proposals that have been put forward—that employees who have been injured would not be allowed to choose their own doctor under Comcare, that approval of doctors and amounts payable would be set by regulation, and that it is Comcare that would determine what is and is not considered reasonable treatment, not an employee's treating doctor—you then get a flavour of the direction in which this government wants to take Comcare. To suggest that any person other than the treating doctor should determine the necessary treatment for an injured worker is quite frankly beyond belief. The bill also proposes severe cuts to incapacity payments for all workers. This would be particularly detrimental and would have the toughest impact on those employees with injuries which take longer to resolve or those who are permanently and significantly disabled. You can see that this is simply an attack on workers' entitlements to workers' compensation.


The government has sought the support of Labor and the crossbench for this legislation. I would urge the crossbench to reject this bill as part of a trilogy of bills through which this government is seeking to cut compensation outcomes for workers. Our first priority should be to ensure that workers will not be worse off under the proposed federal government bill. There is no such clear guarantee coming from this government on that point. We have heard speakers talk about this bill but not give a guarantee that workers will not be made worse off as a consequence of its introduction. It is within the minister's power, in her summing up speech on the second reading, to state that it is not the intention to rip money out of workers' pockets, to short-change them on compensation payments, to make it difficult or impossible to achieve a reasonable workers' compensation outcome. It is important that this government does not make adverse changes to the Comcare scheme, because those proposed changes would directly and indirectly risk the workplace health and safety of Australian workers.


In the first Comcare bill that the government introduced it sought to hollow out state schemes by opening up the Comcare scheme to private sector companies by applying a very liberal definition of what a national employer is. The reduced premiums pools in state workers compensation schemes would mean increasing premiums for remaining businesses in those schemes and would add significant pressure on workers' entitlements. This bill, if constructed incorrectly, may provide leverage for the federal government to force entities to stay in the Comcare scheme, which the now Turnbull government is going to try and make further adverse changes to. We know that the government has more bills to come. It has at least made its plan more transparent than it was when this bill was first introduced. I think the time is now right for this government to lay out its entire plan of how it is going to address Comcare from go to whoa and what its intentions are, because we can only now glean it from the trilogy of bills it seeks to have passed in this parliament. This government should make plain what its intentions are in relation to workers compensation, particularly Comcare itself, when you look at its intentions more broadly. But I do not think they will. I think they will continue to say, 'This is one single bill. This is about allowing the ACT to exit the Comcare scheme and nothing more.' I do not think that is a reasonable answer to this.


When you look at self-insurance issues, these bills will widen the pool of employers' eligibility for self-insurance. It will enable an employer with employees in more than one state to apply for a self-insurance licence, which exempts them from paying premiums in those states where it is currently registered, and will allow an employer to be responsible for managing its own workers compensation claims. This occurred in Queensland in the nineties. It was unsuccessful and it did not last. It did have a significant adverse impact on the existing workers compensation scheme in that state. I think it would have ultimately driven it into oblivion. I think that is the underlying direction that this government wants to take—to drive workers compensation into self-insurance markets, drive it away from properly funded compensation schemes for employees and put it in the employers' hands so that they can drive premiums down. They can do that by driving outcomes for workers down by making it harder and harder for employees to be fairly compensated for when unfortunate injuries do occur in the workplace. Ultimately it will do nothing to improve and incentivise employers to provide good safety outcomes for their employees in the first instance, because, of course, the best way to avoid an injury is to have a safe place of work in the first place and not have to ultimately pay workers compensation. 


But I think the employers who have the ear of this government want the best of both worlds. They want the ability to not spend their money on ensuring a safe place of work and then not spend their money on premiums to assist workers should they be injured as a consequence of their own inactions or neglect. Of course, the most concerning aspects of these bills is the absence of a robust regulatory framework for managing self-insurers. What this government would do, if it was serious about dealing with this in a broad way, would be to also implement a regulatory framework for managing self-insurers. It would not be a trilogy of bills. There would be four bills to deal with this.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2016-02-02,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:11):  Can I indicate at the outset that I will be supporting the second reading stage of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. But I do reserve my position in respect of the third reading stage because there are a number of legitimate questions that need to be asked and ventilated in the committee stages. That is what the role of the Senate is on an important piece of legislation such as this. I want to thank the minister and her office for their assistance today, and I also thank the opposition. I met with the shadow minister, Brendan O'Connor, early today and spoke to his office about that. I do have a number of unanswered questions about the position of both the government and the opposition in respect of this.


I think it is interesting to note that in the additional comments to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's report on this bill from a number of months ago Labor senators expressed some reservations about the bill rather than outright opposition. I accept and respect that the opposition has since changed its position, as they are entitled to, to oppose the bill. But I want to take issue with one thing that Senator Ludwig said. It is not a criticism, but it is an issue—he is coming back into the chamber.



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator XENOPHON:
  I would not be too worried, Senator Ludwig. Senator Ludwig says that this bill will allow for a reduction in the benefits of injured workers. The only thing that will allow for the reduction of the benefits of injured workers will be if the ACT government imposes a scheme that will reduce the benefits for injured workers compared to the Commonwealth scheme. I suppose one argument is that, in respect of the Comcare scheme, it allows an exit to something that is unknown, so I will accept that. But ultimately it is up to the ACT government as to whether they want to take a draconian approach in respect of this.


I do want to disclose that I am still, for my sins, proprietor of a very small law firm that practices in the field of workers compensation law in South Australia. My understanding is that we do very little Comcare work. I was, in my previous prepolitical life, president of the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association in South Australia, as it then was, when we campaigned very hard against the then Olsen Liberal government's changes to workers compensation laws. I remember that Graham Ingerson, who I regard as a friend of mine and who was then Deputy Premier, asked me about my time as a member of the Communist Party at university. I had to tell him gently that, in fact, I was a member of the Liberal club, when he accused me of being a Marxist for opposing the legislation.


I can say this: whatever the then Brown and Olsen Liberal governments proposed in workers compensation changes was very mild in comparison to what a state Labor government ended up doing years later. From 1 July 2015, the Weatherill government has introduced draconian changes to workers' rights—much more sweeping and much more draconian than anything a Liberal government proposed. It has taken away workers' rights substantially, and it seems that some unions—including the peak body, SA Unions—rolled over in relation to those changes, which I will refer to briefly.


The framework established by this bill will allow Comcare to determine and collect exit contributions from former Commonwealth authorities. Senator Cash has characterised this—and I think it is not unfair to characterise it—as a procedural bill, a process bill, because, if an entity such as the ACT government wants to exit the scheme, it can do so but there will be some ambiguities or some uncertainty in respect of the transitional provisions. I guess the question I want to ask in respect of the committee stage is: will the absence of this bill make it impossible for the ACT government to exit this scheme? In other words, whilst I accept in good faith that the minister says that this is a process bill, if this bill is not passed, will it effectively mean that the ACT government cannot proceed with its plans to exit the scheme, or will it simply mean that it can exit the scheme but there will be a lot of uncertainty for workers? I think that is something that needs to be dealt with in the fullness and thoroughness of a committee stage.


I understand that the government say that they want an existing employer not to be able to leave the scheme without contributing an appropriate amount to cover any current or prospective liabilities, and I think that is one thing that needs to be taken into account. The bill also seeks to ensure that any employees injured before their employer exits the Comcare scheme continue to be supported by an appropriate rehabilitation authority. The question that I will ask in the context of a committee stage is: what will that mean to injured workers? Will they still be subject to existing Comcare legislation for those injured before that date, and what will happen if there is an aggravation? This is a technical question: if somebody has a primary injury and then they are injured subsequently in the course of any new scheme, how is there an interplay between Comcare and any new scheme in respect of that? This is something that is coming to mind now—I just want to make that clear to the minister. It is not a trick question. I genuinely want to get to the bottom of this.


In essence, this bill provides a pathway for agencies to leave the Comcare scheme while requiring them to honour their obligations to injured workers. That, I think, characterises the government's position. The opposition is saying, 'Don't support this, because it will lead to a reduction in workers' benefits.' But if they can, under the current legislative framework, exit the scheme and you cannot stop them from exiting the scheme, are we at least providing more certainty? That, to me, is the nub of one of the issues.


The impetus for this bill is the ACT government's announcement that it wishes to leave the Comcare scheme. I understand the ACT government can do this whenever it likes and that it does not need permission or approval from the Commonwealth government to do so. But whether facilitating this bill would make the difference as to whether this goes ahead or not is one of the issues that I think need to be explored in the committee stage. There is currently missing from the ACT government's exit pathway a requirement that it honour its existing obligations to injured workers, and that, I understand, is the government's motivation for this bill: it is attempting to close this loophole.


But, in the bigger picture, the Comcare scheme covers employees working for Commonwealth government agencies and statutory authorities—excluding members of the Australian Defence Force—as well as the ACT government and agencies and corporations who have been granted a licence to self-insure, provided the date of the injury was after the date of the licence. I just want to understand—and this was raised by the Senate committee's report—the effect that the bill may have on workers and their entitlements. I think that is a legitimate question. There is also an issue as to the breadth of this scheme: what other agencies or authorities can avail themselves of this bill? In other words, will it make it easier for other agencies or authorities to exit the bill? The point that Senator Ludwig made is: will that affect the viability of Comcare in itself? Will it mean a shrinking pool of revenue? Has any advice been provided by Comcare to the government about its viability with a smaller premium pool, if you like, with these proposed legislative changes?


I just want to reflect briefly on the fact that Comcare is far from perfect. Comcare was established in order to support workers who have suffered a workplace injury or illness. It is there to help employees recover and, where appropriate, return to work. That is what all workers compensation schemes should be doing, and it carries with it a very heavy responsibility.


When I think of Comcare, there is one case that always comes to mind—and I can refer to this because I introduced a bill to this effect—and it relates to my constituent Barry Crush. In 1988, Mr Crush was the master and chief engineer of the lighthouse supply vessel MV Candela. During a supply run, the ship was caught in a gale with 35-foot waves and 70-kilometre-per-hour winds. Rushing to secure equipment on deck that could otherwise shift or possibly capsize the ship, Barry fell 10 metres onto the deck. He broke his back, his ankle and his knee and suffered massive soft tissue damage. He was forced to stay on the ship while the gale raged for another three days, and what occurred when he finally got to shore was nothing short of disgraceful. He was treated appallingly by Comcare. They lost his files. They ignored him. The man had to live in the most appalling conditions until his claim was resolved many years later.


I must pay tribute to the former head of Comcare Paul O'Connor, who made a specific trip to Adelaide to go to my office and personally meet Mr Crush and apologise for Comcare getting it so absolutely wrong. There was subsequently a mediation settled on confidential terms, where I believe there was a satisfactory resolution of Mr Crush's claim on a fair basis for all parties involved. But that was a case where Comcare got it absolutely wrong and where an ombudsman's report was very critical of Comcare. Legislation that I put up to try to remedy that, whilst it was not passed, did ventilate the issue, and the eventual apology from Comcare meant a lot to Mr Crush and the matter was resolved. It shows you that Comcare can get it wrong, as can other workers compensation agencies, but Comcare did demonstrate that it was capable of owning up to its mistakes and making amends for them.


The ACT government wants to get out of the Comcare scheme, and it has cited long processing delays, high premiums and ineffective rehabilitation services as the reasons for which it wishes to leave Comcare. On the one hand, there is the Electrical Trades Union supporting that exit from Comcare, saying that the ACT should get out of the Comcare scheme. On the other hand, there is the ACTU saying, 'Not so fast! We want to know what scheme workers will be left with.' If it is simply a matter of process—and this is something that I think the committee stage ought to look at—and this is an inevitable move that the ACT government will go ahead with, then it is appropriate to have some process measures in place. I wonder, though, whether the scope of this going beyond the ACT government is appropriate at this stage. That is something that needs to be dealt with in the committee stage.


A March 2015 Canberra Times article gave figures released by the ACT government which showed that, of the 531 current territory claims, only 45 were less than a year old—in fact, more than 200 of the claims dated back more than a decade. So you really wonder whether Comcare had fulfilled its role in terms of workers rehabilitation and getting people back to work. What concerns me is the absence of any comprehensive details of a replacement scheme that injured ACT government workers will be subject to once their employer leaves Comcare. The contrary argument is: 'If they can leave Comcare anyway, there is not much you can do about it.' But I would prefer that the ACT government provide details of how that scheme will work. The March 2015 Canberra Times article referred to the ACT's Minister for Workplace Safety and Industrial Relations, Mick Gentleman, who revealed that there would be no compensation payable for pain and suffering under the new scheme. That concerns me, but, if there is a statutory scheme for lump sum payments for permanent disability, that may ameliorate those concerns. We do not know what they are planning, and that is something that needs to be taken into account.


I want to reflect very briefly on how bad things are in South Australia. It was a Labor government that slashed benefits effective from 1 July 2015. WorkCover SA has been transformed to ReturnToWorkSA, but it could well be rebadged as 'ReturnToOblivionSA', because what has happened in that state, my home state, is that many injured workers will find themselves cut off from benefits, facing the loss of their homes and in extremely difficult situations because a Labor government in that state changed the law in a draconian way. It will be a disaster for injured workers. For instance—and it concerns me that the ACT government may go down this path—it changed the criteria for assessing workplace injuries. Under the Return to Work Act in South Australia, an injured worker's payments will cease after two years from the date the incapacity occurred, unless the injury is a 30 per cent whole-of-body impairment. Examples of a whole-of-body impairment would include a severe brain injury, multiple spinal fractures and, for instance, severe injuries to both shoulders together with carpal tunnel syndrome of both hands so that you cannot effectively use your hands and your arms. Short of that, one or two spinal fractures will not do it. You will lose your benefits, even though you will never be able to go back to your work if you were in a manual job. If you have a so-called mild brain injury which means that you cannot perform cognitively as you could before, and it is a requirement of your job to have even a moderate or high level of cognitive functioning, you will be pretty well gone in terms of benefits. What concerns me is that, if the ACT government adopts the South Australian legislation, it might involve a slight reduction in premiums but it will involve a massive reduction in the benefits for genuinely and seriously injured workers.


I understand the government's argument that we cannot stop this from happening, but I do think there are some legitimate questions to ask about the scope of this legislation, how it will work, what safeguards are in place and whether other government authorities and agencies can avail themselves of this facilitative legislation. That is where I am at. It is an issue I have a particular interest in, given my previous life working as a workers compensation lawyer. I do want to engage constructively with the government and my colleagues in the opposition in relation to this. I think it is worth supporting this bill at the second reading stage, but there are some reasonable and legitimate questions that need to be asked in the committee stage before a final decision is made.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-02-02,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:27):  I have only been in the chamber for a short period of time while the contributions have been made on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. I have had the opportunity to listen to Senator Ludwig's contribution and the contribution of Senator Xenophon. I have to say that there was an extraordinary contrast in the approaches of these two senators to this bill.


Senator Xenophon is taking a very sensible approach. Obviously, he is seeking more information about what the detail of this bill is and the consequences on the people that would be affected by this bill—most particularly and most importantly those people who are currently injured and off work and who are requiring the assistance of an insurer to get them back to work, hopefully, but in some instances to look after them because their injuries are such that they may not be able to return to the work that they had previously done. He has offered to engage in a constructive debate to try to reach an outcome that is in the best interests of these particular people. He also acknowledges that, in a situation where the federal government may not have the capacity or ability to have control over what a government such as the ACT government might do in this space, the Commonwealth has an obligation to make sure that we make the best of the situation so that, once again, the people who are impacted by this action are the ones that we seek to protect.


Contrasting with that was the contribution that I heard from Senator Ludwig, where he seems to have either purposely or through ignorance—I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt and suggest that he has probably not done this purposely—tried to confuse what has been proposed in this bill with other bills that may be proposed to be put before this place. At the moment before the Senate—I will start again—is the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. This bill is a process bill. It is not a substantive bill; it does not deal with arrangements specifically about compensation. It is a process bill—and I will say this quite clearly—that has no capacity to have any adverse effect on employees' entitlements to compensation. I think that is absolutely the key to this.


The fact that Senator Ludwig would come in here and state in the chamber that there is any capacity whatsoever for the passage of this bill to be likely to have a detrimental impact on the entitlements and the benefits that are currently being received by employees I think does a disservice to him and to this place because all this serves to do is to create uncertainty, fear and concern in the minds of the people who are impacted by this, when there is no need for that to happen.


I take my role as a senator very seriously in that I am here representing the people of Australia—and in this instance I am here to represent the interests of the people who, potentially, would be impacted on if the ACT chooses to follow through with its decision of February last year to exit this particular scheme—who are currently being compensated under that particular scheme, ensuring that their rights and entitlements are protected into the future. So it is not my job to use scaremongering tactics for political purposes, to make the lives of those people even more miserable than they currently are. As you would well know, Madam Acting Deputy President, to be injured in any situation—workplace or otherwise—is a very debilitating thing to have happen, and these people need all the support that we can give them. Carrying on with this kind of scaremongering activity that we saw from Senator Ludwig earlier on I think is very sad, and it would be very sad that he could use these people for political gain.


The reality is that this bill actually protects the rights of those employees. I really hope that it is possible, when we get into the committee stage of this bill, that Senator Ludwig comes into this place and properly clarifies to some extent what he was actually up to in his comments earlier on this morning so that he can put the minds of those people who are impacted at the moment by the requirement for compensation for a workplace injury in the ACT to rest. Let us be really clear: this bill is set to amend the compensation act of 1998—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1998, or the SRC Act, as it is known—to provide financial and other arrangements when a Commonwealth authority which is a premium payer exits the Comcare workers compensation scheme.


We saw in February 2015 that the ACT government announced that it intended to leave the Comcare scheme to establish its own workers compensation arrangements. It is interesting: if my memory serves me correctly I would suggest that Senator Katy Gallagher would still have been the Chief Minister of the ACT at the time. As Senator Xenophon rightly points out, sometimes you have to be a little bit careful about what you wish for in this space. Often you may think that a scheme is not particularly good, but the downside of trying to set up a scheme for yourself—as we found out in South Australia—needs to be taken into account. The one thing that needs to be very clear in this is that in a situation like we have seen in South Australia, under the workers compensation scheme that we have there, is that we need to make sure that the injured workers are not the ones who are disadvantaged because of mismanagement, bad management or inefficient management of a scheme. We take that as a given.


But the reality of the bill that we have before us at the moment is that it actually does not delve into those sorts of details. What it actually serves to do is just to make sure that anybody who is currently covered under the ACT scheme in this specific instance—or, for that matter, any other scheme—is not disadvantaged if that particular Commonwealth entity decides that it is going to exit this particular scheme.


The purpose of the bill is quite specifically to close that legislative gap. It would ensure that when the ACT—or, for that matter, any other employer—leaves the scheme that they pay a contribution to cover their liabilities as they currently exist so that the Commonwealth is not left to pick up the tab. As you would know, quite rightly, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds—coming from an economic background—when the Commonwealth is left to pick up the tab that means that the taxpayers of Australia are left to pick up the tab. We need to make sure that in every message we send from this place people understand that if we continually keep putting an expense on this government all we are doing is making sure that those people who currently pay the taxation in this country are being asked to pick up an ever-increasing burden because of these actions. It is our responsibility as federal legislators to make sure that we do what we can to minimise the impact on the taxpayers of Australia, who are our responsibility.


Currently, the act does not include any arrangements to enable an employer who leaves the scheme to be responsible for their liabilities after exit. What we are saying is that the ACT government is more than welcome to leave the scheme; the reality is that there is probably very little that we can do about it as a Commonwealth government—and you could possibly even question whether we should be doing anything about it as a federal government. But if they choose to leave the scheme they cannot just automatically pass the liability that they currently hold onto the new entity. So all this bill serves to do is to say to the ACT government, 'You need to be responsible for your existing liability.' If they want to transfer out of the scheme, obviously, they pick up their new liability when they start with their new scheme, but it is not for the taxpayers of the whole of Australia to pick up the tab for what currently exists and is currently a liability of the ACT.


As I said—and I think this is the most important thing—this bill does not impact on employees' benefits. I cannot say that often enough and I cannot stress that highly enough. The reality is that the content of this bill more broadly is not new. This has occurred in other jurisdictions around Australia before, so there is nothing new in this.


Specifically, the amendments to this bill will enable Comcare to calculate the liabilities of an existing employer—in this case the ACT—and issue them with a levy to ensure that the liabilities are covered once the employer leaves the scheme. This will ensure that the Commonwealth is not left picking up the tab. Contributions will be determined on a cost recovery basis, so it will not allow the Commonwealth to recover anything more than the debt that is currently owed. There is no capacity whatsoever for any gouging or anything to occur in this space; the Commonwealth will merely have a mechanism by which an existing liability that does not reside with us does not end up residing with us. It remains residing where it currently exists. This is sensible management on the part of the government.


It also ensures that employees who are injured before their employer leaves the scheme will continue to receive compensation from Comcare on the same terms as well as ongoing support for their rehabilitation and, hopefully, their return to work.


Obviously, on the basis of the information that is contained within this bill—for those who have had the opportunity to go through the detail of this bill—it is quite clear that this bill is a process bill, is responsible because it is ensuring liability rests where liability should rest and at no time and in no way threatens the benefits of employees. I think we need to be very clear in debating this particular bill that we understand what the bill actually does and that we do not confuse the debate by suggesting that we are actually in here talking about issues that relate to the entitlements, benefits or, most importantly, ongoing rehabilitation of employees and their capacity to go back to work. They are very important issues and at times will obviously be the subject of other pieces of legislation that come through this place, but to confuse this particular bill with something as important as that and to use it for political purposes are horrendous things for us to be doing.


Right now the SRC Act does not set out what happens if the ACT or any other Commonwealth employer leaves the scheme. The legislation does not currently require an employer to contribute towards its liabilities for claims when it leaves Comcare. As a result, there could be insufficient funds to cover claims made by employees of that employer after they have left the scheme. As I said before, it effectively leaves the responsibility or the liability at the foot of the taxpayer. This bill seeks to do nothing more than change that.


It says to any Commonwealth entity that is currently in the scheme, 'If you leave the scheme, you must accept your liabilities and your responsibilities as they currently exist.' If the bill is not passed then the Commonwealth will be left with the ACT's liabilities for its workers. Whilst at no time is there any suggestion whatsoever that those workers and the entitlements and benefits that those workers are entitled to are under question, we accept the fact that they will have to be, effectively, accepted by an entity. This bill responsibly says that that entity needs to remain the liability of the ACT and not be a burden on the taxpayers of Australia.


The reality is that the federal government does not have the power to prevent the ACT from leaving Comcare even though the ACT government made the announcement back on 25 February 2015. My understanding is that they actually have not taken the necessary actions to exit. Before they go rushing off down there, maybe they might like to think a little about some of the experiences of other jurisdictions when they have chosen to leave the scheme. But it will be very interesting to have a look at the contribution made by the Labor senator for the ACT, Katy Gallagher, to this given her very intimate involvement in the decision by the ACT government to go down this path in the first place.


Obviously it is quite clear that I believe it is very important that we see this bill passed. As I said, it is administrative. It is process. There is nothing about this bill that even needs to get anybody remotely exercised or concerned about it. It is just good government on behalf of the current government. We are seeking to make sure that we protect the interests of the people that we represent. At the same time, we are making sure that we protect the interests of those people who are affected directly by the actions of the ACT in saying that they are choosing to leave this particular scheme.


I commend the bill to this place but I most particularly commend the bill to those opposite, that they actually take a little bit of a step back and have a think about the consequences of allowing this bill to go through and most particularly about the consequences for the people who currently require the compensation and benefits that exist under this particular scheme. Think about the implications of scaremongering about this particular piece of legislation. Have a think about the impact on their state of health, their state of mind and their families, because they do not have, as we have in this place, the benefit of a number of people who assist us in interpreting legislation and making sure that we understand clearly the intent of the legislation and the consequences of the legislation if it is passed or not passed. All these people will see is possibly a headline in the paper: 'Federal government legislation'—or bill—'has the potential to reduce benefits to injured workers in the ACT.' That is an irresponsible thing to be saying in this place and a completely irresponsible thing to be saying anywhere.


So I would call on those opposite when they get up to make a contribution, when they ask questions or when they debate bills such as this that they restrict their debate to facts of the matter and make sure that they very clearly understand the consequences of anything they say not only for people in our community that are not as well equipped as we are to get the information about these things but also for people who are in a vulnerable state because they have suffered a workplace injury—and some of them have quite serious workplace injuries. So they might be sitting at home, they might have limited information, and all we are serving to do is to cause them to worry more about what their circumstances might be into the future and, in the process of doing that, probably hindering their recovery.


It has been a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on this bill. I commend the bill to the house. I hope that we will see some sensible debate about the substance of this bill and not a whole heap of scaremongering, which is what seems to have occurred by some who have spoken on this bill before me.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech
"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2016-02-02,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (13:45):  I rise to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Exit Arrangements) Bill 2015. It is always a pleasure and a privilege to stand in this place and make a contribution to anything that is about the safety, rehabilitation and compensation of workers who may have tragically been injured in the workplace. I am no stranger to the topic because, in an eclectic career before coming into the Senate, I spent 20 years as the managing director of an insurance loss adjusting firm that worked all over the world on issues of compensation. So I am as familiar as anyone might be in the architectural environment that one works in when there are claims for compensation, particularly where people have been injured and/or killed in circumstances obviously beyond their control. It is a very significant area and I can tell you firsthand that I have met with hundreds and possibly thousands of victims of injury in the workplace, or of death or injury in events beyond their control, and I can give this chamber the assurance that I would not give my support to any piece of legislation that I thought diminished or weakened what arrangements were in place for genuinely injured people who find themselves in that situation.


Before I start on the specific facts of the bill, I would like to attach myself to the remarks of Senator Ruston, who talked about the circumstances of these people. I am sure that most of us know someone who was injured in the workplace. Indeed many of our colleagues from across the chamber, having been involved in the trade union movement, have a proud tradition of fighting for the rights of these workers in the time past and would also agree that this can be a monstrously depressing and difficult period of time not just for the person who is injured but indeed for their whole extended family and their friends. I have seen people whose lives have been put on hold for many years. It is almost as if in some instances they suffer a psychosis when they realise that their life has been so affected by an injury in their workplace that they will never recover to 100 per cent. I can say to you with some experience that they never ever come to terms with that 100 per cent either.


So I urge all who are making a contribution to the debate on this bill to be very careful with their language. This is no time to be exacerbating the circumstances of people who are watching, who have an interest in what we might do as a parliament with this legislation or who currently have, for example, a pending claim that might be affected by the changes that are being proposed here. I want for anyone listening to my contribution to understand there are no circumstances under which I would support any legislation that I thought diminished the circumstances that these people—current and future—might find themselves in.


This legislation is, amongst other things, a necessary and probably precautionary piece of legislation that has every right to anticipate that there may be departures from the current scheme; therefore, certain provisions have been made. There are no current arrangements for exits. If you accept the proposition put by some across the chamber, this does not worry those opposite. They think that the Commonwealth should necessarily pick up all these contingent liabilities in the event that one of the major clients of the scheme were to leave to go and self-insure or to go to the private sector for premiums.


This legislation is about three or four core issues and core values. It is about time. It is about an anticipation that things may happen in the future and it is responsible to ensure that the legislation has sufficient scope to cope with these departures in the event that they occur. I had the experience of working on cases all over the world where it could take well in excess of 20 years. In fact, the major piece of case law in the United States Supreme Court relating to compensation was the Chick Kam Choo case and it went for 21 years before the family were able to secure an adequate outcome for their action. That we might have a customer of Comcare leave—in this case, the ACT—and leave behind the potential of contingent liability, as you know, is a matter of law. An individual has the right to bring about a claim with respect to their circumstances all the way through until the age of majority. It is not just the affected person. The estate and the minors who might be entitled can bring a claim all the way through to their age of majority. In the worst possible circumstances, events could give rise to liability on the part of this insurance agency, and they would not even be aware of it for 17 years.


If one studies the international architectural structure of Lloyd's of London, their books traditionally will run for almost 30 years. When they put together what is called an insurance book, based in London, New York, Paris or wherever they decide to locate the book, it can have a life of some 30 years. Even on the retirement, even on the sunset closure, of that particular book scheme, it will have a reserve made for contingent liabilities. Actuaries sit, look and decide what that reserve ought to be when having regard to the circumstances before them and the types of liabilities that they might be responsible for, and then they make a financial provision. Indeed, if that provision fails, Lloyd's of London continue to have an ongoing liability within those arrangements. 


What this bill proposes to do, at the heart of the bill, is to create an environment where, if one of the participants in the current scheme decides to leave, an assessment will be made of the contingent liabilities, and they will be burdened with having to make provision for them into the future. You do not even need to be a legislator to understand the simple proposition that, if you are responsible, if you have received the benefit of a premium and you have provided an extension of cover to an individual, or you somehow have a related interest in their claim, you have an ongoing liability. I am certain that even colleagues opposite will not want to see us tracking around the countryside trying to recover money from the ACT in 10 years time. 


The presentation made by some opposite that somehow Henny Penny is going to become a big player in this exercise if this legislation is passed, and that the sky is going to fall in, is pure scaremongering. In fact, it is inconsistent. I listened very carefully to the contribution by Senator Ludwig. You always know when the Labor Party are struggling to make what sounds like a credible contribution on a very difficult issue to articulate. They roll out Senator Ludwig.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No. They roll out Senator Ludwig. You do not get a look in, Senator; I am sorry. The minute you start to talk on a subject, everyone listens intently, looking for all the gaps in the argument. But Senator Ludwig comes in here with a monotone—good afternoon, Senator; good to see you—and it is a bit like that saying: you should not operate heavy machinery while listening to Senator Ludwig. But today, if you did listen—and I did listen intently as I was preparing to make my contribution—Senator Ludwig simply concentrated 100 per cent on perceived negatives of this legislation. Some of the statements he made were completely unfounded. I would have to say that, had Senator Ludwig wanted to polish the shield of the Labor Party with his contribution, by talking about benefits for workers, he might have mentioned the fact that when the scheme transitioned under the Labor government—and they want to criticise our measures—the scheme was only funded actuarially by 68 per cent of its 100 per cent commitment. In less than two years the coalition government have lifted that to 76 per cent. Any of you who are students of commerce and insurance would know that that has been a phenomenal effort. At the same time, there has been a reduction in the premiums. 


This legislation is not about doing anything that might attack or diminish the cover that different employees have. It is about preserving it, and it is about ensuring that it will remain there into the future. It will close proposed loopholes in the event that the ACT, or any other entity, decides to leave the scheme for self-insurance. It will ensure that those who were in their employ, or under their insurance umbrella, who have been injured will have their rights preserved for a long period of time. It is all about confidence for the workers. It is not about scaring the workers. This legislation is about providing those workers with the confidence that what they thought was so is indeed so, and that in their circumstances nothing will change, notwithstanding that their employer may have decided to go and self-insure. 


I listened carefully to the contribution of Senator Xenophon, who on occasions does make a reasonable case on issues. I listened to his contribution about the behaviour of the government of South Australia as they went to self-insure for their workers compensation. I think he made a resounding argument as to why this legislation should go through and be supported in this place by any senator or any group of senators who have the interests of workers at the heart of their intentions. If you really believe in supporting the workers, if you believe in providing them with—





Senator Lines:
  You don't. That's for sure!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I know it is getting difficult, because over time the good work of this coalition government has been eroding your reputation with the workers. Indeed, over the next couple of weeks your position is going to be tested very thoroughly—as Senator Ludwig referred to in a coded way in his contribution to this debate.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Didn't you watch the news in New York?




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No; I have not watched TV since I watched The Killing Season triangulation on the Labor Party. I have been too frightened to go back! But the fact of the matter is that this is all about providing this stability and this security for workers. I am almost out of time, but let me make the important point: I invite you to join us to ensure this legislation passes and provides the workers with the security that they are entitled to and that this government is determined to give them.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, have you concluded your remarks or do you wish to be in continuation?




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I was burdened by the clock, Mr President.

It is an important issue that you raise, Senator Wong, and of course the position of Mr Turnbull and of all ministers in the Turnbull government is the position of the government. There has been, Senator Wong, as you know, over a period of years very vigorous debate in this country about climate change policy. You know very well because you have been one of the most important participants in that debate in opposition and in government.


It is no secret that both the Australian Labor Party and the government have varied their views over the years, and that is the case in relation to Mr Turnbull. The position Mr Turnbull took in 2009 is not the position that the government takes now. That is unremarkable, but I can assure you, Senator Wong, that where Australia has landed on the question of climate policy is precisely where we ought to be. We have embraced and we took to the climate change conference in Paris the most ambitious per capita emissions reduction targets of any nation in the OECD. We were able to do that because the vigorous discussion we had within the coalition over the years has produced a set of policies that are effective. They are not ideological, but they are effective, and we are proud of them.

Senator Wong, as you well know, public opinions about the question of whether, by what process and when Australia might become a republic have changed over the years. Mr Turnbull said after the failure of the 1999 referendum that he did not expect that Australia would become a republic in the lifetime of Her Majesty the Queen. That is a view he has expressed more recently again. There are a variety of views on both sides of politics about these issues, but the position that Mr Turnbull has stated—having, by the way, been closer to this issue over the years than virtually any member of this parliament—is of course the position of the government.

In all three cases the nature of the issue has changed over the course of years. Senator Wong, everybody in this chamber and everybody who may be listening to this broadcast knows that. For example, there are people who today believe in a republic who used to be opponents of a republic; there are people who today have a view of climate change policy which is different from the view they may have had some years ago, and the same in relation to same-sex marriage.

 (New South Wales) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to questions without notice asked by Senators Gallacher and Dastyari today relating to school funding..


I want to take note of these and speak to some of the inconsistencies and myths that were presented by the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham, in answers to questions that he gave moments earlier.


But before doing so, I do also want to note that yesterday I had the privilege of being able to take my daughter to her first day at school. While many of us are going to debate over the next year how we can better fund our schools, how schools should be funded and what needs to be done to make sure we have the best possible education system, we should all be incredibly proud of the numerous teachers, principals and volunteers who make our education system as fantastic as it is.


But, while we have a fantastic education system—particularly in my home state of New South Wales—it can and it should be improved. I think it is disappointing that the minister—Minister Birmingham—outlined and actually undercut comments made by the National Catholic Education Commission, which said that the failure to properly fund the future years of the Gonski model will have the result that:


… fees will increase, schools could close and the quality of education will be compromised.


Ultimately, the government has been trying to set up a straw man argument, and the straw man argument is this: that it is all about funding—that the Gonski model and the Labor proposals that we put forward over the past year, and also the entire process over the past several years, has simply been about funding. Funding is an important component of it. Funding is the start. You cannot have a better education system if you are not prepared to pay for it. But what the Labor proposals have been saying, and what the Gonski model has addressed fundamentally, is: how do you make sure you make the most of more funding, how do you get the best bang for your buck and how do you work towards a more equal, a more fair and a more equitable system? You cannot achieve that if you do not start with a base of better funding for our education system.


Before the last election the Liberals promised—and this was Christopher Pyne, who was the shadow minister at the time—




Senator Brandis:
  'Mr Pyne' to you!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Minister Pyne. He was not Minister Pyne at the time, he has become Minister Pyne.




Senator Brandis:
  I said 'Mr Pyne'.




Senator DASTYARI:
  He said at the time—and I am quoting a press conference on 29 August 2013:


… you can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school …


That turned out to be a statement that was not true. That turned out to be a statement that is untrue.


We also had the then Leader of the Opposition, who became the Prime Minister and who is now a quiet and subservient backbencher—a Mr Tony Abbott—talk about an absolute 'unity ticket' when it came to school funding. Then, as if that were not enough, the official Liberal Party-endorsed sign at the election on 7 September 2013—properly authorised by the Liberal Party—said:



Liberals will match Labor's school funding dollar for dollar.


After the election was over we saw these promises broken. We saw teachers betrayed; we saw students, parents and principals in every state and territory ripped off.


Over Christmas, when there was a presumption that nobody was watching, the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, made the decision to dump the Gonski reforms and cut $30 billion in future potential funding from our schools. To break this down: on average, that is $3.2 million from every school, which will mean fewer subject choices, less support for students with disability, fewer literacy and numeracy programs, learning support cuts and less training for teachers.


Fundamentally this all comes down to the priorities of a government and what a government should, wants to and chooses to prioritise. We have seen from the answers from the minister today and in the decisions that have been made by this government that they have decided that the future education of our children is not a priority. For this to all happen just as children go back to school is a tragedy.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2016-02-02,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:08):  I too took my kids to school last week as Senator Dastyari did. I share his comments in commending the incredible commitment of the teachers and principal at my children's school, St Benedict's Catholic Primary School in Yeppoon. It is a wonderful school, and they do a great job. I am proud to say that all of my three children actually seemed to want to go to school. There were no complaints, tears or dragging them out of bed. I do not know if that will happen every day this year, but it is nice to start the year on a positive step.


I noted Senator Dastyari did talk about his own children to start with and he did spend a lot of time speaking about the Labor Party's policy they announced last week, which you might have seen was titled 'Your Child. Our Future'. To me that was quite a scary title and frame to put on things. I think you can look after your children, Senator Dastyari. I do not particularly want to have any kind of ownership over your children, but apparently the Labor Party wants to have some ownership over my children and other people's children as well. That approach of the Labor Party is testament to their overall overbearing and controlling approach.


In fact, improvements to our children's schools are going to come not so much from what we do in this place but from the good work, commitment and cooperation between parents, teachers and local school communities. There is no magic wand that a minister, Treasurer or budget down here in this place could wave and suddenly have my son no longer wanting to play Minecraft every night and wanting to go learn the periodic table. That is not going to happen. It is not going to happen by Labor's policy. It is not going to happen by spending billions more dollars. It is going to happen by commitment to better education at all of our schools.


I also took note that Senator Dastyari said very clearly that in his view we cannot achieve better educational outcomes unless we have more funding. That is the Labor Party's position. It is all tied to the inputs. It is all tied to how much we spend. In fact, we have spent 40 per cent more on education in the last decade. According to the Labor Party's own 'Your Child. Our Future'policy document, over that period, according to OECD data, in the year 2000 only one country outperformed Australia in reading and maths and in 2006 only two countries outperformed Australia in science. Today, 16 countries outperform Australia in maths, nine countries outperform Australia in reading and seven countries outperform Australia in science. By their own admission and their own data we have gone backwards in the past 10 to 15 years at the same time as we have spent 40 per cent more on education funding.


How do they explain that? How do you explain that the response to this reduction in our performance in the past 10 to 15 years is just to throw more money at the problem? That is the Labor Party's approach to every problem that comes in: just spend more money. Just spend more money on these Medicare reforms that are controversial now. Do not worry about the results. Do not worry about whether they actually deliver what you promised and what you argued for.


We are in a new year now. It is an election year, and the Australian people will have a choice later for a Labor Party that is still addicted to spending too much of their money, still addicted to throwing billions of dollars at problems regardless of the outcome. They do not care. They do not do the analysis. They are not particularly concentrating on the results. They only care about how many dollar signs they can put before the next policy announcement they make. They will not fully fund it, as Jay Weatherill, the Premier of South Australia, admits. They will not have a proper funding plan for it. If we do end up with a Labor government after this election, it will no be 'Your Child. Our Future'; it will be your debt and you having to pay it back. That is what will happen if the Labor Party get back into office. They will continue to spend your money, regardless of what the outcomes deliver, like they did with $900 cheques, school halls and many other programs in their last term in government. God help Australia if they get back in and can have a cash barbecue of billions of dollars more of your money with their misguided plans.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:13):  I rise with some fury at the nonsense that we have heard from those opposite this afternoon—not just the contribution of the member who is about to leave the chamber but the outlandish misrepresentation from the minister himself. The minister no doubt stood at booths in Adelaide in the lead-up to the last election and distributed hand-outs, smiling at people all the while and saying they were on a unity ticket with Labor, that you would get exactly the same investment in funding the future of education in this country in response to the Gonski review to make sure that students got a fair go. They stood there with banners beside them that said they would match the Labor Party commitment, which was a six-year commitment. They would match it dollar for dollar.


Yet day after day we hear this quivering nonsense from them that money does not matter. It is ignoring the clear reality that is evident to every single parent who rocks up at school, opens their eyes and sees that there are needs unmet in every single school across this country bar a few very privileged schools. That is what the Gonski investigation found out, and that is why the commitment was made by the Labor Party last week to fund years 5 and 6, which had fallen off a cliff under those on the other side of the chamber. They have abandoned that commitment that they made to the Australian people. What we see day after day is that those opposite say one thing but they absolutely do another. This is a perfect example of a party that simply cannot be trusted with the truth, cannot be trusted with dollars to invest in the future of this nation and cannot be trusted with education because their miserly view of education is at odds with the facts at every single turn.


When Labor were in government, we recognised that there was an urgent need for excellence and equitable school experiences right across this country. The review that was undertaken involved 70 different education groups, 39 school visits and 7,000 submissions. Mr David Gonski, whose name has been attributed to this for such a period of time now, wrote: 


… the additional investment—


which is the dollars that the Liberal Party continue to say do not matter—


is needed to implement a schooling resource standard. It is necessary because without it—


this is the key part—


the high cost of poor educational outcomes will become an even greater drag on Australia's social and economic development in the future. The need for the additional expenditure and the application of what those funds can do is urgent. Australia will only slip further behind unless as a nation we act and act now.


That was a compelling argument that this government knew Australians understood. Those opposite were prepared to stand up and pretend to the Australian people that they would fund the entire six years of Gonski. People rolled up to vote in good faith and had a look at those posters that reassured them that this government would match the funding that Labor had committed to this national education project dollar for dollar. Well, now those opposite are quibbling over every single dollar. They have withdrawn their support. They misrepresented to the Australian parliament and to the Australian people what they were going to do, and they continue to come in here and peddle a load of nonsense about the lack of need in schools.


In schools around Australia we know that there are kids right now who are benefiting from the first four years of funding going through. In New South Wales, I have visited many of those schools, such as Woy Woy South public school, where there has been a transformation in learning for many of the students, particularly for the local Indigenous families, who have suddenly been able to achieve literacy and numeracy standards never before achieved because they got access to the additional education they needed to help them make up the gap from where they started.


But this government continues to deny that there is any inequity in schools. We need schools that can access the funding to make sure that they are able to do the job of educating our young. We need schools to get that money because they cannot do the job on the miserly amount that this government is intending to give them, a CPI indexation that is not up to the job. There is a failure to understand that speech therapists and quality teaching cost money. It is an investment in the future of the country. Labor is for it; the Liberals stand against it, and they continue to misrepresent their position.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:18):  I am very pleased to join in this very important debate. I will start by commending the wonderful teachers we have here in the ACT and the wonderful schools we have in the ACT both in the government sector and in the non-government sector. I have had the privilege of attending some of these schools here in the ACT along with my family members both in the public sector and in the non-government sector, and my kids now have the opportunities in these wonderful schools. I commend the teachers here in Canberra and around the country who do such an outstanding job.


I think when we take note of answers it is worth reflecting on the point that the opposition are trying to make in some of their questioning. I have got to say this is a little bit like the first day of school. It is the first day back for us here in the Senate after the summer break. You would think that, having had many weeks to regroup, the Labor Party could have come up with something a little bit better than this. They meandered around about Prime Minister Turnbull's views on the republic, on climate change, on same-sex marriage. When that did not get anywhere, they started asking other questions. I thought, 'What a tired strategy in an election year.' We had the year of ideas last year, which produced some extra ideas for taxes from the Labor Party. You would think that in an election year they would be raring to go. But unfortunately that is not what we saw in question time today.


That brings us to some of Labor's questioning on education funding. This is lazy policy from the Labor Party, and this is policy that they know they cannot deliver. They cannot afford it. They cannot deliver it. They knew it when they were in government, which is why they put it out to years 5 and 6. This is the fundamental issue here. Let us look at the first four years, the four-year cycle of the budget, which is what we deal with, which is what Treasurers deal with and is what governments deal with. It is what the Labor Party had when they were in government and it is what the coalition government has now. Over those four years that we committed to, not only will we match what the Labor Party was going to deliver but we will deliver an extra $1.2 billion—that is a fact. That is the record in terms of the coalition government.


We have seen an increase in funding of 27.3 per cent over the forward estimates, a significant increase in funding. The point has been made that we need significant increased investment in our schools, which we are doing. But that is not the only question as to how you get better outcomes. From the late eighties to around 2011-12 there was a 100 per cent increase in schools funding in Australia, yet we saw many of our outcomes going backwards. It is not the be-all and end-all. Even though we are increasing funding by 27.3 per cent in education over the forward estimates—$1.2 billion more than Labor was going to deliver—that is not the only answer. That is not a whole equation.



It comes down to the credibility of Labor to deliver. The reason they pushed it out up to years 5 and 6 was that they had not done the work; they did not have the money, because they wasted it in government; and they certainly would not have the money if they were ever trusted with the Treasury benches again. You do not have to believe me. Believe Jay Weatherill if you want to know Labor's credibility on funding their education promises. What did Jay Weatherill, the South Australian Labor Premier, say about their plans? He said: … we haven't seen any coherent or sustainable way in which that's going to be funded. 


Those are the words of a South Australian Labor Premier. If even your mates in South Australian Labor do not believe you on education funding, how can the Australian people believe you on education funding? Jay Weatherill has called you out. He has said that you cannot fund it, that you have got no plans to fund it. Tinkering with multinationals is not going to fund your plans. You are going to have a budget black hole. This is the fundamental credibility problem Labor have, not just on education but on a whole range of other things. Until they can fix that, they can never be trusted to govern again. (Time expired)

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:23):  I too rise to take note of answers on education given by the government today. All we have heard from government senators is ridicule of Labor's very solid, fully costed plan on education. There is a reason for that. It is that those opposite have nothing to say when it comes to education. They have absolutely nothing to say. And why is that? Because they have ripped out of every single Australian school $3.2 million. That will happen over the next 10 years. That is their school plan: to reduce the funding available to schools—$3.2 million out of every single school across this country. What a disgrace. Imagine what impact the loss of that money has on the quality of resource, the quality of teaching, the exciting learning experiences that children simply will not have because those opposite, the Turnbull government, will have ripped the heart out of every single school in Australia.


I come from a state where, unfortunately, their Liberal counterpart, Colin Barnett, has also ripped the heart out of school funding. Not only will every school in Western Australia suffer this $3.2 million cut imposed by the Turnbull government; they have got cuts of their own imposed by the Colin Barnett Liberal government. Let me tell you: schools in Western Australia are in a shocking state. But of course it is not just Labor saying this. I recently chaired the inquiry into children with special needs in our education system. Again, we saw another mistruth. Christopher Pyne, when he was the opposition shadow, made promises that he would commit the sort of Gonski funding that kids with special needs in our schools need. And yet what we have seen is that government has introduced this indexation to CPI, which is failing children with special needs.


What did the very conservative Catholic Education they tell the inquiry? They told the inquiry exactly the same thing—that they cannot manage on this funding, that it is not enough for Catholic Education to provide the quality and the specialist services that children with special needs need in their schools. And they went further. They said, 'Schools will close.' Schools for special needs children that they manage will close if this drop in funding—the failure to commit to their promises—continues by the Turnbull government. We heard Catholic Education yesterday say exactly the same thing about their mainstream schools. We cannot all have a comprehension problem. You do not sit there as a Catholic Education office and attack your funder unless things are dire—and they are dire. We heard shocking experiences of children with disability in our education system. If they had the Gonski funding, things would change.


We heard from schools in New South Wales who had picked up the special funding that Labor put into schools that have children with special needs, and they told us of the great innovations that they were able to bring to bear—all of which is now gone. This is what we see again from those opposite. The Gonski review was revolutionary. Obviously those opposite have never bothered to read it. It established very clearly the growing inequity in our schools between those students who come from wealthier areas and those students who do not. There is a growing disparity. But of course that is what the Turnbull government are all about. Unless you can help yourself, they have got no interest in helping you. The Gonski panel set out very clearly what was needed. Yes, of course funding is at the core of reform, but we also need good quality teachers—something Labor will invest in in our policy. We want to see innovative schools. We want to see all children having the best opportunity, not being defined by postcode.


I have two grandchildren in high school this year. Unfortunately they do not live in the green leafy suburbs. Their schooling is difficult. Their schools need more funding, and yet I know that those opposite have taken $3.2 million away from their schools, denying them the opportunities of other children.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:34):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 24 December 2015, of the Honourable James (Jim) Joseph Carlton AO, former minister and member for Mackellar, places on record its appreciation of his long and highly distinguished service to the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Jim Carlton was born in Sydney on 13 May 1935 and educated at state schools and then at Marist Brothers Kogarah—the same school where he befriended his younger pal former senator Graham Richardson—and at the University of Sydney, where he studied science and engineering and led both the student representative council and the University Liberal Club. After graduation he worked as a manager in a manufacturing company in Britain for several years before joining the global management consulting firm McKinsey. In 1971 back in Australia he succeeded Sir John Carrick as the general secretary of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party when Sir John entered this chamber. In 1977 Jim Carlton succeeded WC Wentworth as then only the second member for Mackellar, serving in the House of Representatives until 1994 when he was succeeded by a member of this chamber—the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop.


Jim Carlton served as Minister for Health and Minister Assisting the Minister for National Development and Energy in the last year of the Fraser government in 1982-83. Subsequently he held a variety of shadow ministerial posts, including health, Treasury, education and defence, and key positions in opposition policy formulation and coordination until his retirement from the House of Representatives in 1994 to become the secretary-general of the Australian Red Cross. It was thus Jim Carlton's misfortune that his most fertile years in the Australian parliament were years which coincided with the Liberal Party's period in opposition during the period of the Hawke and Keating governments. Nevertheless, his career also demonstrates the weight and impact of a contribution of a sharp public policy mind from the opposition benches.


In his valedictory speech to the House of Representatives Jim Carlton said that he would often ask himself the question: what have I done for Australia?


The answer, although Jim Carlton would have been far too modest to have given it, is that he did an immense amount for Australia and, in a variety of ways, for the wider world. His place in the history of this country is far greater than a mere recitation of the positions he held, impressive though that list might be, for he was one of the most influential thinkers and activists in one of the most important intellectual and political movements of recent generations—those who, in the 1970s and 1980s, led the public policy agenda in the direction of freer markets; more limited, yet more efficient and effective government; and facing up to the need for Australia to compete in an intensifying global economic competition. Without this intellectual and political development, the liberalisation of the Australian economy under the prime ministerships of Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and John Howard would not have happened. That liberalisation contributed to Australia, remarkably, being spared a recession for a quarter of a century now, and to countless Australians having better jobs and higher living standards than would otherwise have been the case.


Jim Carlton worked in the tradition of Bert Kelly, and along with some other dry colleagues such as John Hyde and Peter Shack, through the Crossroads Group and the Society of Modest Members. That band, initially backbenchers, stood up to Prime Minister Fraser and, later in their careers, supported the liberalisation by the Hawke and Keating governments of Australian economic policy. Through painstaking policy preparation, through long years of opposition, they were important contributors to the economic policy developments of those years, which were carried largely in a bipartisan manner—a notable feature of those times—and which would not have been achieved had it not been for the wise bipartisanship that the Liberal opposition in those days, under the influence of men like Jim Carlton, offered.


Jim Carlton's work and its profoundly positive impact show, above all, the power of ideas, especially when those ideas are combined with the hard slog of careful organisation and tireless advocacy. Among his political generation, Jim Carlton was seen as very much of the front rank of our political leaders on the non-Labor side of politics. Indeed, his status in the Liberal Party of that generation was such that on one occasion he was a candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party.


At the state memorial celebration of Jim Carlton's life, held recently at the University of Melbourne, and attended notably by both John Howard and Paul Keating, Professor Ross Garnaut spoke of Jim Carlton's assistance to him when he, Garnaut, had been Bob Hawke's economic adviser—a great example to us all of the benefits of cross-party cooperation and support for good public policy in the nation's interest, leaving aside mere partisan considerations. Of that, Jim Carlton was a very fine exemplar.


His business experience in Britain and the United States, as well as in Australia, convinced him that Australia not only must but also could compete strongly in the increasingly globalised and competitive economy. He was much influenced by the ideas that underpinned Germany's postwar economic miracle. He saw economic policy as a means to better social outcomes, using market forces for social good. He denied the false antithesis between rational economic policy and compassionate social policy. Indeed, he believed, and in a sense this is the emblem of his career, that a good society depends upon a good economy, a compassionate society depends upon a prosperous economy, and a prosperous economy is underwritten by the economic reforms and liberalisation which were trademarks of his career.


He was, all his life, guided by strong, compassionate, humanitarian convictions; a career bookended by his active opposition, as a Liberal student leader in the 1950s, to the White Australia policy and, at the end, by his occupancy of the position as chairman of the Red Cross. But throughout all this his commitment to a freer market, precisely because it created more and better opportunities, was his hallmark. He contributed to Australia's international reputation in his post-parliamentary life, through his work with the Red Cross, for which he was awarded the highest international honour that that distinguished body can confer: the Henry Dunant Medal. Jim Carlton argued for the government to focus on opportunities for young people with youth orientation, as he put it, and for gender equality. So he was both an economic and social liberal, committed to the idea of freedom. He was the embodiment of the cool head and the warm heart.


Jim's interest in the wider world and Australia's place in it reflected in extensive work of foreign and defence policy and on foreign aid, including work to promote democracy internationally. In 1985 he helped to establish an Australian branch of the international committee for a Community of Democracies, and later served as an international vice president of that body. He was a Commonwealth observer at the 1991 elections in Zambia, which saw a return to multiparty democracy in that nation.


Jim Carlton was a politician with a hinterland; with broad cultural, intellectual and indeed culinary interests. He was, for example, a passionate devotee of opera—particularly German opera, from Beethoven to Wagner to Richard Strauss.


Alongside his humanitarian motivation, his focus on long-term strategy and his broad interests, Jim brought to all that he did the emphasis on the value of operational efficiency that he learnt as an industrial manager and as an adviser to the private sector. This reformist impulse was evident, for example, in his work as general secretary of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party in the early 1970s in promoting national rather than state based federal election campaigns, in his promotion of efficiency, accountability and integrity in public administration, in his work with the Red Cross to combine eight separate blood banks into a national Red Cross Blood Service and in his advocacy of digitisation of archives when he chaired the advisory council of the National Archives of Australia.


In his retirement, as many warm tributes since his death reflect, Jim's expertise and active, probing mind were widely sought and deeply valued by government, business, the not-for-profit sector and academia. For example, with Ross Garnaut and Tricia Caswell, he was nominated by BHP to serve on the board of the Papua New Guinea sustainable development program to ensure the proceeds of the Ok Tedi mine best served the needs of Papua New Guinea. He was a senior adviser to the Boston Consulting Group. He served on boards such as the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and the Cranlana Program. He was active in the Accountability Round Table, helped to found the Australia and New Zealand School of Government and held adjunct professorships with the National Institute for Governance at the University of Canberra and the Centre for Public Policy at the University of Melbourne.


He was a man of parts, a person of enormous intellectual substance and depth. But, as well as a sharp mind, Jim Carlton always had a ready smile, a twinkle in his eyes, an amusing story and an encouraging word. Many present and former members of this parliament, including the present Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, and my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells, regarded him as both a mentor and a friend. I remember him fondly. He was very kind to me and always had an encouraging word for me in my political career, including until the time I most recently saw him, at a function in this city last year. His friendliness to all and the work of his wife, Diana, in promoting friendship between the partners of members and senators across parties contributed greatly to the respect and warmth with which Jim and Di were regarded throughout the parliament. Which of his colleagues were the subjects of his greatest gift for mimicry we might never fully know!


Above all, of course, Jim Carlton was a loving husband to Di and a loving father to Alex, Freya, his late son Richard and Rob, and an adored grandfather to Ned, Angus, Rosie, Claudia, Tom, Leo and Jim. Our hearts go out to them in their loss as we share their pride in the remarkable life of Jim Carlton. Those of us who had the privilege to know him are the richer for his friendship and his encouragement, and our nation is truly the richer for the powerful impact which he had on this parliament and on Australian public policy, for his pioneering intellect and for his profound commitment to public service for the good of the people of Australia.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2016-02-02,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:48):  I rise also to speak, on behalf of the opposition, on this motion of condolence on the passing of the Hon. James Joseph Carlton AO. At the outset I convey the opposition's thoughts for his wife, family and friends at this time.


Mr President, today we remember Jim Carlton, and we acknowledge his service as a member of the parliament from 1977 to 1994, as Minister for Health and Minister Assisting the Minister for National Development and Energy in the Fraser government from 1982 to 1983, and as Secretary General of the Australian Red Cross from 1994 to 2001. And we also recall the role—as my colleague the Leader of the Government has extensively outlined—that Mr Carlton played as a thinker and agitator inside the Liberal Party for changes to its approach to economic policy.


Jim Carlton grew up in suburban Sydney in a household that felt the effects of the Depression in the 1930s. After completing a science degree and working in business and industry for a decade, he came to the other place by a pathway that is often maligned in public discourse: he was a party official. He served as the general secretary of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party for six years before his election as the member for Mackellar in 1977. In making his first speech, he was given the honour of moving the address in reply to the speech of the Governor-General, and he spoke principally on issues of economic management, on the importance of motivating investment and on lowering unemployment. He sought to balance the challenges of industry restructuring with a call for policy settings that would stimulate employment growth, including the development of local skills. Exploring new answers and charting a new course on economic policy would be a continuing theme throughout his career.


It was Jim Carlton's role as a leading economic dry within the Liberal Party that is perhaps his greatest political legacy. With others, he successfully gained the political ascendancy as the Liberal Party moved from government to opposition, seeking to—and I quote him—'put intellectual spine into Liberalism in Australia'. He described his mission as shifting Australia from—and I again quote—'an essentially inward looking and somewhat protectionist society into a liberal market economy that was capable of standing in the world as an equal with anybody else'. He sought efficiency in public administration and containment of spending, and in this he found increasing levels of agreement on both sides of politics.


In many ways, his social views were more progressive than many of his colleagues who shared his opinions on economic policy. He said in his valedictory speech that he was worried he had been characterised as being solely concerned with economic issues but stated that he had only ever regarded these as a means to achieving social outcomes. Mr Carlton took his inspiration from a West German economist and politician, the architect of that country's postwar recovery, Ludwig Erhard, and in him saw the benefit of the combination of market based economic policies with active government-led social policies, creating a compassionate framework for the use of market forces for social good.


Paradoxically, it was probably in social policy more than economics that Jim Carlton was to get his opportunity to be a member of the executive as Minister for Health for 10 months before the Fraser government lost office in the 1983 election. A couple of months after his appointment The Sydney Morning Herald proclaimed, 'Jim Carlton is a dry who suddenly found himself in a lush and boggy wetland when he was made Minister for Health last May.' Certainly, receiving the Health portfolio may have been a surprise but it was certainly suited to his management and administrative abilities. He sought improvements in consumer choice and in the standard of care for the aged and chronically ill in a system that still provided assistance to those least able to care for themselves. Concurrently he served as Minister assisting the Minister for National Development and Energy, with his ministerial career coming to a premature end as the Fraser government lost office. 


Jim Carlton was not to serve in government again but he held a number of shadow portfolios in opposition, most notably Treasury, between 1985 and 1987, putting him up against Treasurer Paul Keating, who was at the height of his powers. Mr Keating, unsurprisingly, found a number of colourful things to say about Mr Carlton over the course of their time in parliament together, but his attendance at Mr Carlton's state memorial service was a demonstration of the respect the former Prime Minister held for his one-time sparring partner. In his remarks on his valedictory in 1993, Mr Keating said of Mr Carlton:


Jim Carlton has enjoyed a tremendous friendship with most members of this parliament. He is an exceptionally likeable person. As a consequence, most people like him.


Mr Carlton also had responsibility at various times in opposition for Health, Education, Defence and Environment, and later he was to have a key role in policy coordination between 1990 and 1993, including in the development and promotion of the Fightback package and, later, in its review.


Of interest to those in this place might be Jim Carlton's views about the role of the other place in the legislative process. In his valedictory speech, he decried the lack of consideration given to legislation in the other place, observing that: 


In this sense this chamber is almost worthless and the Senate is having to do a double job of both primary and secondary treatment. It is important that this House becomes a primary treatment area for legislation and that issues are properly aired and legislation cleaned up, including with public hearings, before it goes across to the Senate.


He felt that the Senate would be easier to deal with if this chamber received legislation which had been the subject of more comprehensive scrutiny. Regrettably, I am not sure his suggestions have yet been acceded to. 


Jim Carlton did not leave public service when he left public office. As my colleague Senator Brandis has said, he took up the position of Secretary General of the Australian Red Cross, retaining this until 2001. He relished the opportunity to work for a wonderful humanitarian organisation with responsibility both for national and international operations. Amongst his various achievements was the combination of the eight separate blood banks run by the states and territories into the unified service. 


Speaking on the occasion of Jim Carlton's retirement from parliament, the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, accurately reflected on the quality of his contribution. He said: 


He concentrates a lot more on ideas than on the personalities of the business. In that sense he has made his greatest contribution. Jim will be remembered for the ideas he has generated in a policy sense and the contribution he has made to the development of ideas, much more broadly than just on our side of politics.


Jim Carlton will be remembered as a politician who pursued ideas he thought were right, and that is a fine legacy.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:55):  I rise on behalf of the National Party to support the motion of condolence. It is always hard to hear of the passing of a good man. The Hon. Jim Carlton AO was certainly that: a good and decent man who has left a positive, lasting legacy. Mr Carlton lived by his principles, and the nation is a better place for his life. 


Mr Carlton was born in Sydney on 13 May 1935 and completed his tertiary education at Sydney university. Perhaps it was the completion of a science degree that started the spark of his reputation as a strategic and innovative thinker. A decade working in business and industry sectors gave Jim those practical skills and that life experience that would stay with him for the remainder of his life. 


In 1971 Mr Carlton became the General Secretary of the New South Wales Liberal Party, and it was during this time he demonstrated his unifying reputation in building a national campaign effort for the Liberal Party, which until then had been sort of state-isolated. Elected to federal parliament in 1977, he diligently represented the seat of Mackellar in the House of Representatives until his retirement in 1994. During that time he held a variety of positions, including shadow Treasurer, shadow minister for health and a number of other shadow ministry positions. Jim Carlton was a role model for all politicians, demonstrably and strategically emphasising long-term prosperity for our nation over short-term politics.


I want to take time to talk briefly about Mr Carlton's efforts following his time in politics, including his role as Secretary General for the Australian Red Cross. I think his most notable achievement was the establishment of the National Australian Red Cross Blood Service from what were then separate—and some would argue disparate—state and territory services. In referencing this commendable service that saves the lives of so many every year, I know that Jim would never want me to miss an opportunity to encourage all those listening to take the time to visit donateblood.com.au and make an appointment. It would be a very fitting way to honour his legacy. 


Mr Carlton's achievements were acknowledged by the Red Cross in 2007 when he was awarded the highest, most prestigious, honour available to the Red Cross, the Henry Dunant Medal. This award followed earlier awards, including the Order of Australia and the Centenary Medal in 2001. The Prime Minister recently described Mr Carlton as 'a particularly warm-hearted and likeable man'. I would like to think Mr Carlton's nickname—provided by the opposition in that day, I think somewhat fondly—'Old Rosie' can now be used to describe and recall his warmth of character. 


Mr Carlton's great mind and his lifelong commitment to humanity are tragically now lost to this nation. National thoughts and prayers go out to Jim's wife, Diana, and to their children, Alex, Freya and Rob, in what would have been a very difficult Christmas. Even in passing, Mr Carlton is helping others: he most generously donated an organ to another person in need. His legacy lives on. Vale, Jim Carlton.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs) (15:59):  I am honoured to be afforded the opportunity to speak on this condolence motion and say a few words in memory of my former boss and mentor, the Hon. Jim Carlton AO.


I attended Jim's state memorial service on 14 January 2016 in Wilson Hall, at the University of Melbourne. The word most used by those who spoke about Jim was 'gentleman'. Jim truly was a gentleman. You have only to look at the various press reports of the service to see that—for example, The Australian Financial Review talked about a 'Bipartisan flavour to Jim Carlton farewell'. Present there were, as has been indicated, former prime ministers John Howard and Paul Keating, former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer, former ministers Fred Chaney and Gareth Evans and of course my own colleagues Andrew Robb, Josh Frydenberg and Kevin Andrews. The Financial Review report refers to the very lively relationship that Jim had with Mr Keating, who, as Minister Scullion mentioned, referred to him as 'Old Rosie' in reference to Jim's rather pinkish complexion, not of course to his politics. As the Attorney correctly said, Jim combined not just the economic dry but the small 'l', socially progressive liberal in the political spectrum.


On the same day as his memorial service, there was a very moving piece titled 'Jim Carlton: a gentleman reformer who led the dry argument' by Peter Shack, who was one of Jim's longstanding friends and parliamentary colleagues. The article recalls various anecdotes about their time together but most importantly their time together during the Fraser years pushing for and adopting more market based and competitive policies—the article talks about how they used to meet in Jim's cramped little office—and that is how the dries were formed. It then goes on to talk about Bert Kelly and the work that they did, the work that Jim, Phil Lynch, John Hyde and others did and, instrumentally, the forming of the Society of Modest Members and the Crossroads Group.


I met Jim in 1990, when I approached him for a job. At that time, I was an acting principal legal officer with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service on secondment from the Australian Government Solicitor. I wrote to Jim and said, 'I would like a job with you.' At that time I was on the princely salary of $70,000, but I took a salary cut of half my salary to go and work with Jim. The rewards of working with Jim were greater. They were, indeed, the beginning of my political career. At the time, Jim was responsible for policy coordination and development. Together with David Kemp he was responsible for transition to government. Jim gave me a wonderful opportunity as a government lawyer. I had a good understanding of the public sector, having had the opportunity to act for many government departments and statutory authorities. Having had that experience, he afforded me a great chance to work very closely with him.


The first thing that he did was to give me a paper on vertical fiscal imbalance. Jim adhered to the Freiburg school of thought, which had influenced the reconstruction of Germany after the Second World War. I learnt a lot about Ludwig Erhard, famed for leading the German postwar recovery. Jim would organise gatherings where like-minded dries would come together to discuss important economic issues. The passion and debate at these gatherings was wonderful to witness, certainly to a budding politician. We also supported the Modest Members and their activities at Parliament House. I still recall Bert Kelly coming into the office with his little old school case and the wonderful discussions that would ensue. The work that Jim did as a minister was fantastic, but I actually think that the work he did while we were in opposition is truly what he will be remembered for.


At that time our shadow ministers were in various policy groups. It enabled them routinely to discuss their policy proposals but, more importantly, it enabled them to ensure that the broad policy agendas aligned with each other. Jim chaired the social policy group, but in his shadow role as policy coordinator he also coordinated policy right across the opposition. It was the time of Fightback, so our work was intense, detailed and very complex. My job was to take Fightback and translate that into the public sector changes necessary. I acquired copious quantities of butcher's paper. The office had two charts, on opposite walls—we were of course on the House of Reps side. One wall had a long sheet with the Public Service as it was then, down to the assistant secretary level, and on the other side was the Public Service under Fightback, down to the same level. My job was to look after the paper on the wall, but there was a lot of work that went into it. The thing about Jim that was wonderful was that he always welcomed discussion. He challenged me to be my best, to think clearly and to contribute always to the discussion. I saw that process of policy and politics firsthand. I learnt from a good man, a man who respected the process and who respected others. Indeed, our corridor on the first floor on the Reps side had all these former ministers, both Liberal and Labor, and the friendship across the political divide spoke of the great respect that Jim was held in. It was a good way to learn the fundamentals of political life.


At the 1993 election, Jim ensured that we were ready for government. We even had the administrative arrangements drawn up. Regrettably, the suitcase of work to transition to day 1 was never opened. It went back to Canberra and into the bowels of coalition history. After the election, I was seconded to be senior private secretary to then Premier John Fahey and I became involved in the division in New South Wales. I stood for preselection a number of times, until coming to this place in 2005. For me there were difficult times along the road, but Jim was always there with me. He supported me, he advised me and he was always there to offer counsel. 


After resigning as the member for Mackellar in 1994, Jim went on to run the Red Cross in Australia and, as the Attorney correctly said, he was awarded the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society through parliament and the Australian Red Cross, receiving its highest honour. Later that year, Jim was inducted as an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to the community, particularly through the Red Cross in the areas of international humanitarian relief, international law, peace and disarmament, and to the Australia parliament. 


His contribution to public life continued, virtually, until his death. Jim never really retired. His mind was sharp and agile. Indeed, just a few days before he passed away, I called Jim and Di and we had a long chat on a whole range of different issues as I drove down to Wollongong. We had organised for John and me to catch up with Jim and Di in the new year; sadly, this is not to be. Indeed, so many of his former staff attended his service. We were his wider family. I can recall, vividly, lunches that we used to have at his home in Avalon. He always made a point of inviting his staff and former staff to join him at Christmas lunch with Di at his home. 


Jim died, as he had lived his life, amongst his beloved family. At the memorial service, his son Rob recounted how Jim had passed away on Christmas eve. Jim loved to cook. The family had gathered at the New South Wales central home of Rob and his wife. Jim was not well and the ambulance was called. As Jim was taken away, he duly reminded Di, as he was carted off, about the preparations for the Christmas roast for the next day—I am recounting the story that his son Rob told at the memorial; but that was Jim to a tee. On Christmas day, his family celebrated his life and the wonderful contribution he had made. 


To Di, his wife and partner of many years, to his children—Alex, Freya and Rob—to his grandchildren and to his brothers and sisters, John and I offer our heartfelt condolences on the death of this wonderful man. 


On behalf of the Liberal Party of New South Wales, where Jim was the former secretary-general, I record its gratitude for the service that Jim gave. I live in Mackellar; indeed, I live close to the old Wentworth Estate where his predecessor resided. The people of Mackellar still remember Jim Carlton. 


Jim Carlton AO was highly regarded, respected and very well liked. He made a great contribution to public policy and debate as a minister and in other fields of endeavour. To me, he was a friend and a mentor. Vale Jim Carlton.

Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (16:10):  Others have noted the late Jim Carlton's distinguished service for the voters of Mackellar in Sydney; his term as health minister; his service to the Red Cross, receiving their highest honour; later academic contributions; and the Order of Australia recognition.


As chair of the Bert Kelly Research Centre and someone familiar with the group within the Liberal Party known as 'the dries', I met Jim regularly at Ray Evans's lunch meetings in Melbourne. Jim participated forcefully in the many debates at those lunches. I do not recall Jim ever missing a meeting. 


Jim was a true liberal and in economic matters supported market based competitive policies. Jim, John Hyde and others got together to press on with the cause that Bert Kelly had started but that had been cut short by the end of Bert's parliamentary career. Jim and Bert's parliamentary terms did not intersect. Bert concluded his service prior to the 1977 election that  saw Jim enter parliament.


The former member for Tangney Peter Shack observed in The Australian just before Jim's mid-January funeral that the remaining dries realised after the 1977 election that there was 'much which needed to be done to drag Australia out of the protected mercantilism of the 1950s and sixties in order to ensure a more internationally competitive nation and greater prosperity for all its citizens'.


Whilst John Hyde took a leading role in the dries, Jim provided the opportunity to sharpen their arguments, posing the wet side of the debates. Jim realised the importance of winning not just the economic arguments but also the moral arguments. Protectionism, for example, had to be exposed as not only economically foolish but also morally wrong. It had to be discredited and Jim was very good at this because he never played the man, only the ball, and was respected by all sides of politics for his gentlemanly conduct. Jim Carlton contributed to the style, tactics and strategies that the dries adopted to win a decades-long campaign of shifting public opinion and economic policy change.


On a personal note, Jim supported me becoming a member of the Society of Modest Members, which continues here today in honour of the late Bert Kelly, the original modest member. I thank the Senate for the time to mark Jim's passing and, like many here, I am happy to carry the torch of reform that Bert, Jim and others have passed to us. 



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Day. I ask honourable senators to stand with me in silence to give assent to the motion.

The opposition has indicated it is willing to work with the rest of parliament to make changes to existing shipping laws, where this is consistent with supporting a revitalised coastal and international shipping industry that employs Australians.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2016-02-02,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:58):  We may have replaced the Prime Minister, but the only difference that can be seen between former Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Turnbull is that Mr Turnbull wears a nicer cut of suit. So many people have made that comment that it has got to be true: that the only difference is that Mr Turnbull wears a nicer cut of suit.


The government removed Mr Abbott because he was unable to sell their misplaced priorities and disastrous broken promises. They did not remove him because they rejected his cruel policies. They still support those same cruel policies. The policies that caused the Australian people to decry Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey are still the same under Mr Turnbull. He is just hoping that nobody will notice. Mr Turnbull is also hoping that no-one will notice that the urbane, small 'l' liberal Mr Turnbull of times past has sold out every single principle he has to become Prime Minister—every single one. We are now seeing a huge gap between what the Prime Minister says and what he does.


He was hoping that by breaking promises during the summer holidays, when Australians were enjoying time with their families, no-one would notice. Between Christmas and New Year Mr Turnbull's Liberals confirmed they will dump the needs-based Gonski reforms and keep his massive school cuts. The new education minister has said that he will not fund years 5 and 6 of the Gonski school education funding reforms. This is an enormous disappointment to parents, to students and to teachers right around Australia. The students who will suffer the most are those in remote schools and in disadvantaged schools and particularly Indigenous children. Before the last federal election Christopher Pyne trumpeted his unity ticket on Gonski claiming, 'You can vote Liberal or Labor and you will get exactly the same amount of funding for your school.' Well, that is a clear broken promise—one which they tried to hide during the Christmas break.


This comes after two consecutive Liberal budgets that will strip $30 billion from our classrooms over the next decade. That is an average of over $3 million in school funding lost from every school in Australia. Australians should be outraged by these cuts. It is a farce that Mr Turnbull talks about innovation at the same time he is cutting funding for every school across the nation. The Liberal government's cuts to our classrooms are the equivalent of sacking one in every seven teachers. 


Labor knows that, if you are serious about education policy and equally if you are serious about this country's future economic growth, then you need to get our education system right and that means real investment in the programs that make a difference to increasing Australia's educational attainment. Labor's 'Your Child. Our Future' is a fully costed policy guaranteeing long-term education for all Australian children. We have a plan that will improve the literacy and numeracy of every child in every school in every state and territory and we have a plan that will increase year 12 retention, because we know that this is the biggest indicator of whether these students will go on to be employed. Labor's 'Your Child. Our Future' plan will see an additional investment in our education system of $4.5 billion over school years 2018 and 2019 and a total provision of $37.3 billion for the package over the decade. Labor has done it through finding sensible, appropriate and fair savings of $70 billion to pay for the most important program of school improvement in a generation.


As well as failing to properly fund schools the government's misplaced priorities have seen them cutting funding to the healthcare system. We saw recently the Australian Medical Association's Public hospital report card 2016 that confirms the crisis being created by the Turnbull government's decision to cut more than $57 billion in public hospital funding. Before the last election Labor had a signed agreement with all states and territories committing to fund 50 per cent growth funding at the national efficient price. The Liberals promised to match it. They have again broken this promise. Most importantly, this agreement included reforms to improve the efficiency of Australia's public hospitals to reduce waiting times and increase capacity. Instead, in one of their first acts in government the Liberals completely walked away from this promise. In doing so the Liberals immediately gave up on any attempt at reform and cut more than $57 billion in the process.


The government has fundamentally attacked bulk-billing of pathology and diagnostic-imaging services through $650 million in cuts for bulk-billing incentive payments. There are 50 million pathology tests done every year. It is extremely alarming that there will be many thousands of Australians who will end up not having vital pathology tests because they will no longer be able to afford them. This is a shameful attack by this government on the health of those who are least well off in our community. It is utterly shameful. This government's attacks on health are just more broken promises. 


Labor has a $7 billion plan to close tax loopholes and stop multinationals shifting profits offshore but the Liberals are refusing to adopt it. It is not a priority that they want to pursue. In fact, they have made it even easier for companies and high-wealth individuals to avoid paying their fair share of tax. The tax office has confirmed that more than half of the 2,149 redundancies in the ATO in 2014-15 came from the compliance business line, with the pivotal private groups and high-wealth individuals section losing 270 officials, or nearly 20 per cent of its workforce. It makes absolutely no sense for this government to sack the people responsible for ensuring that appropriate amounts of tax are paid by private groups and high-wealth individuals. 


Instead, the government wants to increase the GST to 15 per cent as well as increasing the base of the GST. It wants to slug the least well off in our society with a massive increase in the GST. We could see a massive increase in the cost of fresh food, education, health care, electricity and other vital daily expenses. A 15 per cent GST on everything, including fresh food, health care, aged care and education, will see an average family pay an extra $6,200 in GST per year—$6,200 extra in GST per year. That is a huge attack on household budgets and that is why on that side some of them are talking about compensation, but we all know that that compensation, because of inflation, gets eroded, gets eaten away, so any compensation is only temporary. This is a terrible attack on the budgets of millions of Australian households and it is not what the Australian people want.


The government has also shown that it does not care for our communities through its savage cuts to the DSS grants program. The government savagely cut $270 million from vital services that support and advocate for vulnerable communities, families and children, including domestic violence services, emergency relief and financial counselling. 


And what about the government's utter lack of interest in Australia's cultural heritage? The government's attacks on the arts community have been unfair. They have been unrelenting and they have been totally misguided and inappropriate. The Abbott-Turnbull government's attacks on the arts include more than $100 million of cuts in the 2014 budget, including $37 million from the national cultural institutions and $25 million from Screen Australia, a further $13.2 million cut from the Australia Council, Screen Australia and the Ministry for the Arts in the 2015 budget and, most appallingly, $105 million ripped from the Australia Council to fund the government's ministerial slush fund. In December, the government made an extraordinary cut of $10.4 million from Screen Australia to help fund the government's spending on two films by the American filmmaker Ridley Scott—Alien: Covenant and Thor. This government, the Turnbull government, has decided that it will utterly decimate the Australian film industry to fund foreign films. So, apart from its broken promises, the government continues to show that its priorities are completely and utterly wrong.


As we have seen, the new Prime Minister has just continued the cuts, broken promises and wrong priorities of the previous Prime Minister. Mr Turnbull sold out every belief he had to become Prime Minister and his continued following and implementation of Mr Abbott's policies shows this to be so. He is beholden to the conservatives in his cabinet and on his backbench—those who want to cut health, cut education, cut the arts while allowing multinationals to pay almost no tax and allowing very high income earners to get extremely large superannuation tax concessions. He has done nothing, and will do nothing, to change these terrible policies.


He has been happy to allow the least well-off Australians to suffer, just to fuel his personal ambition. Mr Turnbull is rapidly looking like the Wizard of Oz: just a powerless man in a shiny suit hoping that no-one will notice he is a fraud, arguing against everything he used to believe in. I can assure Mr Turnbull and his senators opposite— (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:08):  First of all, I want to thank Senator Moore and Senator Bilyk for raising this matter for debate today because it gives me the opportunity to highlight some of the exciting new policies being brought forward by the coalition government. Can I start with the $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda, which will help create a modern, dynamic 21st-century economy for Australia. Our innovation agenda will promote a culture of entrepreneurship and place innovation at the heart of everything we do as a nation. We will make it easier for start-ups and new innovative businesses to access early stage capital to grow their businesses by providing a 20 per cent tax offset for investments up to $1 million, as well as capital gains tax exemption. And we will be establishing a $200 million CSIRO Innovation Fund to turn world-leading research into commercial outcomes and to help small CSIRO spin-off companies access capital to grow their business. Our innovation agenda will help transform Australia into a leading innovation nation and position us to seize the next wave of economic prosperity.


This is a debate, and I simply cannot let pass some of the fantasy stories told by the previous speaker in her contribution. She talked about school cuts under the coalition government. As Senator Birmingham pointed out time and time again in question time, there are no school cuts; there is increased funding for schools. What happened was Labor—without any budgeting, without any money—said, 'We're going to spend X amount on schools.' This was not funded at all. We get into government, find there is no money there and so we have to increase the money that is there to do the things that the coalition government wants to do. So Senator Bilyk is wrong on school cuts: there are no school cuts; there are increases. Similarly with Gonski: there were no forward funding commitments for Gonski. That is being contributed by the coalition government.


Senator Bilyk talked about the tax of multinationals. The Labor Party was in power for six long years and did not a thing about the problem that Senate Bilyk now says is such a major concern for the Australian economy. By contrast, the coalition government has already introduced legislation to deal with that. There has been no talk by anyone on our side of politics about a 15 per cent GST, but day after day after day I hear Labor's spokesmen saying nothing else but '15 per cent GST'. The only one actually proposing this, until two days ago, was the Labor Premier of South Australia. He was the only one, until Mr Baird entered the debate; until then, for the last four months the only one who has been advocating a 15 per cent GST has been a Labor politician, the Labor Premier of South Australia.


Senator Bilyk also talked about arts funding. I am delighted today to hear that, out of the minister's Catalyst fund, the Girringun Aboriginal community—based in Cardwell, between Townsville and Cairns—has received funding through Catalyst to the display of the works of the Girringun Aboriginal Corporation, and the wonderful painters and contributors they have from that community, in exhibitions in Sydney and at the Monaco art festival. This is made possible not by the Australia Council, not by state governments, but by Senator Fifield's Catalyst fund, which allows the government to fund wonderful, very useful and very worthwhile groups like the Girringun Aboriginal Corporation to display their artworks around the world. I understand from Senator Bilyk that she would be opposed to this, so I will make sure the Girringun Aboriginal community are aware of that.


The subject of the debate does have some credence, because there are things that the Turnbull government will not be changing. For example, we will not be changing the coalition's policy of stopping the boats—a policy that Labor could not even comprehend, but we did. The Turnbull government will continue that policy to save lives and to save having children in detention. Furthermore, the Turnbull government will continue the coalition government's campaign to get children out of immigration detention. When we took office, almost 2,000 children were in detention under the Labor-Greens government that ran Australia; now there are fewer than 100. We are going to continue the policies that have allowed that.


We have abolished the carbon tax, and I can assure you that no coalition government ever again in the future will be reintroducing Labor's carbon tax. We will be meeting the climate change targets that the coalition government have set and which I see that the new Chief Scientist has said are well set and will be able to be met by the coalition's policies. And it is wonderful to see that we are doing something about reducing carbon emissions while the rest of the world just talks about it. We are actually doing it, and we will continue doing it.


We are going to continue the coalition's policy of having a referendum on same-sex marriage. What can be wrong with asking the Australian people in a plebiscite to determine this difficult issue? When you are in a democracy, what can be more democratic than asking the Australian people to do it?


Another thing the coalition will not be changing is our determination to build the infrastructure of the 21st century for our country. The money that the Australian government has put in and has leveraged from others into our infrastructure is just legend. Over the Christmas break I had the opportunity of driving to Brisbane along the Bruce Highway, and I am amazed at the amount of work that has been done. I had heard about it. I had seen media releases about all the work along the Bruce Highway, but I actually experienced it. This is work that the coalition has done which Labor could never do, and that policy of building the infrastructure for the next century will continue.


Could I finish on northern Australia? The coalition government have a wonderful policy on northern Australia that we have been considering for the last 10 years, I have to say, and in earnest for the last three or four years. We had a green-paper process on northern Australia. We had a white-paper process. We consulted everyone. We launched the white paper in June last year. I have to say that the wonderful initiatives in that—including the $5 billion loan facility, the CRC, the new infrastructure, new water policies and a new dam policy—are all happening. We are no longer talking about them.


But, by contrast, what are Labor doing? Let me tell you what Labor are doing. Labor have suddenly decided that they have to set up a northern Australia task force to consult with people on what they should do for their policy. They have not got a policy. They have never had a policy on north Australia. And suddenly they are starting, about five years behind the coalition, on looking for a policy for north Australia. With respect to my friend and colleague Senator McLucas, I think she is in charge of that, but unfortunately the Labor Party in their wisdom have got rid of Senator McLucas from their Senate team and replaced her with a bloke from Brisbane, a union delegate—a union hack from Brisbane to replace northern Senator McLucas. And yet she is given the unenviable task of trying to pull together a northern Australia policy before she leaves the Senate in favour of a Brisbane union hack who is taking her place.


As to this discussion by the Australian Labor Party, I am delighted they have brought it forward. It allows me and my colleagues to demonstrate just what wonderful new initiatives are coming forward under the current government and under Prime Minister Turnbull but also to emphasise that the tried and tested policies that the Australian people elected us on will continue for the benefit of all Australians.

"Simms, Sen Robert",AG,2016-02-02,"



Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (17:18):  I thank Senator Macdonald for highlighting the fact that, despite the change of leader, the Liberal Party have stuck with the same deeply unpopular and divisive policies, the kinds of toxic policies that are bad for our nation and bad for our planet. They are things like inaction on climate change, things like cruelty towards asylum seekers and things like spending $160 million on a costly and divisive plebiscite on marriage equality, asking a question when we already know the answer. We know Australians support that reform.


It is interesting. When Mr Turnbull became Prime Minister, he talked a lot about new ideas and new innovations: 'There has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian,' and so on and so forth. We have heard these lines repeated ad nauseam over the last four months. But it is clear that Mr Turnbull is all sizzle and no sausage. It is clear that he is all sizzle and no sausage because, when it comes to putting the meat on the bones, when it comes to actually articulating a different policy agenda, all the Liberal Party have under Malcolm Turnbull is the same stale, Abbott-era policies as Senator Macdonald has highlighted. He is leaving the room, no doubt embarrassed by the reality of that.


In terms of this issue of a plebiscite, Mr Turnbull has made his views on this very clear. He said in a media interview to 3AW just the other day—and these comments were widely reported in the news at the time—that he favours a traditional free vote in the parliament as a way of resolving the issue of marriage equality but that, when Mr Abbott was the Prime Minister, it was determined that the matter would be put to the people through a plebiscite. That is the position that he has adopted, on the basis that it is Mr Abbott's position.


The Australian people may well ask: who is running this show? Who is running this government? Is it Mr Turnbull, or is it Mr Abbott and his conservative supporters on the backbench? Despite the fact that Mr Turnbull has articulated a view in favour of marriage equality, he seems to be completely powerless to rein in his colleagues and to deal with this issue. We saw last week the unedifying spectacle of the Liberal and National parties tying themselves in a knot over this issue, quite frankly making a meal of an entree over the issue of marriage equality, making this issue far more complex than it has to be.


We know from media reports over the last week that the numbers are now here in the parliament. For the first time, we have a majority of members of parliament in both houses who support marriage equality and want to see action on that reform. But there is one thing that is holding back progress on this issue, and that is Mr Turnbull. Because Mr Turnbull is refusing to grant his colleagues a free vote, because he is wedded to the Abbott-era policy of a deeply divisive and costly plebiscite, he is holding back progress on this issue.


The reality is the Australian people do not want a costly and divisive plebiscite on marriage equality. Just today we saw a poll that came out in Nationals-held seats that found that 63 per cent of those polled described the $160 million plebiscite as 'poor' or 'very poor' value for money. Fifty-six per cent of voters supported the parliament resolving the issue on its own. Only 28 per cent of those polled supported a plebiscite. So it seems this idea of a plebiscite on marriage equality is about as popular as its architect, Tony Abbott. It is going down like a lead balloon in the Australian community. It really is time for the Liberal Party to dump this policy. We have seen a change in leader but we are seeing a continuation of the same unpopular policies that led Mr Abbott to be repudiated so strongly by the Australian people.


The reality is that the numbers are mounting. The list of policy failures for this government is growing. It is time for the government to show some leadership and take action on this issue. The issue of marriage equality presents an easy win for Mr Turnbull. Heading into an election year, why doesn't he put it to the parliament and let the parliament decide it? There are two bills—a bill before the Senate and a bill before the House of Representatives. All he needs to do is grant a conscience vote, and we can save $160 million and get this matter done.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2016-02-02,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (17:23):  The legacy of former Prime Minister Mr Abbott will be that he was a Prime Minister who could not be trusted. He was a Prime Minister who broke his promise on almost everything he committed to in the lead-up to the election and after the election. His legacy will be that of the worst Prime Minister in our recent history, a Prime Minister absolutely despised by Australians who voted for him in the end—




Senator Cameron:
  And his own party. 




Senator LINES:
  Yes, and his own party—thank you, Senator Cameron. He could not be trusted on health. Despite his saying there would be no cuts to health, we saw the cuts from day 1. Despite his saying there was a unity ticket on Gonski—tricking the Australian voters to vote for him, believing that a vote for Mr Abbott would mean no change to Labor's commitment on Gonski; we saw those signs, and I certainly saw them in Western Australia—almost immediately upon his winning government we saw that broken promise. Very quickly it was: 'Nah. Sorry. You've voted for us. Now we've got our three years and we're not committing to Gonski.' 


We saw cuts to SBS and ABC and we saw those ridiculous interviews with Prime Minister Abbott in which he tried to justify it, saying it wasn't quite a promise. The cuts were there. And then others were trying to break the bad news that it was a promise he should not have made. In fact, Mr Turnbull had to try and deal with that one. We saw the appallingly weak efforts of the Abbott government on climate change—introducing Direct Action. Not only was it a laughing stock in Australia—not supported by any kind of scientist or scientific body you would care to name—but now, after Paris, it is a joke among developed countries in the world. Was it any wonder really that backbenchers and those in marginal electorates got a little bit nervous and last year decided that Mr Abbott needed to go? So along came Mr Turnbull. 


A lot is known about Mr Turnbull because he likes to talk about himself. He has been an absolute advocate for a republic. But are we going to see a republic? No, because, according to Mr Turnbull, who was the leading advocate when we had the referendum on becoming a republic, somehow things have changed. He was a leading sceptic on Direct Action and he has made well publicised comments about how useless Direct Action is and how it will not deliver, and yet what we see is that he is going to continue with that policy. It would seem that he is no longer a republican and no longer a supporter of action on climate change. 


In his electorate of Wentworth there are a lot of same-sex couples, and he has advocated on their behalf as a supporter of marriage equality. But, no, he has decided—or Mr Abbott and his 44 supporters have decided—that we have to continue with this ridiculous plebiscite. Even members of the government cannot name it properly; we just heard it being called a 'referendum'. Perhaps those speaking notes that were leaked yesterday need to make sure that government backbenchers get the language right. Someone should tell Senator Macdonald that actually we are not having a referendum; we are having a $160 million plebiscite that means nothing. 


What we have seen in the new year is Senator Abetz come out and say, 'We don't really care what the Australian voters think, because we're sticking to our guns and we will not vote for marriage equality'. We are a joke. There are many countries that are much more conservative and that have strong religious backing around the world who have moved on marriage equality, and yet we are dragging ourselves along, limping along. The plebiscite will deliver nothing. We do not trust the question; we have not seen it yet; we do not know when it is going to happen. There is still uncertainty. 


So, for those couples who want to get married, who want to be like every other couple in Australia, it is those on the other side, it is the Turnbull government, it is Mr Turnbull himself, who are standing in the way of them and marriage equality. The time is long done. For a government that goes on and on and on about money, they are quite happy to throw at least $160 million at this ridiculous question, even though quite a number of their backbenchers have said, 'We don't really care what the plebiscite is; we are still sticking to our guns and not allowing marriage equality.' 


Of course we have seen the attacks that former Prime Minister Abbott made on our health system and they have continued well and truly. In fact Mr Turnbull, who seems to think that women need supporting, over the Christmas break tried to put through changes to Medicare that would directly impact women: going after women's health, going after the diagnostic tools that are required to ensure that women are able to have pap smears so that cervical cancer is easily detected. 


All of those are thanks to Mr Turnbull. They are his very own cuts. He has taken the legacy of Mr Abbott and moved it forward: Direct Action, poor policy, nothing on marriage equality, nothing on a referendum—supposedly things Mr Turnbull believes in, all crashed and burned. And now he is making his own draconian cuts that attack women directly.


I do not know how those opposite can think that it is okay to say to women, 'You will have to bear an up-front cost for a pap smear.' The thing they did not research—Turnbull government ministers do not really research very well—is that it says in the Medicare arrangements that if you are not bulk-billed for pathology and diagnostic services you have to pay up-front for them. That is a cost of thousands and thousands of dollars that they are imposing on every single Australian, particularly on women. That is who they have gone after. Is that any wonder? The Turnbull government seems to ignore women in its own cabinet and around the country. It might have put a few more women in, but it is a long way from being equal.


We saw the disgraceful behaviour of Jamie Briggs over the break. Some members of the Turnbull government tweeted, 'Never mind mate!', ignoring the fact that what he did was reprehensible and that no-one should have been supporting the disgraceful comments and actions of Jamie Briggs. Yet they did. A number of them came out in support of him. He has paid the price for that, as he should have. It is indicative of the Turnbull government, because women do not feature prominently anywhere on their agenda. Australian women, ordinary women, will pay dearly under the Turnbull government's cuts to health.


It was Medicare's 32nd birthday last year, but we know that right from day one Liberal and National governments have opposed Medicare. They think that people should somehow be paying for their own health, that it is not something that we as Australians should hold near and dear. Under Mr Fraser they tried to knock it down. They tried and tried and tried, but it is in place. Generations of Australians have taken Medicare for granted. What Australians have now learned is that under a coalition government you cannot take Medicare for granted, that the only governments that protect Medicare, that do not seek to run it into the ground, are Labor governments. We understand that health should be universal, that you should have access to health regardless of your income.


These cuts to pathology and diagnostic services will hit those who can least afford it. We know that we need more investment for pap smears, because women are not presenting for subsequent tests. Mr Turnbull's government has made it worse by saying to women that they are going to have to cop out-of-pocket expenses. What would men understand about this? They never have to have pap smears. They never have to front for the sorts of tests and for the sorts of health issues that women have. For breast cancer it is not just one X-ray that you have; it is several. It is three, four, five or six, until we get to the nub of the issue. All of those will have to be paid for up-front because of the savage Turnbull cuts. So women again will bear the brunt of these cuts. We have seen the savage attacks on women, whether it is women in the Public Service or women on parental leave being accused of being double dippers. Now it is women's health that is right there, front and centre.


Guess what? Women in our country vote, and when they go to the ballot box they will remember. They will not support the Turnbull government, which has done nothing but make life much harder for Australian women. It was a disgraceful attack on women over the Christmas break.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:34):  I am really pleased to be able to contribute to this matter of public importance debate on the Turnbull government. This is a debate about priorities. It is a debate about our government's priorities. Senator Lines spent a lot of time talking about a republic. Fair enough, I am a republican.




Senator Smith:
  Oh!




Senator SESELJA:
  I heard that phrase from my colleague Senator Smith, but I do not see a republic being the top issue for Australians. I do not see it as being the issue about which they are beating down our door. The priorities are somewhat different. Senator Lines just launched into an attack, and there was an attempt in question time: 'Prime Minister Turnbull said this three years ago. He said this five years ago.' I just don't think it is working.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  I don't believe it is. It is a little bit flat. It is little bit like they are going through the motions. They are saying, 'What about this you said about the republic? What about that you said about climate change and direct action?' I don't think the Australian people are interested, frankly. It is gotcha politics. If you go down to the pub and quiz people: 'Did you know that Prime Minister Turnbull said X on the republic five years ago and he said Y today?', you would find that most people would not care. What they would care about are the priorities of this government and, primarily, about the economy.


I will talk about some of those priorities and some of the things that we have delivered. It is a long list. I am not going to be able to get through it in the five minutes I have to speak, but I will do my best to get through some of the significant achievements and priorities of this government versus the Labor Party's priorities. Let us be clear, what are those? We know from its year of ideas what they are—more taxes. Those were the ideas it came up with. Bill Shorten said, 'I'm going to come up with all these ideas, this year.' What he came up with was that we will do more taxes. That is not a plan. It is not a genuine priority to say that you will tax more. You should be looking to tax less. That is my view and it is the coalition's view. You should be looking to keep taxes as low as possible. Deliver the services that are necessary and deliver them well, but try to keep taxes lower.


We have seen jobs growth in the past year. That is our priority. We have created something like 335,000 jobs since the last election—I think it is beyond that now. We have reduced Labor's budget deficit by tens of billions of dollars through savings we have made. We have seen female workforce participation at record levels. Is that not a great thing? We are seeing women coming into the workforce in record numbers, bankruptcy at the lowest level in 20 years and environmental approvals to projects valued at more than $1 trillion. Think about the great job opportunities that are there when we have an environment minister who will put on conditions but will not just mindlessly block projects at the behest of the Greens. 


There is $50 billion in infrastructure—that is growing our nation and growing jobs. There are tax cuts for small business, which is just sensational. We have seen small businesses around this country getting some of the best conditions we can offer them and the lowest tax rates they have seen since the 1960s—that is a great achievement. And, of course, even as we have sought to get the budget under control, funding for hospitals is up over 25 per cent over four years and funding for schools is up 28 per cent over four years. 


We are delivering on the key service areas, we are delivering on tax cuts for small business, we are delivering by signing free trade agreements with our major partners—Korea, Japan and China. Think of the possibilities, the endless possibilities, when we open up more and more trade with our major Asian trading partners. This is a government that is focused on the priorities of Australians. Australians want to see us focused on jobs and through our innovation package on growing jobs in new ways. We accept that, whilst mining will continue to be important for us and resources will continue to be important for us, we always need to be looking to grow new industries.


The service opportunities of even just our free trade agreement with China are phenomenal—that is where so many of our strengths are, of course. I know, here in Canberra, our export industries—our service industries, primarily—are the smarts of individuals and businesses coming up with great ideas that they can now have greater opportunities to deliver to the likes of the Chinese market. 


We got rid of the carbon tax and that has saved hundreds of dollars a year on people's electricity and gas bills. They said we would not be able to do it, and we did, at the same time delivering Direct Action—that is, delivering on our targets but without a carbon tax, which the Labor Party would love to bring back. 


National security and border security are the kinds of priorities we have that we know the Labor Party did not take seriously. They did not take it seriously because we saw the tens of thousands of boat arrivals, the thousands of illegal arrivals. Yet, when we said we would stop those unlawful arrivals, the Labor Party, the Greens and parts of the media said we could not do it. Well, we did. We said we would do it and we delivered on it and, as a result, not only did we save lives but also we restored order to our immigration process. Unfortunately, we have seen that other countries that do not maintain control of their borders suffer the consequences over time. Australians support an orderly immigration program. They support a strong immigration program, provided it is done according to the rule of law and according to our priorities. 


So these are some of the achievements of this government; these are some of the priorities of this government. On the other side there are higher taxes, more wasteful spending and an inability to actually deliver on the promises they want to have the Australian people believe they will deliver on.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2016-02-02,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:41):  I rise to add my contribution to this debate, one that goes to the heart of decisions pending for the Prime Minister, Malcom Turnbull. Since taking over the leadership, there has been expectation and anticipation that perhaps we would see a change from the new Prime Minister, a departure from the harsh, cruel and blunt ways and policies of the previous Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. When it comes to the issue of children in detention, I am very, very interested in watching and listening to precisely what this Prime Minister does in this regard. 


Today, as I stand here, there are 90 children in Australia who are anxiously waiting on the results of a High Court decision to be handed down tomorrow. The reason they are waiting anxiously for this decision is that only two weeks ago the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, directly threatened these children. He said that if these children and their families lose the High Court case tomorrow, they will be sent back to the hellhole of Nauru. These are children, many of whom have been transferred to Australia because of the damage that has been done to them in detention on Nauru; women who have been subjected to sexual abuse and assault that we know has occurred inside the Nauru detention centre and on that island—it is well documented by numerous reports, including the government's own Moss review; and children who have been subjected to abuse, intimidation and violence at the Nauru detention camp. 


For example, a five-year-old boy, who was sexually assaulted and abused in Nauru, was sent to Australia to get the appropriate medical assistance. That boy's life now hangs in the balance as to whether he will be deported to Nauru, back to the place where he suffered such abuse and such inhumane treatment, or whether the Prime Minister will do the right thing and override his minister's call? Will Malcolm Turnbull stand up to Peter Dutton and ensure that this four-year-old-boy and the other 90 children here in Australia are not sent back to the detention centre and the prison island that is Nauru? 


Many people have been watching and waiting for Malcolm Turnbull to show more compassion or empathy on this issue. Many have been waiting for him to stick by what he previously said which was that he did not believe that children belong in immigration detention. Well, this is the big test for Malcolm Turnbull tomorrow 


His minister says these families and these children will be on the next plane to Nauru. Will Malcolm Turnbull let him be that cruel or will he step in and save them from that awful fate?


Only 2½ or three weeks ago I visited a family in Melbourne who had been transferred from Nauru to Australia because of the very, very severe impacts on their mental health as a result of their indefinite detention. They had been in detention on Nauru for two years. Their baby was born here in Australia. She is now almost one year old. That family are now going to sleep tonight with the fear that if the High Court case fails they will be sent back to living hell.


I find it extraordinary that we have a Prime Minister who talks about not wanting to see children in detention and talks about a fair and compassionate society. How can he stand there tomorrow and allow these families to be deported? Hundreds and thousands of people across the country today—as they will be tomorrow—are calling for the Prime Minister to do the right thing, and I hope that he does.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:46):  I too rise to make a contribution to this matter of public importance debate. Whilst it is true that we have a new Prime Minister and that Prime Minister Abbott is no longer at the wheel, so to speak, it is important to put on the public record once again that Mr Turnbull sold out on climate change to get the top job, sold out his position on marriage equality to get the top job and has compromised and sold out his position on a republic to get the top job. That is not a bad trifecta! Things that he has had widely-held and deeply-felt views about have been put aside to take the top job.


It is very important to also put on the public record his public comments about the Abbott government. Prime Minister Turnbull has publicly supported the worst of the Abbott cuts and broken promises. He supported every measure in the Abbott and Hockey unfair budgets, with the comment:


I support unreservedly and wholeheartedly every element in the budget. Every single one.


He supported the GP tax. He said:


I support every element, of course, including the Medicare co-payment.


He supported the $100,000 degrees and cuts to university funding. He said:


I support the reforms to higher education.


He supported cuts to family payments. He said:


I support the changes to family payment reform.


He supported the $80 billion cuts to schools and hospitals. 'Of course, every single member of the government supports every element of the budget'—that was his public statement.


We know that as communications minister the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull delivered a slower, second-rate NBN process and doubled the cost. While we are at it, let's look at the promise of no cuts to the ABC or SBS. As minister he cut $254 million from the ABC and $25 million from SBS. So all of the work that Tony Abbott was castigated for which caused his backbench to revolt and overthrow him is being continued as we speak every day of the current Turnbull government.


We heard Senator Macdonald's contribution. I suppose on the bright side he went from the worst day of his life when Prime Minister Abbott dumped him to, in this last year of the government, probably sniffing an opportunity. If there is a coalition win, will he make a comeback? Will the worst day of his life when he was dumped as a potential minister mysteriously turn into someone recognising his talents and promoting him? His contribution certainly seemed to be in that vein. He was out here auditioning for a role in a future Turnbull government.


I want to go back to question time. If you listened to question time and this debate you probably think there are two parallel universes. In the debate on funding in education we are painting one clear picture and the government is saying something completely different. Senator Birmingham let his guard down a bit when he mentioned that money is not the only way of improving education. He almost came clean and said, 'Yes, now we are cutting,' but he did not quite. But the reality is the government's promises to every South Australian before the last election were very simple and very clear: 'Liberals will match Labor's school funding dollar for dollar.' That was abundantly clear in all of the electoral material that was distributed in South Australia. As I said in question time today, I will seek leave to table the document which underpins the veracity of that line of questioning. I seek leave to table this document.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  Is leave granted?




Senator Scullion:
  No.


Leave not granted.




Senator GALLACHER:
  It is not surprising that the government would not grant leave for something that hangs them or hoists them on their own petard. They said they would match the funding. The reality is they are chopping and cutting. They are going to be convicted in the court of public opinion in South Australia, because parents know that things are not right in their schools. They know that public schools need more resources, not fewer. If Senator Birmingham is underwhelmed by a public school, he ought to resource it better.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:51):  I extend my best wishes to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, on the first day of our parliamentary year and, indeed, I extend them to all of my Senate colleagues. I pity, of course, my Senate colleagues on the opposite side. We saw today just how much of a struggle it is for Labor in 2016 to come to grips with the new modernity and leadership of our national leader in Malcolm Turnbull, the leader of the coalition. They have struggled with the same story and message that they tried to prosecute last year on the first day of this new parliamentary year when we have a fresh, reinvigorated government and a fresh, reinvigorated Prime Minister.


Labor is confused. It is dazed. It cannot find its mojo under the national leadership of Malcolm Turnbull. When Labor talked today about the government's priorities, it was interesting to hear what they did not talk about. They did not talk about the success of the previous Prime Minister and, indeed, the coalition government, in abolishing the carbon tax. They did not talk about the success of the previous Prime Minister and the success of the previous coalition government in abolishing the mining tax. And they could not bring themselves to have a touch of graciousness when it came to the policy that has stopped deaths at sea. They could not bring themselves to even credit the coalition government with having stopped deaths at sea with its stronger borders approach.


I want to touch briefly on the suggestion that this government, as we approach the election this year, in some way or in some form, has the wrong priorities. The government has stopped the carnage on the high seas by halting the flow of boats, meaning that people are no longer drowning when they try to travel to Australia illegally. How can that be a wrong priority? 


There are more Australians employed today than ever before. Month after month, Labor come here trying to predict doom and gloom in the unemployment figures, but unemployment is heading down under the coalition. There were over 300,000 jobs created in 2015—the largest number since 2006, easily surpassing anything Labor were able to achieve in office. How can that be a wrong priority? 


Indeed, on issues important to my home state of Western Australia, the government has concluded free trade agreements with Japan, South Korea and China—agreements that Labor were good to talk about but bad in bringing to a conclusion when they were in office. They were all talk when it came to free trade agreements; there was no ink on the final agreements. These agreements, as we know, will create significant new export opportunities for Australian producers and might be part of the reason consumer sentiment continues to be on the rise in our country even as it declines elsewhere in the world. How can these be wrong priorities? 


We have heard Labor and, indeed, the Greens very predictably try to prosecute arguments about the republic, try to prosecute arguments about same-sex marriage and try to prosecute arguments about climate change. I am tired of having to come to this place and say, 'While those are issues of some importance and relevance to ordinary Australians, they are not issues that are ""top of mind"".' Let me tell you what issues are top of mind for everyday Australians. They are: keeping our borders strong, generating jobs growth and, importantly, from my home state of Western Australia again, tackling this big, bold dream that we have always had in our country to develop northern Australia.


Let me briefly, in the time that is available, reflect on the government's success in keeping borders strong but also, importantly, in making sure there are no unfortunate deaths at sea. Just last year, in December, the immigration minister reflected on the achievement of the government. Over 1,200 people drowned when Labor were in government. Five years of Labor mismanagement meant that people lost their lives at sea. In the two years since, no-one has died risking their lives to come to Australia. Since commencing the turnback policy, more than 20 boats carrying 650 passengers—people who are paying people smugglers—have been returned to their country. There is no excusing the fact that Operation Sovereign Borders is a tough policy; it is tough on people smugglers. But it is a great virtue because it saves people's lives. There has been nothing from Labor about the important policy priority of protecting our borders. It is worth reflecting on what happened under Labor. Labor opened 17 additional detention centres. The coalition has closed 13. Around 9,000 people who arrived illegally by boat were in detention when Operation Sovereign Borders commenced. We have reduced this to just 900. Most importantly, we have reduced the number of children in detention. More than 8,600 children were detained during Labor's two terms, peaking at nearly 2,000 in July 2013. We have reduced that number to fewer than 100 today. No-one likes children in detention. Senator Hanson-Young is right: 80 is too many. But the clearest dividend of the government's success in regard to Operation Sovereign Borders is the government's generosity in addressing the humanitarian crisis in Syria and Iraq by resettling 12,000 additional refugees here. These places are for the most vulnerable people: persecuted women, children and families with the least prospect of ever returning to their homes. There has been nothing from Labor in regard to the important priorities of protecting our borders, reducing loss of life at sea and, as a dividend, being able to bring 12,000 refugees to our country to give them a better opportunity at a new life.


The government has made it clear: jobs and growth are its mantra; jobs and growth are its priority. It is worth reflecting briefly, in the time that is available to me, just how successful the government has been so far in its first term. The government has a strong record when it comes to jobs with 427,200 jobs created since we came to office. It is worth comparing that with Labor's last year in office. In 2013, employment growth was just 1,900 per month—an annual growth rate of just 0.2 per cent. Over the past year, jobs growth has been more than 10 times that amount with more than 25,100 jobs created per month—an annual growth rate of 2.6 per cent. The government's priorities are right. The government's priorities reflect the priorities of ordinary Australians, and that will be reflected later in the year at the general election.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! The time for consideration of the matter of public importance has expired.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2016-02-02,"




Senator CAROL BROWN

 (
Tasmania
) (
18:01
):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I wish to speak on the government response to the report of the Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into grandparents who take primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren.


The response was tabled last month, nearly 15 months after the committee presented its report in this place and only after a motion was moved in this place calling on the government to respond. I have to say that the response by the government is at the very least disappointing. It highlights this government's failure to understand and acknowledge the significant contribution of tens of thousands of grandparents raising grandchildren across this country. It is evident both in the failure to respond in a timely manner and in the content of the belated response.


It is clear that the Turnbull government still do not understand the needs of grandparent carers and their families, and I know that many senators across the chamber would have been disappointed in the response that we have received from the government. It is clear that they did not listen to the evidence that was presented to the Senate committee. That evidence was at times very emotional and also at times quite harrowing. The Senate committee heard many personal accounts of grandparents who were raising their grandchildren and the significant challenges faced by grandparent-headed families. The committee heard evidence from people who were giving everything to provide a safe and loving home and family for their grandchildren when the children's parents are no longer able to look after them.


At the time of the tabling of the Community Affairs References Committee report, I quoted from the evidence from Mrs Sharyne De Young from Grandparents Rearing Grandchildren WA, which I said encapsulated the evidence that the committee heard. I again draw the Senate's attention to Mrs De Young's evidence. She said:


This road grandparents are on is long, hard, tough, bumpy, painful, soul-destroying and exhausting, but much love, determination and courage is given by grandparents to raise healthy and happy grandchildren. 


These grandparents play a huge role in the lives of the grandchildren they are raising. The government's response shows little understanding of the role that these grandparents play and the challenging and tragic circumstances that can lead to them taking on this role. 


Particularly disappointing was the abdication of responsibility that was shown in the response of the Turnbull government. In relation to a number of recommendations that the committee directed to COAG, the government's response merely acknowledged that the issue was one best dealt with by the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers. There was no commitment to progressing these recommendations. There was no commitment to raising them with their state and territory colleagues. This probably comes as no surprise to grandparents raising grandchildren. This would come as little surprise to them, as they know that only last year the Turnbull government sought to cut payments to grandparent carers.


We on this side forced the Turnbull government to back down from its plan to remove 4,000 grandparent carers from family tax benefit part B, and I have no doubt that these grandparents remember how Mr Turnbull, Mr Morrison and Mr Porter tried to repeatedly defend their proposed cuts. Mr Porter even went as far as to insult grandparent carers by saying they should go back to work. If Mr Porter had paid any attention to the evidence received by the Senate committee, he would understand how absolutely offensive that is. As the Senate committee heard, those grandparents still of working age are often forced to leave work to take on the caring role. Other grandparents find themselves taking on the caring role for children, often young children, well into their retirement years.


Instead of trying to take money off grandparent carers, it is time the Turnbull government gave them support and the recognition they deserve. In contrast, Labor understands the significant challenges faced by grandparent headed families. That is exactly why Labor stood side by side with grandparent carers in the face of massive cuts. I seek leave to continue my remarks, as I have much more to say regarding this response by the government.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (18:14):  I present the interim report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the use of flag-of-convenience shipping in Australia. I move: 


That the time for presentation of the final report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the use of flag-of-convenience shipping be extended to 25 February 2016.


Question agreed to.




Senator STERLE:
  It was only in late November or early December last year that another piece of legislation went through this chamber. I do not want to talk about other pieces of legislation, but I think it is important to note to remind senators opposite of what they are trying to achieve in killing off an Australian industry. Quite a few months ago, last year, there was a very high profile 7.30 report or Four Corners report on a certain ship that came into Australian waters. To cut a long story short, there were a number of mysterious deaths on that ship, and one person mysteriously went missing. Of course, we have called an inquiry, fully backed up in this chamber by crossbench senators and the Greens, to have a good look at flag-of-convenience shipping and what it means for Australia.


It should be of no surprise to the Australian parliament that we have a serious issue not only with the exploitation of foreign workers but for Australian governments, particularly of the persuasion that we have on the other side. Even though they have changed captains from Mr Abbott to Mr Turnbull, they are obsessed with driving Australian jobs offshore—and I do not mean that as a pun. It is probably better to say that they are obsessed with killing off the Australian domestic shipping industry. We must not get confused by all the nonsense that goes out from senators like Senator Day and Senator Leyonhjelm, who want to look at the Productivity Commission and at how we can make shipping cheaper. It is plainly doing away with the Australian jobs and replacing Australian seafarers with foreign ships and foreign crew.


I am the first one to stand up here and say we absolutely have to do our best to make sure foreign workers are not exploited. But, sadly, there is no other reason why we would replace Australian ships and Australian seafarers with foreigners—it is all about driving down wages. I have sat in the Senate inquiry into this matter and listened to the mining industry and the cement industry shedding crocodile tears about 'how broke we are because we have to pay Australian wages'. It is an absolute nonsense! We should not let a certain amount of people off the hook here, apart from the Prime Minister and the minister for transport, who has gone missing in sticking up for Australian jobs, when we have seen the demise of Australian jobs on the MV Portland. 


The MV Portland has been a high-profile issue.  I am going to hear tomorrow about flag-of-convenience shipping from former employees of the MV Portland who got marched off their ship at one or two o'clock in the morning by some officials who were doing the bidding of the employer, who wants to use this bulldust about temporary shipping permits—permits that could go for a year. It is not temporary; it is getting rid of Australian seafarers and Australian jobs and replacing them with lower paid foreign workers. It is absolutely disgusting. If it happened to Australian farmers, I expect you would not be able to move in Canberra, because there would be tractors piled up on the road when they came to run over every Liberal politician on their way up here to the parliament. But with seafarers it does not matter!


This is an island nation. We have a proud history—I had better go back a step or two for the purpose of the senators on the Liberal-National side of the chamber. You might not know it, but we do not have bridges to Asia. We actually bring stuff in and take stuff out on ships. We have proudly had a strong shipping industry from day one. Yes, those opposite can sit there and giggle, because, goodness me, some poor big multinationals want to save $6 million to $8 million or something because they can do it cheaper with foreign workers. This is nothing short of a national disgrace. I do not know how those on that side can leave this place and walk back into their states with their chins held high, saying, 'You beauty—we have killed off more Australian jobs. Fantastic!'


When I was sitting here earlier I saw a motion from Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Day about some nonsense that we do not have enough productivity out of shipping.  I could say the same about this parliament—we could do it a lot cheaper here. Why don't we get a heap of Filipinos in? Why don't we bring foreign workers in? They can run the parliament. I know all those listening out there probably think that is a good idea. But I also raise this question: what is next? Should we get rid of all Australia's truck drivers? Should we get rid of all Australia's retail workers? Should we just flood Australia's hotels and restaurants with foreign worker? Yes, they would do it cheaper. While we are at it, why don't we get rid of all Australia's builders, sparkies, plumbers, roof tilers? Why don't we just get rid of the whole lot? Why should we just pick on shipping? You know I have my tongue stuck that far in my cheek it is nearly popping out. I do not actually find it funny, but I am getting sick to death of that lot over there proudly hanging their hat on Australian jobs going. 


The Australian people need to understand that there is no stopping point here. Those opposite will do whatever they have to do. I will go one step further and say: you will do anything on that side to appease your major donors. Prove me wrong. Come out and tell me that is not the case: 'No, we're not getting rid of Australian jobs, because we're not looking after big donors to the Liberal Party.' It is nothing short of a crime. It is criminal.


I throw this challenge out there. We wouldn't cop it if the farmers were being attacked, and nor should we: we should stick up for Australian jobs whether they be on farms or in trucks or on ships or whatever. This makes absolutely no sense to me. I tell you what: I cannot wait to hear tomorrow from those poor buggers who were dragged off their bunks in the middle of the night—it wasn't by the Gestapo, but something pretty similar—because the poor old aluminium mob, Alcoa, want to save a few bob. We could all save a few bob. 


I will be doing my best to expose the nonsense going on over on that side of the chamber while they all run off and want to talk about wonderful things—about how Australia can be great and fantastic and we can do all sorts of things and we can ship our commodities out of here and we can build things—as long as it is not Australians doing it. Not one of them would have the guts to come and challenge me to a public blue out there. They will hide behind every other thing: 'Oh, we've got to think about profits.' I can tell you now, as an ex-truck driver, as an ex-small business man, as a union organiser: the first thing I have always said is we need the employer to be viable—absolutely no argument. I know a lot of really good employers and I know a lot of good small family businesses who have put everything on the line, their hard work, and they deserve to get a return for their investment. There is no argument. But, as long as I am standing here and my feet are pointing to the ground, I will never ever say: 'At the expense of Australian jobs.' There is no way known that I could defend shipping Australian jobs offshore. It does not matter if it is in manufacturing or whatever it may be. And do you know what? If any member of this parliament thinks it is a great idea to see an Australian job go offshore, they should not even be in this building. They do not deserve to get the pay that we get paid to turn up here to defend Australian values and Australian jobs. In fact, they are charlatans, if that is the case. 


They may think it is very clever and very smart. But how would they feel if their kids' jobs went? Would it be a bit different if it were your kids? Would it be a bit different if it were your husband or your wife? I challenge you to that. If you can look me in the eye and say, 'I don't mind being unemployed because I've got to look after some foreign worker', well good; you have shot my argument to pieces. I reckon that not one of them on that side of the chamber, and not one of them on the other side in that green room over there, would like to see their job or their kids' jobs go. But what disgraceful parents they would be if they do want to see their kids' jobs go. Now it may not be popular, but I will always stand up for Australian jobs, as would all my colleagues on this side of the chamber. And do you know? If that condemns me, because I am not looking after some multinational who can make a few more bob in profit—well, then, condemn me. 


I cannot express it, Mr Deputy President. I know your history, as I know the history of all senators on this side of the chamber. We have been called some wonderful things over the years. We are only union stoolies and all that. I can tell you now: every senator on this side of the chamber has dirt under their fingernails. Every senator on this side of the chamber knows and understands when times are tough: where are your friends? Every senator on this side of the chamber has had the experience that I have had—grown men in your office on a Friday afternoon crying because they have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. 


It sickens me to my gut when the mob over there hide behind 'productivity'. It is not productivity; it is bulldust! You are looking after your donors. You an absolute disgrace—the whole lot of you. If every one of you thinks that it is a good idea, get out there and tell the truth in your electorates. Tell the people out there that what you stand for is doing away with Australian jobs. It is gutless. 


No wonder Australians do not involve themselves in the politics of this country. They should involve themselves. They should sit back and say: 'What does this actually mean for my kids and my kids' future?' If you do not have the intestinal fortitude to stand there and look after your kids' future, I tell you what: you deserve to get your arms ripped off in your electorates. None of you have the guts to get out there and put the truth of the argument up. It makes me feel so mad. 


On that I had better sit down and have a Bex or something, because I am really winding up. I hear from those poor buggers dragged off their bunks in the middle of the night so that their jobs can be replaced by foreign seafarers on vessels that are older than their vessels. Do not tell me, from a national security point of view, that we know who those foreign seamen are. (Time expired)

Do not tell me, from a national security point of view, that we know who those foreign seamen are. (Time expired)

AGED CARE AMENDMENT (RED TAPE REDUCTION IN PLACES MANAGEMENT) BILL 2015


The Aged Care Amendment (Red Tape Reduction in Places Management) Bill is a key component of the Government's deregulation agenda. It makes the business of delivering aged care easier for service providers and removes unnecessary administrative process so that the focus of care delivery can be at the forefront of service provider's attention. 


Australia has an ageing population with the life expectancy of older people increasing with advances in technology. With this demographic, comes the need for Governments to support older people with their increasing care needs and make the process of delivering aged care less administratively burdensome than it currently is. This Bill reduces red tape for aged care providers in regards to the management of provisionally allocated residential aged care places and the transfer of residential, home care and flexible care places. 


It shifts the focus of the business of aged care back to its roots in care delivery while still enabling the Government to uphold consumer protections around quality of care, as well as appropriate management of financial and prudential risk on behalf of the consumer. This Bill is a positive step forward to reducing red tape for aged care providers. 


The two measures in this Bill are part of the election commitment made by this Government to review the administration of aged care places management. They represent the achievement of item 11 of the Red Tape Reduction Action Plan. This plan was co-developed by the Government and the Aged Care Sector Committee, and it was approved by the former Prime Minister in 2014. In the plan, the Government committed to a review of aged care places management including the streamlining of the transfer of residential, home care and flexible care places and to revise the service provider obligations associated with managing provisionally allocated residential aged care places. 


The commitment to reduce red tape for the aged care sector in these two areas was initially achieved by streamlining the information required to be provided in managing aged care places with new forms released earlier this year. These revised forms reduced the duplication of information sought by the Department in regulating aged care while still meeting legislative requirements. This initial reduction in red tape was the first step in this deregulation agenda of aged care places management however more can be done to support the aged care sector. This red tape reduction achievement has been built upon and it is the foundation of this Bill.


This Bill contains two distinct measures; the transfer of aged care places measure and the amendments relating to provisionally allocated residential aged care places. Both measures are the necessary next step in aligning business realities with the legislative platform in the Aged Care Act, and contribute to a more efficient and effective administration of aged care places. 


The transfer of aged care places occurs where approved providers of residential aged care make a business decision, that they no longer have capacity to deliver care to older people who reside at their service and seek out another aged care business to continue this service delivery. At present, both transferee and transferor are required to submit an application form that is then considered by the Department of Health. In approximately 80% of cases, this application form is routinely approved by the Department. Historically, this requirement to submit a form has ensured that the new provider of the residential aged care commits to meeting their quality of care and other obligations. 


The Aged Care Act however has a number of different regulatory tools to ensure that quality of care is delivered to a high standard, including strict accreditation requirements, compliance mechanisms and oversight by the Aged Care Complaints Scheme. The approval of this form, to transfer aged care places, is an unnecessary and administratively burdensome component of the Act that this Bill seeks to rectify. 


In proposing a new model for the transfer of aged care places, three key concepts have been central to the new approach; firstly, only seeking additional information from the aged care sector that is necessary to provide an informed risk managed perspective of the proposed transfer, secondly, that where the transfer of aged care places is a business decision between two already approved providers of residential care, that there is limited involvement in that business transaction, and thirdly and most importantly, the government retains capacity to review and where necessary veto the transfer arrangement to ensure that a high standard and quality aged care service can be delivered and other consumer protections can be maintained. 


The new approach to the transfer of aged care places is to replace the application form with a simplified Notice of Transfer that is signed by the transferring parties. It removes the need for approved providers to seek approval to transfer their places to another provider. They simply notify the Department of the transfer and wait for the transfer to be processed. The Government retains the capacity to review the proposed transfer and where quality of care, prudential, financial or other significant concerns exist, has the right to issue a Notice of Veto to prevent the transfer from proceeding. If additional information is required in reviewing the proposed transfer, a Notice to Resolve can also be issued. 


The proposed legislative reforms are a part of a package of changes that will remove 20 out of a total of 93 provisions (in both primary and subordinate legislation) that relate to the material that must be provided to or considered by the Department of Health when approved providers wish to transfer places. A further 17 of the 93 are being merged and/or simplified, and 10 of those 17 provisions will only apply where places are transferring to a new approved provider. 


In developing this new approach, important aged care sector input and consultation has occurred with support provided by peak bodies and others consulted. The new approach to the transfer of aged care places was provided to the Aged Care Sector Committee in May this year with a selection of other providers also asked for input and feedback on the model. The response to this measure from the aged care sector was positive and reflective of the business transaction that this component of the Act regulates. This new approach aligns to the fundamental concepts of red tape reduction and meets the objectives of the Red Tape Reduction Action Plan; by ensuring regulation within the aged care sector is fit for purpose. 


The second measure within the Bill aligns the period of provisionally allocated residential aged care places with the current business realities of approved providers of residential aged care. In reviewing current practice and assessing the case for a change in the policy setting towards a reduced administrative arrangement, advice from the aged care sector was that the current legislative arrangements did not adequately support providers of aged care.


A provisionally allocated place is a place that an approved provider has not and is not delivering care through. It is a place that an approved provider has been advised will be subsidised by the Australian Government but is not currently operational and has not ""taken effect"".


Following successful receipt of a provisionally allocated place through the Aged Care Approvals Round, approved providers of residential aged care must then seek planning approval through local governments to construct their new aged care service. Advice from the sector is that sometimes this process alone can take up to two years. The current provisionally allocated period of two years sometimes only permits planning approval to be received before applications for extension commence. 


Departmental data indicates that the median time it takes approved providers to operationalise their places is approximately four years, and that 80% are operational within six years. It is reasonable to amend this provision to reflect how this component of the Act is used by providers of aged care. Under the current approach, a rolling cycle of extensions and quarterly reports is required to be undertaken. This is time consuming and includes unnecessary reporting of information that rarely changes. 


The new approach to managing provisionally allocated residential aged care places extends the initial period from two years to four years and permits two twelve month extensions before care is required to become operational. After six years, an extension to the provisionally allocated residential aged care place will only be made in exceptional circumstances. If care does not start being delivered, the aged care place will lapse and be re-allocated through the Aged Care Approvals Round to another provider that has capacity to deliver the care. 


This model aligns the legislative platform for regulation with the current business realities of approved providers of residential aged care. It also reduces the red tape for the sector by preventing the unnecessary reporting burden on approved providers of residential aged care by 75%. 


This new approach is an important change in the way that we consider aged care as it shifts the focus back to care delivery. This Bill indicates the Government's intention that provisionally allocated residential aged care places cannot be held by service providers indefinitely, but rather it provides more definitive timeframes for providers to start delivering care for older people who require it and where this cannot be achieved, allows those places to lapse and be returned for reallocation to a service provider that does have capacity to deliver additional care. 


The Aged Care Amendment (Red Tape Reduction in Places Management) Bill demonstrates that the Government is taking the pressure off the aged care sector by aligning the legislative platform with current practice, pursuing the reduction in red tape agenda to reduce unnecessary reporting and shifting the focus back to the business of delivering care for older people. This Bill also implements models that protect the high standard and quality of care provided while enabling business transactions between approved providers of aged care.

I listened with great interest to the debate earlier this afternoon and I must start by congratulating Senator Ludwig on his verbal gymnastics and his ability to muddle and confuse a very straightforward and clear bill. I would like to commend Senator Xenophon for his rebuttal of Senator Ludwig's points and the very measured approach he has taken to addressing some technical issues with the minister.


If Senator Ludwig thinks this is such a conspiracy, he should talk to no-one further away than his own Senator Gallagher, who was actually the Chief Minister here in the ACT and who was the one who initiated the request for the ACT to exit this scheme. Far from being the big conspiracy that Senator Ludwig has intimated, this is actually a very simple provision. It is simple because what this bill seeks to do—nothing more and nothing less—is to close a loophole. The practical impact of not closing that loophole would be that the ACT could exit the scheme and leave—

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (19:20):  I am really pleased to rise this evening to speak about a couple of events here in the ACT. We all know that 26 January is Australia Day but it is also Republic Day in India. Whilst it is important that we reflect on that day as Australia Day it is also important that we reflect on this significant day for our Indian residents, many of whom reside here in Canberra.


Though India became a free nation on 15 August 1947, it declared itself a sovereign, democratic and republic state with the adoption of its constitution on 26 January 1950. Its constitution gave the citizens of India the power to choose their own government and paved the way for democracy. We have much in common with our Indian friends. India shares our democratic political system and commitment to freedom. Whilst it is a republic, we also share some of the same British roots. We share interests, values and a great love of cricket. We have significant trade. We enjoy large flows of tourists and students. Australia is increasingly and importantly a net energy provider for the almost 1.3 billion citizens of India.


Importantly, many Indians are part of our national story, having taken up Australian citizenship. Their contribution is evident in the impact the Indian community have made here in the ACT. I want to thank the India-Australia Association of Canberra for inviting me to join them in celebrating their national day. I would like to thank particularly the organisers and members of the executive committee, including Nishi Puri, Hasib Khan, Sandipan Mitra, Kranti Amar, Gurjant Singh, Lakshmi Singh, Nitu Mitra, Prabha Gupta, Sanjeev Sood and Shashi Amar. The president of FINACT, Amardeep Singh, was also in attendance. FINACT does such a great job representing all of the Indian Australian associations here in the ACT. I want to commend them on their continuing involvement in our community and to pass on my best wishes, as I did on the day they celebrated their 67th Republic Day. I would like to also comment on the fact that a former president of FINACT here in the ACT, Jacob Vadakkedathu, was an outstanding candidate for the ACT Liberal Party in the 2012 election. He continues to make a great contribution to our community.


One final thing on this is that, as I said in my speech on the day, while there are many things that unite us as nations, one of the things that I am most impressed about with our Indian community here in Canberra is their wonderful commitment to family, to community and to their culture. That commitment and that contribution to Canberra and to Australia is something certainly worth celebrating and commending.


I also want to note tonight an announcement made by the Commonwealth in recent days. Certainly for the coalition, small business is in our DNA. We are great friends of small business, and in this parliament we have delivered the biggest small business package in the nation's history. Continuing this commitment to our nation's small businesses, I am proud to bring to the Senate's attention that we have recently announced the inaugural Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. I am particularly proud because the position has been taken up by a Canberran, Kate Carnell.


Kate Carnell will continue her advocacy for small business, an endeavour she has fulfilled as the CEO of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry since 2014. She has extensive experience in small business, having run one for some 15 years prior to serving in the ACT assembly, most notably as Chief Minister. As the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman she will facilitate the interests of our small businesses both through dispute resolution and through contributing to legislation and regulation pertaining to our small business community. Kate is an excellent advocate for our small business community and I know she will fulfil her mandate in a professional and effective manner, as she has done throughout her extensive career in both the public and private sectors. She has been a significant contributor to our community here in Canberra; she has been a significant contributor in advocating for business, particularly small business. I once again commend Kate Carnell on her appointment and the government on an excellent appointment.
