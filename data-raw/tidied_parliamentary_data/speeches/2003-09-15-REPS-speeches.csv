"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Expanding Australia's trade and investment relationship with the countries of central Europe, together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The report is the product of an inquiry conducted by the Trade Subcommittee through 2002 and 2003. The terms of reference for the inquiry were referred to the committee on 12 August 2002. The inquiry represents the first effort by the parliament to critically analyse trade and investment opportunities for Australia in the countries of central Europe. Not much more than a decade ago, these nations were part of the Eastern bloc of nations, with seemingly immutable economic and political ties to the USSR. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent demise of the Eastern bloc dramatically and irreversibly changed the trajectory of the countries of central Europe. Where once there were authoritarian political structures and centrally planned economies, there are now flourishing democracies and prosperous market economies. Where once there was a grey uniformity of life and industry was tied to a paternal master, there is now plurality and vibrancy and a striving to join the European Union. Central Europe has clearly changed forever.
Cognisant of the dramatic changes taking place and the opportunities such changes inevitably yield, the committee felt it was an opportune time to re-evaluate Australia's trade and investment relations with these nations. In undertaking the inquiry, it was hoped that information about specific and general opportunities for trade and investment would emerge. This belief was borne out. This report attempts to document these opportunities and make recommendations on how the Australian government can assist Australian investors and industry to capitalise on those opportunities.
The key finding of the inquiry is that there is an information failure between Australia and central Europe. Australia's economic strengths place it well to assist central Europe with its transition to a modern liberal democracy. Our strengths match central Europe's needs, and its transition trajectory promises major opportunities. The synergies and the potential are there, yet substantial trade and investment between Australia and the region has failed to emerge. The main ingredient missing from this potentially fruitful economic equation is knowledge of each other's markets and each other's needs. The committee believes that, if this information failure were remedied, existing opportunities would drive much greater trade and investment, to the advantage of both Australia and central Europe. This conclusion is the foundation of the report.
Accordingly, the report recommends a range of measures to increase mutual awareness and mutual understanding of trade and investment opportunities. The suggested measures can be grouped into three categories. The first involves several awareness-raising activities, including: sending a senior trade mission to the region, led by the Minister for Trade; sending a senior e-commerce and e-government focused trade mission to the region, led by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts; increasing support for Australian and central European firms' use of European trade fairs; including central European participants in the Australian Tourist Commission's Australian Tourist Exchange program; encouraging two-way student flows by increasing scholarship numbers and by encouraging research links; and encouraging industry specific trade missions to central Europe in areas of high potential. 
The second category recommends a range of government measures to address the existing impediments to increased trade and investment. These include: supporting Australian firms seeking EBRD funding by providing tied aid to the EBRD; encouraging links between Australian and central European research institutions to help them access the European Commission's Sixth Framework science research funding scheme; reconfiguring certain diplomatic arrangements in central Europe to better support Australian trade and investment activity; improving Australian trade representation at the World Bank and the European Commission; and reassessing visa requirements for students from central Europe who wish to study in Australia.
Finally, the report also recommends that Austrade develop a new export strategy for the region that considers the areas of Australia's strongest comparative advantage—namely, services, agribusiness and manufacturing. Within the services sector, the committee viewed the following areas as having particular potential: e-commerce and related services; e-govern-ment technology and services; government services; tourism training; land titling; agricultural services; and environment related services. In agribusiness, the committee viewed wool, leather and related products, and wine products as areas of high potential. In manufacturing, the committee saw automotive equip-ment, smart card technology, building materials and environmental equipment as promising.
The committee's abiding impression from the inquiry is of the dynamism and resultant opportunities in the countries of central Europe. The committee hopes that this report will focus the minds of the relevant Australian policy makers on the key issues in trade and investment relations with central Europe and provide some insights into how to enhance them.
I would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the support of Austrade during the inquiry and visit. In particular I would like to thank Alex Brooking from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for his outstanding assistance, and John Price and Peter Kane from Austrade. All three did an outstanding job. The officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade both within Australia and overseas were outstanding. The hospitality provided by ambassadors and trade commissioners was excellent. Also the arrangements made in terms of coordinating the business appointments with various chambers of commerce and industry groups were particularly outstanding. We were very well served by DFAT in terms of this visit.
I would also like to acknowledge the Trade Subcommittee secretariat, Adam Cunningham and Pierre Huetter, in the conduct of the inquiry and their preparation of the report, which was not easy, especially as neither of them actually accompanied us on the visit. But we worked through that, and I was particularly grateful for the final result in terms of the report that was achieved.
Finally I think it is appropriate that I should commend my colleagues in terms of this report. Those include Senator Alan Ferguson who led the committee—when we broke into two groups—in Romania and Bulgaria. He was accompanied by Mr Hawker on that visit, and, as with the rest of the visit, Mr Jull, Mr Prosser and Mr Thompson also accompanied us on those visits. They were particularly conscientious in their approaches to the visit, approaching it in a very workmanlike way. Senator Eggleston was involved in the program as well and contributed significantly. 
We are very pleased with the outcome of the report. We approached the report initially on the basis that it would not represent particularly new opportunities but we would look at it nevertheless. What we found were new market economies that had turned their backs on the old Eastern bloc and were looking to the West in terms of opportunities, particularly in relation to e-business, land titling, hospital services and tourism services. We believe that this area of the world represents significant opportunities for Australia. In many ways, their economies are like Australia's in the fifties and sixties and therefore they are best able to take advantage of the opportunities represented by Australia's experience, particularly as it relates to e-commerce. That is why we made the recommendation in relation to trade missions led by the Minister for Trade and also a particular e-government mission, to be led by the minister for communications. We also looked at some of the establishment that we have and the need for an embassy to be established in Prague. This was part of our overall recommendations. I commend the report to the House.

"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I am pleased to present in the parliament today the report of the Australian parliamentary observers delegation to the 2003 Cambodian National Assembly elections, which were held in July. I had the honour of leading this delegation to Cambodia, from 24 to 29 July 2003, at the invitation of the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer, whose personal initiative ensured that Australia would be part of the broader international community's election observation team.  
On 27 July 2003, the people of Cambodia went to the polls for the third time since the Paris peace accords. In so doing, they demonstrated a remarkable enthusiasm for their right to vote and for the opportunity to take part in the political process of their country. Against the background of the 1993 and 1998 elections—and 10 years after the UN-supervised elections of May 1993—Cambodia's march towards political pluralism and a freer democratic culture continued in July 2003 with an infectious enthusiasm by its people that deserves the international community's full admiration. The Australian delegation—which consisted of Senator Mark Bishop, Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja and my coalition colleague in the House the member for Cowper—join the consensus of the international community and the domestic election observers that the 2003 election environment represented a marked improvement, in all respects, over Cambodia's two earlier elections. 
The political atmosphere in the days preceding the poll appeared conducive to ensuring that Cambodians felt confident in airing divergent political views. Campaigns were boisterous, spirited and appeared to proceed unhindered through Phnom Penh on the final day of campaigning. Standing in the middle of a major Phnom Penh city road with convoys of trucks—overloaded with cheering party supporters—driving by was, for me, a truly remarkable experience. The improvement in the election environment appeared to reflect the growing sophistication of the electorate, in both its awareness of electoral processes and a growing confidence in the freedom to support the party of choice. Urban voters were significantly more advanced in this regard than rural voters. It must be said, however, that this confidence was tempered in some cases by a general lack of faith in evolving electoral and government institutions. Indeed, some Cambodian voters expressed concern about a return to political instability in the wake of the election. Underlying this concern was Cambodia's recent history of election violence and the widespread climate of impunity which has sprung from the lack of an effective legal and judicial system.
While Senator Mark Bishop and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja observed the various polling stations in the Phnom Penh municipality and rural and semi-rural areas across Kandal Province, my colleague the member for Cowper and I observed the voting around Kampong Cham Province, which is notable for its rubber plantation work force and for being a trigger for several incidents of serious violence and intimidation against opposition and FUNCINPEC party candidates and activists in the past. We noted that election day processes were generally smooth and were managed well by polling station and election committee officials. The electorate appeared aware of voting procedures, and all those we questioned believed in the secrecy of the ballot. When asked, voters universally responded that the election was a marked improvement on the previous two polls in 1993 and 1998.
We observed small but noticeable numbers of Cambodians being turned away from polling stations by officials on the basis that their names did not appear on the electoral roll. It was unclear from subsequent discussions with voters whether this resulted from a failure on the part of the persons to follow correct registration procedures or whether deficiencies in the list existed. There was, at certain points, a degree of confusion regarding the correct registration requirements, although people were usually aware of their right to lodge formal complaints.
Cambodia's 2003 National Assembly election represents an important step in Cambodia's transition towards a form of representative democracy. With this greater political openness, there can be only better prospects for economic growth as the international business community looks for new markets and new consumers. 
In conclusion, I take this opportunity to acknowledge my parliamentary colleagues on the delegation and to thank them for their support. I also thank especially the professional and enthusiastic staff of our embassy in Phnom Penh. Their cooperation and skills ensured that our visit went smoothly and successfully. I also express our gratitude to the royal government of Cambodia for extending the invitation to observe the election process. Having met the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen, in Bangkok, Thailand last year, I take this opportunity to wish him the very best as he leads his government and the people of Cambodia to greater prosperity and greater freedom in the interests of all the people of Cambodia.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Cambodian National Assembly Elections 2003</title>,Delegation Reports,1,1,speech
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NP,2003-09-15,"—I rise to speak on the observation report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Cambodian National Assembly elections. As a nation, I think Australia can be proud of the role that it has played in supporting democracy in Cambodia. By way of outcome, we can see that the trend for democracy is certainly improving. The electoral process is, I believe, becoming a very fair process. It has improved through a range of measures in which Australia has played a part. Australia has had a significant role to play in supporting the democratic process—a process which we in this country take for granted but which is a relatively new commodity for the Cambodians. Australia has been there, assisting in areas such as voter education, voter registration procedures and media.
In this country we are very much used to the process of the media inquiring in great detail about the policies and plans of the various political parties. But in Cambodia, certainly in the past, there has been a much more regulated approach to reporting in the media; previously there has not been the question and answer type of interview arrangements, which we are very used to seeing in Australia. The Australian government has played a part in sponsoring a program on Cambodian television which enabled the Cambodian people to see, for the first time, their future political representatives answering questions put forward by interviewers. I think that the question and answer style of interviewing, which we are used to in this country, has been a great step forward.
I would also like to commend our embassy staff, who did a great job in facilitating the visit by the observation team. Our embassy does a great job in representing the interests of Australia in Cambodia. I was very impressed with the great work that AusAID are doing in Cambodia. We can, through various niche projects, provide very much needed aid that targets specific areas of need. For instance, our delegation was able to visit the Friends project, a very important project in Phnom Pen, run by a Frenchman called Sebastian Marot. It has a mandate to look after young children and to give them education and work skills to enable them to provide for themselves. Unfortunately, because of adverse impacts such as AIDS, a great number of young children are required to fend for themselves. The Friends organisation does a great job in providing them with the training and education that will, hopefully, enable them to become self-sufficient in the future. That is just one particular project in which AusAID has been involved. The projects that we saw were very well targeted, getting right down to providing services on the ground—and that is important.
I also would like to comment on the degree of enthusiasm—the member for Ryan commented on this earlier—with which as a general rule the Cambodian people embraced the right to vote and being able to participate in the future of their country. As to our methods as an observation team, we called in at quite a number of polling stations and inspected the procedures, both before and during polling; we also observed the closing of the polls. But in addition to that we wanted to look at what the average Cambodian person in the street thought of the process. We went doorknocking, which is quite a novel approach for politicians overseas. We doorknocked a range of businesses and private houses in the Kampong Cham province and we were pleased to note that, when we called at random at a particular house or business, the spirit of that house or business was very positive regarding the process. People were keen to participate. They did not feel intimidated and they felt that their vote counted.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	supports the development of bilateral free trade agreements with both China and Japan;
(2)	acknowledges the close partnership that Australia has developed with both Japan and China;
(3)	notes the importance of trade with Japan, Australia's principal trading partner;
(4)	notes the importance of rapidly growing trade with China which has a real annual growth rate of 7 per cent;
(5)	acknowledges the massive economic and social benefits of a genuine free trade agreement with both China and Japan to all parties;
(6)	realises that the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the proposed China-ASEAN FTA and Japan's proposal for a comprehensive regional economic partnership reflect the fact that China and Japan recognise that free and open trade is the best guarantee of economic prosperity and growth;
(7)	commits to an international free trade agenda understanding that bilateral free trade agree-ments can complement and encourage wider free trade objectives in APEC and the WTO;
(8)	forcefully supports an international free trade agenda as a driver for global economic pros-perity, improved living standards and greater opportunities for the developing world; and
(9)	commends the efforts of Japan and China to enhance global free trade, in particular, China's efforts to reduce average tariff rates from 40 per cent a decade ago to 11.5 per cent today.
The concept of free trade with Japan and with China is about two very simple things. Firstly, it is about jobs—jobs for companies such as Braemar Manufacturing in Koo Wee Rup; Sealite navigation beacons in Somerville; BHP Steel in Hastings, the largest employer in the electorate of Flinders; and Enviro-Mulch in Rosebud—and, secondly, it is about better living standards for families in Cowes, Lang Lang, Dromana, Rye and Mount Martha.
In addressing this motion, I wish to proceed in three stages. Firstly, I want to answer these questions: what are the benefits of free trade; what are the reasons we pursue free trade; and why is it in Australia's interests? Secondly, I want to look at how exactly Australia is pursuing those interests and making Australia a more open society and part of a more open international trading economy. Thirdly, I want to address the specific question of the benefits that would flow to Australia—and to China and Japan—from free trade agreements with each of those two countries.
Let us turn first to the question of the benefits of free trade. The theory is very simple. The theory is about comparative advantage and that is about two things: firstly, that nations and regions are able to specialise in those things in which they are most capable; and, secondly, that we expand our market from being a nation with a trading range of 19 million to 20 million people to being a nation with a trading range of hundreds of millions of people. That is commonsense. In that context, the notion of paying out subsidies to our own businesses is counterproductive. It takes away the standards which ordinary Australians aspire to by taking money out of their pockets to subsidise businesses which are ultimately unproductive. In my maiden speech I made the point that I was for moving towards zero tariffs in Australia; nineteen months later I reaffirm that commitment. 
But why does it matter? It is very simple. One in five Australian jobs relies on exports. A 10 per cent increase in exports would lead to an increase of 70,000 new jobs for Australians—real jobs, which would have an impact on people. And not just any jobs. The average job in a firm which is involved in export pays approximately $17,500 per annum more than the average non export related job in Australia—and that matters. In addition, trade gives ordinary families access to a wider range of products at lower prices. Those are real benefits for real families—and they matter.
In rural and regional Australia—in areas such as Lang Lang, Kooweerup, Cowes and San Remo in the electorate of Flinders—one in four jobs comes from exporting. If we can expand our opportunities for export and the range of possible destinations then we will provide all Australians with an opportunity for an improved living standard. A very simple example is that in 2002 Australian goods and services that were exported were valued at $151 billion—and $151 billion is an extraordinary part of the gross domestic product of Australia. It represents income which would not otherwise be available to Australian families, Australian workers and Australian producers—income as a real result of our trade.
In my own electorate of Flinders, I note that Australia has rapidly become the fourth largest exporter of wine after France, Italy and Spain, and that those exports topped $2 billion in 2002. Again, this leads to jobs and to rising living standards and has an impact on people's lives. In that context, Australia is pursuing a three-tiered approach to trade: at the multilateral level through the World Trade Organisation—and we see from Cancun that this is a difficult and slow road; at the regional level through APEC and through closer economic partnership with ASEAN; and bilaterally through free trade negotiations with Singapore, Thailand and the United States. It is estimated that annually the value of a free trade agreement with the United States is $4 billion to Australia, or over $200 to every Australian man, woman and child—and that matters; that makes a real difference to people's lives.
I raise the question of trade with Japan and China, as they are two enormous markets with extraordinary potential for Australia. They will have a significant impact on the way we will be able to produce, create jobs and provide opportunities. Australia is already giving high priority to negotiations with Japan. In 2002 the Prime Minister, in discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Koizumi, established the basis for a trade and economic framework agreement with Japan. Japan is the destination for over $25 billion worth of our goods and service exports and it is our single biggest export market. Opportunities exist for our exporters—whether it be our rice producers or our steelmakers such as BHP Steel in Hastings, which employs over 1,400 workers—to export their products to Japan. These exports are, at the moment, less than they should otherwise be. Increasing exports is a good thing; it creates jobs and provides opportunities. 
Whilst the framework agreement is not in itself a free trade agreement, it does lay the foundation, the way forward. This, in turn, gives a direct and immediate benefit to Australia and a new standard for the process of multilateral trade negotiation. Multilateral trade negotiation is a very difficult process. The risk that we frequently face is that we will follow the path of the lowest common denominator, because there are multiple countries with multiple interests and to find agreement can be very difficult. Japan has recently established a free trade agreement with Singapore and is in the process of establishing agreements with other countries within the ASEAN region. China is also doing the same thing. China has, not surprisingly, recently concluded a free trade agreement with Hong Kong and, importantly, is negotiating a free trade agreement with ASEAN. If we do not participate in this bilateral approach to free trade agreements, companies such as Braemar in Koo Wee Rup or Sealite in Somerville risk being excluded. In participating in this bilateral approach to free trade agreements, there is a positive benefit for Australia, there is a positive benefit for international markets in creating an international environment for freer trade, and there is also a defensive role—that is, to ensure that we are part of a process which is occurring in any event.
We cannot hide from the process of globalisation and we cannot hide from the fact that there is an increasingly open international trading environment. The effect of this is good, but not just for Australia. Oxfam recently prepared a paper which showed that the single greatest impact on the quality of life and living standards in the developing world is not aid—although that plays an important role—but the promulgation of genuinely open markets. Europe and the United States have, to a certain extent, played a role in closing off those markets. If we can open up that environment and those markets, we will be doing something to help deal with issues of underprivilege, underdevelopment and poverty within that part of the world which cannot yet claim to be fully developed. That is a very important humanitarian step as well as sound economics.
The Prime Minister, in his recent meeting with the former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji in May 2002, developed the basis for a free trade agreement by moving towards a framework agreement, and this was played through in his most recent meeting with Hu Jintao, the Chinese leader. They have set themselves on a long-term path for an agreement between the two countries. I welcome our progress with Japan and China. I make this point: these free trade agreements will bring benefits and jobs for Australian families and improve the living standards of families throughout Flinders. (Time expired)
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Trade: Free Trade Agreements with China and Japan</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I have some major concerns about the extent and rate of these free trade arrangements. We have important relationships with Japan and China; we also have relationships with many other countries in South-East Asia. However, I cannot condone using free trade as an argument for going into developing countries and opening up trade when the only people who benefit are the financial institutions of developed countries. I think we really have to come to some break and start working out how to measure the success of the so-called global economy and the accompanying free trade to find out who is actually benefiting. The front page of the Australian today shows there is conflict. The headline says: `Trade talks teeter on rich-poor divide'. Roy Eccleston points out in his article that much of the discontent about the extent of agricultural trade reform is based on the dispute between rich and poor countries. Poor countries are claiming that it would give them little new access to the rich world's agricultural markets, while demanding they open up their markets to subsidised competition. 
When the World Bank and the IMF were born in 1944 and established in December 1945, it was to provide resources to rebuild after the Second World War—to fund postwar reconstruction and development projects and to lend hard currency to nations with temporary balance of payments difficulties. In the 1980s things changed: Third World nations sought help from those two bodies after the price of oil skyrocketed and there were huge interest rate rises. But instead of dollars they received structural assistance plans, with 114 conditions in return for loans. While the details varied from nation to nation, in every case the rollover of debts was conditional on countries removing trade barriers, selling national assets to foreign investors, slashing social spending and making labour flexible—for example, by bringing down wage rates to almost starvation level. I thank author and journalist Greg Palast for simplifying that useful base argument.
When we talk of free trade, we talk of the interests of bodies such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation, groups of unelected people who decide which countries get aid, who make the trading conditions in those developing countries that are desperate for assistance and who wish to ensure the flow of capital around the world through these free market mechanisms. Where is the level playing field that we all talk about when referring to free trade? From my reading, there seems to be only one playing field and it is tipped to ensure all funds run one way—into the coffers of Western financial institutions.
Japan and China, who are big and quite powerful in different ways, want a piece of that action. What are we actually seeking from them in the way of an agreement? This motion does not specify. It uses motherhood terms, without any measurement whatsoever. Where, for example, are the `massive economic and social benefits ... to all parties' of genuine free trade with both China and Japan? Where is the evidence of this? The honourable member for Flinders quoted many figures—$4 billion et cetera—that we hear in this debate but no measurable situations. Who has set this `international free trade agenda understanding that bilateral free trade agreements can complement and encourage wider free trade objectives in APEC and the WTO'? There is nothing in this motion that backs up that statement. If I had more time, I could give heaps of examples of where free trade does anything but push for global economic prosperity, improve living standards and provide greater opportunities for the developing world. It almost works, or has worked, in reverse in some countries.
It is vital for Australia to build relationships with countries in our region, including China and Japan. Labor went to China last year and proposed a closer economic relationships agreement. Simon Crean did that long before the Prime Minister went there. This government has certainly taken its eyes off the ball. When you look at what is occurring in Mexico, you see it missed the opportunity. Its obsession with negotiating a bilateral trade deal with the United States has diverted its focus away from realising that there were a lot of other things going on. It should have been focused on India and the poor countries. It has lost its opportunity to be a part of that developing world group.

"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I am delighted to second this very important and timely motion put to the House by my friend and colleague the member for Flinders. I thank him for giving me the opportunity to speak on a topic of tremendous importance to this country's future economic prosperity—namely, free trade, particularly in the context of the broader Australia-China bilateral relationship. It is important because, as my colleague and friend the member for Flinders said, free trade—and freer trade—is all about jobs. It is all about Australian jobs and an increased standard of living for Australians, because trade is good for this country. Since the election of the Howard government in 1996 the Australian government has pursued an ambitious and wide-ranging trade agenda.
—The member for Braddon!
—Indeed, the very dedicated and committed trade minister, the Hon. Mark Vaile, recently described it as `the most ambitious ... in Australia's history'. The record of achievement already speaks for itself. Australia has the runs on the board. Australia has already entered into negotiations for free trade agreements with the US and Thailand and has already signed an agreement with Singapore.
One of the key objectives has been to achieve a more targeted approach to bilateral trade relations, a strategy which is delivering very positive results with some of Australia's most significant trading partners. Australia's efforts in these countries have been characterised by very direct involvement from the Prime Minister. In the case of China, when they met in May 2002 the Prime Minister and former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji agreed to begin working towards a trade and economic framework agreement. It is remarkable to think that two-way trade between Australian and China has doubled between 1998 and 2002, and the potential to expand even these figures is certainly there for an entrepreneurial and innovative country like Australia.
For our part, Australia enjoys a very health bilateral relationship with China. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Howard was in Beijing to meet China's new leader, President Hu Jintao, who will be making a visit to Australia in October. The Chinese President has travelled sparingly since assuming his office, and therefore his forthcoming visit speaks volumes of his attitude towards the Australia-China relationship. Indeed, President Hu's visit will provide an important opportunity to advance even stronger bilateral trade relations between Australia and China and highlight that this country continues to punch very strongly above its weight in the corridors of power abroad.
Australia makes no secret that it would like to see a joint study for a free trade agreement as one element of the new bilateral agreement. There is no question that a free trade agreement would deliver enormous dividends to both Australia and China. I find it remarkable that those opposite and the speaker preceding me, the member for Lyons, would dare to think differently. I say: ask the Chinese, the Japanese and those in Asia whether they would like a free trade agreement.
—The member for Braddon!
—I can say that they would all be in favour of a free trade agreement. It will also provide jobs for them and increase their living standards. It is no wonder that those opposite will continue to sit opposite, because they just simply do not get it. They do not get that free trade is all about jobs. My goodness, isn't that what Australians want? They want jobs. 
China is already the second biggest economy in the world, and its bullocking growth means that it will have a major influence on our trading environment in the decades to come. China's economy continues to grow rapidly—its growth rate is now at seven per cent. China has undergone a massive opening of its market in recent times, culminating in its accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001. Not only is this good for China, but it is also good for the region. It is good for Australia and it is good for the broader international community. An included and engaged China, playing its rightful part in the economic architecture of the world, is critical for international stability and international security.
In conclusion, one of the single greatest achievements by any Australian government in the 100-plus years of Federation is without doubt the Howard government's success in securing the $25 billion contract for Australia to supply LNG to Guangdong Province. I say to those opposite: support the government on free trade related issues. If they care to ask the Chinese President when he comes here whether he wants free trade for his country, they might be very surprised at his answer—a big yes, yes, yes. 
Let us get into free trade, let us give jobs to Australians, and let us give jobs to those in China as well. This is good for the Australia-China relationship. It is good for the region. It will enhance the prospect for greater opportunities between our two countries.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—Of all Australian political parties, Labor has had a unique relationship with China for over 30 years. In July 1971, the then opposition leader, Gough Whitlam, made a historic visit to China, advancing the argument that Australia should establish diplomatic relations with China. Instead of being applauded by the then Liberal-Country Party government, Whitlam was heavily criticised by them for making friends with Communist China. This criticism was, of course, quelled very shortly after, when President Nixon made the same journey in February 1972. But the McMahon government still made no moves to establish diplomatic ties. It took 16 days after the election of the Whitlam government in 1972 for Australia to formally establish diplomatic ties with China.
Given the limited time I have on this matter this afternoon, I will devote my attention to our developing relationship with China and the importance of multilateral agreements, as well as bilateral agreements. In April last year the Labor leader, speaking in Beijing, laid down five principles that we believe could be used to assist our relationship with China: to form the foundation of a possible future Australia-China treaty; to enhance economic complementarities to assist development priorities and to assist Australian exports in areas such as info-technology, tourism and financial services; to develop the bilateral relationship as a building block to a new regional partnership, consistent with the objectives of APEC and the World Trade Organisation; to be established through a leadership dialogue; and to provide a vehicle for closer government-to-government and business-to-business relations. More than ever before China is the key to two of the biggest issues confronting the Asia-Pacific region: the future of regional economic integration and the future of strategic stability.
I had the great privilege recently of being part of a delegation of senators and members—all members of the Australia-China Friendship Group—to visit China earlier this year. Building upon the diplomatic ties and the growing development in trade of 30 or more years, our visit added another strand to these ties that bind. In the areas of trade, Australia is now among the top 10 sources of imports into China, and we are the 13th largest country in exports from China. Although most of our trade exports to China come from agricultural and mining industries, there is a growing interest in other areas, which I referred to earlier. As the Labor leader has already indicated, there are three general areas where our relations with China should be enhanced through the signing of an Australia-China treaty—in bilateral, regional and multilateral forms of closer cooperation. These areas are not mutually exclusive but complementary. It is a pity, however, that the government and its members who have moved the motion before us this afternoon have focused only upon bilateral agreements and have shown little interest in realising the valuable multilateral trade access through the World Trade Organisation Doha Round. 
—The member for Flinders is now attempting to interrupt. Obviously he wants to advance his arguments. Effectively, he said the multilateral agreements are too difficult and too complex—for this government anyway—to establish. The fact remains that we need multilateral arrangements and regional cooperation to ensure that we have successful trade relations and other forms of relationships with countries in our region. A case in point is the collapse of the World Trade Organisation trade talks in Cancun. This is very bad news for our farmers and underlines the influence of Australia as leader of the Cairns Group of trading nations. 
It would appear Australia was caught napping when developing nations—angered by what they saw as the hypocrisy of the developed nations that insist upon open market access but refuse to dismantle costly and trade distorting domestic producer support—established a G21 group. Bilateral agreements are important, but right now Australia needs a government that will focus on building a coalition of developing countries and efficient food producers. Senator O'Brien, currently in Mexico for the trade talks, is right when he says that the opportunity was missed by the Howard government. This motion is right: bilateral agreements are important; but, in the end, multilateral arrangements and regional cooperation are so much more important.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Trade: Free Trade Agreements with China and Japan</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,2003-09-15,"—I am pleased to support the motion put forward by the members for Flinders and Ryan. I congratulate them on bringing this to the parliament's attention. There is little doubt that, when we regard the economies of both China and Japan, they are the two biggest economies in East Asia—China is the third largest, and fastest growing, export destination for Australia; Japan is our largest export market. Japan's GNP is at $US4.5 trillion, and China's is the sixth largest at $US1.1 trillion. These two economies cannot be ignored.
In response to the member for Lyons, my primary producers are very much interested in what the government is doing on the multilateral front and particularly with regard to these two bilateral negotiations. I will talk a little bit more on the multilateral issue shortly. I was disappointed the member for Lyons focused so much on the negatives. He talked a lot about free trade; let us talk more consistently about fair trade. That is what my farmers are asking for—market access. They are ever more efficient in what they do—the most efficient primary producers in the world, in fact—but are doing it tough with no subsidies at all. They are demanding fair trade, so let us focus on that in their interests and put the interests of other nations behind our own. From my perspective it is about accessing those markets that, before this, have been restricted to us because of distortions in the world markets. We want those constraints removed. 
What is wrong in determining our destiny in the best interests of ourselves? What is wrong with that, particularly with regard to primary producers who have a record, in the history of the nation, of carrying the nation? So I am a little disappointed by the contribution from the member for Lyons. I know he is a good bloke, but he should be more focused on the benefits for his constituency—which has some of the elements of primary production in which I have primary interest. His veiled criticism of the outcome at Cancun was not missed by me. Anybody who thinks that the outcome in Mexico was somehow a surprise does not know much about the difficulties of negotiating such large multilateral arrangements. What I heard from the last speaker, the member for Burke, reflects the mistakes that were made in the past—too much of a focus on the multilaterals.
I came to this parliament in 1993 because of the inappropriate decisions that had been made in pursuit of those large, multilateral arrangements—wholesale reductions in Australia's tariffs for imports that saw primary industries thrown to the wolves, particularly the citrus industry. Their tariff was reduced overnight from 30 per cent to five per cent. They were forced to go cold turkey in adjustments, with no help from this parliament and the government of the day. That is not an approach that is in the best interests of the wealth creators of the nation, so let us be done with the suggestion that we have to be entirely dependent on negotiating multilaterals. This government has focused very determinedly on both approaches, and the outcome of Mexico highlights the importance, particularly for these two countries—China and Japan—of negotiating bilateral agreements. We have a fallback; it is like not putting all our eggs in one multinational basket. My constituency, particularly those large primary producers of commodities like wheat and citrus, were brought to the fore by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry a fortnight ago when he was in China. He was specifically negotiating much better arrangements for those commodities that are important to my constituency.
I am about the best interests of Australians, especially farmers. I note the member for Flinders' interest in the tertiary sector, and good on him. Those benefits will all be there, but let us focus more on having a balanced approach to creating access to those important markets. This will put the economy of this nation on a sure footing, supported by primary producers who have objectives and can set targets with confidence. The wine industry, which has been mentioned by both of the coalition speakers, is a good example of a primary industry that set its targets with some confidence that the markets will be opened up to it. It is fast approaching a $2 billion industry making an important contribution to this nation's economy.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I welcome the opportunity this motion gives to discuss international trade and its importance in improving living standards in trading countries. Perhaps there is not enough opportunity in this place to discuss the myriad of issues that surround those statements. I was very interested in the honourable member for Mallee's contribution because I have constantly stated on the record, in this place, my firm belief that free trade must also be fair trade. The honourable member for Mallee and I perhaps see fair trade as being different beasts, but the importance of this debate is that it is that statement that must be paramount when we look at any of these free trade agreements. 
The honourable member for Flinders stated the importance of bilateral agreements in the context of other regional agreements and the most important of multilateral agreements. But what we must really look at, as we go through reductions in tariffs and a move towards a pure definition of free trade, is the way in which it is fair to both sides in a bilateral agreement. I could find cases of companies in my electorate that certainly, in the way in which national trade is developing, have had success but overwhelmingly, and regrettably, there have been greater job losses in my region because of this move to tariff reduction. As a nation we must look at the way in which we share the glory—if there is, in fact, any to be had—from this type of move towards free trade throughout the whole of Australia's regions. That is very important and has been missing from the national debate.
Australian companies must be able to trade fairly with countries and compete fairly against countries. Trade must be fair not only for each of the trading countries but also for the workers that produce the goods because, as we look at developing countries and the way in which we trade with them, labour standards are certainly an issue that we cannot ignore in the context of this developing trade environment. Trade is not an end in itself; trade is a means to an end. We need to use trade to assist in the progress of trading nations instead of viewing trading issues in isolation from all other areas of public policy. I have talked about labour standards and we can also talk about the impact on the environment and the social environment of these countries.
Australia's role is to show leadership. We have in the past, we must do it now and we must continue to do so. We must ensure that any trade agreement includes enforceable core labour standards, sustainable environmental standards, better social protections and the elimination of the exploitation of child and forced labour. Any bilateral trade agreement with China or Japan must be complementary to the multilateral trading system. Australia must understand that any benefit gained from a bilateral agreement does not impact equally across a nation. Whilst regions may agitate because they think there is something of benefit, other regions may suffer. This is central to the point and it is why debates like the one we are having today are required. It is to make sure that this place is engaged in all of those issues and that we do not see them in isolation. The events in Cancun during the past week show that international trade debates will be robust. But there must be an effort made in those debates to act in Australia's best interests. Australia must ensure that, in engaging in discussions with countries like China and Japan about bilateral agreements, this is our utmost goal.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I have a number of letters and petitions regarding the axing of Behind the News. A petition from the Goollelal Primary School in Kingsley reads as follows:
On Monday 4th August we were informed through the media that the current affairs program, BTN—Behind the News—would be axed due to the federal government's budget cuts of $26 million to the ABC. We at Goollelal Primary School in Kingsley, Western Australia are very dismayed at this decision, as this program is viewed weekly by our year 6 and 7 students and is considered of high educational merit in providing up-to-date world news in a format that students can understand. In addition, many interesting and informative articles are presented which engage our students and increase their general knowledge. We the undersigned would like to petition for BTN to be retained by the ABC so that Australian students can continue to benefit from this excellent educational program. 
It is signed by 200 students. A similar petition regarding Behind the News comes from Wanneroo Primary School and is signed by 122 students. They say simply:
We disapprove of you taking BTN off the air and we want you to change your decision.
I also have a letter from Halidon Primary School. I congratulate these students on taking this action. I am proud of the way that they have involved themselves in the democratic process. Because they are non-conforming petitions, I seek leave to have them tabled.

I ask him if he is aware of the British Joint Intelligence Committee assessment of 10 February this year that `there is no intelligence that Iraq had provided chemical and biological materials to al-Qaeda' and, further, that the committee assessed that any collapse of the Iraqi regime would increase the risk of chemical and biological warfare technology or agents finding their way into the hands of terrorists. Prime Minister, against that, why did you tell Australians precisely the opposite just two weeks later on 27 February, when you said:
... not only might they—
that is, Iraq—
use them—
that is, chemical and biological weapons—
against other countries but they might give them to terrorists, and that is the reason why I'm taking the stance I am.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. Let me inform him that I have been informed that the Joint Intelligence Committee assessment on Iraq and terrorism was received by the relevant Australian agencies on 10 February 2003. I am further advised that the JIC reports are not normally passed to ministers, and I can confirm that this particular JIC report was not brought to my attention or, so I am told, that of my office or other ministers.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Hang on! Don't get too excited about that at all. But even if it were, there is nothing new in the JIC report. The Australian intelligence community, as part of the government's prudent contingency planning, undertook various assessments of what could go wrong in the event of a conflict in Iraq, and in framing these assessments Australian agencies drew upon JIC reports as well as a range of other analysis and intelligence. It was the judgment of the government—and rightly so—that the longer term proliferation and terrorism risks of leaving Saddam's weapons of mass destruction in place outweighed the shorter term risks addressed in the JIC report. That was the basis of the government's decision. It is a decision that I stand by, and I stand by it unconditionally. 
The government was open about these risks. For example, on 24 March, in response to a question from none other than the Leader of the Opposition, I noted that threat levels against Australian interests in a number of countries, especially in the Middle East, had been raised because of the war in Iraq—that is what I told the parliament. I said then, and I repeat now: the government has been open and transparent about threats to Australian interests through the DFAT travel advisories.
Also I make this very important observation to the parliament, which goes directly to what the Leader of the Opposition is trying to get at: all five of my major speeches on Iraq were checked for accuracy by the Office of National Assessments and any suggestions for changes from the Office of National Assessments were accepted by me. I am referring there to my statement to the House on 4 February, my statements on 18 March and 14 May, my National Press Club speech on 14 March and my address to the Australian people on 20 March.
The government stands by its judgment that removing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction would reduce the threat posed by terrorists over the longer term by making it less likely that WMD would fall into the hands of terrorists. It was very much a judgment of the government about the medium and longer term risks of proliferation and terrorism. It is the responsibility of intelligence agencies to make assessments; it is the responsibility of governments to make decisions. And I would remind the Leader of the Opposition to understand the distinction between representations which are made by governments about the nature of intelligence assessments and judgments made by governments as to what to do consequent upon those assessments. We made an assessment. We stand by that assessment; we do not apologise for that judgment. We did not mislead the Australian people. It so happens that we made a different judgment from that of the Australian Labor Party, and apparently it remains the judgment of the Australian Labor Party that Saddam should have been left in authority. That is not the judgment of the Australian people, and it never will be.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opp-osition moving forthwith:
That this House censure the Prime Minister for:
(1)	not telling the Australian Parliament and people the truth about the heightened threat of terrorism caused by the Government's decision to engage in military action in Iraq;
(2)	not telling the Australian Parliament and people the truth about the increased risk of chemical and bio-logical weapons falling into the hands of terrorists caused by the Government's decision to engage in military action in Iraq; and 
(3)	failing to take all the necessary steps to protect Australians from the threat of terrorism.
The findings of the British Joint Intelligence Committee demonstrate beyond doubt that the Prime Minister sent this country to war based on a lie. The Prime Minister did not tell the Australian people the truth when he committed us to war and, by his actions, the Prime Minister increased the threat of terrorism to the Australian people. He made us less safe and, worst of all, he failed to protect us. Six months after the Prime Minister committed this country to war, not a single weapon of mass destruction has been found. Yet in the process Iraq has become a new haven for international terrorists. In other words, what the Prime Minister has succeeded in achieving is the exact opposite of what he promised the Australian people. What is unravelling here yet again is the continuing pattern of deceit by this Prime Minister. Remember them? We all remember them. The children were thrown overboard. Was he telling the truth then?
Opposition members—No.
—Then there was the further assertion that predeployment did not mean our troops were committed to a war. Was he telling the truth then?
Opposition members—No.
—And Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program were an imminent threat to Australia. Was he telling the truth then?
Opposition members—No.
—The Leader of the Opposition knows that that is not normally permitted.
—He said that this war would reduce the threat of terrorism. Was he telling the truth then?
Opposition members—No.
—Of course he was not. Let us look at the most recent example. Here is what the Prime Minister said on 20 March:
We believe that so far from our action in Iraq increasing the terrorist threat it will, by stopping the spread of chemical and biological weapons, make it less likely that a devastating terrorist attack will be carried out against Australia.
That is what the Prime Minister said on 20 March. In other words our action in Iraq, rather than increasing the terrorist threat, would make it less likely. That is what the Prime Minister said. But what did the British Joint Intelligence Committee say? Its assessment was: 
... that al-Qaida and associated groups continued to represent by far the greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq.
That is what the Joint Intelligence Committee in Britain found—that the threat would be heightened. The Prime Minister said an attack would be less likely, yet he had intelligence reports saying the threat would be heightened. He did not tell the Australian people that. He continued to tell them that Australians and Australian interests would be less likely to be the subject of a terrorist attack. He also said, on 27 February:
... not only might they—
that is, Iraq—
use them—
that is, chemical and biological weapons—
against other countries but they might give them to terrorists, and that is the reason why I'm taking the stance I am.
In other words, that was his other justification for going to a war in Iraq—that they might give these weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. But what, Mr Speaker, did the British Joint Intelligence Committee say about this? They said there was no intelligence—no intelligence—that Iraq had provided chemical and biological materials to al-Qaeda and assessed:
... that any collapse of the Iraqi regime would increase the risk of chemical and biological warfare technology or agents finding their way into the hands of terrorists ...
The Prime Minister said that if we did not go in they would give their weapons to the terrorists; the Joint Intelligence Committee found exactly the opposite. In just one paragraph of this report, paragraph 126, the British parliament has destroyed the Australian Prime Minister's entire case for going to war in Iraq. The Prime Minister continues to assert that he relied on intelligence that contradicts this. Where is it, Prime Minister? This report is now not just before our parliament but also in the public domain. You were asked consistently in question time today, Prime Minister, where this other intelligence was, and you failed to give us any evidence. The Prime Minister had compelling information coming to him, based on this report. The Prime Minister cannot hide from this. The simple fact is that the British parliament itself in this report says that the allies, including Australia, were represented—
—This is a censure of Tony Blair!
—The Leader of the House!
—Read the report. The minister interjects. This is the minister who came into this parliament and said that Australia was at increased risk of terrorism because it went to the war in Iraq. He told the truth probably for the first time in this parliament. But what information did the Leader of the House have, Mr Speaker, that led him to the conclusion—back in the debate on war—that we were at increased risk of terrorist attack?
We now know that the British Joint Intelligence Committee came to that conclusion and we now know that the Prime Minister and his government received this report at least by 18 February. We know that Australian representatives took part in that committee. We have the circumstances in which the Prime Minister has consistently relied—when it suited him—on the conclusions of the same British Joint Intelligence Committee. Remember the claims about uranium and Niger? Remember when the Prime Minister was in this parliament, flourishing the very details of all of that information that came from the same Joint Intelligence Committee? Don't tell us, Prime Minister, that when you received that and it suited your argument you could not help yourself getting out there. But you expect the Australian people to believe that when you received information contradicting a report you ignored it—that you had some additional information that contradicted it. Well, table it, Prime Minister. That is the charge to you. You will not take the censure, Prime Minister, but under the suspension of standing orders you will have the opportunity to defend yourself. 
We have before the parliament now conclusive information that the basis upon which the Prime Minister justified taking this country to war was a lie. There can be no more reprehensible position for a Prime Minister to take than sending young Australian men and women to war based on a lie, and that is what he has done. That is what he has done, and that is what this evidence now demonstrates. Apart from the fact that we still have not found the weapons of mass destruction, his justification was that we would reduce the threat of terrorism and that we would take away the capacity for Saddam Hussein to be feeding his weapons of mass destruction—chemical and biological—to others. That is not borne out by any of the evidence that has now come before us. He did not tell the Australian people the truth on this; it is the continuing pattern of deceit. I say this: you do not have to lie to defend the country in terms of its national security.
—Leader of the Opposition! That is not an accusation you can make.
—I will never hesitate to do what is necessary to defend this country. I love it, I believe in it and I will do everything possible to defend it, but I will never send our young men and women to war based on a lie. I will tell them the truth.
More importantly, once having made the decision to start the conflict, you do everything possible to protect the Australian people. Last week, we saw a litany of circumstances in which the government has failed to protect the Australian people. All the Prime Minister did, knowing that he had increased the threat to Australia and Australians, was increase the travel warning—no steps here, no heightened threat security; the Prime Minister stands condemned.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—The government reject this motion. We reject this motion for several very simple reasons. The first and most important reason that we reject this motion is the mistaken belief on the part of the Leader of the Opposition that the publication of this material represents—
—I ensured that the Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence. The same courtesy will be extended to the Prime Minister.
—the injection into this debate of some blinding new revelation. At no stage has this government set out to mislead the Australian people on this issue. At no stage have we sought to commit the young men and women of this country to military conflict based on a lie.
—I warn the member for Rankin!
—The reality is that the opposition, from the very beginning, could not summon the courage to support the government's decision to join our allies in disarming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction. No matter what the opposition leader does, no matter how much he flourishes a report of the British Joint Intelligence Committee, nothing can alter the fact that if the world had listened to the Australian Labor Party Saddam would still be in Baghdad. 
—I warn the member for Hasluck!
—If the world had listened to the Australian Labor Party, the tyrannical regime that was removed by the coalition of the willing—
—I warn the member for Braddon!
—would still be terrorising the people of Iraq. If the world had listened to the Australian Labor Party—if the world had waited for the United Nations to move at the pace of the slowest of the permanent members; namely, France and Russia—action would not have been taken to remove Saddam Hussein. Let us understand at the very beginning of this debate that if we had listened to the Australian Labor Party Saddam would still be running Iraq. That, of course, is a fundamental reality and a fundamental difference.
—The Leader of the Opposition! The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence.
—Let me go to the issues that have been raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me go very directly to the issue of this British Joint Intelligence Committee report. Let me repeat for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition: in terms of the report itself, reports of that kind are not routinely passed to ministers. They are provided to our intelligence agencies. If he bothered to talk to the member for Brand or if he bothered to talk to Senator Ray or if he bothered to talk to the member for Griffith they would inform him that that is the normal procedure. I made it perfectly clear in question time that, in providing the various assessments that Australian intelligence agencies provided to the government before the commencement of military operations against Iraq, those Australian agencies would have drawn on information contained in the Joint Intelligence Committee report. There is nothing remarkable about that, and I counsel the Leader of the Opposition not to get excited about that and not to suggest that there is some kind of giant cover-up.
The reality is that it is absolutely impossible in the day-to-day life of a minister or Prime Minister to read in full all of those individual reports. That is why you have assessment agencies, and just as the Leader of the Opposition was wrong about the CIA material in relation to uranium from Niger he has been wrong about the chain of events in relation to this Joint Intelligence Committee report. If he had bothered, in between his fervent interjections in question time, to actually listen to what I said, he would have heard me say that it was the judgment of the government, and rightly so, that the longer term proliferation and terrorism risks of leaving Saddam's weapons of mass destruction in place outweighed the shorter term risks addressed in the JIC report. That is what I said in my answer but, of course, the Leader of the Opposition is so intent on making noise at question time rather than trying to inject a bit of understanding and intelligence into a debate that he does not even bother to listen to the answers to the questions that he has addressed to me.
It has always been the argument of the government that the action we took in Iraq to disarm Saddam of weapons of mass destruction was designed to prevent a situation arising whereby, if one rogue state such as Iraq were allowed to keep those weapons, it would encourage other rogue states to do the same, thereby increasing the possibility that those weapons of mass destruction would fall into the hands of terrorists. That was the construct of the argument that I presented to the Australian people back in March of this year, and nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has presented today, nothing in the Joint Intelligence Committee report and nothing that has been presented by anybody else since March of this year has shaken or altered that fundamental construct. 
So you have Iraq, a rogue state, possessing, on our intelligence assessment, weapons of mass destruction. Iraq is left undisturbed by the international community, which is what the Leader of the Opposition wanted to happen—that was the effective result of the stance taken by the Australian Labor Party. There is Iraq, a rogue state, keeping weapons of mass destruction. Other rogues states say, `We will do the same thing; we will also get hold of weapons of mass destruction.' The more rogue states that have them, the greater the likelihood that they will fall into the hands of terrorists. If they fell into the hands of terrorists, the threat posed to Australia would be lethal and real. That was the construct of our argument. That was the fundamental justification of the decision that the Australian government took in March of this year—a decision which resulted in the removal of the tyrannical regime that on conservative estimates was responsible for the murder of probably a million people, a regime that posed a direct threat not only to the state of Israel but to other countries in the Middle East.
The Leader of the Opposition talks as though the possession of weapons of mass destruction is some kind of light matter. The possession of weapons of mass destruction represents a very serious threat to the stability of the world. No country has been more prominent, under both Labor and Liberal governments, in promoting a cause of action which is designed to prevent the spread and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As we speak, the Australian Navy is engaged in a training exercise titled the Proliferation Security Initiative, which is designed to equip the navies and the military forces of the countries participating to take effective action against the transportation of weapons of mass destruction.
I ask the Leader of the Opposition to remember the fundamental terms of the debate that occurred in this place six months ago. It was a debate where there was a government that was prepared to assert the courage of its own judgments. It was a debate where there was a government that was prepared to make its own independent judgment according to its assessment of Australia's national interests. It was a government that was prepared, notwithstanding the unwillingness of certain permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, to make a judgment that the long-term national interests of this country lay in joining the United States and the United Kingdom in taking military action against Iraq.
By contrast, we heard from the Australian Labor Party a view of the world that simply went as follows: `No matter what the circumstances are, you don't do anything without a further United Nations resolution.' In other words, they were handing over the conduct of the foreign policy of this country to the governments of France and the Russian republic. They were not prepared to summon the courage to make a judgment in Australia's national interest. We made the judgment that it was in Australia's interest to join the United States and the United Kingdom. We believed that the action would reduce the likelihood of proliferation and of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists, thereby reducing the likelihood of a lethal threat to this country constituted by the possession of those weapons by terrorist groups. It was a judgment made courageously by this government in the medium to longer term interests of this country, and it is a judgment from which I will never resile. 
—The mover of this motion to suspend standing orders was heard without any interruption from the Prime Minister, and when the Leader of the House interrupted him I took action against the Leader of the House.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—The Prime Minister asked this question: is it reasonable to expect that he would read a document such as this provided by the British Joint Intelligence Committee? I say yes, Prime Minister, because you were on the verge of taking this country to war. The problem with this document is that it torpedoed amidships a large part of the rationale you would put to the parliament and the people for going to war, and you knew it. It is unique in this parliament for a Prime Minister not to take a censure motion on a question of national security. He goes fleeing from the chamber and he refuses to engage in this serious and substantive censure motion on national security and whether this government can be trusted on these matters.
We have seen today the classic John Howard reinterpretation of history. There were two reasons advanced by this government for going to war: firstly, it was necessary to reduce the threat of terrorism to Australia and, secondly, it was necessary to reduce the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction through terrorists. The import of this document for the people of Australia is that it blows apart both those arguments. This is a document that was delivered to Australian intelligence one month before this country committed itself to war. That is why it is important.
We have a Prime Minister with the gall to stand before the parliament and say that the reason for going to Iraq was to liberate an oppressed people. Talk about retrospective humanitarian justification! Did we hear that in advance? When they tabled this legal opinion justifying their case for going to war, was there any shred of documentation or discussion of that? No, there was not. It has been invented after the fact, and the reason why it has been invented after the fact is that this Prime Minister—man of steel, Howard of Zimbabwe, chair of the Commonwealth troika on Zimbabwe—knows that, if humanitarian intervention was the justification for Iraq, we would be on the gates of Harare today. So do not come at us with that codswallop; come to the actual core of the argument itself!
Did we notice the slow stripping away of the Prime Minister's defence today? It began with him saying, `I don't know what you're talking about, Leader of the Opposition,' and went from `There may have been a document produced by the JIC in London,' through to—what happened then?—`It could've gone into the mix.' By the answer to the fourth question, it got down to: Australian intelligence contingency planning `drew upon' the advice of the British Joint Intelligence Committee. By the end of question time, do you know what the Prime Minister was saying? He was saying that it was part of the paraphernalia which was available to his office and to his officials in shaping their decision to go to war!
It is like getting blood from a stone to try to get the truth from this Prime Minister. You have to extract it bit by bit. A simple yes and a simple no—to the vacant chair—would have been all that was required. At the end of it all, the key question asked by the Leader of the Opposition remains unanswered—that is, what was the intelligence and evidence base upon which you chose to reject the considered advice of the supreme intelligence body of the United Kingdom in reaching your decision for going to war? The reason that you do not answer the question is that you do not have an answer. 
And then we come to the core arguments the Prime Minister advances. He has talked at length about the fact that he has covered off this question of an increase in the terrorism threat arising from the war in Iraq, and he has tried to cover that off in terms of what was contained in a couple of travel advisories in relation to a couple of countries in the Middle East. Now that you have deigned to return to the chamber, Prime Minister, let me tell you that the increased terrorism threat has everything to do with what was happening in Iraq then and now—when we see al-Qaeda returning to the country, creating merry hell, possibly responsible for the death of Sergio de Mello, possibly responsible for the assassination of Ayatollah Hakim in Najaf the other day; Indonesia becoming a radicalising force as far as terrorism is concerned; and the organisation of terrorism activity against Australians. That is one element of it.
The second element, Prime Minister, you have no answer for at all. This document says that if you invade Iraq it will increase the risk of proliferating biological and chemical weapons to terrorists. Tell me this, Prime Minister: where in this parliament have you ever admitted that?
—The member for Griffith will address his remarks through the chair.
—Where have you admitted it? He remains silent. I ask the Prime Minister, `Where have you admitted this?'
—The member for Griffith will address his remarks through the chair!
—Mr Speaker, having the Prime Minister in the chamber makes this a unique opportunity to pose the question—for the simple reason that he has never done so. You were told about the increased risk of proliferating biological and chemical weapons to terrorists—you were told about it in this document—and you did not tell the Australian people. That is the second core element. This is not an occasional utterance. We have the Howard government using this on 15 occasions. The Prime Minister himself used this on 30 different occasions in arguing his case for going to war, and his ministers have used the same argument. It is not an accidental argument. You lie censured for this because you have misled the Australian people yet again. (Time expired)

That this House:
(1)	notes that a study commissioned by Osteoporosis Australia and a subsequent report titled The Burden of Brittle Bones indicated that osteoporosis is a disease that is becom-ing increasingly prevalent in our comm-unities; 
(2)	notes that this report further indicated that it should be recognised that osteoporosis is a preventable and treat-able disease and with more research the current trend could be reversed;
(3)	notes with concern the statistics in this report that indicate the projected increase in numbers of patients within the population diagnosed with osteoporosis—in 2001, 1.9 million Australians, 10% of the population, were diagnosed as suffering from osteo-porosis and by 2021 this figure is expected to rise to 13.2%;
(4)	recognises the enormous cost to the health services, the community, to individual suffer-ers and their carers; and
(5)	calls on the Government to recognise osteo-porosis as a national health priority.
The report commissioned by Osteoporosis Australia, titled The burden of brittle bones: costing osteoporosis in Australia,is an alarming document that has gone largely unnoticed in this House. It is alarming because it brings to the forefront this widespread, disabling and sometimes fatal disease. Far from the minor condition that many believe it is, osteoporosis is a leading cause of doctors' visits, prescriptions and home nursing. This insidious and serious affliction is the major cause of disability and handicap in Australia. It is the primary cause of hip fractures and spinal vertebrae collapse. Moreover, these and other effects of the disease inhibit otherwise productive lives. In turn, this destroys the individual and their family.
Unbeknown to most, there were 1.9 million Australians with osteoporosis in 2001, with the majority of these being women. Put in terms of hospitalisation, this equals one person hospitalised every 8.1 minutes. This frightening statistic will worsen, with a 60 per cent increase expected over the next two decades. This increase will equate to an osteoporotic hospitalisation every 3.7 minutes by 2021. The pressure this will place on our health services and resources will be enormous, and it will be nothing short of a miracle for them to cope. This is not some type of scare tactic; this awful disease has a higher prevalence than allergies, deafness and diabetes, and is even more prevalent than the common cold.
Although the disease is so widespread and studies have shown that there is an awareness of it within the broader community, there is still a lack of understanding and a lack of knowledge of this disease. As a result, osteoporosis will cause bone fractures in about 25 per cent of women and 17 per cent of men. Of those that are unfortunate enough to suffer hip fractures, about 20 per cent, sadly, will die within 6 months of the fracture. Even more frightening is that the rate of hip fractures is rising at an incredible rate. By 2020, one-third of Australian hospital beds will be occupied by women with fractures. It truly is `the silent epidemic'.
Given the prevalence of the disease and the expense to treat it, the costs are enormous. In 2000-01 the total health cost of osteoporosis was close to $1.9 billion, with half of this being hospital costs. In the same period, this insidious disease resulted in over 110,000 fewer people in the work force and over 162,000 cases of absenteeism from work. These and other indirect costs came to a total of over $5½ billion—a staggering amount, by any stretch of the imagination.
Putting this back into a compassionate human perspective, more important than money and the financial cost is the cost that people pay through pain and suffering and, in over 1,000 cases per year, with their lives. Osteoporosis represents one per cent of the total burden of disease and injury in Australia, with over half of the disease burden being due to premature mortality—that is, over 13,000 premature deaths. This means that it is a greater burden in this country than HIV-AIDS, cervical cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Put in perspective, what do all these figures mean? Musculoskeletal disorders are the third leading cause of health system expenditure in Australia. Osteoporosis costs on their own are higher than those of diabetes and asthma. Given the demographic projections of population ageing coupled with the lack of immediate health intervention, osteoporotic conditions are set to increase to epidemic proportions. This is of grave concern to most—except, I gather, to those sitting on the other side of this chamber.
Considering the World Health Organisation has defined osteoporosis as a primary health issue since it is filling more hospital beds than any other disease, why is this dreadful disease not given greater importance and classified as a national health priority area? Why, unlike in the US and the EU, has there not been a concerted response from the government in any area concerning osteoporosis? The EU and the US are heeding the advice that, left unwatched and untreated, this disease will be the epidemic of the future if we fail to act now.
Of their own accord, Osteoporosis Australia have had to initiate education and awareness programs, especially towards fracture prevention. They have done this largely without assistance. All they have asked is that osteoporosis be adopted by the government as a national health priority and be provided corresponding funding, and that the national strategic plan detailed in their report is adopted by the government. These requests were made in this report two years ago, and what has been done so far by the government? Nothing. Keeping true to form, the government continues to be out of reach to these organisations that are trying to help others in need—the perfect application of that old Liberal favourite of, `If their vote won't make a difference, let's ignore them and they'll go away.' I congratulate Osteoporosis Australia on their excellent work to date and on commissioning this important report. I simultaneously condemn the Liberal government's inaction in this vital area.

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I thank the member for Chisholm for bringing to the attention of the House the significance and increasing prevalence of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is characterised by abnormal bone remodelling where bone resorption by osteoclasts exceeds formation by osteoblasts, resulting in a decreased bone mass, without defective mineralisation, leading to brittle bone, reduced tensile strength and significant susceptibility to fracture.
Normally, peak bone mass occurs in both sexes in the third decade of life, followed by a period of net bone loss of 0.3 to 0.5 per cent per year. At menopause, women can suffer an accelerated phase of as much as tenfold bone loss due to oestrogen deficiency. Primary or type 1 osteoporosis is a disease occurring in the sixth or later decades of life in oestrogen deficient menopausal females and hypo gonadal males. Cytokine levels are increased, resulting in increased osteoclast activity and increased trabecular bone resorption, leading to forearm and vertebral body fracture. Secondary or type 2 osteoporosis—associated with advanced ageing in both sexes and certain endocrine and systemic inflammatory diseases, certain drug therapy, particularly glucocorticoids, diabetes mellitus, obstructive airways disease and alcoholism—is associated with a decline in osteoblasts, leading to cortical bone fractures in the femur, femoral neck and pelvis. 
Important factors to reduce environmental risks of osteoporosis include exercise, particularly walking; maintaining a normal weight and muscle mass; and ensuring adequate calcium, phosphate and vitamin D intake, including sunlight. Bicarbonate intake to improve blood alkalisation retards bone loss. Avoiding excess alcohol and caffeine and long-acting benzodiazepines and ceasing cigarette smoking are advisable. Bone fracture with associated pain and deformity is often the first sign of the disease, sometimes with minimal trauma. Height loss from often silent vertebral fractures and resultant forward curvature or kyphosis of the thoracic spine—the dowager's hump—is common. Once a patient fractures a hip, the risk of death within one year is significant. For early diagnosis, bone densitometry is the most sensitive test. In established osteoporosis, the goal is to prevent fracture. In the elderly, reducing the risk of falling is essential. So improving coordination and vision—as with cataract surgery—and reducing muscle weakness and confusion, which is sometimes drug induced, are critical. The use of hip pads by those who are at high risk of falling reduces hip fractures.
Pharmacological treatment can be classified in two groups. The first is medications that decrease osteoclast-induced bone resorption, including calcium, particularly calcium citrate; vitamin D3, including its active metabolite calcitriol; and HRT or oestrogen in post-menopausal women—unfortunately with the increased risk of breast and uterine cancer. Selective oestrogen receptor modulators or SERM, such as raloxifene, where bone and cardiovascular oestrogen receptors are targeted and breast and endometrial receptors are blocked and not activated, show real promise. Calcitonin, particularly by intranasal administration, and biphosphonates inhibit osteoclasts and bone resorption. The second group of drugs comprise medications that stimulate osteoblast activity and new bone formation, including sodium fluoride, but there are concerns regarding the quality of bone formed—that is, is it still brittle? Parathyroid hormone, particularly combined with anti-resorptive therapy, is promising. Androgen therapy, mainly in hypo gonadal males, is useful.
My parliamentary colleagues will detail the national health priority of osteoporosis, the Access Economics report and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare figures. The government's commitment for care for osteoporosis and related conditions includes an allocation of $11.5 million over four years in the 2002-03 federal budget. A sum of $1.5 million has been allocated for 27 practical projects to help provide a better quality of life for people with arthritis and osteoporosis right across Australia. The National Health and Research Council has provided funding of $5 million for osteoporosis and falls prevention-specific research in 2003. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, considers osteoporosis to be a very high priority.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Health: Osteoporosis</title>,Private Members' Business,8,1,speech
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I rise to support the motion of the member for Chisholm. Osteoporosis has been described as the disease that we do not have to have. Osteoporosis is a disease that is easily identifiable and, if identified early enough, is manageable and treatable. Unfortunately, it is not a disease that is curable. Through targeted health intervention, the incidence of osteoporosis can be dramatically curbed. Osteoporosis means `porous bones' and is a serious musculoskeletal disease which leads to deterioration of bone density and structural quality. This in turn leads to a greater risk of fractures and collapse of vertebrae.
Osteoporosis is caused by a number of factors: age, hormonal changes, diet, lifestyle and family history. But early diagnosis through bone densitometry or biochemical cross-link testing can lead to the delay or diminishment of the onset of osteoporosis. Community education and promotion need to be undertaken to ensure that people who need to be tested are tested. Osteoporosis treatment includes nutrition, adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium, exercise to increase muscle strength and to improve coordination and balance, lifestyle changes—avoiding smoking and excessive intake of alcohol and caffeine—and practising fall prevention strategies. Preventive medical treatment, regular screening of high-risk patients, avoidance of medications that might affect bone health or diminish bone density, use of hormonal and non-hormonal medications, education and counselling programs are all things that we can do to make the lives of people who either are about to get osteoporosis or have already been diagnosed much better. 
Today osteoporosis is more prevalent in Australia than high cholesterol, allergies or even the common cold. It is estimated that, in 2001, 1.9 million Australians had osteoporosis, of which 75 per cent were women. It is also estimated that treating osteoporosis in 2001 cost $1.9 billion in direct financial costs. These include the costs to the health system—services reimbursed through Medicare and private health funds, pharmaceuticals, allied health services and research—and the indirect financial costs of early retirement, absenteeism, loss of tax revenue, the value of volunteer carers, modifications and devices, which are also substantial.
But it is the human cost that cannot be easily measured. It is the unnecessary pain, suffering, loss of mobility, loss of quality of life and deaths that result from osteoporosis that we cannot measure. The Access Economics' report The burden of brittle bones: costing osteoporosis in Australia described it as the silent thief. The report dramatically demonstrates the effect of osteoporosis where it states:
Osteoporosis steals more than bone. It's the primary cause of hip fracture, which can lead to permanent disability, loss of independence and sometimes even death. Collapsing spinal vertebrae can produce stooped posture and a “dowager's hump”. Lives collapse too. The chronic pain and anxiety that accompany a frail frame make people curtail meaningful activities, because the simplest things can cause broken bones. Stepping off a curb. A sneeze. Bending to pick up something. A hug. “Don't touch mom, she might break” is the sad joke in many families ...
of women who have osteoporosis. Access Economics estimate that 25 per cent of Australian women and 17 per cent of Australian men will develop fractures related to osteoporosis. Of those Australians over 60 years of age, one in two women and one in three men will sustain an osteoporotic fracture. In 2001, it was estimated that a fracture occurs every 8.1 minutes in Australia. Once one bone is broken, the chance of another fracture within 12 months increases fourfold. The Royal Australian College of Physicians figures indicate that 50 per cent of people with hip fractures will require long-term nursing care. The real concern is that those figures show dramatically that 20 per cent of people who sustain a hip fracture will die within six months of sustaining that fracture—that is, one in five people suffering from osteoporosis who fracture a hip will die within six months. This person will be someone's husband or wife, aunty or uncle, brother or sister, or friend—tragic, unnecessary losses from osteoporosis, the disease that we just do not have to have.
I support the member for Chisholm's motion because I believe that we need to ensure that all Australians are educated about this disease and that it is given the attention that it needs at the national level. It should be a national health priority for all of us. ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Health: Osteoporosis</title>,Private Members' Business,8,1,speech
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I commend the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat, on the detailed contribution she has made to the debate on osteoporosis. I was somewhat disappointed that the member for Chisholm—who took the time to move this motion and for the first three of four minutes of her contribution kept it on a high plane—could not resist cheapening her remarks and the motion by blaming the government for osteoporosis. As the member for Ballarat and previous speakers have said, this is a critical, long-term health issue, an issue that requires even thought and an even tempered approach.
It is not just a critical health issue on its own; it symbolises in many respects the great challenges and demands that will increasingly confront our health system and our society both today and for decades into the future. As medical science improves and as life expectancy increases, we will be able to do many things that were previously not possible and to treat diseases in a more sophisticated way. In this respect, you can compare osteoporosis with many other diseases—such as MS, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, cancer and the like—inasmuch as in 20 years we have made so many critical advances and we know so much more about these diseases. However, as previous speakers have said—quite rightly—osteoporosis is different in that it can be avoided; it can be prevented.
As the Access Economics report and many other detailed studies in recent years have highlighted, diet and lifestyle are key, as are genetic predisposition and many other factors. The tragedy is that more than 1.9 million Australians—particularly women—are affected by osteoporosis. Many do not know it and do not become aware of it until far too late into their lives, when the bulk of the damage has been done. The cost to those with the disease is enormous not only for their health, wellbeing and quality of life but also for their family and friends who care for them. The cost to the community is also very large. Access Economics estimates that the cost to the health budget directly is in the order of $2 billion, but it importantly points out that the size of indirect costs with things such as loss of earnings and the costs of carers is nearly three times that, at $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion annually.
As we know, the disease results in bone fractures. It incapacitates and effectively cripples those afflicted, requiring lengthy hospitalisation and/or care in a nursing home. With better education and better understanding, literally millions of people in the future will be in a position where they do not have to face this disease and at the same time our overburdened health system will be able to direct resources into other major areas of demand.
I am pleased that the federal Minister for Health and Ageing has gained the agreement of all of the states to declare this a national health priority area, which has been important in focusing attention on the problem. I am also pleased that there has been a commitment to this area in the last couple of budgets as well. However, while there is a tangible and important role for government, there is also a large role for the medical community as well as for individuals within society. Preventive care, not just in this area but also in many other areas, needs to have a greater focus so that we can prevent diseases before they occur rather than have to treat them further down the track. In this respect, the more doctors can do with every patient—no matter what their visit is for—to inform them of the risks of these sorts of diseases, the better.
Parents can play a greater role with children. More and more kids at a young age—and teenagers—are suffering from obesity and we know that that sort of problem, that sort of lifestyle, will lead very directly in the future to serious health problems such as osteoporosis and diabetes. With 10 per cent of our population affected and the number likely to increase, we as a community have to do more. We have to combine to try to massively reduce this affliction and we can now do something to address it.

"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I commend the member for Chisholm for bringing this important issue to the attention of the parliament, and I commend the speakers who have preceded me in this debate. The issue of osteoporosis was raised with me when one of my constituents came in recently to talk about the high cost of preventative treatment. Following her discussion with me, I did a bit of background research on this issue and got in touch with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. What struck me—and other speakers have referred to this—was the very high cost of the treatment of this disease to not just individuals and their families but the economy and society generally. The cost is going to become more substantial with an ageing population. Previous speakers have commented on the fact that one in two females over the age of 60 will suffer fractures due to osteoporosis primarily associated with the drop of oestrogen in postmenopausal women. As many as one in three men will be similarly afflicted by fractures associated with osteoporosis.
From what I could ascertain from my constituents, the loss of bone density is often very gradual and comes without warning signs until the disease is well advanced. Constituents asked me—and I had no answer—why we do not provide for free bone density scans on the same basis as we currently provide screening for breast cancer. I thought that was a reasonable question to pose to me. Further, looking at reports that estimated the direct and indirect cost of the disease, I found that direct costs were somewhere in the order of $2 billion—over half of that in hospital costs—with indirect costs estimated to be as high as $5.57 billion over the last couple of years.
If the costs are so high and the impact on sufferers is so great, I want to ask in the short time that I have available why it is that Fosamax, which is a well-known treatment for this disease, is not available on the PBS and subsidised as an acknowledged preventative treatment for osteoporosis. When I took this matter up, on behalf of Mrs Campbell, with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, they told me:
The availability of Fosamax ... and Fosamax Once Weekly tablets on the PBS is restricted to the treatment of established osteoporosis in patients with fracture due to minimal trauma where the fracture has been proven radiologically. The requirement that fractures be demonstrated arises from the requirement that for PBS listing, cost-effectiveness be demonstrated for a particular use of a drug. The PBAC considered that Fosamax and the other similar drugs listed for osteoporosis were only cost-effective in patients with proven fracture.
They went on to say:
Unless further data is presented to the Committee demonstrating cost-effectiveness in patients with osteoporosis but without a radiologically proven fracture, the Committee is not able to extend the listing to cover the treatment of osteoporosis where fracture has not occurred.
I find this an amazing response, particularly as we have pointed to the very high direct and indirect costs that are borne by sufferers, their families and society generally. The advice went on to say:
I am unable to provide detailed reasons as to why the PBAC considers Fosamax is not cost-effective in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients who do not have fractures due to minimal trauma due to commercial-in-confidence considerations. 
I have pursued these issues by way of questions on notice to the minister. It would seem to a layperson that you do not have to be an economist to know that the high direct and indirect costs surely warrant the subsidisation of Fosamax as a preventative treatment on the PBS scheme.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Health: Osteoporosis</title>,Private Members' Business,8,1,speech
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I would like to commend all the members on both sides of the House who are supporting this motion on osteoporosis. Sadly, we probably all know of someone, either in our families or amongst our friends and/or constituents, who suffers from the debilitating effects of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis means `porous bones'. It is a disease which causes severe deterioration in bone density, leading to weakness and the increased likelihood of breaking or fracturing bones should the person suffer a fall. This motion provides us with the opportunity to reinforce the message that osteoporosis is preventable. It is important that this message is understood by the Australian people, particularly those who are most at risk, such as women after menopause and men with low testosterone levels. The organisation Osteoporosis Australia produces a lot of very good information about the disease and how it can be prevented. On its web site, at www.osteoporosis.org.au, it provides people with the opportunity to gain an assessment of the risk they face, based on their health and lifestyle, of suffering osteoporosis. It is a quick and easy assessment to do.
In 1999 the results of a national nutrition survey were released by the CSIRO which revealed that over 90 per cent of Australians aged 65 years or older were not consuming their recommended daily intake of dairy foods and were not getting sufficient calcium. Osteoporosis robs the bones of calcium. Dr Peter Ebeling, endocrinologist at the Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology at the Royal Melbourne Hospital at the time of the survey's release, stated:
People aged over 65 need at least 1000mg of calcium every day to help slow down bone loss.
While osteoporosis is not curable, it is preventable and it can be managed. We can protect our bones by eating a good diet, with an adequate intake of calcium, and by maintaining an active lifestyle which includes regular physical exercise, such as walking.
The report produced for Osteoporosis Australia by Access Economics Pty Ltd entitled The burden of brittle bones: costing osteoporosis in Australia states that osteoporosis is `the disease we don't have to have', and yet an estimated two million Australians already suffer from osteoporosis-related conditions and the prediction is made that this will increase to three million people by 2021. It was a recommendation in the report that dealing with the growing problem of osteoporosis be made a national health priority, with commensurate funding. I am pleased to note the lead taken by the health minister, Senator Kay Patterson. Senator Patterson is leading all state and territory ministers to an agreement to designate arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions, including osteoporosis, as a national health priority area. This means that a high priority is already being given to the work of health professionals and key community groups to improve the health and wellbeing of people with osteoporosis.
The federal government has also funded the initiative known as National Falls Prevention for Older People, which aims to reduce the number of serious falls suffered by older people, particularly those who have osteoporosis. I particularly welcome the $10 million in funding for research projects in South Australia announced by the minister in October 2002. Those projects include efforts to develop drug or dietary strategies to prevent osteoporosis. In the 2002-03 federal budget, $11.5 million was allocated over four years to help reduce the incidence of bone and joint conditions in the community. This was followed by an additional $21.8 million in this year's federal budget to help people with chronic conditions, including arthritis and osteoporosis. An additional $2.3 million was also provided for the National Falls Prevention in Older People initiative. 
Australia is one of more than 60 countries that have signed up to the Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010, which is endorsed by the World Health Organisation and the United Nations. Activities over the decade are designed to improve the health related quality of life for people with bone and joint conditions. Osteoporosis is preventable and with a good diet and plenty of exercise many Australians can avoid the effects of this debilitating disease.

"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises the success of the Federal Magistrates Service since its establishment by the Commonwealth Government in 2000;
(2)	in particular, recognises the contribution of the Federal Magistrates Service to:
(a)	providing a quick and accessible forum for liti-gants involved in less complex family law and other general federal law disputes;
(b)	increasing access to justice for Australian families, particularly those going through relationship breakdown; and
(c)	providing an alternative and less formal court option for litigants and encouraging the use of conciliation, counselling, arbitration and medi-ation in appropriate cases; and
(3)	notes the Government's recent announce-ment that four new Federal Magistrates are to be appointed in South-east Queensland, Newcastle, Adelaide and Melbourne to further enhance the operation of the Federal Magistrates Service.
Since the Howard government's election in 1996, a great deal has been achieved in the national interest. The Howard government's record speaks for itself. The runs are on the board in many areas of national policy: under the Howard government our Commonwealth debt has been cut, the budget is in surplus, far more apprenticeships exist for younger Australians to help them in their search for jobs and Australians are paying $450 less a month on their average weekly mortgages than they were in the horror days of the Keating government.
But I want to speak on another aspect of national policy which has not had the full applause of the parliament. I want to speak very strongly in favour of it and advocate its place in Australian society. I want to speak in the parliament today about the creation of the federal magistrates courts and the impact that those courts are having on the lives of families throughout the country and in particular in my electorate of Ryan.
The Howard government is committed to providing quicker and more efficient services in and access to the legal system for Australians throughout the land. The government has established the Federal Magistrates Service to provide a cheaper, simpler and faster method of dealing with less complex civil and family law matters. It is the first tier of the Commonwealth court, and it is the first new Australian court since the Federal Court was established in 1977. The service has developed procedures that aim to be as streamlined and as user-friendly as possible, reducing delay and cost to litigants—because we all know that areas of litigation put great stress upon those who are in that litigation environment. 
Since its establishment three years ago, the Federal Magistrates Service has assisted many constituents in my electorate of Ryan. This is why I am speaking on it in the parliament today. It is providing a quick and accessible forum for litigants involved in less complex family law and other general federal law disputes. The Federal Magistrates Service is helping to ease the pressure on the Family Court in particular and, consequentially, to reduce waiting lists in family law related matters. Constituents in Ryan often approach my office regarding family law matters, and some have family issues that are of a very serious nature. As we all know, in these situations all parties are looking for the quickest possible solution. The Federal Magistrates Service has freed up the Family Court and the Federal Court to focus on the far more complex and lengthy matters that the justices of those courts ought to focus on. Effectively, the Federal Magistrates Service is increasing access to justice for not only Ryan families but all Australian families, providing families with a greater range of options for resolving their legal problems as quickly and cheaply as possible.
There are currently 19 federal magistrates located in capital cities and major regional centres around Australia. In the 2003-04 budget the government allocated to the Federal Magistrates Service funding for the appointment of two additional federal magistrates. These appointments will honour the government's election commitment to appoint up to two additional magistrates. Those new federal magistrates will be appointed in Newcastle and south-east Queensland. Two new magistrates will also be appointed in Adelaide and Melbourne. These appointments will contribute very significantly to the effective operation of the service.
While about 80 per cent of the current workload of the FMS is in the family law area, the government is still considering other areas of suitable jurisdiction for the FMS, where they involve matters of lower complexity. Areas being considered include some aspects of corporate insolvency and intellectual property related matters. Gradual expansion of the jurisdiction of the FMS is in accordance with the intended structure and development of the FMS as a lower court in our federal civil justice system.
I know that my constituents in the electorate of Ryan appreciate the nature of the Federal Magistrates Service and would very much commend the government on its expansion into other areas of law where it can help Ryan constituents. In moving this motion in the House, I would like to acknowledge the Attorney-General and the significant reforms that he has initiated while overseeing this important portfolio. The Attorney-General has initiated a number of changes to ensure equity and fairness in access to justice for all Australians. It is important that members of the House and senators as well acknowledge the work that is done to make life easier in this very difficult area for our fellow Australians. The FMS is achieving the government's aims of encouraging people to resolve their legal disputes without going to court and of streamlining court processes where a resolution might not be attainable privately. I commend this motion to the House and again speak very strongly on the character of the Magistrates Service in the federal tier. (Time expired)

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—The member for Ryan's motion recognises the contribution of the Federal Magistrates Service to the resolution of family disputes. However, with great respect to the member for Ryan, paragraph (3) of his motion ignores the principal reason the government is providing four new magistrates for Queensland, Newcastle, Adelaide and Melbourne. For the record, the real reason the Federal Magistrates Service is increasing its number of magistrates can be found in the Federal Magistrates Service Annual Report 2001-02, which on page 10 states: 
The workload of the court in its general federal law jurisdictions has expanded, especially during the last quarter of 2001-02 when the court received a significant number of matters relating to migration.
The annual report goes on to state that, in addition to the quantum of cases flooding in from its inherent migration jurisdiction, that jurisdiction itself has been greatly expanded. It states:
The court has had a major expansion of its jurisdiction. At the time of its establishment the court was given jurisdiction in relation to most administrative law matters. However, jurisdiction in relation to applications to review visa-related decisions made under the Migration Act 1958 was specifically excluded from the scope of the court's work. That was changed from 2 October 2001 when the court was given concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court.
The express and implied assertions in this motion give the false belief, in my view, that this increase in the Federal Magistrates Service is somehow a good thing. The truth about the increase in the Federal Magistrates Service paints quite a different picture. There has been an explosion in appeals to the Federal Court, principally in the area of migration law. Far from hailing the expansion of the Federal Magistrates Service as a good thing, the real necessity for this government to increase the services is a tragic admission, in my view, of the government's failed migration law policies. The failure of the government's migration law policies reflects an ever increasing spiral in migration appeal cases—a barometer of market dissatisfaction against an ever increasing number of departmental and tribunal decisions.
Again, with respect to the member for Ryan, he cannot move this motion seriously believing it represents some great achievement of the government. Rather, if the government were serious about addressing this issue, it would go to the heart of the matter and implement policies that would lower the number of migration appeals. If the government were serious about its immigration policy, it would identify ways of making its visa system more equitable. I see that on a daily basis in my federal electorate office of Lowe. 
The Howard government should immediately stop using immigration policy for its own cynical short-term political interests as an instrument to pander to the worst instincts in our society and, in so doing, further divide the Australian community. In conclusion, at a time when we have alarmingly low birth rates in Australia and recognise the serious consequences that that issue poses for our future, there has never been a better time for the government to do something to increase our migrant intake to the many parts of Australia which are in desperate need of the economic benefits associated with increased population growth. That would be in everybody's interests.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Federal Magistrates Service</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2003-09-15,"—I seconded this motion, and I point out that it asks the House to recognise the efficiency of the Federal Magistrates Service in processing law disputes and the measures of comfort it affords families and individuals by bringing their cases to a speedier resolution than would otherwise be possible. I acknowledge and support the thrust of the member for Ryan's motion but I would like to look more closely at the Federal Magistrates Service and the role it plays in Family Court matters. It is no secret that issues surrounding parental separation, custody matters and child support payments have been at the forefront of my concerns for many years. Every one of us in the House today will have heard heartbreaking stories of divorce, child visitation problems and financial hardship—to the point where the government is looking at overhauling the system. 
In the three years since its creation, the Federal Magistrates Service has played a major role in smoothing the way for Australian families—which would otherwise have had to go through lengthier and more arduous legal processes—during times of anxiety and distress. I tell the case of the man from Gin Gin who was in my electorate and who used to have to travel to the Federal Court at Parramatta, some 1,000 kilometres away, by hitchhiking and getting lifts on semitrailers, and then appear before two teams of barristers without legal aid. The Federal Magistrates Service goes some way to addressing those sorts of injustices. Although the FMS has jurisdiction in many areas, including administrative law, bankruptcy, unlawful discrimination, consumer protection, privacy law, migration and copyright, it focuses most of its attention on Family Court matters.
While the Federal Magistrates Service shares jurisdiction with the Federal Court and the Family Court in many of these matters, it has developed in its own right to the point where it is now responsible for about 36 per cent of all the applications for final orders in Family Court matters. Over 60 per cent of all applications for maintenance, child support and contravention of orders are delivered directly to the Federal Magistrates Service. I cannot endorse the member for Lowe's cynical view of the FMS. I am sure that this growth is not essentially around migration matters but is more broadly held in the family jurisdiction.
More specifically, from the year 2000 to date the Federal Magistrates Service has received 93,278 family law applications, comprising 1,504 child support applications and 91,744 divorce applications. In that three-year time frame, the number of lodged child support applications has more than trebled—from 204 in 2000-01 to735 in 2002-03. In the same period, divorce applications have grown by 29 per cent—a clear demonstration of the growing demand being placed on the Federal Magistrates Service. Its great value lies in two things: firstly, its ability to lift the burden from the existing Family Court and Federal Court systems; and, secondly, the speedier closure it gives many Australian families. Many citizens simply can neither afford the financial strictures of the Family Court process nor abide its lengthy delays. The Federal Magistrates Service was given a funding boost in 2003-04, with a budget of $4.4 million over four years. Four new magistrates will come on board, lifting its ranks from 19 to 23.
They will carry out services in the capital cities and some regional centres, and circuit hearings will be held throughout rural and regional areas. Whilst circuit hearings and regional courts are based at Launceston, Parramatta, Newcastle and Townsville—they offer fair coverage—I see great merit in basing additional magistrates in smaller provincial centres where permanent and regular circuits can be established. This has been done, with the announcement in May of a dedicated magistrate for south-east Queensland. I would like to see this trend developed further. Through flexible alternatives the Federal Magistrates Service focuses on methods of primary dispute resolution, helping to find workable outcomes to disputes without the necessity of resorting to the legal system. Individuals can be referred to counselling, mediation and conciliation prior to lodging court documents, and these services remain available during the legal processes. 
In conclusion, within the Central Queensland region we are fortunate to have two fairly accessible services being delivered by Centacare at Rockhampton and Bundaberg. I commend the work of the councillors in these two centres, particularly Shari Jackson and Neil Crossland.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—The motion before the House asks us to recognise the success of the Federal Magistrates Service since its inception in 2000. In particular, we are being asked to look at the contribution the Federal Magistrates Service has made to shortening delays in the Family Court and increasing access to justice for Australian families, particularly those who are going through relationship breakdowns. The motion is also celebrating the four new federal magistrates in south-east Queensland, Newcastle, Adelaide and Melbourne. This announcement is good news for those areas. However, I do not think the member for Ryan yet fully understands the significant issues still facing many families in Tasmania and other regional areas when accessing appropriate legal representation in either court.
The member for Lowe has addressed the issue of migration workload, but I cannot let this motion go without addressing the Family Court implications that we are still suffering in regional communities. When the Federal Magistrates Bill was being debated in 1999, I made it clear that the concept of a federal magistracy was neither the best nor the most efficient way to resolve the delays in the Family Court. My fear when initially debating this bill, following the retirement in Tasmania of Justice Butler, the Family Court judge, was that families in my electorate of Bass and throughout the north of Tasmania would not have appropriate access to the Family Court system. Legal practitioners in Launceston and in northern Tasmania tell me that their experience has borne out the concerns that I had. The court still incurs long delays in the system, which can lead to a significant lack of judicial time spent on cases or can mean that the cases are dragged out over many months. They also raise as a concern the impact that continually having different judges hearing different cases can have on the results of cases. I hope the member for Ryan comes back for the rest of the debate because I think it is important that he understands the full implications of the service. Most legal practitioners would agree that having a familiar judge is important in ensuring the most efficient use of a court's time. More importantly, we want to make sure that families do not have to explain to a judge again and again the circumstances of their case, thereby using up further court time.
The last time I spoke on this issue was actually in August 2000. It has been an issue on which I have been campaigning for some time for my community. Northern Tasmania was then still waiting for a replacement Family Court judge, following the retirement of Justice Butler in 1995. It is now September 2003—almost 10 years since the retirement of Justice Butler—and we are still waiting for a Family Court judge to be appointed on either a full- or part-time basis in northern Tasmania.
I have explained to the House several times the predicament that the judicial system in northern Tasmania is in, but for the benefit of those opposite who may not have been around when I did I will briefly go through it again. Northern Tasmania has been without a dedicated Family Court judge since 1995, when Justice Butler moved to Hobart just before he retired in 1996. During that year the then federal member for Bass, Warwick Smith, promised that Justice Butler would be replaced. In April 1996, the Family Court closed the northern registry, claiming it had to meet budget cuts imposed by the federal government and that the north of the state would be serviced by a Hobart judge and by fly-in visits from interstate judges. It was promised at this time that families in the north of Tasmania would not be inconvenienced by this decision. It does not take Einstein to figure out that that actually has not happened. I would also remind members that Justice Butler's replacement, when eventually appointed, was appointed in Sydney—a decision that baffles me to this day, as the delay times in Tasmania have been significantly and consistently worse than in Sydney. Delays at the time of the new appointment stood at 44 weeks in Sydney, compared to 53 weeks in Tasmania. Currently these delays are on average between six and 10 weeks in Sydney and Melbourne and anywhere between 12 and 28 weeks—and quite often more—in Tasmania. Despite this there is still no dedicated Family Court judge in northern Tasmania. 
The Family Court regional circuit schedules only four judicial sittings in Launceston a year. This means that effectively there is a different judge for every sitting. The most consistent of these judges is Justice Hannon, who is based in Hobart, but there are also three sittings a year when a fly-in judge from either Sydney or Melbourne will attend. This makes it difficult if a case needs to be heard by the same judge and it makes it difficult for lawyers to build a relationship with the judge's office. Also of concern is the process of hearing urgent and often sensitive matters, particularly those that involve children's issues. There are some link-up facilities in place to ensure these matters are heard in as quick a time frame as possible, but I am sure that most people in this House would agree that this is not an ideal situation when talking about children's matters. 
The government's failure to ensure that Tasmanian families have access to a fair and just legal system is continuing to have a disastrous impact on families, who are having to wait longer than 24 weeks to have their cases heard. The people of Bass were told by the federal government that the Federal Magistrates Service was going to fix that. The government's foresight in setting up this service and their subsequent program of cost cutting in the Family Court to meet budgets have been a farce. The magistrate appointed in Tasmania not only is responsible for Northern Tasmania or even Tasmania but also has to go elsewhere.
The system has once again shown that the Howard government's commitment to Australian families is nothing but empty promises and shameful politics. For many families in Tasmania, the situation of judicial delays has been at crisis point for some time. The government needs to start taking the needs of families across the whole of the country seriously and not just continue to pay lip-service to having appropriate judicial resources.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I would like to add to the debate on this motion and the comments by previous speakers. The establishment of a judicial environment sensitive to and capable of dealing with the evolving needs of modern family life has been one of the most important challenges of all court systems. The Australian government has taken great pride in meeting this challenge, particularly with the establishment in 2000 of the Federal Magistrates Court.
In an era of increasing marriage breakdown, changing parental responsibilities and evolving family structures, the Federal Magistrates Service has proved a model of response. It has offered mediated, non-adversarial legal options to families—things that were hardly imaginable even 10 years ago, let alone at the dawn of Australia's judicial system over a century ago. In its three years of operation, the Federal Magistrates Service has proved to be an outstanding success in providing the average person with a simpler, much more humane, less time-consuming and less intimidating alternative to the superior courts. Importantly, it has done a great deal to relieve the tremendous workload of higher courts. 
The increasing range and volume of cases directed to the Federal Magistrates Service have demonstrated its vital and expanding role within Australia's judicial system. Over one-half of all migration matters and more than 40 per cent of family law and children's and property applications are now completed by the Federal Magistrates Service. But it is in the area of family law that the Federal Magistrates Service has distinguished itself. Approximately 80 per cent of the court's workload is in the area of family law. One of the greatest successes of the Federal Magistrates Service has been its ability to encourage people embarking on family legal disputes to resolve those disputes through primary dispute resolution rather than through the traditional, much more stressful, adversarial and damaging arena of the higher courts, which all too often become weapons of revenge rather than forums of resolution and conciliation.
The Federal Magistrates Service, through its mediation capabilities, is able to call on a range of means to resolve disputes in order to avoid contested hearings. It has helped to usher in a new era of conciliation, counselling and mediation within our judicial system and it has greatly benefited those using it. The court uses community based counselling and mediation services as well as the increased existing counselling and mediation services of the Family Court and Federal Court, providing a choice that is as wide as possible for clients of the court. The Federal Magistrates Service is currently dealing with about 36 per cent of applications for final orders in family law matters. The Federal Magistrates Service is making a significant contribution to the effective operation of family law in Australia, providing families with a greater range of options for resolving their legal problems as quickly and as cheaply as possible.
The federal government is to be applauded for further extending the benefits of the Federal Magistrates Service with the appointment of two new federal magistrates. In the 2003-04 budget the government allocated funding to the Federal Magistrates Service for these new federal magistrates. The appointments will honour the government's election commitment to appoint two additional magistrates, and that is a very good thing. They will also conduct circuits in various locations, in both rural and regional communities. The service conducted circuit hearings in 21 locations in 2002-03. The appointment of the new federal magistrates will be of great benefit to those rural and regional areas that we have heard other members speak about today.
At a time of increasing social and economic fallout in rural and regional Australia, the benefit can hardly be overestimated. Every day we read reports of drought, the downturn in rural industries and the erosion of rural communities. It is vital to remember that, at the end of the day, these are not just statistics—they translate into individual and sometimes very tragic human stories. Unfortunately, these things result in regional family breakdown, loss and dislocation. By extending the Federal Magistrates Service into rural and regional areas, the federal government is taking a positive step to reduce this human toll and help with what is happening in rural Australia. In particular, it is helping those involved in Family Court matters such as divorce, property disputes and parenting orders, and I commend the government for it. I think this is a very valuable service. 
The federal government is to be commended for ensuring that 80 per cent of the current workload of the Federal Magistrates Court is in this family law area. It also includes other areas, such as corporate insolvency and less complex intellectual property matters. Currently there are 19 federal magistrates located in capital cities and major regional centres around Australia, so it is a cheaper and more effective way to resolve disputes.

"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I too welcome the opportunity to speak on the member for Ryan's motion concerning the Federal Magistrates Service. I thank the member for Ryan for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. The Federal Magistrates Service was established by the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 and conducted its first hearing in July 2000. The purpose of the court was to relieve some of the workload of the Family Court and the Federal Court and to provide a simple and more accessible alternative to litigation in those courts.
However, the service has not eased pressure on these courts, particularly the Family Court. With cuts in past budgets, pressure on the Family Court grows. In the Canberra Times on 30 October last year, it was reported that the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Alastair Nicholson, said that the Federal Magistrates Service had not reduced the workload of the Family Court but had increased the burden on the staff of the court. The Family Court recently cut from eight to three the number of senior registrars, who are responsible for making interim orders about residence and contact with children ahead of a final hearing. With the cutting of Family Court staff to pay for the Federal Magistrates Service, many interim and urgent matters now have to come before a judge rather than a registrar.
I am sure most members would be contacted fairly often by constituents who are concerned about how the family law system works. I know many constituents who are angry at the delays they experience in resolving family law disputes. People have contacted me because they are concerned about the fact that, once they have filed for orders relating to child or property matters, their file will sit in a pre-trial queue for nine to 12 months before being allocated a hearing date. This, combined with other delays in the process, means that many defended cases will take in excess of two years to come to trial. This can also result in enormous legal bills.
Many members would also be aware that the Family Court has taken some positive steps to help people avoid unnecessary trials and to resolve matters through mediation and other processes. I am most supportive of these measures and am reassured that the court is continuing to develop these alternative approaches. I recently had the opportunity to visit the Newcastle Registry of the Family Court. While I was there I learnt of the enormous amount of casework both the Federal Magistrates Service and the Family Court deal with on a daily basis. It is quite staggering. They do so with a small staff, including Mr Justice Graham Mullane and Federal Magistrate Mr Warren Donald.
I welcomed the announcement in this year's budget of the appointment of an additional federal magistrate in Newcastle. Although the new magistrate is yet to be announced, I do hope the position will assist in relieving some of the burden of work on the Family Court and the current federal magistrate. I have recently been advised that one of the federal magistrates in Parramatta has been seconded to Melbourne, leaving the people on that magistrate's lists in Parramatta without hearings until next year in some cases. This is appalling and adds to the burden on people wanting to resolve their family law disputes. 
While I was at the Newcastle Registry of the Family Court, I was interested to learn that in most final defended cases that come before the court one or more of the parties suffers from depression, a more serious mental illness, a personality disorder, alcoholism or an addiction to another drug or has a disposition to violence, control or other abusive behaviours. Many are legally unrepresented, which places further pressure on court staff—this all takes its toll on the resources of the court—who need to deal with people's difficult circumstances.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—Thirteen days ago I received an unexpected email from my brother who lives in New Jersey. I say that it was unexpected because he usually only contacts me about something of some significance. His email said:
Hi Ace, I have just sent an article from The Courier Mail that I read the other day, I was appalled by the story, having been involved with the island and people for so long we still try to keep up with the news from the area. I knew that things were bad but not that bad. I wonder what a Federal member of parliament, opposition or government thinks when a story like that bounces around the world, isn't it a part of the Governments responsibility to care for the welfare of its citizens regardless of their colour or race, as the expression goes in this country “ someone needs to step up to the plate”.
With the wonders of modern technology, I accessed the Courier Mail. Being from Tasmania I do not get to read it very often. I was appalled to read the article of 30 August 2003 headed `Next stop jail for child'. The article says:
A 13-month-old boy has been sent to jail because there is no safe place for him in his home town.
Mornington Island is so dangerous mothers in fear of their lives inside their houses and even at the women's shelter routinely put their children under street lights in the hope they will be safe.
Every child on Mornington was in urgent need of abuse rehabilitation, local MP and Police Minister Tony McGrady was told at a recent meeting of the Island's Community Justice Group.
Mornington Island, in the Gulf of Carpentaria almost 1900km north of Brisbane, is one of 20 remote indigenous communities crippled by alcohol-fuelled violence.
What has this got to do with my brother? Well, a few years ago he spent 14 years on the island as the person in charge of all the construction and maintenance on the island. He lived there with his wife, Sue, and their four children. He was determined that I should investigate this matter. The article goes on:
The 13-month-old, called Jarvin, was sent to Townsville's Stuart Creek prison on Thursday to share a cell with his mother.
She was jailed in April for 15 months for attacking another islander with a chair.
Jarvin's father is also in jail and his extended family is already overburdened with caring for other children.
Little Jarvin was handed from family to family before the Justice Group decided to send him to join his mother.
The Families Department has not been involved because there has been no dispute over custody. Jarvin briefly stayed with the only accredited foster carers on the island, Michael and Helen Rosser, but they already have 13 children in their three-bedroom house - 10 of them foster children. There is no full-time social worker. 
Lawyer and Justice Group co-ordinator Meg Frisby said island children lived in fear.
“Do Queenslanders know that we have `lamp post children'—
an expression I have never heard before—
children as young as three sleeping under lit areas so that they are not sexually abused or beaten?” she said.
	...	...	...
A Corrective Services spokesman said there were four children in the Stuart Creek prison. They either stayed with their mothers in a larger secure cell or in a special family house in the open custody area. It is understood Jarvin was taken to the family house with access to a playground.
The article goes on to say:
Almost 10 per cent of Mornington Island's population is in jail or on community service orders. As of last week, 28 men and women from Mornington were in Stuart Creek jail. At least 20 other Mornington men were in other prisons. A further 54 were on community work orders.
And here is the bit that really stumped me:
The population of around 1000 spend almost $5 million a year on beer at the council-owned canteen. A staggering 20,000 cans of beer are delivered each week.
Why do I raise this issue, apart from giving my brother some satisfaction that I am a hardworking member of the House of Representatives? I raise it because I was part of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs that produced what is regarded as a blueprint for Indigenous health, and that is Health is life: Report on the inquiry into Indigenous health. The foreword to this report says:
In Aboriginal society there is no word, term or expression for `health' as it is understood in Western society ... The word as it is used in Western society almost defies translation but the nearest translation in an Aboriginal context would probably be a term such as `life is health is life'.
The foreword continues:
The continuing poor state of Indigenous health, and the many efforts of successive governments to address the issue, has seemingly left a nation at a loss to know what to do for the best on this issue. The Committee believes that many of the difficulties come down to these differing world views about health, about how it should be defined and about the sorts of services needed for good health.
We brought down 35 recommendations because the issue is so important. Recommendation 1 says:
The Commonwealth accept it has the major responsibility for the provision of primary health care to Indigenous Australians:
	the Commonwealth must assume responsibility for developing, in collaboration with the States and Territories, an efficient, coordinated and effective mechanism for the delivery of services and programs which impact on the health and well-being of the Indigenous population.
In the first chapter there is a quote from The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, whose submission we received. The report stated:
Mental health and emotional well-being, is another major challenge facing the Indigenous community. It is linked to:
... the loss of loved ones, childhood trauma, alcohol and drug related misery, violence, ongoing racism, stereotyping and discrimination, and the accumulated loss of two hundred and eleven years of cultural destruction and dispossession.
The report goes on to look at the question of how we compare with other countries. It says:
The poor health status of Indigenous Australians stands in stark contrast to that of the Indigenous populations of New Zealand, Canada and the United States. 
All reports are the result of the tireless work of the committees involved. This committee has just released a wonderful report on substance abuse, which took us three years to complete. I note that the member for Blair, Mr Cameron Thompson, who is in the chamber, was part of that inquiry. We expect governments not to shelve these reports or put them away as part of a collection but to work on implementing the recommendations. One of our recommendations was that there should be a capacity for reporting back to the House—not only for this government and this parliament but also for state and territory parliaments, who have joint responsibility for the Indigenous people in their territories and states. This report was brought down three years ago. My brother asked, `Ace, what is happening?' This story is circulating on the Net and going around Australia. We now have a new type of child: a lamppost child.
I do not wish to cast aspersions on the people of Mornington Island—I think I have visited just about every Aboriginal community in my 11 years in this place either as a member of the House of Representatives Committee on Family and Committee Affairs, as deputy chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and as a two-term member of the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Fund. I realise that there are huge problems facing our Indigenous brothers and sisters. But, surely to goodness, we have to look at this issue and come up with some serious recommendations to be implemented right now—not in three or five years down the track. We have Commonwealth and state ministers saying, `It's your responsibility; it's not ours.' We have people, Pontius Pilate like, washing their hands of this issue. Children as young as 13 months old are having to spend time in jail with their mothers because the system is absolutely stuffed. I am appalled and horrified. That is why I have raised this issue in the House today. It is pleasing to note that this is being broadcast around Australia, and I hope that someone somewhere will take up the challenge to address this issue immediately.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Health</title>,Grievance Debate,10,1,speech
"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I move:
That the amendment be agreed to.
This is an amendment to add a new subsection 140I(4). It expressly forbids enforceability of a sponsor's undertaking to pay the costs of the Commonwealth in relation to the location and detention of a person whom that sponsor has sponsored where the amount exceeds an amount or cap prescribed in regulations. It is proposed that regulations will initially prescribe a cap of $10,000. The new subsection (4) provides that the amount of the cap can be changed from time to time, as circumstances require, by amendments to the regulations. This allows flexibility and would enable us to take into account inflation and other factors without the need for another amendment. 
The new subsection (4) makes it clear that the dollar amount of the cap applicable in particular circumstances is the cap prescribed by the regulations at the time the sponsor made the undertaking. Amendments provide that the cap applies in respect of each person a sponsor has sponsored and in respect of whom the sponsor has given the relevant undertaking. In summary, the amendment to the bill will ensure that the liability of sponsors to pay the Commonwealth's costs of locating and detaining a sponsored person will be limited to a specific amount. 
This flowed from a parliamentary report where there were deliberations in relation to the bill. The bill has largely had bipartisan support because it seeks to introduce a range of sponsorship measures which will be important in improving particularly the workings of the temporary business long stay visa class. This is a very beneficial program. Australian businesses have been able to bring more than 20,000 highly skilled people and their families to Australia under this visa class. Major occupations have included nurses and computer professionals as well as accountants and executives.
Despite the handful of well publicised cases, it is a very compliant group. There are few people who breach sponsorship requirements, overstay the visas altogether or work contrary to visa conditions. All sponsors are monitored to ensure that they comply with undertakings given. Twenty per cent of the group are site visited. The government has certainly moved on any areas of noncompliance and referred to other agencies, where appropriate, for investigation matters that might be of concern. Last year we referred 26 cases to other agencies for investigation and, where there was a breach of our requirements, cancelled 234 visas. The regulation changes that were made in 2001 introduced minimum salaries and skill levels and required that employees be made aware of their salary and working conditions. If overseas employees want to change employers, they must apply for a new visa and meet the conditions at that time.
This bill seeks to increase our ability to maintain the integrity of this program and, for the first time, to provide sanctions against sponsors who do not comply with undertakings they have given in relation to employing people under these temporary arrangements. It is designed also to stop abuse. Abuse sometimes occurs in the appeal system where applicants clearly do not meet the threshold requirements of having a sponsor for their stay in Australia. This visa program exemplifies world's best practice in service delivery. The bill, as amended, will keep that standing. The amendment that I have proposed meets the desire of the Senate not to have a punitive level of costs imposed upon those who sponsor. With the regulations prescribing a limit of $10,000, we will be able to see how that works and see whether there are the improvements that we hope will come from it. I commend the amendment to the House.

That the amendment be agreed to.
The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 will amend the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 to do two principal things: to provide for a new Australian National Training Authority agreement and to increase to nine the number of members of the Australian National Training Authority. The bill underpins ongoing funding and development of a world-class vocational education and training sector that supports the competitiveness of our industries and Australia's economic and social development. In 2002 there were around 1.7 million Australians who participated in vocational education and training: more than one in nine working age Australians and more than one in four young people aged 15 to 19. The figure is even higher when you take into account students who undertake VET programs, as they are called, at school. As I advised the House today, there were more than 396,000 new apprentices in training as of 30 June 2003—a significant if not huge increase from 140,000 in 1995. Today, New Apprenticeships are available in more than 500 occupations, including aero skills, electro technology, process manufacturing, information technology, microtechnologies in manufacturing, photonics, nanotechnology and telecommunications.
In the other place, concerns were raised that the removal of the ANTA agreement from the schedule might deny the parliament the opportunity to scrutinise the ANTA agreement. This is plainly false, as I had undertaken to table the agreement when it was concluded. Nevertheless, two amendments have been proposed to require the agreement or any amendment to it to be tabled within 15 sitting days of the agreement's conclusion and to cause the agreement to be published on the ANTA web site within the same period. The government agrees to these amendments. This bill will provide for the ongoing development and continuing successful operation of Australia's world-class vocational education and training system.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I, too, rise to support the amendment that has been made in the Senate, which will ensure not only that any new ANTA agreement and any amendment to the agreement would come before the House within 15 sitting days of the agreement being made between the Commonwealth, states and territories but also that it is published on the Internet. We considered the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 in conjunction with the VET funding bill. While the Minister for Education, Science and Training is in a conciliatory mood and supporting this Senate amendment, he will have an opportunity to also support the position taken by the Australian Labor Party on what should happen to the Australian National Training Authority—that is, there is a need in the new agreement for growth funding. 
If the minister is going to have credibility in coming into this House and criticising state and territory governments for ensuring that their books are balanced, then he needs to be part of a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth, states and territories in negotiating the new ANTA agreement. He will have an opportunity at the Gold Coast MINCO meeting in a couple of months to put his money where his mouth is. Before going to dinner at Jupiters Casino, the minister will have an opportunity to roll the dice in favour of young Australians—and in favour also of mature age Australians, who are participating more and more in the vocational education and training sector.
This is an extremely important sector of the economy. It is important for individuals who participate in vocational education and training in schools, in TAFEs and through group training organisations and other parts of the sector in that it enables them to fully participate in society and realise the positive benefits that education and training give, and it is also important for us as a nation and as an economy. The expansion of vocational education and training benefits our economy and means that we can move forward as a high-wage, high-skills economy. The alternative is competing with our neighbours in a race to the bottom. Some would like to see their approach to labour market deregulation produce that result.
I commend the fact that the minister has been conciliatory in accepting the amendment from that dreaded place across the other side and that we can all agree on this Senate amendment. However, I call upon the minister to have the same enlightened approach towards negotiating the ANTA agreement if his rhetoric is to become more than just that and is to result in the states and territories delivering an expanded service. More and more we see the dollars per student simply becoming fewer and fewer due to pressure on the system, which is why we need growth funding in the new ANTA agreement. I commend the bill to the House. I also take the opportunity to commend all those from the top down—from the ANTA board, which will see an expansion due to this bill, to all the TAFE teachers throughout Australia—who work beyond the call of duty and do many hours of unpaid work due to their commitment to deliver services for Australians.

"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
The purpose of this bill is to amend the human quarantine provisions of the Quarantine Act 1908. 
The Quarantine Act 1908 (the act) and its subordinate legislation provide the legislative basis for human, plant and animal quarantine activities in Australia. The human provisions of theQuarantine Act 1908 deal specifically with a small group of `quarantinable diseases'—plague, cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, rabies, viral haemorrhagic fevers and, more recently, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) administers the legislation for plant and animal quarantine entirely and, for human quarantine, on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing.  
Australia's quarantine policy is based on the concept of the management of risk to an acceptably low level. In these times of enormous international movement of goods and persons through migration, business travel and tourism, the risk to the Australian population posed by the importation of communicable diseases, including quarantinable diseases, has increased greatly. 
The recent outbreak of SARS and the potential for other new and emerging disease threats highlight the importance of border protection measures as an essential first line of defence against the transmission of disease.
In 1997, the human quarantine provisions of the act were reviewed in accordance with national competition policy requirements.
 Following the recommendations of the final report of the National Competition Policy Review, the Department of Health and Aged Care undertook a review of the human quarantine provisions of the act in the year 2000, to investigate the adequacy of existing provisions for protecting and promoting public health, and with a view to updating and improving the legislative framework for human quarantine activities in Australia. 
In December 2000, the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, approved the final reportof the Human Quarantine Legislation Review. The report recommended a two-stage response to the review's findings.
This bill has been developed in response to the stage 1 recommendation of the final report. The bill introduces a number of amendments and new provisions to ensure the act is comprehensive yet flexible in its approach to border control measures. 
These are minor and technical amendments to better align some of the existing provisions with current policy and practice regarding human quarantine control measures. 
The amendments:
	incorporate a new right for people who have been ordered into quarantine to request an independent medical assessment;
	support the current policy of granting pratique by exception for international aircraft except where specified circumstances exist;
	allow for vector control activities to be undertaken, or ordered, within the entire bound-ary of a port as well as in a 400 metre surrounding buffer zone, with a penalty for non-compliance consistent with other penalty provisions in the Quarantine Act;
	ensure that quarantine signals apply to sea vessels only and not to aircraft;
	provide that costs relating to human quarantine may be recovered from the master, owner or agent of a quarantined vessel consistent with other similar provisions in the Quarantine Act;
	ensure that individuals are not liable for the costs of food or medicine relating to human quarantine; and
	remove the outdated references to `division or divisions' of quarantine. 
The act currently makes no provision for a person who has been ordered into quarantine to obtain an independent medical assessment of their condition. Pursuant to the amendments in this bill, a person ordered into quarantine who is, or is likely to be, suffering from a disease, may seek an independent medical assessment of their condition from a medical practitioner of their choice. They must be informed of this right, and may seek to exercise it at any time after being ordered into quarantine. Such a request may be invoked again after a lapse of 72 hours but not before. This new procedure aims to balance the interests of the individual against the public health risks to the wider community. 
A new section is inserted into the act, to enable pratique to be granted automatically in relation to the arrival of overseas aircraft, unless specified circumstances exist. Pratique is a term used to refer to the health clearance of a vessel—whether a ship or an overseas aircraft, or an installation, by a quarantine officer. 
In relation to incoming overseas aircraft this risk management approach is addressed by enabling pratique to be automatically granted in appropriate circumstances. Circumstances in which pratique will not be automatically granted include: 
	if the commander of an aircraft has notified a quarantine officer of the presence of a prescribed symptom or an outbreak on board; or 
	a quarantine officer is not satisfied that an aircraft is free from infection. 
The Director of Human Quarantine, who is also the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, can also give a direction, before an aircraft arrives, that pratique will not be granted automatically on arrival, so that appropriate precautions can be taken commensurate with the perceived level of risk. The recent SARS outbreak provides an example of circumstances where the Director of Human Quarantine may decide to give such a direction, for example, in relation to aircraft arrivals from specified countries which pose a higher level of disease threat.
A new part on vector monitoring and control activities is inserted into the act to provide for the carrying out of vector control measures. The objective is to prevent the introduction, spread and establishment of exotic diseases and their vectors so that any threat to public health resulting from a vector incursion is minimised or removed entirely. This provides for vector monitoring and control activities to be undertaken within a port, and within a permissible distance—currently 400 metres—from the boundary of a port, or from a place at which a vessel has landed, or is moored or berthed. 
Provisions are also inserted to provide greater flexibility in relation to vector control activities carried out on private property to ensure that a vector has not spread onto, or is not likely to become established on, the property. This part also provides for a new offence of failing to comply with a direction given by a quarantine officer to carry out vector control measures on the property.
A quarantine officer will be able to enter property, including private property, to conduct vector monitoring and control activities with consent, or in an emergency, or under the terms of a warrant.
In order to remove inconsistency and ambiguity, this bill inserts several new definitions into the act. The definition of `vector' is inserted to ensure that a consistent description applies throughout the act. The definition of `proclaimed place' is repealed and replaced with a definition of `declared place'. This modernises the administration of the act by allowing the minister to declare any place in or beyond Australia infected, or in danger of being infected, by a quarantinable disease or pest. 
Other amendments in this bill include: 
	the removal of all references to `a division' or `divisions' of quarantine; 
	provision that persons released under quarantine surveillance cannot be apprehended; and 
	clarification that a person can be made subject to quarantine on the basis of a quarantine officer's `reasonable suspicion' that a person has been infected or exposed to a quarantinable disease or pest. 
This addresses an anomaly, in that a person can be `ordered' into quarantine on various grounds, including:
	a quarantine officer's opinion that the person is, or `is likely to be', infected with a quarantinable disease, or  
	that a person or persons are suffering or `suspected' to be suffering from a communicable disease. 
However, there is no equivalent provision under section 18 in relation to persons being subject to quarantine. This corrects that anomaly, and moreover, requires that the suspicion be reasonable.
These amendments address a number of technical issues to improve the operation of this longstanding piece of legislation. The Quarantine Act has served Australia well to protect human health over the last century, and with these amendments will continue to do so. 
The recent international outbreak of the SARS virus has also highlighted the need for a continued strategic approach to health protection to address issues surrounding contemporary disease preparedness, governance and response. In implementing the stage 2 recommendations of thehuman quarantine legislation review, the department will consider these issues, including options for administrative review and cost recovery where appropriate.
I commend this bill to the parliament and present the signed explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (HEALTH) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the second reading debate on the Quarantine Amendment (Health) Bill 2003. Quarantine is one of the federal government's oldest and most important responsibilities. It is a responsibility in relation to human health that lies within the health portfolio, and it is, in fact, one of the original reasons why we have a health portfolio. The bill amends the Quarantine Act 1908, which provides the legislative basis for human, plant and animal quarantine activities in Australia. The amendments are designed to ensure that Australia's quarantine laws with regard to public health reflect the modern scope and focus of our quarantine arrangements.
There are several measures contained in this bill. The first relates to pratique for aircraft entering Australia. Pratique is a term used to refer to the clearance of an installation or vessel, whether a ship or aircraft, by a quarantine officer. Historically the master or commander of every vessel was required to undergo pratique, but the sheer number of aircraft entering Australia every day through modern airports makes this quite impractical. Current practice is for aircraft to undergo pratique on an exception basis. The bill makes provision for this practice by allowing pratique to be granted automatically unless specified circumstances, such as an outbreak of disease on board the aircraft, give reason to act otherwise. This is an important change to the act, providing a legislative framework that supports good quarantine practices while acknowledging the realities of modern international airports.
Second, under the current provisions of the Quarantine Act, a person detained for quarantine has no right of medical or administrative review of their detention. Under new section 35C of the bill, a person ordered into quarantine who is, or is likely to be, suffering from a disease will now have the right to an independent medical assessment of their condition by a practitioner of their choice. This review can take place at any time and the person must be informed of that right. After a lapse of 72 hours, the person can request another medical review to ensure the quarantine is still justified. 
Third, a new part, VAA, is inserted into the act to provide for vector monitoring and control measures. Vector is a term used to describe the means by which disease travels in the environment, for example, through mosquitos or rats. The objective of vector control is to prevent the introduction, spread and/or establishment of foreign diseases and their vectors so that any threat to public health is minimised or removed entirely. The need to control and monitor disease vectors is quite apparent, and the incorporation of these details into the act is an excellent step forward to acknowledge and support the hard work already done by quarantine and public health officers around the country. 
A new section 55B provides for these activities—for example, the search for mosquitos and their breeding grounds—to be undertaken both within a port, including an airport, and within a reasonable distance from the boundary of a port or from a place at which a vessel is moored. These activities currently take place with the cooperation of the owners and/or operators of a port and the surrounding land, which is often owned by federal, state or local government. Section 55C of the bill will now allow quarantine officers to also conduct these activities on private property. Although I must acknowledge that the owners of private property are generally very cooperative, quarantine officers have not previously had any formal right of access. They will now have the right of access with the consent of the owner or, in an emergency, under the terms of a warrant.
In addition to these major components of the bill, there are several smaller administrative improvements. Currently the act provides for the Governor-General to proclaim particular places of origin as potential sources of infection. The bill will instead allow the minister to declare potential sources of infection, allowing the process to happen more efficiently and more quickly. Currently, a person must be infected with a disease in order to be quarantined. This bill allows a person to be quarantined on reasonable suspicion of infection or exposure. This acknowledges the reality that quarantine officers and others involved in the quarantine process are not medically qualified for conclusive diagnosis in airport terminals. This measure will allow easier administration of quarantine for diseases such as SARS, which spread rapidly and are not easy for anyone to conclusively diagnose, including medical practitioners—let alone quarantine officers on the spot, faced with potentially the outbreak of a new international disease. 
The master of any vessel is currently required to display quarantine signals if an outbreak of disease has occurred. This is of course impractical on modern aircraft, and the bill will allow notification of the outbreak to a quarantine officer by radio or other communication instead. The current act has no provision for people who are released from quarantine but who are still subject to surveillance—for example, people with suspected exposure to SARS who could be released to their own homes. This scenario will now be provided for.
Because the measures in the bill are measures which the opposition support and which I believe can be clearly seen as necessary additions to our quarantine arrangements, the opposition are supporting this bill and have cooperated with the government, dealing with it in an expedited way. The measures are, in the opposition's view, commendable and Labor are pleased to be able to support the work of our quarantine officers by supporting this bill. Whilst we have determined to support the bill and to cooperate with it being dealt with on an expedited basis, I must however take this opportunity to raise some concerns with the manner in which this bill has ended up before the House today.
The bill arises from a review of the human quarantine provisions of the Quarantine Act conducted in 1997, in accordance with the national competition policy requirements. I have no doubt that the review was well conducted, overseen by a steering committee, including representatives from AQIS and from Commonwealth agencies, and chaired by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer. A publicly available discussion paper and an independent consultant's report informed the review. Yet, I cannot help but wonder why it has taken six years to progress from this review to the implementation of its recommendations and why, after such a lengthy delay, the Howard government all of a sudden is rushing the bill to parliament and, in fact, several weeks ago requested that Labor support an exemption from the Senate cut-off without, at that stage, having even had the courtesy to show us a copy of the bill. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, it is not possible for any member of parliament or any political party to make a reasonable judgment about the merits of a bill without at least a copy of the bill and, hopefully, an explanatory memorandum. 
I am sure that the SARS epidemic, which caused such turmoil internationally and which put a great deal of pressure on our quarantine services in Australia, had a lot to do with pushing these changes forward. I must take the opportunity to congratulate our quarantine service, our airlines and our public health and medical work force for their excellent response to this epidemic. Even so, the best part of a year has elapsed since the epidemic first took hold, and it is only now that we are implementing changes which might have supported our quarantine services at the time. 
In addition to this needless delay, Labor has one other significant matter of concern in relation to this bill. As a matter of course, when dealing with legislation affecting the airline industry, Labor ensures that the industry is consulted. The office of the member for Batman, as shadow minister for transport, contacted Qantas, as Australia's only international airline, to ensure that the practical aspects of this bill were appropriate and workable. When the member for Batman's staff made contact with the airline they discovered, much to their surprise, that Qantas had not been consulted about the wording of the bill at all. In fact, it had not been contacted by the government in relation to these matters since 2000. I would have thought that we all would have been concerned about this level of consultation. Three-year-old consultation is not an acceptable level of involvement if the Howard government is serious about ensuring the workability of the Quarantine Act.
I make the point very clearly: Qantas would not have known this bill was here or been advised of its contents if it had not been for actions taken by the Labor opposition, and specifically the member for Batman in his capacity as shadow minister for transport. It was Labor's internal processes, conveying the bill to the member for Batman and seeking his opinion and him then going through the usual procedures for contacting industry, that ensured Qantas was aware that this bill was coming before the parliament and of the provisions within the bill. When one looks at the disparity of resources between the government and the opposition, and where I would have said the burden for undertaking such consultation should have lain, it is fair to say that that is something that the government ought to have done. They left it unattended and, consequently, it fell to the opposition to do it. It is not that the opposition resents doing such work, but it really is not appropriate practice for a bill affecting our international airline and carrier, Qantas, to come before this parliament without the minister or her staff, or relevant departmental officials on her instruction, making contact with the relevant major industry player.
When we engaged in that consultation, Qantas indicated that it had a number of concerns about the interpretation of the bill. Fortunately Labor acted as an intermediary with the government and, as a result of Labor transmitting information back and forth between Qantas and the government, the advice we have now received is that the issues that were initially of concern to Qantas have actually been resolved. This should never have been a necessary part of the process. It seems to me that three-year-old consultation—consultation in the year 2000—obviously needed updating. We are all aware of major shake-outs in the airline industry in the intervening three years and, as the bill has a direct impact on the airline industry, it was appropriate to consult with Qantas and any other airline affected to ensure this was going to be part of a cooperative approach to quarantine. It should not be up to the opposition to ensure that the government involves all the stakeholders in this process. 
Labor regrets that in this case the Howard government could not place more priority on implementing changes they have known for six years were necessary, even in the face of a public health crisis such as the SARS epidemic. We also regret that the government has taken such a slipshod approach to industry consultation. Nevertheless, as I indicated at the outset, this legislation is a positive step towards an even better quarantine system. Labor is pleased to support it and to facilitate its expedited passage through the parliament. Both sides of the parliament, as well as the quarantine service, the public health sector and the transport industry must work together to ensure the best possible protection for Australians and Australian industry.",REPS,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (HEALTH) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—in reply—I take this opportunity to thank the opposition for their support of this important legislation. In doing so, I will not take up the time of the House in going over old ground as far as summary is concerned. However, I would like to say a couple of things about the consultation process given the fact that this was raised by the shadow minister. During the course of the review, broad public consultation was undertaken and the department has worked extensively with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, or AQIS. The human quarantine legislation review was overseen by a steering committee, chaired by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and including representatives from AQIS, the Department of Defence, Australian Customs Service, the department of immigration and multicultural affairs, and a representative of the states and territories chief quarantine officers. The bill has been developed in close consultation with AQIS, which administers the human quarantine provisions of the legislation on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing. The shadow minister might be interested to know that Qantas did actually lodge a submission to the original review agreeing to the final recommendations of the discussion paper. I commend the bill to the House.

"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2003-09-15,"—I rise to speak on the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003. This bill is a result of the government's commitment, made in April of this year, to ensure that fuels are properly labelled and offences under the act are properly enforced. It follows on from the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, which established a national regulatory regime for fuel quality, backed up by comprehensive monitoring and an enforcement regime that is among the best in the world.
The bill establishes a comprehensive and transparent system of labelling. It will be used in the first instance to establish the parameters that will apply at the point of sale of ethanol-blended fuels. This will be an important element in restoring public confidence in ethanol—confidence that has been seriously damaged by the actions of the oil companies and motoring organisations, such as the Australian Automobile Association. In this they have been aided and abetted by the Australian Labor Party and some sections of the media. I will return to the matter of ethanol later in my address.
The amendments contained in this bill will enable the responsible minister to set a fuel quality information standard whenever this is in the public interest. This can be used, for example, to label biodiesel blends when these become available. The bill also introduces strict liability for key offences under the act. This is to ensure that convictions can be obtained. It will not be possible, as it was under the previous act, for a defendant to simply claim that they were not aware of the requirements of the act. Ignorance will no longer be a defence. This bill confirms the government's commitment to uniform enforceable national fuel standards that will enable consumers to be confident about the fuel they are buying. It is a sensible measure that both sides of the House should support.
I would now like to return to the issue of ethanol. I had the opportunity recently to see the ethanol industry in the United States. Ethanol has a very different place in the minds of the American motoring public and its supporters there from the place it unfortunately has here in Australia. I visited the Minnesota Department of Agriculture and received a great deal of their material, including a brochure entitled Questions and answers about ethanol, which they distribute freely to motorists in the great state of Minnesota—and I was very pleased to drive there, despite the fact that you have to drive on the wrong side of the road. In Minnesota all motorists use a 10 per cent ethanol blend. That is all you can buy—a 10 per cent ethanol blend; there is no plain gasoline available in Minnesota. It is the same in many other states, but Minnesota takes the lead. 
The Minnesotans are so keen on ethanol that they are now producing E85, which is an ethanol blend of 85 per cent ethanol and 15 per cent gasoline. They are so proud of this that a leaflet I have here with me says:
Never buy gasoline again! E85. Renewable—American-Made ... Less-Polluting.
It lists the 86 service stations in Minnesota that sell E85. They also have a list of all the vehicles that can run on E85, known as flexible fuel vehicles. Under Ford, for instance, Explorers, Tauruses, sedans and wagons, Ranger pick-ups and Taurus sedans are all listed as being able to drive on E85. Under Daimler Chrysler, it lists Dodge Rams, Chrysler Sebring sedans, Dodge Stratus sedans, Dodge Caravan cargo vans, Caravans, Voyagers and Town and Country vehicles—all Daimler Chrysler. General Motors have Tahoes, Ukons, Ukon XLs and some of their Sierras and Silverados, Chevvies, Sonomas and Suburbans. Isuzu has a range of Hombres, Mazda has the Mazda B3000 and Mercedes has the C320 series. Mercury also has selected vehicles that drive on E85. So in Minnesota not only are they all happy to drive on E10 but they are now starting to drive on E85—no worries about ethanol over there. In the brochure Questions and answers about ethanol, one of the questions asked is:
Will the use of ethanol void my car's warranty?
This is a very topical issue, with the scare campaigns that the Australian Automobile Association has been running. The answer reads:
Certainly not! When the use of ethanol began in 1979, most automobile manufacturers did not even address alcohol fuels. As soon as each manufacturer tested their vehicles, they approved the use of a 10% ethanol blend. Today, all manufacturers approve the use of ethanol, and some even recommend ethanol use for environmental reasons.
A further question is:
Why do some mechanics say not to use ethanol?
The answer is:
A mechanic who says not to use ethanol does not have correct information.
It then goes into that information, which I will not share with the House tonight. Another question asks whether ethanol use reduces exhaust emissions. The answer reads:
Ethanol contains oxygen, so it contributes to a cleaner, more efficient burn of the gasoline with less CO and other toxic chemicals in the exhaust emissions. Ethanol is a simple chemical which, when burned, does not produce all the complex pollutants and aromatics formed by the many different chemicals contained in gasoline.
Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, I know you have quite a scientific interest, and that is a debate we have not yet had in Australia—the health benefits of using alcohol-blended fuels. Further brochures put out in Minnesota are Breathe easy: small engines run great on ethanol, and Breathe easy: snowmobiles run great on ethanol. And so it goes on.
They do not have any problem with ethanol over there. In fact, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture told me they had set up a hotline for complaints about ethanol. Certainly, for the first few years, they received quite a number of complaints. They would thoroughly check them—they would send out a team to take a sample of the fuel in the vehicle to assess the vehicle. They found that not one complaint related to ethanol, which was pretty much what we found in the complaints about engine damage recently in Sydney. It transpired, when we addressed the Sydney Morning Herald's articles, that the contamination had been from kerosene. That was not mentioned in the articles. In Minnesota they found over time, as ethanol became accepted, that there was no substance to the complaints. They properly investigated them, found they had no substance and reassured motorists. That complaints hotline is still there, but it is rarely used. 
I would like to deal again with Minnesota. They sold the idea to the farmers in Minnesota on the basis that ethanol and the Minnesota model would be of assistance to farmers and the wider community. They said farmers could wait for the next government-induced subsidy or they could take charge of their own destiny. In Minnesota, they sure did. The great bulk of ethanol distilleries in Minnesota are farmer owned. They are what they call new generation cooperatives, whereby some of the townsfolk have shares in the distillery as well. Minnesota produces in excess of 300 million gallons of ethanol. As I said, there are 14 plants, of which 12 are new generation cooperatives, with three more under construction.
What did it do for the state of Minnesota? Driving around, there is no doubt of the prosperity in those little towns. You drive through and there are restaurants up the main street and everything is beautifully painted and brand spanking new. There are lots of late model vehicles and people have an air of prosperity and confidence. Why wouldn't they? In building those distilleries there was $555 million in direct investment creating jobs. It adds every year to the annual state GDP, from $29 million in 1990 to $588 million a year now. It directly creates 2,562 jobs, and indirect jobs flow on from there. So why wouldn't Minnesota look like a prosperous, busy, bustling little state?
They do get support. They get financial support from the government—$36 million a year from their state government. What a pity our state government in Queensland was not likewise inclined to create jobs and opportunities in Queensland. That support is being reduced now, as ethanol has become accepted and popular, and it will be reduced to $20 million this year. But the most important factor in Minnesota's case was the state mandate of a 10 per cent ethanol blend. I believe that in time the government will move to that—when we can reassure the public, again, that they can have confidence in blended fuels and, of course, that ethanol can be produced with no subsidy. I think we can move to that in this country. We cannot live in a 20th century fossil fuel age. Unfortunately, the opposition—the Australian Labor Party—love fossilised ideas and fossil fuels, but we in the coalition are prepared to move forward into a carbohydrate fuel age, which has many benefits. It provides a benefit for motorists, a benefit for the environment and a benefit in terms of jobs and opportunities.
In Minnesota the impact on the farmers has been substantial, and there is a flow-on to their communities. First of all, it has stabilised corn prices. As we know, many commodity prices are very unstable; they fluctuate greatly with world prices. But over there when the corn prices are low, because they supply their corn to the distillery and the feedstock is at a low price they get a good dividend from their ethanol sales. When corn prices are high, naturally there is less to make from the dividend from ethanol but, of course, you have got a high corn price, which is something of a solace, I have to say. Mind you, the farmers there told me that they were not often worried by high corn prices—that was not a significant problem for them, if I could term it that way.
Minnesota saw the future 15 years ago. They set oxygenate standards through legislation and they set fuel standards—which, of course, are contained in this very sensible piece of legislation. They mandated, and now they are reaping the benefits of that. The Minnesota model provides a great model for us. But in speaking to them over there I was amazed at the fact that they faced the same obstructions in those early days that we are facing here. They had the scare campaigns about engine damage and dealt with that with a hotline. Likewise, we in Australia will have to deal with that scare campaign. They had opposition from the oil companies; they had arguments about whether in fact the fuel was greenhouse gas efficient. But they focused on getting a coalition of support and actively pursuing scientific research.  
I would like to share some of that research with the House tonight. Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, with your scientific background you would be most interested in the net energy value of ethanol, which is one of the very significant issues—that is the energy content of ethanol minus the fossil energy used to produce the ethanol. The latest studies out of Minnesota are done by Shapouri, Duffield and Wang. We will have to duplicate these studies in Australia, naturally enough, and in fact we trust the results will be out in the next few weeks. Those Minnesota studies show that the net energy value now is 21,105 British thermal units positive per gallon. That is a very good result and shows that ethanol is a modern fuel that takes something like low-grade coal and a natural biomass and produces a valuable, renewable, liquid fuel. It is a plus-plus.
In the time left to me I would like to speak about the scare campaign that we have had here. It is quite a disgraceful one. The Deputy Prime Minister has set up an ethanol working group, which is a very good initiative to draw together distillers, oil companies and other stakeholders in what we trust will be an ethanol industry in Australia. There was a leaked document from that group. It asserted that up to 10 million cars in Australia would not be able to use E10. I actually got information from the United States on all of those cars and their manufacturers, and I have in fact written to every car manufacturer and importer in Australia. I have not yet sent the letters; they were only completed this afternoon. Let me give you an example of the anomaly that exists between the quality of vehicle manufactured in Australia and the quality of vehicle manufactured in the US. I have written to the president of the Ford Motor Company in Australia as follows—and I do apologise for his not having received this letter first but, as I said, unfortunately the correspondence could not be completed and sent in time for tonight's address; I will certainly ensure that each of these motor companies receives their correspondence:
Dear Sir 
I write to request your assistance to resolve an apparent anomaly regarding the quality of vehicle manufactured for the Australian market compared to those manufactured for the US market, specifically with regard to their ability to operate successfully on E10 or 10 per cent ethanol fuel blends. In the information supplied by your company to the Ethanol Confidence Building Working Group convened by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, it states: Ford: all Falcon petrol vehicles since 1998 will operate satisfactorily on E10. Please contact the Ford call centre for information on other Ford vehicles.
This is at odds with the information that Ford supplied to the American magazine Changes in Gasoline 2, available from Downstream Alternatives in Bremen, Indianapolis. In chapter 5, the auto manufacturers fuel recommendations state that every major auto manufacturer should include the use of 10 per cent ethanol blends under warranty coverage. Page 26, under the Ford Motor Company's details, states:
Your vehicle should operate normally if you use blends that contain no more than 10 per cent ethanol such as gasohol.
In the United States there is no warning to motorists; there is no concern. So my question is: why are Australian motorists being given an inferior vehicle in Australia not only from Ford but from others, when in the United States American motorists have the option of choosing their fuel blend and their vehicle? To be fair to Ford, the Service Station Association of Australia have undertaken a non-technical study of ethanol blended fuels, all at 10 per cent, using a Ford Fairmont sedan which has travelled 94,400 kilometres on E10. The report says: 
... only minor panel repair, no mechanical repairs or non-routine maintenance at this time.
Similarly, a Ford XLS ute, an AU11 series, has travelled 161,000 kilometres on E10 and again the report states as follows:
... no mechanical repairs or non-routine maintenance at this time.
I have said to the president of Ford that these results are very impressive, and I commend his company on the results achieved by its vehicles. But the anomaly still remains: why have Ford and other vehicle manufacturers allowed there to be a perception—and it may only be a perception; after all, this is a leaked report, and I have great faith in our Australian vehicle manufacturers and importers—that Australian vehicles are of a lesser standard than American vehicles? I know that the member for Leichhardt would be enthusiastically supporting the ethanol trial in Cairns, which interestingly enough has raised the market share of Caltex. We are delighted to hear that Caltex are doing well out of an ethanol blend. Long may they continue, we trust, to profit from ethanol blends! The National Party believe that motorists in Australia should have choice in their fuel blends, as American motorists do. We would encourage those car manufacturers and importers, which have sound reputations generally, to see that they can promote consumer confidence in E10 by offering vehicles that give this choice.
I encourage the Australian Labor Party to join the 21st century, like the coalition, and to embrace a 21st century fuel and a carbohydrate based fuel industry—certainly starting with E10 blends. It is good for the motorists, who know that they are driving to work using not imported fuels but perhaps the grain, sugar cane or whatever biomass it is from a paddock not far from their town. This is good for the environment—a 10 per cent ethanol blend is said to reduce, following United States studies, greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 per cent. That is a very positive outcome. So we have a win, win, win. It is not often you get that, but out of an ethanol blended fuel there can be a very positive win for the motorist, a win for the environment and a win for rural and regional jobs and prosperity in regional communities.",REPS,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2003-09-15,"—I strongly endorse the remarks of the member for Dawson. That is the same line I have taken in the northern media—I do not know whether we get as much coverage as I would like. But yes, Australian motor cars are so deficient in their manufacturing that they cannot take an ethanol blend. There are three problems in relation to ethanol that could be argued: first, there is the hydroscopic problem—it absorbs water; second, it is permeable and will pass through a membrane that petrol will not pass through; and, third, it contains oxygen, which of course is the reason we want to use it. You cannot have your cake and eat it too! But if oxygen is permeating throughout the petrol, when the explosion occurs all of the hydrocarbons can access that oxygen. In a normal motor it is only the surface area of the petrol that can access the oxygen and you get an imperfect burn, which is the problem that prompted remarks on health made by the honourable member for Dawson.
Having said that, I cannot help but comment that the current government has not implemented ethanol use; the current government has abolished it. If I could see an exercise in hypocrisy it would be the National Party standing up and saying that they secured assistance. The honourable member sitting at the table here has on many occasions referred—I am sure my saying this will embarrass him—to the hypocrisy of the people representing the National Party. They come in here and say that they represent rural Australia. They said that they secured a subsidy in the recent elections which is a great help to the ethanol industry. The ethanol industry had, until the last budget, a 38c a litre advantage over petrol. After the budget, its advantage was to be phased out completely over the next seven or eight years. So instead of the assertion made by this political party that they helped, in actual fact they sat at the cabinet table that abolished all assistance. 
We have seen the hypocrisy of the people on my right-hand side in continuously attacking this and moving an amendment to this bill which they should be absolutely ashamed of. They were the people who thought ethanol was so good that they did not levy an excise and who added a bounty to ethanol. They were the people who did that—good on them; terrific stuff; a new industry for Australia. Manildra was in fact created by the people sitting on my right-hand side, not those on my left-hand side. Understand that the industry is being abolished by the current government. But, having said that, I again endorse the remarks, on another level, by the previous speaker.
The first story we heard came from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss. Of all the people who should not have carried this message, he definitely should not have carried this message. He issued a press statement saying that there were problems with mixing and it would have to go back to the oil companies to be mixed and this would create great difficulties. I attended a seminar on ethanol. The lecturer at the seminar said, `Mixing ethanol with petrol is very complicated—very, very complicated indeed!' and he poured one beaker into another and it was mixed. Everybody knows how it is done. Even someone with the smallest amount of scientific knowledge knows that it diffuses immediately throughout the petrol. One of the problems is that it is so permeable it diffuses. Everyone at the seminar roared with laughter, because they already knew that.
This minister in the government is so lacking in intellectual understanding of what he is talking about and so irresponsible as to make a statement damaging this industry. Where did he get that information from? I suspect he got it from the same place that the RACQ, the Australian Automobile Association and all the other people who continuously put these furphies out are getting their information from—and we all know where that is.
The next thing that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said, in a personal attack on me for advocating ethanol, was that I was a fool and that, in actual fact, it would only result in ethanol coming in from Brazil. So I immediately went to press and said: `Of course the ethanol is going to come in from Brazil. There is a 38c a litre advantage for ethanol over petrol. As sure as the sun rises, ethanol is going to come in from Brazil.' We have always said that we need an environmental rebate. If we are going down the environmental road, there should be some sort of reward for the risk takers—whether they be the farmers, the processors, the sugar mills or the people in the wheat industry. Of course, that would have the effect—incidentally, not intentionally—of keeping the Brazilian ethanol out.
Surprise, surprise, the Brazilian ethanol came in a few months ago. Of course, when we asked for a rebate for the people of the wheat and sugar industries, we got completely ignored. But, when `Mr Manildra' asks for it for his personal advantage, we suddenly get action from the government. It is a pity the minister—who was saying to me that Brazilian ethanol would come in—did not get off his backside and do something about stopping Brazilian ethanol from coming in. If he had acted when we had asked him to act, the government would not be in the deeply embarrassing situation that they are in at the present moment. The minister sitting at the table was one of the people who advised the government on the dairy industry. If his advice, and the advice of the honourable member for Page, Mr Causley, had been taken, we would not have had the problem that arose in the dairy industry—most certainly not the political problem for the government; we may have even been able to forestall it. 
The same people who are advising the minister and the Australian Automobile Association then came out with another story: that there is considerably less power in ethanol. Of course there is, because it is 30 per cent oxygen; it does not contain the hydrogen which provides the power. I do not know—does anyone do any research or have any scientific understanding before they shoot their mouths off? Of course it has less power. But the reason that it is being used is that it has oxygen in it—because it oxygenates the petrol. So when you allow for the oxygenation effect, there is a marginal loss of power—about two per cent or something like that. But that was not the contention put forward by certain people on the front bench here and by spokesmen for certain other interests.
The final story we have heard is that ethanol will wreck motors. I am going to read out a number of propositions. One of them is from the United States. Eight or nine months ago—I cannot remember the exact date—the United States Senate moved, in an overwhelming vote of 69 to 27, or something of that nature, across party lines, to introduce a 10 per cent ethanol blend by the year 2010. We can assume that the United States Senate has decided to wreck 40 million cars in the United States, or we can assume that the statements made by the Australian Automobile Association and the car manufacturers in Australia are a load of imbecilic rubbish—but there is no in between. The United States Senate moved to implement a 10 per cent ethanol blend, in a vote of, I think, 69 to 27; it was overwhelming. The 27 votes against were only on a minor point. It actual fact, it was almost a unanimous decision on the substantive motion.
Do you think that an august body like the United States Senate would move to implement a 10 per cent ethanol blend when, according to the leaked Australian report, that could put some 30 million cars off the road in the United States? Do they seriously think that the United States Senate would put 30 million cars off the road? So we are looking at another load of rubbish. It may come as a great surprise to the Australian Automobile Association, the oil companies and the motor manufacturers, who have been so stupid in their statements, to know that 22 per cent is the minimum level of ethanol used in petrol in Brazil. Brazil is a poor country. Do you think every motor car in Brazil has been modified to the tune of hundreds or thousands of dollars to suit the government of Brazil? Not likely.
Shortly I will refer to the European Union. We have a choice here. We can listen to the advice of the Australian government and people like CSIRO, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Australian Automobile Association and Australian manufacturers—we can believe all these people—that ethanol is bad, or we can listen to the government of the United States, a government of a country of 250 million or so people, and we can listen to the European Union—the government of Europe; the government of 650 million people—but there is no in between. You cannot believe the European Union and also believe the Australian government and its spokesmen and mouthpieces, the Australian Automobile Association and the manufacturers—you cannot believe both. You cannot believe the United States and also believe these very foolish people in Australia. 
A report from the CSIRO said that ethanol was marginally negative for the environment. You do not have to be Albert Einstein, you do not have to be clever, you do not even have to have been to school to work out that, if you burn petrol, CO2 goes into the atmosphere. If you burn ethanol, CO2 also goes into the atmosphere. They are equal. If you burn the same amount of ethanol and petrol, you get the same amount of CO2—actually, you do not, because there is a lot of oxygen in ethanol. But we will not go sideways into that; we will just say that the same amount goes up. But there is one hell of a difference between the two, because with ethanol it comes back down again.
I had a screaming sense of personal frustration when explaining it to one of these people who has put out one of these reports—and I deeply regret to say that the officers involved have this attitude. I said: `Do you understand that there are 500,000 hectares of sugar cane being produced in Australia and that each one of those hectares pulls around 100 tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year? This means 50 million tonnes of CO2 is being pulled out of the atmosphere by this one industry every single year. The petrol industry does not do that—the petrol industry pulls not a single tonne of CO2 out of the atmosphere—yet you are saying that they both have the same effect on the atmosphere. Do you realise how incredibly stupid your statement is?'
In fairness to CSIRO, they have canned that report. It is very difficult to find. The federal department of the environment are not referring to it very often at the present moment either. I had a discussion with one of these people, and he said, `You've got to take into account things like ploughing.' I cannot speak for the wheat industry—and they tell me wheat is just as efficient as, if not more efficient than, sugar in producing ethanol—but the sugar industry most certainly cannot produce 10 per cent of Australia's ethanol requirements. It would be flat out producing three or four per cent. But, regarding the sugar industry, he said, `Every year you've got to plough, you've got to plant, you've got to cultivate. This takes a lot of oil, petrol and input.' I said to him: `We don't plough anymore in this industry. We don't cultivate. We only touch the ground once every five years. We put an eight-inch trash blanket over it every year. We don't need to cultivate anymore.' He said, `But what about the mill?' I said, `There are no inputs to a mill.' He said, `But you have power.' I said, `The power is generated by burning the bagasse,' which is the solid material that is left after you take the cane juice out. It was quite obvious to me that he had absolutely no working knowledge of this industry whatsoever. He was the person advising the Parliamentary Library, advising the department of agriculture, advising the department of the environment, and he had no working knowledge of this substantial central industry whatsoever.
There are 14 mills in Queensland. If we move to ethanol then there will be 40 per cent more bagasse—the solid material that is left over—to be burnt to generate electricity. One in every two of those mills should be able to generate 100 megawatts of electricity all year round. I think the Queensland grid is about 5,000 or 6,000 megawatts. We are talking here of a quarter of the entire electricity requirement of Queensland being able to be delivered by a sustainable energy medium that takes as much CO2 out of the atmosphere as it puts in—and this is only a by-product of the production of ethanol. To me, it is incredible that this could be happening. 
The issue of health is by far and away the most important issue in this debate, and the government are going to get burnt, and burnt badly, unless they move on ethanol. Unlike the governments of all the other countries which have acted to clean up their act regarding pollution coming out of petrol exhausts, this government, and successive governments, have not. The Americans and Europeans acted 15 and 20 years ago.
Dr Noel Child and Professor Michael Dawson of the University of Technology in Sydney were explaining it to me. They said that when lead was taken out of petrol something had to be put back in to improve the performance, because motor cars would now only do 500 kilometres, instead of 600 kilometres, on a tank of petrol. We had to put something back in to replace the lead, and there were two alternatives: there was ethanol on the one hand and there were aromatics on the other.
There is a huge difference between aromatics and ethanol. One is carcinogenic. It causes cancer. People will die if you use aromatics in the petrol tank. Ethanol is not carcinogenic, and people will not die if you use it in the petrol tank. This is a pretty significant difference. Other countries acted 15 to 20 years ago. I think the Americans put a one per cent cap on benzine 15 years ago. There is no cap on benzine in Australia at the present moment. I have not seen the latest Australian design rules, but they only came out two months ago. As of two months ago, I can say that for certain.
Another difference—and this explains where all these stories are coming from—is that the oil companies produce aromatics. They make a profit from aromatics. They make no profit from ethanol. So they had a choice between using aromatics, which would kill people, and using ethanol, which would not kill people. One they made a profit out of, the other they did not. This was an evil decision—and `evil' is the only word that I can use to describe to the House the nature of this decision.
On top of that there is a small particles issue, which in fact is more serious than the aromatics issue. I quote from the New Scientist magazine, which is the most eminent scientific magazine in the world. An article under the headline `Big City Killer' states:
If the cigarettes don't get you the traffic pollution will.
Up to a fifth of all lung cancer deaths in cities are caused by tiny particles of pollution—most of them from vehicle exhaust. That's the conclusion of the biggest study into city pollution to date, which tracked half a million Americans for 16 years. It suggests the impact is far greater than feared.
I cannot read out the whole article, but it is from the world's most prestigious scientific journal. That article refers to another article, from the Journal of the American Medical Association of 6 March 2002, called `Lung cancer, cardiopulmonary mortality, and long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution'. On page 1137 of that article is the lung cancer mortality rate. If you go from what is normal in country Australia to a Sydney type situation, you will see that the incidence of lung cancer doubles. It is very simple: here is the graph. People here are not acting and have actually become spokespeople for the oil companies. People are dying in this country.
Finally, on the sugar industry, I deeply regret that the Parliamentary Library has taken information from sources that are really very substandard. I was the minister in the Queensland government when Transfield came to us—definitely no foolish company—and we negotiated on the basis of $360 a tonne, which we had to do because it was $340 a tonne then for sugar, so we were not going to negotiate for anything less. The library reference says $200 a tonne. So either Transfield or the people providing that information are fools, and I must emphasise that it was the people providing that information to the Parliamentary Library. We had Fluor Daniel and Wright Killen of Texas oversee the figures for us, so I am certain they are correct. 
It was 67c for feedstock—that is, $360 a tonne—and 15c for processing, which equals 82c. You only put a 10th of it in a litre, so that is 360c for your normal petrol charges, which are 40c a litre less government charges at the present moment at the bowser. That is 44c a litre, and that is handled by the environment rebate. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Cobb, John, MP",NP,2003-09-15,"—One thing that is certain is that Australia is very much a transport driven nation. Electorates like mine—or that of the member from the Top End over here—are even more transport driven than most, especially when you are an export driven electorate, as most electorates in country Australia are. Nobody has more reason to be worried about transport and its standards than these people do. Sheer distance and the necessity to own and use a car in the bush means that we are all going to be using them at a young age and we will be dependent lifelong on using automobiles or internal-combustion engines of some sort.
It is no surprise that passenger vehicles in Australia do produce 40 million tonnes of greenhouse gases and, while that is not a huge problem for those of us who live in the country, it could certainly create some problems in the cities. Obviously we are not about to even try to stop people using motor vehicles, but we do have to provide some sort of a regulatory framework and tighten standards to get better operational outcomes and some better emission controls to try and keep things on an even keel in the cities.
The Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 set the wheels in motion to do just that, and the amendments set out in the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003 give the Commonwealth the ability to bring about some changes. The Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 was an innovative piece of legislation that, for the first time, introduced a national regulatory framework to control fuel quality. The aim of the act is to regulate fuel quality for the adoption of better engine and emission control technologies, for more efficient engines and, to an extent, to control emissions.
The National Party has been on about the fuel quality agenda for a long time. While most of us represent large fuel-consuming electorates because of—as I have said previously—the very nature of our electorates and the way they have to transport so much, there do have to be fuel standards. Even though we do not always like them, I think we have got to recognise that they have to exist. It does not matter whether you are a farmer or a transport operator, we all must concede that we have a part to play. With all the changes to emission controls that have happened in the last 20 years, the technology has certainly meant a far greater ability to get mileage out of a litre of fuel. We have moved towards better production, better technologies and cleaner fuels at the same time and, by and large, we are getting industry wide cooperation.
The one thing I will never claim to be—and I am not—is a mad greenie, but we do have to have a commonsense approach to this, and it has to involve the whole of the community in one form or another. The amendments in this bill will provide benefits for the fuel consumer, or motorist, and for the community as well—it is a fact of life. Item 1 of the explanatory memorandum states: 
This item amends the objects of the Act (section 3) to include a specific objective related to the new fuel labelling provisions.
The amendments are necessary to give the Commonwealth the ability to have an effective and enforceable national labelling regime for fuels. Motorists will have the opportunity to be informed about the fuel they are purchasing before they buy it, and I do not think we can argue about the fact that they should have the right to that. Labelling requirements have got to be consistent, and that is why the Commonwealth has taken these steps. Some of the states, especially New South Wales, have had the ability to do it for 100 years but they have not done it.
Consistent national labelling at petrol service stations will benefit all Australian motorists and, as we move towards a 10 per cent limit on ethanol, consistent labelling is something we have to do. There has been enormous scaremongering—to say the least—by certain parties about ethanol fuel and labelling requirements. I think the members opposite, along with the fuel companies, are probably as guilty as anyone of running one of the biggest scare campaigns, with very little truth involved, if any at all, and absolutely no concern about an Australian industry that has an enormous amount to offer to Australia as a whole.
I agree with what the honourable member for Kennedy said earlier—that environmentally this is good news, not bad news. I am no scientist but I do not believe that a scientist can add two and two and make five—but perhaps in this case they have. We have moved an amendment to counter the unease and scaremongering that has been going on. How often do you see an opposition combine with the fuel companies, especially an opposition that purports to represent the ordinary people? I do not know how often it has happened; this is certainly the first time I have seen it happen to this extent. The particular system they were trying to destroy involved totally Australian companies and Australian employees, Australian farmers and Australian technology. Why anyone would want to ruin that, I do not know, but the attempt to do so will go down in shame. We have to do our best to try to resurrect the opportunities presented by that technology and those industries. The people who work in those industries build homes and feed their families. It is all very well for the opposition to smile about it, but I do not think the people who have put their money up and the people who have got the jobs are smiling about it.
Not surprisingly, most of the state Labor governments have failed in their duty to regulate the industry. As has been mentioned, it is not just New South Wales; most of the states have the opportunity to regulate the industry and to have labelling standards, but they have failed to do so. Instead, they preferred to be part of the scare campaign to try and stop people using the produce at all. Because the states have refused to institute labelling, the Commonwealth will legislate to give itself the power to require labelling so that consumers will have the opportunity to know exactly what they are buying, instead of driving up to service stations where there are signs with `no ethanol' written on them—as was intimated by those who have been trying to run a scare campaign for political reasons. The fuel companies have tried to run a scare campaign for a far more insidious reason—to try to ruin a competitor. 
The New South Wales government has had the capacity for 100 years to regulate the sale of petrol and to require petrol retailers to inform consumers of content through proper labelling, and it has failed to do that. Blends containing 20 per cent ethanol have been available on the Sydney market since 1994. I point out that reports that were in the paper last week about what ethanol does to cars were not accurate. Most car companies concede that a 10 per cent level of ethanol will never hurt their products, but they will not put their name to it in case somebody calls them to account in the future. That is a disgrace on the part of the car companies, the opposition and the petrol companies. Research suggests that an ethanol level of 20 per cent may cause some problems in some cars. It is not suitable for two-stroke engines, where there may be a problem. But we are not talking about two-stroke engines; we are talking about the vast bulk of cars that have been made since 1984—certainly almost every car that is being produced today.
While the Commonwealth was undertaking scientific testing to set an appropriate and sound ethanol limit for fuel, state governments still had an opportunity to cooperate by insisting on labelling standards so that the public could look at what they were buying, and we would not have had to have that `no ethanol' campaign that was run so effectively and nearly—I stress `nearly'—brought an industry to its knees. It is no wonder the motoring public became anxious about ethanol fuel while all of that was going on. That 20 per cent ethanol level was being thrown about everywhere, whether it was being used or not, and most of the time it was not. Certainly at that level there would be durability concerns with some vehicles.
With this amendment, we are about allaying the concerns of motorists and are about giving an industry—and those who put in the money, the technology and the work—an opportunity, whether it be in cane production or feed grain production. We want to allay the concerns of the public and the concerns of people in the industry. After all, it is a wholly Australian industry and not—as with a lot of the engines and fuel companies we are talking about—total foreign investment. Each fuel quality information standard will set out the type and supply of fuel to which it applies, the information that must be provided with regard to the fuel and the manner in which it must be provided. The standards will be enforced through Environment Australia's existing national fuel monitoring program. The bill states that fuel quality information standards, and variations to these standards, cannot be made without first consulting the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. This gives a voice to the many stakeholders who are affected by fuel regulation—and I have already mentioned those.
Finally, key offences of supplying off-specification fuel, altering fuel so that it does not meet the standards and supplying or importing prohibited additives are to be made strict liability offences. The new offences relating to the supply of fuel which does not meet the fuel quality information standards will be strict liability offences. Claims by offenders that they were not aware of the standards will be rendered null and void, and suppliers will be made accountable to the consuming public. I support this amendment. I abhor what has gone on in the past 12 months or so in trying to ruin an industry before it even got on its feet. I should add that there is an enormous amount of investment ready to be put into the ethanol industry and the biofuel industry today. It does not need scare campaigns by those who have no purpose other than foreign greed or local political outcomes and who are trying to drag it down. ",REPS,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2003-09-15,"—I congratulate the member for Kennedy for the great speech that he made a moment ago, particularly in terms of the health issue but also for the analysis of the scientific implications of the use of ethanol. I rise to support the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003. I am delighted that so many were in the gallery to hear the speech made tonight by the member for Kennedy, because I think it is a matter that should be reported by the press gallery. With its national significance to job creation and regional development and the major contribution it could make to the health care of the nation, I believe the press gallery should be paying this matter enormous attention.
Ethanol has absolutely enormous implications for agriculture. We heard the member for Kennedy say that about 550,000 hectares of sugar cane would be able to produce something like three to four per cent of our fuel needs if all of that area were turned over to the production of ethanol. In my area and that of the member for Gwydir—and also in southern Queensland—there is the potential for three plants to be put in place, the production from which would amount to something like one per cent of our fuel needs. They would generate something like $0.25 billion in investment and another $120 million in natural gas private sector investment and utilise something like a million acres of sorghum or grain crop—corn or wheat. The implications from that, not only for investment but to the regional communities, are absolutely enormous.
I cannot believe the way in which this issue has been treated by both sides in this parliament. I cannot believe that the Labor Party have embarked on a process of removing the issue of ethanol from the minds of the fuel-using community. The Labor Party have embarked on this process to score some cheap political points over some confused rationale that the government had at one stage over the dealings of the Prime Minister with the proprietor of Manildra. But that is not an excuse. 
—That justifies it.
—No, it does not justify it at all. The cheap political advantage that has been gained by that, if any has been gained, is at the risk of major production in the ethanol industry.
The government on the other hand is not squeaky clean on this issue either. The government says that since 2001, when it brought in the 350 million litre biofuel policy it is currently trying to implement, it has tried, by removing the 38c per litre excise until 2008 and phasing out that excise exemption in five equal instalments through to 2012, to put in place a policy—and we have heard speakers here tonight talk about this—that will encourage investment in the ethanol industry. That will not occur.
Let us look at the mathematics and the economics of the ethanol industry. If you are a greenfield site at the moment, even if a decision were made today, it would take something like two years for that plant to get into production, which would take you to the end of 2005 before a litre of ethanol was produced. You would then have three years of exemption from the 38c excise and then there would be a phase out over the next five years. Investors looking at investing in ethanol—and there are significant investors right across Australia—are all saying that under that regime it is uneconomic to start an industry.
The member for Kennedy is quite right: we are not going to see an industry start with that sort of policy mix. It is not going to occur. The government have to rethink the policy mix. They cannot keep saying, `We've put in a policy mix that's going to encourage investment in ethanol,' when the investors are saying that it is not good enough. The two things do not add up. It is private sector investment. We are going to have to rethink that policy. A corruption of economic language has come into the debate in this place, where the removal of a tax—an excise—is described as a subsidy to an industry. It is a tax that should not be on the production sector to start with. The language should not be corrupted in that way. The removal of a tax is considered by the government to be a subsidy to an industry. 
In a lot of other countries in the world that sort of logic does not hold true. We heard what the member for Kennedy said about the US Senate with the 10 per cent mandate. They are the so-called bastion of free enterprise, the nation we listen to most, the nation we have listened to in recent years and with which we have formed a number of treaties. Let us hope that the Minister for Trade can do something about a free trade treaty while he is in Mexico. But we are not following the Americans with this mandated 10 per cent.
—Do you support the FTA?
—I support a 10 per cent mandatory usage of ethanol. The government should bite the bullet on that. It should mandate for 10 per cent, which would give investors security, and should remove the corruption in language which says that the removal of a tax is a subsidy. Remove the tax and let the industry grow. The flow-on effects to our communities and the environmental impacts will be enormous. There will be a generation of investment and a decreasing reliance on the Middle East and other oil-producing countries into our future because of the capacity to grow our own readily renewable fuel. As I said, the implications of that for regional communities are enormous.
The community of Gunnedah, in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate, currently has a proposed investment package of $120 million. Depending on the yield, that $120 million would utilise something like 500,000 to 600,000 acres of sorghum. That would underwrite the price of coarse grain in that area. Dalby is a smaller plant—I think it is about a $60 million investment—that would create something like 60 million litres of ethanol per year. In terms of crop input, that particular plant would need 200,000 to 300,000 acres of sorghum. There is another plant in the township of Corindi south of Tamworth. These are the sorts of investments that are out there and the sorts of things we should be encouraging.
The government would not agree with fuel excise being charged. I think some of the players in the current cabinet argued behind closed doors when the GST came in that fuel should have been considered and a flat rate of GST applied to it. That would have sent some positive messages to the investment community in terms of our comparative advantage in being an export nation. I suggest that there would be people in the cabinet who would agree with that view, but there would be others who would suggest that, if we start to remove or not charge an excise on a renewable fuel, that may well encourage the growth of a readily renewable biofuels industry, which the 2001 policy was supposed to do—350 million litres of fuel by 2010 was supposed to be the objective. So we have this argument going on: do we go for a renewable biofuels industry that does not produce an income stream to government, or do we stay with an income stream to government? At the moment we are told that we must, at some stage, reimpose a tax, an income stream. The Deputy Prime Minister said the other day in relation to a question on this that the industry must be able to stand on its own feet at some time in the future—so there will be a capital grant of 16c a litre or whatever and the excise exemption will be graded out—which means that the industry will be fully taxed. So again we have this corruption that, if you do not tax this industry, that would be subsidising it. 
We have a circumstance where the government is opting for the income stream. The Treasury are saying, `If we start to erode this income stream base, we will be in big trouble later on'—we are starting to see it with LPG gas and some of the other things as well—`we've got to be careful that we do not lose our income.' On the other hand, in the Telstra debate the government is happy to lose a very large income stream. The government has to make up its mind whether it is in the business of encouraging domestic industry, particularly inland Australian agricultural industries. This is a very real opportunity to come to grips with some of the problems that inland Australia is having. We have an oil industry that is based on US dollars essentially, a global currency, and we have the potential—if we apply a 10 per cent mandate, for instance, so that 10 per cent of fuel is generated by crop production—to enter that global market in terms of pricing. The impact of that on our communities would be enormous.
I believe that some members of the government are actually trying to do the right thing but are being caught in this mesh and using the Labor Party's scare campaign—and the Labor Party are playing into the hands of this agenda—and a few erroneous facts are being thrown about by the fuel companies to say, `Oh well, we tried, but it was the filthy Labor Party that stopped us from achieving the goal.' The policy mix that the government currently has in place will not encourage or guarantee anything; it will not do anything other than support the existing industry for a short period. The existing industry is essentially one producer: Manildra. The production from this plant relates to what was a by-product that they were going to have difficulty with in terms of environmental outcomes. They have turned a by-product into ethanol and done it very successfully—and I congratulate them. But they are the only beneficiaries of this current policy mix. Other investors will not be able to establish themselves for long enough to accept the 38c a litre exemption and put themselves in a position where they can, as the Deputy Prime Minister keeps saying, stand on their own feet at some stage with full taxation being applied to them. The only producer that can do that is the one in the industry at the moment, and that is Manildra.
So I would encourage government members to revisit this if they are serious about doing something for regional Australia, for country communities, for country people and for agriculture that does not rely on the world to exist and if they are serious about getting into the renewable biofuels industry—and at some stage we will have to, but it might be 50 or 100 years away. Australia has some of the best and most competitive farmers in the world, because they have had to struggle in a non-subsidised environment. Yet here we have the government saying, `You can only have this one, boys, if you can stand full taxation.' I think it is an absolute disgrace that we are even suggesting that. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry  and the Deputy Prime Minister should be demanding that there be no excise on this industry. Why do we want to tax an industry that is going to create this amount of investment? If 10 per cent of our fuel suddenly became ethanol, it would need $2.5 billion to $3 billion worth of investment. Where would that occur? In the agricultural lands of Australia. That would be an enormous investment in not only the employment levels but the whole underwriting of the grains industry and perhaps the sugar cane industry. 
We have to look at the social implications if we do not do something for the sugar cane industry. I know—and the member for Kennedy might disagree with me—that sugar cane is not the most efficient way to produce ethanol. But we have an industry and communities out there that have been making a major contribution to Australia over many years, and here is an option we can adopt. If it does require some sort of `subsidy', so be it. If we destroy our agricultural industries, those people we destroy along with them are going to be subsidised at some time in the future. So I would encourage the government members to revisit this and get it right. Remove this idea that people seem to have polluting their minds that a renewable biofuels industry must be taxed at some stage. There is no logic to that. Why does it have to be taxed? We are a global player, trying to compete with others. Why are we looking at taxing people in relation to these particular industries? It is just a corruption of the worth of this industry.
I would like to mention a few other things in conclusion. The points that the member for Kennedy made in relation to health are very important. I urge the press gallery to pick up on this and really start to do some homework on what is going on within the fuel industry and on the rumours that are about, such as the rubbish being peddled that you cannot use 10 per cent ethanol in fuel because of the so-called damage that is being incurred. All those sorts of things can be taken care of. As the member for Dawson said earlier, they are up to E85 in some parts of the United States. As I said, we have followed the United States in many areas. Maybe we have to take a closer look at what they are doing over there, because we have the capacity to join with them and provide readily renewable biofuels in our country communities, rather than looking at importing fuel into the future. The health implications and the US experience are very important.
Let me conclude by saying that I believe there are two issues that are very important in relation to the economic implications for country Australia. The first is the issue of Telstra and communications. Equity of access to communications is the very thing that can break the distance factor as a disadvantage of living in rural Australia. The second is that we can start using agriculture to grow fuels into our future. We can start using agriculture to produce its own jobs, rather than relying on the vagaries of the international marketplace and the corrupted cost structures of some of our competitors. It would be nice to think that the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, would be successful with some of his negotiations; history says that countries looks after themselves. Maybe it is time that this country started to look after itself as well.",REPS,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—Before I speak on the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003, I would like to congratulate the member for Dawson on her most articulate and precise speech on ethanol. I think it was absolutely tremendous. Much has been said about the benefits of ethanol, and I have certainly not been a wallflower in making my feelings about this issue known. Let us recognise that behind all this brouhaha is a Labor Party campaign. The member for Bruce is running the line that the government is keeping information from consumers on the safety of ethanol in fuel. However, the reality is that such statements are just a cover for their campaign of misinformation and half truths on ethanol—and that is putting it graciously.
Labor have done their best to kill off the blended fuel industry in Australia. If Labor really want to repair that situation, restore national confidence in this industry and give back to the workers in my electorate of Gilmore the assurance that their jobs are secure, then let us have the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa and the member for Batman come into the House here and now to apologise for misleading the Australian people on the value of ethanol as a renewable fuel additive. If the Labor Party want to persist in refusing to recognise the environmental benefits of ethanol and continue to work against jobs in Gilmore, then perhaps they should listen to some outsiders. Radio presenter Philip Clark has had the good sense to present an objective analysis of this issue. On 10 September Mr Clark interviewed Dr Bill Wells, an adviser to the United States government on ethanol. Having heard the claim that two million cars manufactured before 1986 would be damaged by 10 per cent ethanol, he said: 
It's not even possible ... I don't believe there's an automobile driving on the highway today in Australia that would be harmed by 10% ethanol blends. Somewhere between 27% and 30% of all petrol in the US contains some level of ethanol. In the big polluted cities—Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Chicago, it's just moving into Detroit and Connecticut—100%, year round of the petrol contains ethanol. It's non-polluting. In around 1985 or 1986 ... when they took the lead out, the auto companies said, OK, we now have cars that can burn on unleaded fuel and they're being conservative about the other ones.
Indeed, Dr Wells is so confident about it he said:
If I had ... a pre-1986 car, I would seek out ethanol. It will clean out your engine, particularly the older cars, it makes them run more efficiently, the higher octane level, the enleanment is really, really good for these rich burning engines and the proof is it's been running for 10 years in Sydney.
Last week when I addressed this issue in the Main Committee I was also somewhat conservative in my own assessment. (Quorum formed) It is a pity that the Labor Party cannot take it as well as give it and that they have to call this intervention to  stop time in my speech. However, I will continue loudly and long on this issue. There is no doubt that ethanol cannot be used, as I said—and I was wrong to say—in pre-1986 cars, when the manufacturers are saying that they can use it with the right preparations. It is no wonder that, with all the conflicting reports, like the consumer I was somewhat confused. Dr Wells went on to say:
There are around 2.7 billion gallons, which is something like 11 billion litres of ethanol going to be blended as E10 or E8 or E6 in the United States this year.
He calculates:
Americans will drive 670 billion miles on ethanol this year. If there was a problem ... believe me, we would know it.
Dr Wells points out that Brazil have 22 per cent ethanol in their petrol and some cars run on 90 per cent. So why are we arguing like this? 
Philip Clark in his commentary on the subject puts it down to `hysteria' and `ignorance'. I think he is right. Hysteria describes Labor's approach to dealing with a serious issue. They cause a scare campaign and destroy the reputation of fine Australians and their companies all in the name of getting at the government. It is called point scoring. Given the level of ignorance that prevails in the Labor Party on ethanol, as evidenced by some of the debate we have heard on this bill, it is not surprising to see them resorting to an hysterical fear campaign. That is what they are good at. They have no policies. That takes creative ideas and hard work, and they are not up to that. Instead, they scare the people—because what would they know? 
We also need to ask about the oil companies' support for using ethanol. Do they have an interest in backing Labor's campaign? As far as the international oil companies are concerned, this is certainly not the case. Dr Wells states that Sir John Brown of BP is an `extreme environmentalist and he buys more ethanol in a month than the United States and Australia could use in two years'. To their credit, BP in Queensland have produced a brochure entitled `What colour is your petrol? Ours is green.' It states: 
It's time for more motorists to take advantage of the benefits of ... Australian-sourced renewable fuel. Ethanol is one of the best ways we have to fight air pollution from vehicles. That's because ethanol contains 35% oxygen. And when you increase the level of oxygen in petrol you get more complete combustion, which reduces harmful tailpipe emissions such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons ... When the ethanol is burnt as a fuel, it releases carbon dioxide which plants reabsorb and use to make more oxygen. And so the cycle goes ...
Why are our oil companies in other states not supporting ethanol? I repeat the question: are they in support of Labor in its scare campaign? In the United States Mobil put out literature entitled `Why ethanol is good for your car'. They promote ethanol as `Engine enhancing; Clean and safe; American made'. They say that ethanol helps keep fuel injection systems clean, so they perform better. Problems with fuel injection plugging are the result of dirty fuel, not ethanol. The research has been done. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers compared ethanol fuel to straight gasoline, and in a published report the institute said that ethanol was `very similar in driving characteristics to straight gasoline, except that pre-ignition and dieseling run on are noticeably reduced and acceleration can be improved' with ethanol.
Hopefully, other Australian oil company representatives will start to respond to the initiative demonstrated by Mobil's global operations and BP here in Australia. It is easy for these companies to become slaves to the marketplace, responding to the hysteria that the Labor opposition is feeding the public. However, rural and regional Australians can be far more discerning. They understand better than most the longterm benefits of practical environmental management, not to mention the real and immediate benefits of employment so desperately needed in these areas. 
When I was elected as the member for Gilmore in 1996, unemployment was 17 per cent. Thanks to the responsible economic management of this government, unemployment in Gilmore now stands at 6.5 per cent. But I am not satisfied with that; there is more work to be done. It is estimated that this industry will create up to $1.1 billion of new investment in regional areas. Where is Labor's alternative employment program for regional Australia? That is what it comes down to with this opposition. There is no plan and no policy.
Let us, for a moment, have a look at how this issue affects the people in my electorate of Gilmore. The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority regulations require Manildra to find a way to deal with the waste stream from their mill on the Shoalhaven River at Bomaderry. This waste includes starches and proteins. The most efficient solution to the problem was to build an ethanol plant, which also added value to what would have been just waste. If Manildra is unable to process effluent waste into ethanol, then the EPA may force them to close as there is no other infrastructure in place to deal with the waste. Let us not forget that it was the former Labor government that promoted the use of ethanol and encouraged Manildra to produce it by giving ethanol an 18 cent per litre bounty.
Manildra has been seeking to sell ethanol to the four major fuel companies since 1992. During that time they have not been able to sell even one litre. Ethanol storage is in short supply and if petrol companies do not start taking ethanol, it is likely that Manildra will need to halt production anyhow. Since the government's decision on the 10 per cent cap for ethanol in fuel, Manildra has again made representations to every fuel company, and on each occasion the answer has been `no' or `maybe in six to 12 months or so'. These oil companies still have their signs up saying, `No ethanol sold here.' 
Closing Manildra's ethanol plant at Bomaderry on the Shoalhaven River would directly threaten over 200 local jobs with a much wider economic impact, beginning with the loss of a further 600 to 800 jobs indirectly. One of the major reasons why Manildra is located at Bomaderry is the neighbouring paper mill. It uses the starches to add quality to the paper; it stops ink running. Starch also adds stiffness to packaging and cardboard. Closure of Manildra also puts the paper mill at risk of closing.
But the destruction does not end there. Manildra supplies brewers' syrups across Australia. Imagine how many jobs are linked with the production, transport and selling of beer in Australia. Ethanol is the major carrier or delivery system for aerosol sprays as it evaporates quickly, leaving only the substance being sprayed. Ethanol is not only the delivery system for perfumes and deodorants, but it is also used with many aerosol medicines such as asthma sprays. Is Labor asking producers for these products to source their ethanol from overseas?
Manildra is a major supplier of glucose sweeteners to Cadburys, Nestle and Coca-Cola. The production of ethanol emits carbon dioxide as a by-product, which is used to put the bubbles in Coke. This CO2 replaces fossil carbon. Now why would you go back to mining a fossil fuel product when a safe, clean, environmentally friendly carbonating substance is being made from renewable vegetative waste? We must ask: where are the Greens on this? Senator Brown is strangely silent. How come they are not at the petrol stations asking for ethanol to help keep our air clean? How come they are not out there supporting a sustainable, renewable fuel source?
The effects of the Bomaderry plant closure would be even more far-reaching. The flour that comes from Gunnedah and the township of Manildra will have nowhere to go since it is not flour sold for bread making but for industrial processing. Such a result will negatively impact on the farmers, the harvesters and the flour millers out in those regional areas. Australia wide, there could be another 900 jobs put at risk.
The ethanol issue has been played out before in several developed countries. In each case where the oil companies totally owned and controlled the industry, the introduction of ethanol progressed smoothly and without question. However, in countries where the oil companies did not have total control of the industry, this same battle of the perception of ethanol has been fought. Basically, if the oil companies cannot own it they will fight its introduction for as long as possible in the hope that they will send the ethanol producers broke. When that happens, as has happened in other countries, the oil companies then buy up the infrastructure and suddenly ethanol is available in fuel with no problems. This is the battle we are watching in Australia today. (Quorum formed)
In presenting this bill, all the Australian government is asking the parliament to do is to give it the power to put in place a system of labelling that the states and territories have not done. The state member for Kiama, Matt Brown, is one Labor MP who says that he is happy to support ethanol—particularly if he gets his photo in the paper—but his support does not extend to convincing his own New South Wales government colleagues to do what it is their responsibility to do—that is, to introduce labelling which the federal government has now put before the House. 
In concluding—as time is running out and I have had to miss out half my speech—let us go back to the ethanol plant at Bomaderry known as Manildra. I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Werriwa have actually ever been to see what is produced there or have had the opportunity to talk to the people who produce ethanol. As the federal member I extend an invitation to them to come and visit, speak to the workers and hear from people like Stuart Lucas, who has worked for Dick Honan at Manildra for the past 26 years. He has just bought a better home and has a mortgage to go with it. He certainly has no plans to retire or to be made redundant. He has a son, who has worked at the plant for 10 years. He also has a wife, two children and a mortgage. What will the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Werriwa tell them? How will they explain that scoring these political points costs jobs and ruins families—and for what? I say to them: come and visit. Come and talk to the workers whom your tactics will affect, the people whose jobs you are putting at risk. I am working for those jobs and for more jobs—more jobs in Gilmore and more jobs in rural and regional Australia.",REPS,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-09-15,"—The Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003 is concerned with establishing a labelling system for all fuels available in this country. But, as we have heard from the speeches on this bill, it is very much caught up in the current ethanol debate. This bill has been referred to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee for report by 28 October 2003, a deadline which is unlikely to be met, yet the House of Representatives proceeds with debate before the committee's findings are available. Again this highlights the need for a House bills reference committee. That is patently obvious, given the intensity and passion of the debate around one of the fuel additives that we are debating—that is, ethanol.
This is all the more serious in light of the potentially very complex nature of such labelling—whether or not something contains ethanol—as evidenced by the ethanol working group's report that more than three million cars of many different ages and makes may not be suited to ethanol. The public is demanding some clear and definitive answers on this. The Senate committee is to examine the effectiveness of the bill in delivering an enforceable national labelling regime that will achieve consumer choice in fuel purchase and the likelihood of the proposed amendments resulting in key provisions of the act being enforceable. It will also examine the bill's provisions on the development of fuel quality information standards. Surely this is critical to any proper debate of this legislation here in the House of Representatives.
The bill establishes a national framework for fuel labelling in Australia. It will override state and territory laws where the Commonwealth makes fuel quality standards and create strict liability offences for the key offences provision. The objective of the labelling is to reduce the levels of pollutants and emissions arising from the use of fuel that may cause environmental and health problems, facilitate the adoption of better engine technology and emission control technology, and allow engines to operate more effectively. The minister is to determine the base fuel standard only after consultation with the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. Members of this committee include representatives from each state and territory, one or more representatives from the Commonwealth, one or more representatives from the fuel producers, one representative of an non-government body with an interest in the protection of the environment and one person representing the interests of consumers—a good, solid review group, you might say. 
The bill provides that if its provisions are contravened this will be a strict liability offence, which means that the courts do not have to prove that the defendant had guilty intent in failing to adhere to the bill's provisions—nor do courts have to prove fault; that is, recklessness or negligence. So failure to comply is punishable but there is still the possibility of arguing the defence of a `reasonable mistake'. The bill basically assumes that all those in the industry will have the required knowledge of the applicable fuel standard and therefore will comply. This means the prosecution does not have to go about proving the defendant has this knowledge. If offences were not strict liability offences, enforcement would be exceedingly difficult. The punishments have been reduced accordingly—fines only and no imprisonment. The maximum fine—which has been halved—is 500 penalty units, which is $55,000. For a corporation the maximum fine is 2,500 units, which is $275,000. That is all pretty reasonable. Fuel labelling is essential as we move toward biofuel and clean fuel alternatives. We are in a transitional time of development, and people need to know what they are buying. I support labelling, but how can this bill be passed without the findings of a proper review committee with regard to its effectiveness? Notwithstanding that, I can only support the bill at this point in the expectation that the inquiry and review in the other place will iron out any flaws before it returns here. 
Let me just briefly mention the ethanol debate. Here I support my colleague the member for New England in agreeing that the government's support program is not long enough to enable sufficient encouragement of all potential players in this market. If ethanol is as effective as other countries seem to believe then its use, quite frankly, should be mandated. That this bill is subject to inquiry is not unusual; that related excise bills are held up in the Senate is part of the opposition parties' attempts to obtain the release of the full minutes of discussions between the Manildra Group and the Prime Minister. It strikes me that this impasse—where, by Thursday night, we may have the current excise on ethanol lifted but the domestic subsidy maintained—can be broken by the simple release of those documents. The public can be excused for being totally bewildered to the point of abject cynicism by the shenanigans around ethanol in this country.
The European parliament strongly supports biofuels, including ethanol, through tax exemptions and other means. There is strong support throughout the US for ethanol blends, with the oil companies cooperating in the process, it would seem. A similar story pertains in New Zealand. The University of Sydney's Professor Ray Kearney says that benefits to our health, the environment and the economy will arise from the expansion of the market for ethanol-blended fuels and biodiesel. However, the parliamentary research paper says that the positive benefits relating to greenhouse gas emissions depend on how the ethanol is produced. Whilst ethanol produced from woody feedstock results in substantially reduced full fuel cycle greenhouse gas emissions, ethanol produced from starchy crops does not produce significant full fuel cycle greenhouse gas savings over conventionally produced gasoline. That needs to be fully tested, I would suggest. Yet ethanol production from corn is booming in the US—it is a starch based product. It is being used as a blend and to create an improved ethanol-powered fuel cell. The US Renewable Energy Action Project says CO2 emissions are reduced by 35 per cent by using ethanol. 
Up to 20 per cent blending is used worldwide, yet here we have the oil industry actively campaigning against ethanol blends. If the science is sound, then why wouldn't the oil companies want to extend what is a finite supply of petroleum by using an environmentally friendly additive? It makes more sense to dilute a last bottle of cordial than to guzzle it all up, although the oil companies seem determined not to give up even a 10 per cent share of the market. Is it as short-sighted as all that, or am I missing something? Whatever the finite nature of oil supplies, the oil companies seem determined not to give up even a 10 per cent share of the market.
However, complicating this scene further, we have a government not being open and honest enough with the public about the arrangements it makes with ethanol producers. We have innuendo and suspicion cast across the alternative energy debate, with claims of special help for political mates. Whatever the merits of ethanol, we should not have any government, opposition or, indeed, independent member or senator compromised by campaign contributions from anyone. Banks, retailers, media operators and, yes, oil companies, are all listed on the AEC web site as big donors to political parties. So too is the alternative energy sector, it seems. Only a cap on campaign spending will reign in the donations and remove this odious influence from Australian politics. Public perception is everything, and corporate or interest group donations to the political process can only be controlled by controlling the spending of individuals in individual seats and legislating for free broadcast time. It is not rocket science; it is the sort of policy that is in place in the UK—have a look.
This ethanol mess is one of the government's and industry's own making, contributed to, no doubt, by the duplicity of the oil companies. It blurs the debate we should be having: how best to develop alternative energy in this country. That industry should be developed through cooperation and sharing by government, oil companies and alternative energy producers, not by policies that favour one, two or three producers. The opposition wants to cover all bases with its second reading amendment: attack the government, promote strong labelling, hop into bed with oil companies by suggesting ethanol will wreck engines, and legitimately criticise the government's secrecy around negotiations on protecting the local industry at a time when that local industry is dominated by one producer, in at least one aspect of the ethanol production area. That producer has, incidentally, stuck by the product. I supported him strongly through the times when he lost the bounty assistance, and still do. Manildra, incidentally, is in my electorate and I went into bat when they lost that bounty. The former government introduced that bounty and it was knocked off by this government in 1996 or thereabouts on the grounds that it was not an efficient way of encouraging an alternative energy industry. Here we have another system in place which, to my mind, does not do anything substantially different, notwithstanding that loss of bounty assistance, as the member for Gilmore has been since she came into this parliament.
Let us not be duplicitous about this; let us not do deals behind closed doors. Let us get out and debate with the public and have a proper investigation into the value of ethanol. Let us go over the more recent information, which seems to cloud some of the earlier stuff that was around in the late nineties suggesting that perhaps the energy efficiency—in terms of CO2 reduction in the production process for wheat or sugar—is not as efficacious as perhaps some other means of producing ethanol around the world. Let us have it all out there and let us really look at the industry and see how valuable it is in the long run. 
I believe it is an industry worth supporting—and not just because Manildra is in my electorate—I have thought that for many years. I support any sort of investigation into alternative energies that are going to reduce the amount of petrol guzzling and indeed the fanatical rush to control the oil reserves of the world, part of the problem we see today in the Middle East crisis. Let us be constructive around alternative energy and then one day perhaps we may find alternatives that will not only deliver a cleaner earth but a more peaceful earth. So, while the public hopes the air will become clearer with cleaner fuel, the debate is muddied by the crass opportunistic politics on both sides of this debate. Hopefully, the fuel quality standards legislation before us will at least clear up the product choices for motorists, and to that extent I support the bill.",REPS,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—The debate has now come to an end and I propose to make some summing up remarks. Let me make it clear right from the start that the government does not support the second reading amendment. The allegations contained in that amendment are baseless and the actions proposed in it are unnecessary. I will say something about the amendment in summing up the debate, but I would first like to correct some misinformation which has come before this parliament in the course of the debate.
Let me start these remarks with a general comment. Since last year, the Labor Party has been a major factor in the decline of consumer confidence in ethanol, because it has been prepared to make inaccurate claim after inaccurate claim without regard to the facts or the truth. This irresponsible campaign peaked last week when the Labor Party insisted on putting into the public arena preliminary information provided by automobile manufacturers to the ethanol confidence working group about the impact of the 10 per cent blend of ethanol in petrol on the operability of different makes of cars.
This information was not cleared by the manufacturers for publication and very possibly contained information that could be misleading. Nevertheless, Labor insisted on making it public and even tried to table it in the House. The consequence of this is inevitably that consumers would have been misled by some of this information. We can see the nature of how they were being misled through comments made by the member for McMillan in the course of the debate when he said that 10 per cent ethanol blends will damage some vehicles. On the basis of the information provided by the manufacturers, there is no justification for this claim—a claim which was, however, widely reported in the press.
As pointed out by the member for Dunkley, the general issue is not about vehicle damage from 10 per cent ethanol but about whether a vehicle will operate optimally on the E10 blend. This is no different an issue to the change in performance that may be experienced by using regular unleaded petrol in vehicles for which premium unleaded is recommended. On this point, the member for McMillan stated that, according to the list, ethanol is not recommended for use in many vehicles. I agree that it is disappointing that car manufacturers provided that equivocal advice on the suitability of ethanol for their cars to the working group. Amongst domestic manufacturers, only Holden has given clear advice. It is also disappointing given the wide use of 10 per cent ethanol internationally. But I understand that car makers and importers are working through the federal Chamber of Automotive Industries to tighten up that list and give clearer and more accurate advice to motorists. Nevertheless, Australian motorists are quite able to see through this issue. Once the legislation is passed and clear advice is available at the bowser, motorists will be able to determine if their car can use E10. I note that motorists now choose between premium unleaded, lead replacement and unleaded petrols without difficulty. Equally, car enthusiasts will be able to determine whether or not they want to use E10 once the government is given the power to impose labelling. 
My second point of clarification concerns comments by the member for Bruce, who suggested that the label he has tabled is the government's proposed label—he also made a number of statements about what he thought were the inadequacies of that label. Let me make it quite clear to the House that that label is no such thing. There has been an orchestrated and hysterical overreaction to a draft label that has no legal status, and debate on that label is irrelevant. The content of the ethanol label has not been finalised. The ethanol confidence working group have been considering this issue and have come up with an option—that is all it is: an option. This is not the be all and end all of the process in designing a national ethanol label. The final content and form of the ethanol label and where and how it is to be displayed will be set out by me in a disallowable instrument. In deciding on the label, I will consider the advice of the ethanol working group but also any other matters that I consider relevant. After the bill is passed and before making this instrument, I will also be required to seek the advice of the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee—a statutory committee with members drawn from industry, consumer groups and all the jurisdictions. This is exactly the same mechanism used in setting the current petrol and diesel standards.
The member for Bruce and the member for Batman asked why the government has taken so long to introduce the labelling legislation. Unlike state governments who have had the power to introduce fuel labelling requirements within a matter of weeks throughout the whole development of this debate, the Commonwealth has no existing power to require the labelling of vehicle fuels. That is what this legislation is about. In the absence of action by the states—and I warned the states about the need for consumer information in October last year and repeated my call to them in December—the government at the federal level has moved quickly to introduce the necessary legislation. The amendments in this bill will ensure that the Commonwealth gains the power to act swiftly to require labelling of fuels where it is in the public interest to do so. These labelling requirements will be uniform across the country and will be backed up by a world-class monitoring and enforcement program.
The matter is now in the hands of this parliament and especially the Senate in terms of the time taken for passage. The real question is: why is the opposition determined to stand in the way of a national labelling regime? In the Senate the opposition has referred this bill to a Senate committee which will not be reporting until 28 October. That will make it impossible to meet the 31 October date that has been requested of the federal government for labelling by the state jurisdictions—who have of course, and have had throughout this debate, the opportunity and the power to create labelling on their own account.
The second reading amendment accused the government of protecting the interests of ethanol producers through subsidies—and I note the member for Wills has talked about the government bankrolling ethanol producers. The Keating government originated the policy of an ethanol bounty scheme and provided more than a decade of excise exemptions for ethanol. Support for a domestic ethanol industry has therefore come from both sides of this chamber. The member for Bruce has also asked why the government has not tabled the label with the legislation. This legislation not only gives the government the power to require fuel labelling but also sets out a statutory process to be followed in the setting of labelling standards. This includes the formal consultation with the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee that I mentioned earlier, which must occur before a draft label can be put forward for parliamentary consideration. The statutory processes have been designed to ensure transparency and accountability. It would be quite inappropriate for the government to propose a label for debate before those statutory processes and the required consultation have occurred. It would in fact be putting the cart before the horse. It would also be a waste of parliament's time, because the label could potentially change substantially as a result of the consultation with the Fuel Standards Consultative Committee. 
I reiterate that the bill provides that the labelling determination will be a disallowable instrument, so this is neither the only nor the last opportunity for the parliament to scrutinise any proposed ethanol label should it so choose. The government shares the concerns of the member for McMillan about the potential effects of ethanol on marine engines, and a label would be needed to address this issue. I note that the results of the scientific tests on outboards that the government commissioned are posted on the web site of my department. These tests showed that 20 per cent ethanol was not suitable for outboards but that these engines ran satisfactorily on 10 per cent. Nevertheless, I agree that information on outboards is needed on labels as it appears on labels produced by BP, Bogas, Caltex and the Victorian government.
We could debate a range of issues around ethanol until the cows come home, but the fact is that such issues are irrelevant to today's debate. What we are seeking here is the passage of a bill that will allow nationally consistent labelling—that is the issue at hand—and it appears that there is no argument from either side of the House that such labelling is required. Of equal importance are the strict liability amendments contained in the bill. These changes will strengthen the act and ensure that the key offences in the act can be properly enforced. This will significantly improve the effectiveness of the act as an instrument to achieve the objectives of reducing vehicle emissions, improving engine operation and providing consumer information. The passage of this legislation is being delayed by the opposition. They are the speed hump between motorists and full information for consumers. I thank all those who contributed to the debate.
 (Mr Jenkins)—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Bruce has moved as an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2003-09-15,"—I want to speak this evening about the excellent work being done by my local schools in conjunction with our local TAFE college, Kangan Batman TAFE. It is a key post secondary education provider for people in my electorate of Calwell. TAFE and apprenticeships may be hot issues at the moment as experts and policy makers acknowledge their inherent value, but young people in my electorate consider vocational education to be an integral part of their career options. It is no wonder then that a strong nexus has been established between local secondary schools and Kangan Batman TAFE and that it is one that continues to strengthen from year to year.
Kangan Batman TAFE operates on fundamental, yet simple, principles of access and equity, seeking to ensure the greatest possible participation in the workplace by providing training opportunities for people in my electorate. The institute has 33,000 students and 1,000 very devoted staff members, with 12,100 students aged between 15 and 19 years and 145 students with disabilities. Illustrating the quality and high calibre of the courses that it offers, Kangan Batman TAFE was named Training Provider of the Year in 2001 in the Victorian Training Awards and was a finalist in the 2001 Australian Business Excellence Awards.
The confidence that local students hold in Kangan Batman TAFE is best reflected by recent On Track results released by the Victorian government. On Track, a guide to the progress of graduating VCE students, reported that Roxburgh College had the highest result in the state, with 63 per cent of year 12 students going on to TAFE studies. This result also highlights the success of the state government's decision to relocate Upfield Secondary College to the new Roxburgh Park site—and of course striving towards a first-class facility. Other local secondary colleges have achieved similarly strong figures in terms of entry into TAFE, with Penola Catholic College at 49 per cent, Copperfield Secondary College at 48 per cent and Broadmeadows Secondary College at 45 per cent.
The Minister for Education, Science and Training is surprisingly accurate when he claims that vocational education and training underpins the competitiveness of our industries and supports economic and social development. This is something that is particularly prevalent in my electorate in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne, where TAFE is the preferred option for my young constituents, who are increasingly being squeezed out of university places due to financial constraints. It is the hard work of those involved at a local level that has allowed Kangan Batman TAFE to prosper and meet the needs of my young constituents. However, this level of commitment is not satisfactorily reciprocated by this government, and the success stories that exist in my electorate are not reflected in other areas. 
Repeated government cutbacks have had a negative impact on vocational training courses and institutions but, despite all the research calling for action, it is a problem that the government tends to ignore. We need to continue to support and invest in this vital education sector, not impose stringent and constant budgetary constraints. Evidence from overseas bodies, such as the OECD, affirm undoubtedly that investment in human capital provides significant gain for the students concerned and, similarly, overall national social and economic benefit. To see this, all we need to do is look at Germany and the importance that it places on vocational education.
Denying adequate funds to the very programs that would assist the unemployed to get off welfare and back into work means that young Australians are missing out on vital training courses and on learning the skills that our nation needs, which are also pivotal to giving each of them the best possible opportunity to establish a strong and sustainable livelihood. The 2003-04 budget saw Commonwealth funding to the training sector for the period 2004 to 2006 fall in real terms from $230 million to $218 million. At a time when industry and training providers are screaming out for further skills development, the government's response is to make no offer of additional funding.
The member for Bradfield really needs to understand the hurt and pain that the introduction of the government's changes to the post secondary sector has created. While hundreds of thousands of young people are opting for vocational education and training courses, we need to address the issue of the tens of thousands of young people who miss out each year. The minister talks about giving kids from poorer backgrounds a fair go, but he conveniently hides the fact that budget cuts are actually preventing kids from poorer families—many of which are in my electorate of Calwell—from participating. This affects boys in particular, who seem to be missing out in greater numbers. The minister needs to understand that this is not a good sign, given that the rate of youth unemployment sits at 20 per cent across the country and in my electorate remains in double digits.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Education: Vocational Education and Training</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech

"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2003-09-15,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1)	to (3) Refer to the Commissioner of Taxation annual report 2000-01.
(4)	(a) (b) The information shared between the Commissioner and the Bar Association of New South Wales involved statistics gathered by the ATO in relation to the percentage of the profession who had failed to file a tax return and the number of barristers declared bankrupt within NSW.  The Commissioner did not provide any personal information about any barristers and, as such, did not infringe section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA). 
The Commissioner's appointment carries with it a responsibility to liaise with industry bodies, and the community more broadly, about compliance with the tax laws.  It is appropriate for the Commissioner to provide to a professional association statistical information relating to, or affecting, compliance levels within the relevant profession provided the disclosure is otherwise consistent with the secrecy provisions of the tax law and the privacy principles.
(c) and (d) The Commissioner met with the President of the Bar Association of New South Wales on Tuesday 13 March 2001.  The Commissioner's staff responsible for the Legal Profession Project continue to meet and liaise with officers of the Bar Association.
(5)	The Commissioner's ability to disclose aggregate statistical information to a Bar Association is explained in the answer to question (4) above.
Disclosure of aggregate statistical information does not infringe any prohibition in section 16.  Nor does the Privacy Act 1988 apply to the disclosure of aggregate statistical information.
(6)	The Commissioner of Taxation has informed me that the ATO is continuing to give high priority to barristers who are not complying with their tax obligations.  This includes focussing on the lodgment of outstanding returns, payment of debt and prosecution action for failing to lodge tax returns.
(7)	The majority of barristers are now up to date with their lodgments and the Commissioner will continue his efforts through the focus of the ATO's Legal Profession Project.  The Bankruptcy Taskforce has made a number of recommendations to change tax law, bankruptcy law and family law.  The package of recommendations is now being considered by the Government.
