Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:32):  Could I just seek some clarification from the Clerk as to whether we dealt with the amendments on sheet 7683 last time. I think we were halfway through that vote, from memory.



The CHAIRMAN:  Where we are up to is Australian Greens amendments (3) and (4), but they were actually consequential on the previous one, on which the question has been resolved. So I do not think you would want to move those. We would then be ready to go on to—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Opposition amendments?



The CHAIRMAN:  Opposition amendments, yes—if we are following the running sheet.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-03-25,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:34):  The opposition opposes schedule 2 in the following terms:


(5) Schedule 2, page 10 (line 1) to page 15 (line 9), to be opposed.


Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to make significant changes to the way in which Australia will determine if it has protection obligations in relation to certain non-citizens. Specifically, the bill inserts a new section 6A that provides that a non-citizen is not entitled to complementary protection unless the person can prove that it is more likely than not that he or she will suffer significant harm if removed from Australia. Currently, the 'real chance' test means that a person must not be returned to a situation where there is a real chance that they would face significant harm. This means a chance which is not remote or insubstantial but which may be below 50 per cent and may be as low as 10 per cent. These changes have the potential to put vulnerable people seeking Australia's protection at risk of persecution, death or serious harm if returned to their country.


While Labor notes that complementary protection applies to only a small cohort of those who apply for refugee status but are refused, they are nonetheless an important cohort. When Labor introduced the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Act 2011, it was intended to assess and provide protection to those who do not satisfy the definition of a refugee. However, they are nonetheless provided protection on the basis that they face serious violations of their human rights if returned to their country of origin.


The changes proposed in schedule 2 of the current bill are contrary to the complementary protection framework that Labor introduced, and therefore Labor is seeking to have the bill amended to actually remove schedule 2. I welcome the government's agreement to also support this amendment, as well as, I trust, the support of the crossbench.



The CHAIRMAN:  Just for the information of the chamber, we probably jumped a little bit ahead, but we will come back to the previous amendments. Just so everyone is aware, we are not in the order of the running sheet at the moment. Senator Carr has requested that the question be put in respect of schedule 2—that is, opposition amendment (5) on sheet 7578—and that is presently the question before the chair.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (09:36):  I would like to thank the opposition for their constructive approach in relation to the negotiations for this piece of legislation. In terms of this particular amendment, for the record of the Hansard, the government believes that the changes it has proposed to complementary protection provisions in the Migration Act through this bill are fair, measured and appropriate, and I refer back to my summing-up speech, in which I outlined the reasons why we have taken this position. The government maintains that schedule 2 is an important part of this piece of legislation. However, the government has noted the voting intention of the majority of senators in the chamber and will not be calling for a division on the opposition amendment.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Excuse me, Chair. I am just going to ask for this conversation to happen a little more quietly so I can continue speaking, if that is all right. Can you just be a little quieter.


The Australian Greens support this amendment. We are very concerned, of course, about changing the risk threshold. While I understand that the government believe that their assessment has been that it was needed, I am thankful that it proves that in this place, when you have senators that are concerned and listen to what the experts say, particularly through the inquiry process, we are able to make positive changes to government legislation. I commend the opposition and my fellow crossbenchers for standing strong on this particular point.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-03-25,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:40):  The Greens oppose item 14 of schedule 1 in the following terms:


(5) Schedule 1, item 14, page 8 (lines 1 to 15), to be opposed.


This amendment goes to dealing with concerns that many experts and others had in relation to this bill with the difficulties for asylum seekers who have new information that would strengthen their claim—or, indeed, things perhaps may have changed over the long period of time that we know people have been waiting for their claims to be processed.


We have to remember here that this legislation is going to impact directly on people who are part of what has been referred to by the government as the legacy caseload. There are around 30,000 people whose claims either have not started to be assessed yet or are part of the way through. Many of those people have already been in Australia for three or four years. The circumstances in their home countries have perhaps changed. The issues that they have dealt with while they have been held in immigration detention may have impacted on their ability to give clarity to their case and information. Also, of course, one of the things that I am extremely concerned about is the impact on people's claims, through no fault of their own but through the lax management of people's data, such as when the immigration department accidentally uploaded the personal information of over 10,000 asylum seekers. You would remember, Mr Chairman, this happened a number of years ago. All of those people have now been put at further risk because of that data breach.


We need to ensure that, if new information becomes available and was not included the first time round, there is an ability for that to be included, without punishment, without fear of raising those issues and without a negative impact on people. It strikes me that this legislation before us, as it is, punishes people for circumstances that are often out of their control and out of their hands. If new information becomes available, it should be able to be included, particularly when we talk about people's identity documents and clarifying exactly who they are and where they are. People should not be punished because of things that perhaps have changed over the last three or four years as they have been waiting desperately to have their claims assessed.


That is why I propose Australian Greens amendment (5): because we need to make sure we are not unduly dismissing somebody's legitimate claim because we are not recognising the realities that people face fleeing persecution and then the hardships that they have had to endure while they have been here in Australia effectively on a freeze in terms of their assessment, which has forced new, subsequent information to now have a very direct impact on their ability to be safe or, indeed, to be put in further danger if they are sent home.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-03-25,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (09:44):  The government will not be supporting the Greens amendment. The amendment opposes and seeks to remove the requirement under proposed section 423A that a tribunal is to draw an inference unfavourable to the credibility of a claim or evidence unless the applicant has a reasonable explanation for not providing it before the primary decision. Together with proposed section 5AAA, the intent of proposed section 423A is to encourage the comprehensive and timely presentation of all claims and evidence in support of a protection visa application and to discourage the late presentation of claims or evidence unless the applicant has a reasonable explanation for doing so. When considering what is a reasonable explanation, tribunal members will take into account factors such as the applicant being a minor, a sufferer of torture or trauma, or a person with a mental or physical impairment. The provision is intended to facilitate a tribunal member in dealing with an application for a protection visa where new claims and evidence have been raised simply to prolong an applicant's stay in Australia rather than due to a genuine need for protection. The tribunal has procedural fairness requirements which require it to give the applicant an opportunity to explain late or new claims in evidence. I again confirm, for the benefit of the chamber, that the government has tabled additional information in the addendum to the explanatory memorandum which explains the existing requirements.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:46):  I just have a question for the minister, in clarification of why the minister and the government believe this particular part of the legislation is important. You referred to taking into consideration those who had suffered torture and trauma. I would just like to know whether that includes the torture and trauma of being indefinitely detained in an offshore detention centre.

 (South Australia) (09:53):  That is right.



The CHAIRMAN:  Thank you, Senator. Then maybe we should now move to your amendment (5) on sheet 7683.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  My understanding is that was consequential as well.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question would be that part 3 of schedule 1 stand as printed.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I think we will move on from that amendment if that is okay.



The CHAIRMAN:  Thank you.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I would like to go to amendments (1) to (5) on sheet 7675. These are fairly basic amendments. They deal with removing the retrospectivity elements of this bill across all of the schedules—1, 2, 3 and 4. They speak for themselves. We should not, in this place, be creating legislation that is retrospective in its impact and its nature to pull the rug out from under people. It is a basic concept that we apply across the board when we are debating issues in this place that you do not make things retrospective.



These amendments are fairly simple. They just say that, from the moment that this bill passes and has royal assent, that is when these new rules will apply. We should not be trying to change the rules backwards, which is effectively what the government is doing by having these retrospective elements in the legislation. Of course, I am concerned about the very real impact that will have on asylum seekers who do have their claims already on foot. I do not think it is fair at all, but it is a broader point than that. This is actually about ensuring that we stick by the basic notion that you do not make laws in this place retrospective.


Because these amendments are all of the same nature, I seek leave to move them all together.


Leave granted.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I move Greens amendments (1) to (5) on sheet 7675 revised:


 (1) Schedule 1, item 15, page 9 (lines 3 to 12), omit subitems (1) and (2), substitute:


(1) Section 5AAA of the Migration Act 1958 as amended by Part 1 of this Schedule applies to an application made on or after the commencement of that Part.


(2) Section 5AAA of the Migration Act 1958 as amended by Part 1 of this Schedule also applies in relation to an administrative process starting on or after the commencement of that Part.


(2) Schedule 1, item 15, page 9 (lines 13 to 17), omit subitem (3), substitute:


(3) Sections 91W, 91WA and 91WB of the Migration Act 1958 as amended by Part 2 of this Schedule apply to an application for a protection visa made on or after the commencement of that Part.


(3) Schedule 2, item 6, page 12 (lines 21 to 30), omit subitem (2), substitute:


(2) Subitem (1) covers an assessment made on or after the day this item commences.

14 Application of amendments



   The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to a person who arrives in Australia after the day this item commences (whether or not that person had been in Australia previously).

   The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to an application to the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal for review of a decision if the application is made on or after the commencement of this Schedule.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-03-25,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (09:56):  Again, the government will not be supporting the Australian Greens amendments. These amendments in the bill, contrary to what Senator Hanson-Young has said, are not retrospective—that is, they do not take effect prior to their commencement date. They operate prospectively, albeit in respect of already existing protection visa applications or administrative assessments.


In relation to proposed section 5AAA, the onus on the applicant, there is already an obligation on an asylum seeker to present all of their claims and evidence up-front. In relation to the amendments to sections 91W and 91WA, identity documents, these amendments do not change an existing obligation on the part of a person seeking protection in Australia to provide documentary evidence of identity, nationality or citizenship. In relation to new section 91WB, applications for protection visas by members of the family unit, this does not change the way the current provisions in the Migration Act operate in relation to how members of the same family unit of protection visa holders are dealt with. This amendment simply puts beyond doubt what the current interpretation of the act is.


In relation to schedule 3, making the amendments apply to new arrivals means that it will not capture UMAs or transitory persons already in Australia and living in the community who are currently section 91K barred to be instead made 46A or 46B barred. This will therefore not achieve the intended effect of schedule 3: to streamline the application bars for UMAs and transitory persons.


In relation to schedule 4, the tribunal efficiency measures, the purpose of making the amendments apply to existing applications before the tribunal is to maximise the number of applications affected by these changes, which provide increased efficiency and consistency of decision making.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:58):  I accept the government's argument. It seemed a bit muddled—both prospective in its nature and impacting on things that have already happened. It seems to be retrospective in my understanding of the term. I am disappointed that the government continue to pretend that this is not retrospective. It clearly is. The reason it is is that they want it to impact on as many people as possible. It is simply not fair. I accept, though, that the government have not listened to that argument.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (10:05):  I rise to move amendments to the Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014 on behalf of the government. First, I advise the chamber that the government will not be seeking to move amendments (1) to (10) on sheet ZA361 as a result of the concerns raised in relation to the amendments in schedule 2 to the bill, which provides for the more likely than not risk threshold for assessing complementary protection. As I have already stated, the government will not be actively opposing its removal, which has now occurred. In terms of the remainder of the government's amendments, I seek leave to move amendments (11) to (20) on sheet ZA361 together.


Leave granted.




Senator CASH:
  I move:


(11) Schedule 3, item 1, page 16 (lines 7 to 10), omit paragraph (b), substitute:


   (b) either:


      (i) is an unlawful non‑citizen; or


      (ii) holds a bridging visa or a temporary protection visa, or a temporary visa of a kind (however described) prescribed for the purposes of this subparagraph.


Note: Temporary protection visas are provided for by subsection 35A(3).


(12) Schedule 3, item 6, page 17 (lines 11 to 14), omit paragraph (b), substitute:

(15) Schedule 3, item 16, page 20 (line 13), omit ""class"", substitute ""kind"".


(16) Schedule 3, item 16, page 20 (line 19), at the end of paragraph (3)(c), add ""granted before 2 December 2013"".


(17) Schedule 4, item 11, page 23 (line 30), omit ""7 days"", substitute ""14 days"".


(18) Schedule 4, item 11, page 24 (lines 20 and 21), omit ""7‑day period"", substitute ""14‑day period"".


(19) Schedule 4, item 26, page 32 (line 3), omit ""7 days"", substitute ""14 days"".


(20) Schedule 4, item 26, page 32 (lines 24 and 25), omit ""7‑day period"", substitute ""14‑day period"".


In response to the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, schedule 4 to the bill will be amended to increase the time frame, from seven to 14 days, in which an application for reinstatement may be made by an applicant who failed to appear before the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal and whose review application was subsequently dismissed as a result of that nonattendance.


The government also moves technical amendments to the bill, including to schedule 3 to take into account the reintroduction of temporary protection visas by the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014. This amendment extends the statutory visa application bar by providing that unauthorised maritime arrivals or transitory persons who are the holders of a temporary protection visa are prevented from making a valid visa application unless the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection determines it is in the public interest to do so. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

 (Victoria) (09:34):  The opposition opposes schedule 2 in the following terms:


(5) Schedule 2, page 10 (line 1) to page 15 (line 9), to be opposed.


Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to make significant changes to the way in which Australia will determine if it has protection obligations in relation to certain non-citizens. Specifically, the bill inserts a new section 6A that provides that a non-citizen is not entitled to complementary protection unless the person can prove that it is more likely than not that he or she will suffer significant harm if removed from Australia. Currently, the 'real chance' test means that a person must not be returned to a situation where there is a real chance that they would face significant harm. This means a chance which is not remote or insubstantial but which may be below 50 per cent and may be as low as 10 per cent. These changes have the potential to put vulnerable people seeking Australia's protection at risk of persecution, death or serious harm if returned to their country.


While Labor notes that complementary protection applies to only a small cohort of those who apply for refugee status but are refused, they are nonetheless an important cohort.

The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that schedule 2 stand as printed.


Question negatived.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Carr, given that this is a related matter, maybe you could move amendment (1) on sheet 7578 now. It is on the same matter.

The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Carr, would you be happy to move your amendments (2) and (3) on sheet 7578 by leave together?

  Mr Chairman, it is not our intention to proceed with those amendments.

The CHAIRMAN:  The opposition have indicated they are not proceeding with amendments (2) and (3) on sheet 7578.

  And (4); we are not proceeding with (4).



The CHAIRMAN:  And the opposition have indicated, for the chamber's information, that they will not be proceeding with amendment (4) on sheet 7578. On that page of the running sheet, what is left is amendment (5) of the Australian Greens.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-03-25,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:40):  The Greens oppose item 14 of schedule 1 in the following terms:


(5) Schedule 1, item 14, page 8 (lines 1 to 15), to be opposed.


This amendment goes to dealing with concerns that many experts and others had in relation to this bill with the difficulties for asylum seekers who have new information that would strengthen their claim—or, indeed, things perhaps may have changed over the long period of time that we know people have been waiting for their claims to be processed.


We have to remember here that this legislation is going to impact directly on people who are part of what has been referred to by the government as the legacy caseload. There are around 30,000 people whose claims either have not started to be assessed yet or are part of the way through. Many of those people have already been in Australia for three or four years. The circumstances in their home countries have perhaps changed. The issues that they have dealt with while they have been held in immigration detention may have impacted on their ability to give clarity to their case and information. Also, of course, one of the things that I am extremely concerned about is the impact on people's claims, through no fault of their own but through the lax management of people's data, such as when the immigration department accidentally uploaded the personal information of over 10,000 asylum seekers. You would remember, Mr Chairman, this happened a number of years ago. All of those people have now been put at further risk because of that data breach.


We need to ensure that, if new information becomes available and was not included the first time round, there is an ability for that to be included, without punishment, without fear of raising those issues and without a negative impact on people. It strikes me that this legislation before us, as it is, punishes people for circumstances that are often out of their control and out of their hands. If new information becomes available, it should be able to be included, particularly when we talk about people's identity documents and clarifying exactly who they are and where they are. People should not be punished because of things that perhaps have changed over the last three or four years as they have been waiting desperately to have their claims assessed.


That is why I propose Australian Greens amendment (5): because we need to make sure we are not unduly dismissing somebody's legitimate claim because we are not recognising the realities that people face fleeing persecution and then the hardships that they have had to endure while they have been here in Australia effectively on a freeze in terms of their assessment, which has forced new, subsequent information to now have a very direct impact on their ability to be safe or, indeed, to be put in further danger if they are sent home.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (09:44):  The government will not be supporting the Greens amendment. The amendment opposes and seeks to remove the requirement under proposed section 423A that a tribunal is to draw an inference unfavourable to the credibility of a claim or evidence unless the applicant has a reasonable explanation for not providing it before the primary decision. Together with proposed section 5AAA, the intent of proposed section 423A is to encourage the comprehensive and timely presentation of all claims and evidence in support of a protection visa application and to discourage the late presentation of claims or evidence unless the applicant has a reasonable explanation for doing so. When considering what is a reasonable explanation, tribunal members will take into account factors such as the applicant being a minor, a sufferer of torture or trauma, or a person with a mental or physical impairment. The provision is intended to facilitate a tribunal member in dealing with an application for a protection visa where new claims and evidence have been raised simply to prolong an applicant's stay in Australia rather than due to a genuine need for protection. The tribunal has procedural fairness requirements which require it to give the applicant an opportunity to explain late or new claims in evidence. I again confirm, for the benefit of the chamber, that the government has tabled additional information in the addendum to the explanatory memorandum which explains the existing requirements.

The CHAIRMAN:  The question would be that part 3 of schedule 1 stand as printed.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I think we will move on from that amendment if that is okay.



The CHAIRMAN:  Thank you.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I would like to go to amendments (1) to (5) on sheet 7675. These are fairly basic amendments. They deal with removing the retrospectivity elements of this bill across all of the schedules—1, 2, 3 and 4. They speak for themselves. We should not, in this place, be creating legislation that is retrospective in its impact and its nature to pull the rug out from under people. It is a basic concept that we apply across the board when we are debating issues in this place that you do not make things retrospective.



These amendments are fairly simple. They just say that, from the moment that this bill passes and has royal assent, that is when these new rules will apply. We should not be trying to change the rules backwards, which is effectively what the government is doing by having these retrospective elements in the legislation. Of course, I am concerned about the very real impact that will have on asylum seekers who do have their claims already on foot. I do not think it is fair at all, but it is a broader point than that. This is actually about ensuring that we stick by the basic notion that you do not make laws in this place retrospective.


Because these amendments are all of the same nature, I seek leave to move them all together.


Leave granted.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I move Greens amendments (1) to (5) on sheet 7675 revised:


 (1) Schedule 1, item 15, page 9 (lines 3 to 12), omit subitems (1) and (2), substitute:


(1) Section 5AAA of the Migration Act 1958 as amended by Part 1 of this Schedule applies to an application made on or after the commencement of that Part.


(2) Section 5AAA of the Migration Act 1958 as amended by Part 1 of this Schedule also applies in relation to an administrative process starting on or after the commencement of that Part.


(2) Schedule 1, item 15, page 9 (lines 13 to 17), omit subitem (3), substitute:


(3) Sections 91W, 91WA and 91WB of the Migration Act 1958 as amended by Part 2 of this Schedule apply to an application for a protection visa made on or after the commencement of that Part.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-03-25,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (09:56):  Again, the government will not be supporting the Australian Greens amendments. These amendments in the bill, contrary to what Senator Hanson-Young has said, are not retrospective—that is, they do not take effect prior to their commencement date. They operate prospectively, albeit in respect of already existing protection visa applications or administrative assessments.


In relation to proposed section 5AAA, the onus on the applicant, there is already an obligation on an asylum seeker to present all of their claims and evidence up-front. In relation to the amendments to sections 91W and 91WA, identity documents, these amendments do not change an existing obligation on the part of a person seeking protection in Australia to provide documentary evidence of identity, nationality or citizenship. In relation to new section 91WB, applications for protection visas by members of the family unit, this does not change the way the current provisions in the Migration Act operate in relation to how members of the same family unit of protection visa holders are dealt with. This amendment simply puts beyond doubt what the current interpretation of the act is.


In relation to schedule 3, making the amendments apply to new arrivals means that it will not capture UMAs or transitory persons already in Australia and living in the community who are currently section 91K barred to be instead made 46A or 46B barred. This will therefore not achieve the intended effect of schedule 3: to streamline the application bars for UMAs and transitory persons.


In relation to schedule 4, the tribunal efficiency measures, the purpose of making the amendments apply to existing applications before the tribunal is to maximise the number of applications affected by these changes, which provide increased efficiency and consistency of decision making.

It seems to be retrospective in my understanding of the term. I am disappointed that the government continue to pretend that this is not retrospective. It clearly is. The reason it is is that they want it to impact on as many people as possible. It is simply not fair. I accept, though, that the government have not listened to that argument.

First, I advise the chamber that the government will not be seeking to move amendments (1) to (10) on sheet ZA361 as a result of the concerns raised in relation to the amendments in schedule 2 to the bill, which provides for the more likely than not risk threshold for assessing complementary protection. As I have already stated, the government will not be actively opposing its removal, which has now occurred.

      (i) is an unlawful non‑citizen; or


      (ii) holds a bridging visa or a temporary protection visa, or a temporary visa of a kind (however described) prescribed for the purposes of this subparagraph.

(18) Schedule 4, item 11, page 24 (lines 20 and 21), omit ""7‑day period"", substitute ""14‑day period"".


(19) Schedule 4, item 26, page 32 (line 3), omit ""7 days"", substitute ""14 days"".


(20) Schedule 4, item 26, page 32 (lines 24 and 25), omit ""7‑day period"", substitute ""14‑day period"".


In response to the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, schedule 4 to the bill will be amended to increase the time frame, from seven to 14 days, in which an application for reinstatement may be made by an applicant who failed to appear before the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal and whose review application was subsequently dismissed as a result of that nonattendance.


The government also moves technical amendments to the bill, including to schedule 3 to take into account the reintroduction of temporary protection visas by the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014. This amendment extends the statutory visa application bar by providing that unauthorised maritime arrivals or transitory persons who are the holders of a temporary protection visa are prevented from making a valid visa application unless the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection determines it is in the public interest to do so. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2015-03-25,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  I rise to speak about the important day coming up in New South Wales this Saturday. Of course, it is the state election. The New South Wales people have a simple decision to make: do they re-elect the Liberal-National government of Mike Baird and Troy Grant? I make the point that four years ago when a coalition government was elected to power in New South Wales the state was running at No. 7. What I mean by that is that, of the six states and two territories, it was seventh out of eight on performing economies. It is now No. 1. It has gone from No. 7 to No. 1 in just four years.


The people of New South Wales have an option: re-elect the coalition government led by Premier Mike Baird and Deputy Premier Troy Grant or be fooled by the untruths and scaremongering by the Labor Party and the trade union movement. Even the Labor leading lights of previous years are disgusted with what they are hearing. Who said this? Who said:


… lie after desperate lie is being thrown at the public in an attempt to frighten the electorate into rejecting the Baird government's … sensible reforms …


Senator O'Sullivan might ask the question: who would have said that? Was it Premier Mike Baird? No, it was not. Was it Deputy Premier Troy Grant? No. It was actually former New South Wales Labor Treasurer Michael Costa! I will repeat what he said: 'Lie after desperate lie is being thrown at the public in an attempt to frighten the electorate into rejecting the Baird government's sensible reforms.' Mr Costa also said the unions have already cost the New South Wales public $10 billion by knifing the power privatisation he and Morris Iemma attempted in 2008.


Here is another quote. Former federal resources Minister Martin Ferguson said recently that the New South Wales trade unions and New South Wales Labor are deliberately misleading the public by telling them the proposed privatisation of the electricity networks will drive up electricity prices. Mr. Ferguson said:


""It's … creating unnecessary fear and trying to scare people into voting for Labor not on merit but on misinformation … In many ways I am ashamed of the Party.""


Former state Labor Treasurer Michael Egan said in 1997:


I am pressing on with electricity privatisation because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, I think it is the best course for New South Wales … job creation in New South Wales and every community throughout every nook and cranny …


In July 2008, former Labor Premier Barry Unsworth said:


""Transport, health, public security: all these matters are ones which in my view have a greater priority than who delivers electricity through your meter … the problem we have got here is that we've got some Luddites here in NSW that can't comprehend that.""


Then we have former Prime Minister Paul Keating backing privatisation, as does former Labor leader Mark Latham. The ACCC, the Productivity Commission and peak business organisations have all called for privatisation.


It is amazing that the Electrical Trade Union is running around the state claiming the sky will fall in if New South Wales power assets are privatised, and yet, when Labor was in power, electricity prices increased by 60 per cent over five years. Sixty per cent over five years is how much electricity prices went up when the Labor government was in power in New South Wales. The Australian newspaper of 11 March reported that Australians who live in states with privatised electricity supplies have faced smaller price rises over the past two decades than their counterparts in other states.


The fact is New South Wales are leasing, not selling. They are not going to privatise the whole network. They are going to lease 49 per cent of the power assets. One thing is that Essential Energy is going to be quarantined from that lease. It will remain in public hands. If you go out to rural and regional New South Wales, Essential Energy is the provider. So I am very pleased that the Nationals have secured the quarantine from that lease of Essential Energy.


Of the $20 billion expected to flow from this leasing, $6 billion will be spent in regional New South Wales. This will be spent on roads and bridges, on health and education, and on helping our regional communities. An example is health. Health has always been a big priority for the Nationals. Nationals members live in rural communities and they do not just read about problems like the distance to hospitals and medical services; they live in their communities and experience the very same problems.


Look at what the Nationals members in regional New South Wales have delivered. I refer to Kevin Anderson, the member for Tamworth. Kevin fought hard to secure $100 million from the state for the Tamworth Hospital upgrade on top of the federal government's $120 million. The new hospital includes 81 additional treatment spaces, including 32 extra beds. Kevin Anderson also secured $300,000 for the upgrade of the Gunnedah hospital emergency department.


There is great news, also, for people in the Northern Rivers. When the people wanted a champion to take up the fight to have the Lismore Base Hospital upgraded, they turned to the member for Lismore, Mr Thomas George. As a result, a re-elected Nationals team in government will deliver $180 million to finally complete the Lismore Base Hospital. That is a great win for Thomas George in that area. There will be a helipad on top of the main tower, new operating theatres, a maternity suite, a paediatric unit, a medical imaging centre and more beds. The Northern Rivers community is grateful they have a local champion in Thomas George.


The communities of Inverell and Armidale are rejoicing at news delivered to them by the member for Northern Tablelands. In the company of state Nationals leader Troy Grant, local member Adam Marshall announced the Armidale Hospital redevelopment would get $60 million and Inverell District Hospital—Inverell is where I live—would get a $30 million upgrade. For many, many years both communities have been crying out for an upgrade and, again, it has taken a Nationals member to deliver in a New South Wales coalition government.


Just down the road from here in the Monaro electorate, John Barilaro stepped in and got the Cooma dialysis unit up and running and got an upgrade of Cooma District Hospital. When it comes to health, this New South Wales coalition government has spent over $1 billion upgrading hospitals and has outlined plans to spend another $2 billion in the communities I have mentioned, plus in areas such as the Tweed, Mudgee and Coffs Harbour.


Likewise, in relation to roads and bridges, I was in the Upper Hunter recently for the announcement of some excellent road funding. Hopefully this Saturday the member for Upper Hunter, George Souris, will be handing the baton across to Michael Johnsen, the Mayor of Upper Hunter Shire Council.


Four years ago the Nationals announced Resources for Regions, and it was estimated $160 million would be spent in mining-affected communities. In fact, $217 million flowed in, and this program will continue. Resources for Regions is allowing the upgrade of major roads in the Singleton shire, $2 million for an overtaking lane on the New England Highway and $4 million for Muswellbrook Shire Council to upgrade a number of local roads used by mining-related vehicles.


I come back to the record of the Nationals in government in New South Wales: $13 billion for better roads, hospitals and schools; more than 2,000 extra nurses, teachers and police in our communities; 25,000 more jobs in regional New South Wales; and a plan to invest $6 billion into new and improved roads, rail networks, water supplies and hospitals.


The facts can certainly be lost in the hysteria and, as I have said in this chamber before, there should be no mining on prime agricultural land, and the Liverpool Plains is off limits. But we have people like the failed Independent, Peter Draper, who was thrown out by the people at the last election and is attempting get his old job back, running around claiming to be the Messiah when it comes to mining. Mr Draper was in state parliament as the member for Tamworth and did absolutely nothing when Labor handed out licence after licence—he sat there mute.


 Before I finish, I want to say thank you and well-served to five retiring Nationals. Firstly, Andrew Stoner steps down after a stellar career serving the people of Oxley since 1999, and having been Leader of the New South Wales Nationals from 2003 to 2014. Andrew will always be remembered as the man who kept the Nationals together during some tough times, when there were plenty who were predicting the demise of the party. He kept the party together, and I wish him and Cathy and family all the best for the future.


Another former party leader, George Souris, also retires on Saturday. George has been the member for Upper Hunter since 1988—that is what you call electorate loyalty. He was state leader from 1999 to 2003 and in his time held a number of ministerial portfolios. I wish Vassy and George all the best as George finally walks out of Macquarie Street.


Bowing out also is the member for Ballina, Don Page, taking a break for the first time since his election to the seat in 1988. Don was also Deputy Leader of the Nationals from 2002 to 2007 and a minister in the current government. My best wishes go to Don and Liz.


My namesake in state parliament, John Williams, lost his seat due to a redistribution. We refer to him as John 'not Wacka' Williams, to distinguish between John and me. John was a great champion of the far western region and flew his aeroplane around so that he could cover the 250,000 square kilometres of the electorate.


To my good friend Jenny Gardner MLC: all the best to you, Jenny, after many years of good service. (Time expired)

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either an answer or an explanation.


Firstly, I will explain that my office has been in contact with the minister's office, in fact, on several occasions over the last couple of days—




Senator Fifield:
  With my office?




Senator SIEWERT:
  Yes, with your office. My office has been in contact with your office on several occasions over the last couple of days about the answer to this question because we are very keen to get a copy of this report. The reason I am asking now, I should say up-front, is that this pertains very clearly to the effectiveness of remote communities. Of course, that is on everyone's minds at the moment with the consideration of the government in Western Australia of closing up to 150 communities. This pertains to a program that, from what I understand, has had some important impacts and also looks at how we could support remote communities better.


This example relates to the East Kimberley, as I said, but it is particularly pertinent to the remote community of Ringer Soak. Ringer Soak is located in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. It is approximately 100 kilometres from the Northern Territory border. It consists of about 100 people. There are about six members of the community who are non-Aboriginal, so it is an Aboriginal community. It is about three hours drive from Halls Creek, which is the next largest population centre.


In 2010 the federal Attorney-General, in collaboration with the then FaHCSIA department, commenced the Indigenous Justice Program in this Aboriginal community and also in 15 other communities within the Kimberley region. I have been contacted by people who worked on the program and worked in the community at the time who have particularly community development skills and mental health expertise. They describe the federal Indigenous Justice Program as being tasked to primarily focus on young Indigenous men and having five clear goals: less trouble with the police; less time before the courts; less incarceration; less trouble with alcohol and drugs; and less incidence of youth suicide. In other words, it is focused on the key areas when you are talking about some of the issues that cause disadvantage in Aboriginal communities.


One of the workers describes being in Halls Creek in February 2010 along with the Indigenous Justice Program workers from the neighbouring communities. Those workers were provided a summary of the project by the Western Australian Attorney-General's delegate. They said they identified those five goals because, 'They cost us a fortune to address, they are interrelated and they can cause enormous suffering to individuals, their families and wider communities.' They said, 'If we had some guaranteed methods for achieving the five goals of this program, we would be training you as to how to foster these. But, as you know, the rate of incarceration and youth suicide in this demographic, already the highest in the country, is increasing and we have no pat solutions to teach. That is why we are investing in this program. For this reason, you are being asked to live and work in these communities for three years and to address our quarterly reporting procedures.' They were asked to explain the five goals to their respective community councils, sit with the old people and discuss the goals and build a rapport with the young people and then be directed by the community councils in these centres as to what they would do and how to achieve these five goals. The workers said: 'The quarterly reporting was designed to capture information relating to these five goals and allow for analysis and comparison between the six communities of the project and look then at the conclusions. Whatever successes stand out from this analysis, we hope to be able to copy and reuse elsewhere.' Again, you can see why it is really important for us to have the review of the program, to see what actually does work. The program, which commenced in late 2009 and early 2010, was a bit delayed, but it was carried out and the review was done in 2012 by Allen Consulting Group, who we know have carried out these sorts of analyses in the past. 


We believe it is really important that this report be made available, and that is why I have had people contacting me to ask for this review to be made available. I am renewing this call for it to be made available because of the current debate that is going on. These continue to be five burning issues for the families living in these communities and for other communities. To date, this report has not been released to the public, and people are asking for it to be released so that we can learn what happened in this particular project. You will understand from the goals and the way I have just described it that it is a rather unique project that I hope has a lot of learnings for the community. That is why I asked the minister for an explanation, and I would like to move that that report be made available publicly by the end of March.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:10):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to a question without notice asked by Senator Conroy today relating to the manufacture of the next fleet of Australian submarines.


Today Labor has extended the hand of bipartisanship to the government on submarines. As we all know, this decision will transcend governments and generations. It is one of the most important defence capability decisions that our country will ever make. Prior to the 2013 election, there was bipartisan support for the future of the submarine project—genuine bipartisan support. That promise was to build our future submarines in Australia. But, since coming to government, the Prime Minister has been crab-walking away from that promise. It is an open secret. Even Senator Edwards must know by now that the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, has a handshake deal with Japan to build our new submarines. It is also clear that, to save his own job, he traded submarines for votes in the Liberal party room. To win those votes, the government has announced a sham competitive evaluation process. But be in no doubt, Senator Edwards and those opposite: this process is being retrofitted to still deliver the Prime Minister his captain's pick for having the submarines built in Japan. 


The dysfunction and chaos within the Liberal Party is infecting the submarine decision. Senator Abetz may not be in the NSC—I am not sure—but if he was in the NSC, he was one of the ministers who sat there when they went around the table last October with officials and ministers—and I hope Senator Edwards is listening—and said 'yes' or 'no', 'deal with Japan', 'no tender', 'build in Japan', and 'we announce it with Prime Minister Abe in November at G20'. So, Senator Abetz, if you were a member of the NSC, you know that is the truth. And I accept that if you were not, you may not have been privy to it, because they did not want to bring it to cabinet. But they drew up the press releases in the Department of Defence. They drew them up for an announcement in November of this year. So poor Senator Edwards was sitting there last year being treated like a mushroom by his own frontbench, by his own ministers on the NSC. He was treated like a mushroom, just like every other person in South Australia. 


That is why we offer the opportunity today; we reach out and we say that we have outlined a fair and proper process to deliver the best submarine for Australia at the most effective price for taxpayers. The key criterion is to ensure that future submarines are built in Australia. This is a return to the bipartisanship that we saw before the elections. 


We are not the only political party offering such a deal. The conservative British Prime Minister David Cameron recognises how important it is for the United Kingdom to build and maintain its own warships. Under Labor's process we would include France, Germany, Japan and Sweden in the competitive tender. We would ensure that the final bids guarantee submarine performance and Australian ownership of all intellectual property.


This is the test for new today: in your five-minute contribution, Senator Edwards, will you make a commitment that the next generation of submarines is built, maintained and sustained in Australia? All you are being asked to do today is to be bipartisan. Build them, maintain them and sustained them here in Australia or are you going to cave-in to the captain's pick again— (Time expired)

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:15):  What a disingenuous rant that was! Let me talk to you about crab-walking. Where was Senator Conroy—when he was in cabinet—when he was crab-walking from Defence Minister Fitzgibbon? Where was he when Minister Faulkner was crab-walking from the issue of the submarine build?




Senator Conroy:
  Not on the NSC.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Where were you, Senator Conroy, when Minister Smith did the same? There were three defence ministers in six years in the Defence portfolio. How trite of you to come in here and accuse us of inaction in building submarines, when you sucked $16.3 billion out of the Defence budget and left it in a complete vacuum. Senator Gallacher was down there that day, along with the other South Australian Senators when the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, did his big xenophobic rant on the back of a truck—




Senator Gallacher:
  Mr Deputy President, I would like to point out that I was not there; I was in Tasmania.




Senator Abetz:
  That is better than being in South Australia.




Senator EDWARDS:
  I respect the interjection from Senator Gallacher, because I know that if he could have gone to a further place— if he could have got to Norfolk Island that day for a hearing—he probably would have. I know him to be a fair and reasonable person. I have worked with Senator Gallacher, and there is not an island far enough away that he could have found himself on that day. There was not a place he would not hidden that day to get away from the rant of the Leader of the Opposition, who was spruiking the Labor lines down there to the handful of fluoro-vested union spruikers, working up fear and loathing about the government. 


We are actually doing something. Senator Conroy, I hope you are listening because it was only a few Fridays ago that the Abbott government dealt Australian shipbuilders into the largest defence procurement project in the Commonwealth's history. What a day that was! Now we have some action. Do you know what we have going on in Adelaide over the next couple of days? We have a submarine convention going on. When did we have one of those in the glorious days of submarine building in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd reign that sucked the Defence budget dry? The light at the end of the tunnel is no longer a freight train, as it was when the Labor party was in power, it is now is a build.




Senator Conroy:
  A build in Japan!




Senator EDWARDS:
  Australian shipbuilders, if they get their act together, have the opportunity to build a submarine force that is world-class, as the Collins class was. Now they have an opportunity to do it. If the union movement came together, stopped protesting and sharpened their pencils to get together with management of ASC and other shipbuilders like Forgacs and Osborne. If they realised that, they would have a real shot at this. 'Do not waste a nanosecond' is my message to the union movement, which has been crying this opportunity but which has been ranting and raving—




Senator Conroy:
  You're building them in Japan.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Senator Conroy, I listen to them and I have heard the experts. That is why I have made the representations that I have and I stand behind them. But do not shrilly come in here, lecturing us about crab walking. It is absolute hypocrisy.





Senator Conroy:
  You have been treated like a mushroom.




Senator EDWARDS:
  I wish I had another five minutes. For almost 80 Defence acquisitions completed by Labor after July 2007, nearly 70 per cent were single-sourced procurements. So much for Labor's commitment to open tenders. If you were actually committed— (Time expired)

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:21):  I would like to put on the record very early in the piece some comments that have been made around the Collins class submarine. Ian Mcphedran said: 


In what has been regarded as one of the most incredible naval shipbuilding feats of the modern era, the first Swedish designed Collins class submarine, HMAS Collins was commissioned from a former greenfield site at Port Adelaide in July 1996, just nine years after the project began. The Collins class boats are extremely stealthy and have been known to sneak right under US aircraft carriers to photograph their keels.


So we have a very successful base here. We have world recognised technology efficiency and shipbuilding capability in these submarines. What we do not have, if I can use Senator Abetz's metaphor from his generous contribution to Senator Lundy yesterday, is people looking forward and telling the South Australian community that we need to do this build, design, sustain, maintain in Australia. We have to use his analogy—looking one way and doing another. That is exactly what this coalition government is doing—looking one way and saying: 'Nothing to see here, South Australian public. We will give you 500 jobs.' There was that debacle of a press conference where it came out that the minister was unable to describe what competitive evaluation was but said, 'Don't worry; there will be 500 jobs in it.' 


We really need to go back and revisit some of the earlier contributions. When we questioned the Defence minister we were labelled incongruous and stupid. He then went on to say that the ASC could not build a canoe, when all of the evidence in South Australia with the supplement that has been read by thousands of South Australians this week is to the contrary.


What happened is our Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Japan got together and did a deal. As Senator Conroy said, the National Security Committee ticked off on revoking the promise that we would build 12 submarines right here in Adelaide. That went out the window, and if you want to go into it deeper, Senator Cormann and the Hon. Joe Hockey said, 'Where are we going to save some more money? Slash and burn—who cares about South Australia?' They now have to revisit that because there is such widely-held and deeply-felt antagonism to this position put by this coalition government that people's seats are in jeopardy.


We know from the by-election results of Davenport and Fisher that people are prepared to change their mind about who they support on this issue. And why should we have Senator Birmingham touting programs of training and employer positions, which are all valuable, but there is never a word said about his own state? Never a word is said about ASC. Never a word is said about the small businesses, the people who need these opportunities in South Australia. Not a word is said about the destruction that the closure of Holden will cause in our northern suburbs. If we do not do this design, build and sustain in South Australia, it will be cumulative. He is out there announcing good programs but he is not at home defending his own state.


We know that the member for Hindmarsh is, at every opportunity, trying to defend himself in that electorate, which is a very marginal electorate. We know that Andrew Southcott is increasingly concerned and has fronted up behind any opportunity to get some profile in this argument. But unless they actually agree to what has been put to them today, they are going to pay extreme electoral pain. People in South Australia want it built. They want the promise honoured. The Labor Party has stepped up in a bipartisan way today as we always have with this project. There has always been bipartisan support. The Australian National Audit Office actually says that there is bipartisan support for this naval shipbuilding capability. And it must continue in South Australia. We will take this issue on for as long as it needs to be to win it. (Time expired)

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-03-25,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (15:26):  It gives me pleasure to speak in this debate because I want to highlight that Labor were in power, allegedly, between 2007 and 2013. They were in power, they were in government, they were in ministerial leather but they were incapable of making a decision on the submarine fleet. Their failure to make a decision and their failure to think about the future defence needs of this country has risked a credibility gap between the ageing Collins fleet and the future submarines. Now Labor want to spend another five years on a tender process. It is rich of Labor, it is typically hypocritical of Labor to call for an open tender process given that back in 2007 Prime Minister Rudd said that Labor would bypass a tender process for submarines. Even Senator Conroy has conceded, in a masterclass in understatement regarding submarines, that it did not go as fast as everybody wanted. In fact, it did not go anywhere under Labor. They did nothing for six years while they were in-fighting amongst themselves.


In the Defence budget, Labor broke their commitment to guarantee an average of three per cent real growth in Defence spending to 2017-18 and 2.2 per cent real growth to 2030 to fund the promises made in their 2009 Defence white paper. Defence spending under Labor fell to 1.56 per cent of GDP in 2012-13. This is the lowest level of Defence funding since 1938 and that was before the outbreak of the Second World War. They cut the budget for 2012-13 by 10½ per cent. That was the biggest cut to Defence spending since the Korean War. Now Labor come into this place and reach out with their alleged hand of bipartisanship. Actually, what they do is reach out with a hand of hypocrisy and a hand of insincerity in relation to the submarines. They want to talk about a fair and proper process—I was writing the words down while the Labor senators were speaking—and they want to talk about a fair deal for taxpayers. If you want to talk about a fair deal for taxpayers, we can talk about what Labor did in relation to debt. We can talk about what Labor left here on the ministerial desks and on the credit cards and in the savings accounts of Australians—that is, the huge debt that Labor left.


The independent Parliamentary Budget Office stated in mid-2014 that, without action, Australia's debt would grow at one of the fastest rates in the developed world. We are currently paying a billion dollars a month in interest payments. That is over $12 billion a year, for those senators opposite who are not very good at counting with their shoes on. That is enough to build a world-class teaching hospital in every capital city, enough to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway and it is around half of the Defence budget. It is about the same amount as government spends on aged care. It is more than the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is more than the cost of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is more than the cost of higher education spending.


So for Labor to come into the Senate and talk about what we are doing in relation to the submarines is disappointing and hypocritical, because we have to try and clean up the mess that Labor has left behind and ensure that we get the debt down so that we deliver better services for Australian taxpayers. We also need to deliver a submarine fleet that delivers value for taxpayers. 


In terms of the acquisition strategy for future submarines we want to provide a pathway—based on a competitive evaluation process—which will maximise the involvement of Australian industry, while not compromising on capability, cost, schedule or risk. And Australia is going to need an international partner to deliver this program. France, Germany and Japan have all emerged as potential international partners, and they will be invited to participate in the competitive evaluation process that will assess their ability to partner with Australia to develop our future submarines.


As part of this evaluation process Defence will seek proposals from potential partners for pre-concept designs, options for designs built overseas or in Australia and/or a hybrid approach, and costs and schedules for each option. The future submarines program will involve an investment of around $50 billion over its full life, and it is very important that we deliver value for money for Australian taxpayers. That is what this government is going to do, rather than spitting out press releases for dirty, grubby politics, which is what Labor are currently doing.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-03-25,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:31):  I, too, would like to take note of the answers given today to Senator Conroy, which, once again, demonstrated the incredible mess that the coalition has got themselves into with regard to the future submarine project.


The government promised before the last federal election to build the 12 future submarines in my home state of South Australia, in Adelaide. We know they back flipped on that promise. We know that the hapless former defence minister slurred the Australian Submarine Corporation. And we know that the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, has done a deal with Japan to give the work to that country without any sensible, transparent and accountable tender process.


It has been a saga of dreadful mishandling of the most important procurement process ever in the history of Australia. Today, I was very proud when the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, came out and offered an olive branch to the coalition—he offered a hand to the coalition—to get this most important procurement project right. We asked for their bipartisan support to put in place a decent, accountable process—an accountable process that would deliver for Australia and for South Australia the best possible, cost-effective submarines that are suitable for Australia's security. The process would guarantee the work is retained in Australia to build and to maintain those submarines and to ensure that we have the shipbuilding skills in Australia for the future.


The process that Labor put forward today in South Australia—in my home state—would commence with the four most prominent non-nuclear submarine designers from Germany, France, Japan and Sweden. It would be a 12- to 18-month process, involving a request for proposals, a project definition study and a request for tender, with a decision taken by the end of 2016 about where we would get the design for the submarine from. It is a concrete, clear, accountable, sensible process. It is the first time we have had on the table a real process to ensure that the submarines that we desperately need in this country are built and, most importantly, maintained in Australia. 


It was disappointing that the coalition took barely any time to consider this very sensible bipartisan approach to them to fix this problem of the future submarine project. Almost immediately, the useless defence minister, Kevin Andrews, who was dumped into that position when he did not really want to be defence minister—




Senator Abetz:
  I rise on a point of order. If she is going to use those sorts of descriptions—




Senator Wong:
  She has a name: Senator McEwen.




Senator Abetz:
  When there are male senators I say 'he' and when it is a female senator I say 'she'. If there is something offensive about that of course I withdraw that.




Senator Wong:
  She has a name.




Senator Abetz:
  I assume 'hes' also have a name, Senator Wong. But that does not overcome the fact that if the senator wishes to use that sort of terminology she may as well abide by the standing orders and refer to the minister appropriately.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator McEwen, you need to refer to members or ministers in the other place by their correct titles.




Senator McEWEN:
  Thank you Mr President, I will attempt to do so, when it is warranted. 


As I was saying, what the Labor Party has put on the table today is a process that the coalition should sign-up to, because it is the most rational process. It is a reasonable process and one that will actually deliver. It was interesting that Senator Abetz had to take offence when I criticised the Minister for Defence. It just shows how rattled the coalition are by this whole process.


Many of those opposite were disappointed by Mr Abbott's captain's pick, which only came about in the context of a potential leadership spill. When his own job was threatened, Mr Abbott suddenly invented this process, and coerced the defence minister into supporting him in this so-called tender process, which was demonstrated again today by Minister for Defence, Mr Andrews, as a fig leaf for a decision that has already been made. It is a fig leaf for a decision that has already been made in a dodgy deal that the Prime Minister has stitched up with Japan, and which will dud this country, because there are no guarantees under that dodgy deal that this important work will be done in Australia, in my home state. There is no guarantee at all.


As a passionate South Australian, and a great fan of the Australian Submarine Corporation and a person determined to ensure that we have skilled manufacturing jobs in my home state of South Australia, I implore the coalition to put the past behind us and to join with Labor to ensure that this most important defence procurement project is delivered in Australia and guarantees jobs for Australians and guarantees the security of Australia into the future.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:45):  I seek leave to have my second reading speech to the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion Bill 2015, which was introduced on my behalf on 9 February, incorporated into Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



In Australia, we currently lack a comprehensive national plan to address extremism in our communities. If we are to address these issues at their root, if we are to work to prevent attitudes that accept terrorism and violence as acceptable, then we need to invest in programs that build social cohesion and work to prevent young Australians from becoming radicalised. 


As United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has said, ""the best response to a corrosive, malevolent ideology is a strong assertion of collective resistance"". It is this collective, comprehensive and unified response that the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion Bill 2014 pursues. The Bill establishes a centralised body to develop and implement key preventative programs that help stop young Australians from becoming radicalised. The Centre and its Director will focus on building social cohesion, working with communities to prevent violent extremism. Through bringing together government bodies, law enforcement agencies, academics, researchers and former extremists to consult and work together to build resilient and cohesive communities, the Centre will be well equipped to develop high quality, effective programs for social cohesion.


Currently in Australia, we are under-investing in prevention programs for young Australians at risk of involvement with extremist groups and ideology. To put it in perspective, of the $630 million Counter-Terrorism package currently being implemented by the Australian Government, just $13.4m is allocated in Australia to for prevention programs targeting young Australians involved with extremist groups. That's a mere, 0.5% of the total budget. Of this total funding, just $1 million is currently being utilised, leaving an enormous funding and capacity gap that fails our community. 


The lack of a central body dedicated to building social cohesion in our communities or preventing extremism compounds the impacts of this under-investment. Though we currently have in place individual programs such as Countering Violent Extremism, a four-year grant program that works to deter young people from extremism, this has been subject to cuts in funding at a time when we should be investing even more in such schemes. 


Furthermore, as Australian violent extremism expert Dr Anne Aly has noted, ""Other countries including the UK, Sweden and the US have non-government and not-for-profits working specifically to combat violent extremism, but in Australia much of the work is taken on by government or the research community. There are of course NGOs [Non-Government Organisations] who have developed projects that aim to address the root causes of violent extremism but there was no entity that could take on a coordinating role bringing together government, research and community. This is where we see ourselves having the most impact.""


The establishment of the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion would act to break down this siloed approach, bringing together groups from various sectors to develop effective and comprehensive policies to address radicalisation. Research and experience has proven that violent extremism is best dealt with by civil society groups, in coordination and consultation with government and law enforcement agencies. In Australia, this is illustrated in groups such as People against Violent Extremism (PAVE), which grew out of recognition that civil society is a vital player in conflict resolution and developing community resilience against extremism. We also know that countering violent extremism through early intervention and individual and community engagement represents a smarter approach that recognises social as well as political and ideological factors that can make people vulnerable to extremism. This Bill, and the functions and powers of the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion that it outlines, puts into practice these findings. 


Community engagement and consultation is necessary, but they do not hold all of the answers alone. Diversionary and educational programs, along with strong online campaigns, are all part of a necessary strategy to help stop young Australians becoming radicalised. It is not about targeting one particular community, but rather a collective approach across multiple communities, government and academia, to implement programs and strategies that that are more targeted at identified points in radicalisation where intervention is likely to succeed. We cannot continue to rely on decisions from the bureaucratic level alone. We need recognise that our failings, both at a government and community level, in preventing radicalisation, is largely due to a policy response that was based on assumptions rather than on a framework that has had proven success. Research from Curtin University has found that deradicalisation programs delivered by government ""lack viability and credibility within the target group and are most likely to be viewed manipulative and agenda serving."" By enabling relevant NGOs, community leaders, government departments and academic experts to come together we will be able to develop a best practice model for combating violent extremism.


There is precedent around the world for success using this model. The Australian Centre for Social Cohesion framework, focusing on community, government, research and dialogue, is largely based on Hedayah, the premier international institution for training and research to counter violent extremism. The Bill takes this successful international model, and replicates it at a domestic level, focused on the Australian circumstance, and tailoring their research and training to our domestic needs. Hedayah works closely with communities and stakeholders (e.g. youth, women, educators and community leaders) who have traditionally been on the outer when it comes to developing policies to combat violent extremism.


If we are serious about dealing with extremism and terrorism, we must not isolate our focus to reacting to acts of terror and extremism, but also be serious about prevention. Identifying those at risk, finding pathways to deradicalisation, and bringing together the community to find collective solutions, must be a focus of our proactive response to extremism as a nation. The establishment of the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion will provide the foundation that Australia needs to effectively implement such a response.

The establishment of the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion would act to break down this siloed approach, bringing together groups from various sectors to develop effective and comprehensive policies to address radicalisation. Research and experience has proven that violent extremism is best dealt with by civil society groups, in coordination and consultation with government and law enforcement agencies. In Australia, this is illustrated in groups such as People against Violent Extremism (PAVE), which grew out of recognition that civil society is a vital player in conflict resolution and developing community resilience against extremism. We also know that countering violent extremism through early intervention and individual and community engagement represents a smarter approach that recognises social as well as political and ideological factors that can make people vulnerable to extremism. This Bill, and the functions and powers of the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion that it outlines, puts into practice these findings. 


Community engagement and consultation is necessary, but they do not hold all of the answers alone. Diversionary and educational programs, along with strong online campaigns, are all part of a necessary strategy to help stop young Australians becoming radicalised. It is not about targeting one particular community, but rather a collective approach across multiple communities, government and academia, to implement programs and strategies that that are more targeted at identified points in radicalisation where intervention is likely to succeed. We cannot continue to rely on decisions from the bureaucratic level alone. We need recognise that our failings, both at a government and community level, in preventing radicalisation, is largely due to a policy response that was based on assumptions rather than on a framework that has had proven success. Research from Curtin University has found that deradicalisation programs delivered by government ""lack viability and credibility within the target group and are most likely to be viewed manipulative and agenda serving."" By enabling relevant NGOs, community leaders, government departments and academic experts to come together we will be able to develop a best practice model for combating violent extremism.


There is precedent around the world for success using this model. The Australian Centre for Social Cohesion framework, focusing on community, government, research and dialogue, is largely based on Hedayah, the premier international institution for training and research to counter violent extremism. The Bill takes this successful international model, and replicates it at a domestic level, focused on the Australian circumstance, and tailoring their research and training to our domestic needs. Hedayah works closely with communities and stakeholders (e.g. youth, women, educators and community leaders) who have traditionally been on the outer when it comes to developing policies to combat violent extremism.


If we are serious about dealing with extremism and terrorism, we must not isolate our focus to reacting to acts of terror and extremism, but also be serious about prevention. Identifying those at risk, finding pathways to deradicalisation, and bringing together the community to find collective solutions, must be a focus of our proactive response to extremism as a nation. The establishment of the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion will provide the foundation that Australia needs to effectively implement such a response.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2015-03-25,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (15:49):  I table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Today, I introduce the Construction Industry Amendment (Protecting Witnesses) Bill 2015.


The Bill maintains the existing examination powers used by the building industry regulator, Fair Work Building and Construction, to combat unlawful conduct.


The construction industry is a critical sector of the Australian economy. It is the nation's third largest employer with more than one million workers, with many employed in small businesses. It has, regrettably, been affected by unlawful conduct, thuggery and intimidation for too long.


The Government, and any objective observer, realise that Australia desperately needs a construction industry that is not plagued by lawlessness, intimidation and thuggery, and in which all participants respect the rule of law. It is what one would expect in the twenty-first century.


For this reason, one of this Government's first tasks was to introduce a Bill to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. That Bill was passed by the House of Representatives in December 2013 and is currently before the Senate.


The case to re-establish an effective regulator to enforce appropriate laws, to provide sufficient penalties to deter unlawful conduct, and stop the thuggery and lawlessness in this important industry, is a powerful one.


Re-establishing the ABCC and bringing respect for the rule of law back to the building industry remains a priority for this Government. I also reiterate the Government's firm commitment to the advance release of the Building Code 2014 which will be administered by the ABCC.


However, the Government appreciates that the Senate requires additional time to consider the ABCC Bills.


Whilst this would ordinarily be a matter of scheduling, we need to stop a ticking time bomb from exploding. The compulsory powers in the current legislation to address the culture of silence and intimidation are subject to a sunset clause imposed by the former Labor government. These important powers will no longer be available to the regulator from 1 June 2015.


Accordingly, until the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 are dealt with by the Senate in the coming sitting period, this Bill, the Construction Industry Amendment (Protecting Witnesses) Bill 2015, will extend the period during which the Director of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate can exercise the agency's compulsory powers.


The Bill will extend the powers for a further two years. All other aspects of the current legislation are unchanged, including the automatic immunity given to a witness over their evidence.


The ability to compel a person to provide information is vital to protecting workers and witnesses who dare to stand up to unlawfulness and intimidation and assist the regulator to clean up the industry. The powers also ensure Fair Work Building and Construction is able to carry out its investigations effectively and break down the 'culture of silence' and retribution that exists in the sector.


This Bill simply extends the existing powers. These kinds of powers are not novel or new. A range of other Commonwealth regulatory bodies have compulsory powers, such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink and Medicare.


In 2009, the Hon. Murray Wilcox, AO, QC conducted a review of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and its powers at the request of the former Labor government. He recommended that the compulsory powers be retained because he was satisfied there was still such a level of industrial unlawfulness in the industry that warranted the powers. He also said that, in reality, without such a power some types of contraventions would be almost impossible to prove.


We have recently seen the effectiveness of compulsory powers during the investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of the alleged CFMEU secondary boycott against Boral. ACCC Chairman Sims and his agency were confronted by the culture of silence and fear of reprisal that is all too often a feature of the building and construction industry.


Mr Sims said that ""the ACCC has only been able to progress the investigation by compelling people to give evidence"". Without the ACCC's use of its compulsory powers, the serious wrongdoing alleged could not have been put before the Court.


It remains the case today that law-abiding industry participants have nothing to fear from the continuation of these powers. In fact, as the name of the Bill suggests, the powers will protect those people who do the right thing.


This Bill provides for the continuation of arrangements already in place, which have been previously supported by both sides of Parliament and ensure individuals who are brave enough to take a stand against unlawfulness are not stood over and intimidated into silence.


The Government is committed to re-establishing the ABCC and returning the rule of law to Australia's construction industry, and this Bill will ensure that there is no break in the existing regulator's ability to investigate unlawfulness until the Senate has had an opportunity to consider the legislation to re-establish the ABCC.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


(i) the Minister for the Environment (Mr Hunt) has referred the Shenhua Watermark coal mine planned for the Liverpool Plains to the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development (IESC) for assessment under the water trigger provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act),


(ii) the Namoi catchment, that includes the Liverpool Plains, is the largest groundwater system in the Murray Darling catchment and the Shenhua project triggered the requirement to consider water impacts of the mine under the EPBC Act,


(iii) the Federal Government has passed legislation in the House of Representatives, including to hand over application of the water trigger, including approval decisions, under the EPBC Act to state and territory governments and local councils, and


(iv) as well as the proposed Shenhua Watermark project two other major mining projects are proposed for the Liverpool Plains—BHP Billiton is planning a coal mine of 500 000 000 tonnes less than 10 km from the Shenhua site, and Santos has a coal seam gas licence to explore for gas across the whole Liverpool Plains floodplain;


(b) calls on the Minister for the Environment to publicly clarify:


(i) if he is requiring that the IESC review assess the cumulative impacts of the project in association with other developments, whether past, present or reasonably foreseeable,


(ii) whether the IESC will carry out the bioregional assessment of the impact of the proposed mine on the Namoi catchment, or whether they will be simply reviewing other work rather than carrying out their own independent work, and


(iii) if the IESC will be required to engage with the Local Land Services to assess the cumulative impacts, or will a desktop assessment of the hydrogeology and geology be all that is required; and


(c) calls on the Minister for the Environment to retain the water trigger at the federal level and abandon its plans to hand it off to state and territory governments.

The PRESIDENT:  Is leave granted? Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  The government would like to clarify that we oppose the motion just voted on because it does not accurately reflect the environmental approval processes for coal or coal seam gas projects. The government has made it clear that in respect of the Liverpool Plains it is taking the advice of the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development. That committee was established by the former government with the support of the coalition and the Greens. However, the Greens seem to lack an understanding of the word 'independent'.


The government has requested that the committee respond directly to questions raised by the community but it will not tell the independent committee how to do its job, as the Greens have suggested in this motion. To do so would taint the work of the independent committee. The government is carefully considering the impacts of proposed projects in the Liverpool Plains area and it will assess these impacts consistent with Australia's stringent environmental laws.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (16:00):  Pursuant to contingent notice standing in the name of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Abetz, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent a minister moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to government business notice of motion No. 5.


The Leader of the Government in the Senate and I commenced this week in discussions with representatives of all groupings in this place. We met with the Australian Labor Party. We met the Australian Greens and we met with each member of the crossbench or a representative of their office. 


In those discussions, it rapidly became clear that there were some people who were very willing to talk about how this week may play out, particularly in the light of Mr Malcolm Fraser's passing and the obvious effect that that had in relation to the Monday sitting. 


We discussed a range of options in relation to this sitting week and, as I say, it became clear that there was a greater willingness amongst some senators—in this case, particularly those senators who are crossbenchers—to discuss these sorts of matters. It also became clear that there wasn't such a willingness on the part of the Australian Labor Party and the Greens for those discussions. We had some good discussions and, as a result of those, we were able to enter into agreement for arrangements which flow through the course of this week. 


We, subsequently, continued those discussions with those individual senators who were keen to work on a cooperative basis. We continued those discussions in relation to bringing the first sitting day of the budget week forward: having a sitting on the Monday—indeed, that was a proposition which one or two of the crossbenchers put forward. 


I know that there is a proposition in this place, which has been circulated in the chamber by the Australian Labor Party, to have that sitting Monday of that budget week take place according to a different format to that which is contained within my motion. 


We were very pleased that there was the proposition from members of the crossbench, which I think was broadly supported, to have a Monday sitting. The way that the Monday sitting is laid out here is that it will be, essentially, an opportunity to transact a bit of additional government business but, most importantly of all, there is a question time there for that day as is appropriate 


I make clear to all colleagues that there has never been a suggestion that we have a sitting on the Monday without question time. Question time is there within that motion. 


That is the proposition which the government has before the chamber and which I hope receives the support of the chamber. If the opposition senators are wondering why there hasn't been an ability to reach an agreement with them on this front, it is probably partly a function of the earlier disposition this week, which was manifest. 




Senator Wong:
  We just gave you all the hours you wanted!




Senator FIFIELD:
  I am hearing a voice of support from Senator Wong at the table and I appreciate that. We are appreciative that the chamber has supported the additional hours for this week. We are also grateful that there is broad support in this place to sit on the Monday of the budget week. There are two propositions, I suspect, that will be before this place in relation to how that Monday flows, and we will see what the will of the chamber is. 


I do not think that it is reasonable on this occasion for those opposite to deny leave to move this motion, but that is why I am in this position of seeking to move a motion to suspend standing orders so that I can move the motion which is on the Notice Paper. 

",Senate,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,BUSINESS,21,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2015-03-25,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:06):  The reason we are in this position for Senator Fifield's information is that there was an inability from the government to appropriately consult with the many people on this side of the chamber on the important issue of extended hours. 


I agree with Senator Fifield: we did meet to look at a range of issues about the need for extra hours of debate. We acknowledge the government was in a position that they had important legislation that needed to be considered and also the special circumstances of this week with the death of Malcolm Fraser and the state funeral for him on Friday. There was no disagreement about that, and you can see from notices on this paper today that there was agreement with significant extra hours this week—more so than we have ever seen in my experience in this place.


We agree that we need to focus the attention of the Senate on the important matters to be discussed. At one of those meetings, there was a discussion about maybe sitting on the Monday. We were told that we would receive a letter from the government following up on that meeting about what would be the proposal for extended hours for the Monday of budget week. There was no in-principle opposition to meeting on that day. However, this notice, which talks about a process different to any other sitting day for the Monday of budget week, came to us in a letter today at lunchtime after this notice of motion had already been circulated to everyone. That was the consultation process.


In good faith, we need to look at how the Senate best operates to meet the requirements of legislation. There were 'robust discussions' in those meetings we had earlier this week, and that is how it should be. Governments put forward proposals, and we look at the way that we can make them work. We have come up with an agreed result: two notices of motion amending hours this week have already been passed by this place without any dissent. We have put forward a reasonable proposal in the notice of motion about hours for the Monday of budget week that, if we agree to meet in this place on the Monday, we have a standard sitting day of the Senate. That would allow not just question time but the ability to take note of the answers of question time, formal business, any proposal to debate a matter of public importance or an urgency motion—standard operations of the Senate. 


If our amendment is passed—and it has been circulated and should have come forward for debate—we would have between seven and eight hours of dedicated time to look at the items of business put forward by the government. That is not standing in the way of debate in this place; that is looking at how we can operate as a Senate, do our business and also ensure that the way the discussions are held are similar to that which we had earlier this week, where all the interested parties are gathered together, the discussion is held and the propositions are heard at the same time. Discussions should not be held in the way that this particular proposal has operated, which was that we got a letter from the Leader of Government which says that the members of the crossbench have already been favourably considering this proposal, rather than us having the opportunity as a group to put forward what we wanted. 


In the discussion that we had with the government earlier this week, there was no debate on what would happen on Monday of budget week. People who were in attendance at that meeting had opportunities to talk about what would happen this week and also how we would look at the legislation agenda that the government is trying to have us consider. There has been great consideration, negotiation and allowance by the Senate to have extra hours to look at the important issues of legislation that came forward. Then, today, we had yet another demand and it was put as a fait accompli. That is not the best operation of the Senate. 


We would save a lot of time if we could have these discussions as we did earlier this week. That does not mean that there will be absolute agreement; that does not always happen in negotiations. The way that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has put it today, if we do not agree, we will be punished by not being part of the discussion. That was how I heard Senator Fifield put forward his position that, because there was a certain lack of accommodation or cooperation in the meetings earlier this week, they had to exclude the Labor Party from further decisions about what would happen in future hours motions. We think it is important— (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-03-25,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:11):  The Greens will be supporting the amendment to the motion proposing that the Senate sit on the Monday before budget day. I think that this will be the first time since I have been in this chamber that we have sat on the Monday before the budget. There is a reason for that: there is a lot of preparation and work done in the lead-up to the budget and a lot of talk about it before the budget. So it will be the first time that we have sat on the Monday. 


When we sit on Fridays in this place, it is usually considered a rollover of the Thursday. Despite the fact that the Greens have argued for question time and other business to be transacted on a Friday, when we sit on Fridays in this place we have always been told, 'No, this is just a rollover of Thursday.' We have failed to get question time and some of the other business that we consider important on the Friday. However, this Monday is the beginning of a sitting week. It should be treated as a normal sitting day that allows us to do the normal business of this place. That includes consideration of documents and clerks documents; authorisations for committees to sit; question time, which is about the only thing that the original motion of the government allows us to do; petitions; taking note of answers; postponements; rearrangements; formal motions; and any matters of public urgency. 


If we are successful in amending the motion to vary hours, the amended motion will provide the government with plenty of time to deal with the bills that it specifically wants to deal with. Of course, we know that the bills that are listed in the government's motion are the Construction Industry Amendment (Protecting Witnesses) Bill 2015, which is about the ABCC; the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Amendment Bill 2015; and the Tribunals Amalgamation Bill 2014. The government has plenty of time to debate these bills. We have already extended hours.


I acknowledge that Mr Fraser's death and the adjourning of this place as a matter of respect of course needed to be taken into consideration. We sat late last night; we are sitting late tonight, which we very rarely do on a Wednesday night; and we will be sitting late into the night, potentially, tomorrow until adjournment to consider the bills that the government has asked the Senate to consider. There is extra time to make up there. If the government's motion on sitting hours is amended, there will be plenty of time for the government to consider its business. Of course, if the government was not so intent on ramming through the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015 this week, it would have had more opportunity to deal with the other bills that it claims are urgent.



An honourable senator interjecting—  




Senator SIEWERT:
  Yes, we met with the government as part of the leaders and whips process. We indicated our position there. As Senator Moore just articulated, the government said they wanted to sit on Monday. Of course, we would expect that to be a normal Monday. There was no further communication beyond that until we saw the motion, which shows quite clearly that they just want to use the time to ram through these additional bills, without proper consideration of what the Senate does. The Senate has other important work to do. The government seeks through this motion to not allow the Senate to carry out its functions. We do not support the government's coming in here and making us deal with their agenda without full transparency and the ability for us to prosecute the other things that need to be dealt with in this chamber. It is unreasonable for the government to try to not allow us to have full consideration of, for example, take note of petitions and of the clerks documents and transact the normal business of this place. It should be treated as a normal Monday if we are required to sit. The government has had ample time through the extended hours we have already sat this week.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2015-03-25,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (16:16):  This motion has been moved as part of a suite of motions by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate with the intention of ensuring that there is adequate government time to deal with a number of time critical bills and other major pieces of legislation that it has been agreed by various members of this place should pass in a timely manner.


The opposition tell us they have denied leave to move this motion on the basis that they have not been properly consulted or that consultation has been insufficient. The fact is that, Senator Fifield tells me, immediately following the meeting where the possibility of the Senate sitting on the Monday of budget week was raised, Senator Fifield, as I understand it, telephoned Senator Moore to advise her that this was something we would like to do. I think it is probably slightly misleading to say that a letter was the first notification that the opposition received that this was happening, because at the first opportunity that was available to us that advice was made.


There is more than one view about how this chamber can be managed from time to time. I acknowledge that this government does not have a majority in this place. We do not have the ability to set the agenda. We do not have the ability to set the hours that this place sits, but neither does the opposition. I might just note for the record that last week we invited all members of this place to be represented at a leaders and whips meeting that was held earlier this week to discuss how we could manage the issue of hours. So we started the process last week, and I believe that even before then there had been some discussions between the opposition and the government as to how we might manage that. In order to do it in a consultative manner that involved everybody we invited everybody to a meeting that occurred at the beginning of this week. At that meeting, the opposition presented us with a take it or leave it option on extended hours. That was not acceptable to us and we thought that, given that there are a number of other senators in this place, it would be advisable that the government speak to them and discuss other options. That is how this place should work. There are major parties, minor parties and Independents in this place. Everybody has the ability to have input into how this place is run. That occurred.


The idea of sitting on Monday was a proposal put forward by one of the crossbenchers, which was then discussed by the rest of them. Discussion occurred between the government and the crossbenchers as to how sitting on Monday could work. In the end, the motion that was put forward reflects the discussion, the toing and froing, that occurred with the crossbenchers. The crossbenchers certainly were not putting forward things to the government as a take it or leave it option. They were prepared to discuss, be consultative and negotiate. It was a very fruitful discussion. As I say, the idea of sitting on Monday came from one of the crossbenchers, and this motion reflects the discussion that we had.


The end result is that the Senate should be entitled to make a decision on that motion. Formality should not be denied. There are 76 people who make up this place and those 76 people should be entitled to make a decision on this motion. It is up to them whether they actually accept or reject it, but denying formality on the motion is not the appropriate way to deal with this. Doing that would deny the Senate the opportunity to make a decision that it should be entitled to make, not to mention the fact that it also denies the opportunity for the opposition to move the amendment that it has circulated and clearly intends to move. It is a nonsensical thing to deny formality on a motion about which you have circulated notice of your intention to amend. On that basis, I believe that we should suspend standing orders to allow this motion to be voted on.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:20):  Just so we are very clear, the government was offered by the opposition a full sitting day on the Monday before budget. As long as it was a normal Monday sitting day they would have had full agreement from the alternative government and the majority of the chamber. But Senator Abetz does not want to accept that. He does not want to accept an agreement by the opposition to facilitate debate on some controversial bills which are opposed by a number of parties in this chamber, because he does not want a normal sitting day on the Monday. He wants one that is only about government business with the addition of question time, but nothing else, none of the other aspects of a sitting day. That is what we are arguing about.


We are having a suspension of standing orders, because the government has turned down the opposition's agreement to a normal sitting day on the Monday. That is how unbelievably unreasonable we have been. We have actually suggested that the parliament sits. We should have a normal sitting day. I emphasise, as someone who has been on that side of the chamber, Monday is a very good day for government business. On a normal sitting day on a Monday you are looking at around seven hours of government business. You would have had that by agreement. But no, instead they decide they do not like how unreasonable we are being—for daring to suggest that if the parliament sits, we should have a normal parliamentary day with seven hours of government business! And instead, they want to try and ram through this motion, notice of motion No. 5, on the basis that they have got agreement with members of the crossbench. If the crossbenchers choose to vote for it, that is a matter for them; we do not agree. We think that if we have a full sitting day with that many hours, it is only reasonable that the Senate have a normal sitting day. But behind the argument—actually, explicitly part of this argument—is the government's suggestion that we have been somehow unreasonable.


I want to make it very clear what we as an opposition have done which has agreed to facilitate debate on the metadata bill. I wrote and requested—via the Manager of Opposition Business and directly—of the government their request for additional hours in this sitting week. We kept getting only a Tuesday variation. We kept being told, 'oh, we only need to sit on Tuesdays; that is all we will take'. Now we do not agree with Senator Ludlam on the metadata bill. But I was not going to agree to only have it only debated on Tuesday. So I said to them, 'we want a full proposal about what would happen during the sitting week'. Did I get that? No. I acknowledge that in the intervening period between those discussions and the first discussion this week, we had the passing of Mr Fraser, which obviously affected the Senate. At the meeting, what we indicated to the government is essentially what they have got agreement to, with the exception of Wednesday.


We indicated that the opposition was prepared to give up the MPI on both Tuesday and Wednesday and private senators' business on Thursday, and to sit additional hours on Tuesday and Thursday. Can I just repeat that so everyone understands: for government business, the opposition was prepared to give up the MPI on Tuesday, the MPI on Wednesday, and private senators' business on Thursday, and to sit additional hours on Tuesday and Thursday in order to debate the metadata bill. That is the unreasonable position that Senator Abetz is now going to try and complain about. Well, Mr President, that was not an unreasonable offer. The opposition's position on this is not unreasonable. And if the government choose to try and run the Senate this way, well, they are going to get these sorts of responses. They are going to get the opposition saying, quite rightly, 'well, we are not just going to agree to this motion', and, 'we are going to do deny formality', and, 'we are going to move amendments'—because that is what we believe. That is what we believe: that the Senate ought to be run with a little more consultation; frankly, with a little more organisation than the chaos that we appear to be seeing from those opposite.



I repeat: we are prepared to facilitate debate on the metadata bill, which is why we are prepared to give up time. We are prepared to sit on the Monday before budget week—not something that those opposite ever gave us in government. But we are prepared to do it. We just want a sitting day with seven hours of government business. And instead, the tactical decision by the geniuses on the other side is that they now want a debate and a suspension of standing orders, instead of taking what was a very reasonable offer—a very reasonable offer—from the opposition about additional sitting time on the Monday of the budget week. So I say to the crossbenchers: I would encourage you to consider supporting the opposition on this. We will be moving an amendment to ensure a full sitting day. (Time expired)

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (16:25):  Mr President, what we have just witnessed is a regrettable attempt at rewriting history. I will not seek to justify what the coalition has done or not done. All I would do is appeal to the crossbenchers, who were in my office—and their staff—when we were seeking to come to a reasonable landing in relation to this matter—




Senator Wong:
  You don't listen!




Senator ABETZ:
  And whilst I am talking in the fashion I am, we have the ongoing interjecting by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, who cannot help herself. As a result of there being no decision able to be achieved in the meeting in my office, another suggestion was proposed to us: that there be a sitting of the Senate on Monday 11 May, and that that be devoted to government business, other than for question time. That is now the proposal.


Might I say, Mr President, that people can put their spin what did or did not occur in the communications, but I think the crossbenchers were able to see firsthand what occurred, and they can make up their minds; they can make their determinations as to who was being reasonable and who was being unreasonable. Mr President, we had the situation, very regrettably, of the passing of a former Prime Minister. It is the tradition and proper that we adjourn as a mark of respect for that situation; as a result, Monday of this week was denied to us. Further, if we were to have thought of sitting on Friday of this week—which normally would have been a possibility—that also has been denied to us, because Mr Fraser's funeral service will be held this coming Friday. Therefore, we have had to seek extra time for government business, and the proposal was put that the Monday before the budget session would be the appropriate time, and that it be devoted to government legislation. Indeed, the motion indicates, I think, the three bills that we have nominated which have particular time constraints in them which do require the urgent consideration of the Senate.


The Labor Party have, regrettably, continued with their course of action. I know that the crossbenchers were not able to witness the first nine months of this government because they were not here in the Senate, but for the first nine months, when Labor and the Greens had the majority, it was objection, objection, delay, and negativing everything possible—including Labor's own policies which they took to the last election. Since 1 July, when the new Senate came about, and Labor and the Greens lost their majority, we have in fact been passing things through the Senate, and there has been some substantial and reasonable progress with legislation. And so I say to the crossbenchers that the sitting on Monday is something that should be supported; and that the fact that Labor now—all of a sudden—say: 'Monday, what a good idea; we would have been supportive of that, but for—', is a rewriting of history that is disingenuous in the extreme. And I would—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, on a point of order.




Senator Wong:
  Mr President, the Minister is misleading the Senate. If he does not talk to the Manager of Government Business then that is not our problem.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, that is not a point of order. That is debating the topic.




Senator ABETZ:
  Just that intervention yet again by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate indicates the attitude she has taken ever since the people of Australia made the decision to remove her and her colleagues from government.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  We have non-stop interjections from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, so one can imagine, without the glare of cameras and microphones, how tolerant Senator Wong is when trying to discuss these matters and come to a reasonable landing. So I simply plead with the crossbenchers. That which was determined the other day is a reasonable way forward, and I would encourage the Senate to support the motion that is before them.

The fact that we could make an argument that we could not come here today to talk about having a more transparent way of how we operate and seeking a full day of debate in this Senate in a standard day would be able to be dismissed because people said that it would not operate beforehand.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:27):  I rise with some energy to contribute to the debate on the matter that Senator Claire Moore has put before the Senate this afternoon, and that is a concern that must be absolutely reverberating right across this country, but nowhere more particularly than in the great state that I represent here in the Senate—the great state of New South Wales—and as voters put their minds to the election coming up this weekend to understand the difference between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party on these critical issues that touch every single person's life. And it has been very, very clear, from the moment they got in. Since the election, we have heard nothing but negativity from the government on the issue of any expenditure towards core services such as health and education. They constantly talk about these sectors as the great costs to the nation. They fail to understand the power of education and health as investments in our people—investments in our young people, investments in retraining, investments in keeping people well and healthy so that they can participate and live full, active and fulfilling lives that contribute to the common good of society.


But we have seen an environment of austerity from the moment they arrived in this place—this Liberal government and Liberal governments all around the country that have been punished at the polls because of their miserly vision of this country, because of their determination to cut and cut hard, right to the heart of people's lives in their access to education and health. Parents and teachers are rightly concerned about school funding after the government walked away from Labor's Gonski funding reforms. Everybody understood that we needed to move to a sector-blind, needs-aware funding model—everybody, that is, except this miserly government. When they got in they cut years 5 and 6. They completely misrepresented to the community beforehand that they were on a unity ticket with Labor. But the minute they had the opportunity, when they felt that people were looking the other way, it was gone—just like the cuts we see in the health sector.


People are fearful of the cuts that this government has made and the chaos of policymaking with regard to Medicare. The prospect of being taxed to go to your GP is a concept that no Australian who voted for the Liberal Party was made aware of before they voted. No indication was given to the entire Australian population that this government was going to come in and tax you to go to your own doctor. And the shemozzle that has followed that! They made that announcement, without consultation, on the day they delivered the budget. That is the first time that health professionals across this country and the people who voted this sad and sorry government in found out that they were going to be taxed to go to the GP. That is a disgrace.


And, of course, that is why we should be extremely fearful about what the Abbott government is set to do in the next budget. They are all outside the chamber now having a big talk as if they are consulting. But the reality is that this government always thinks it knows better than the experts. This is a government that ignores the facts. It is not making evidence based policy and it is determined to inflict pain on those who can least afford it. They target the most vulnerable, and when they are on their knees is when they kick them the hardest.


There is a big difference between Labor values and Liberal values expressed in the two critical policy areas of health and education. In government, Labor has always fought for universal access to health care—people know it as Medicare, and it underpins access for every Australian. People who are old enough will remember that, before Medicare, people were made bankrupt because they had to have an operation. Those are the old days that this government is set to return us to. On education, there was no sound from this government before they were elected that they were intent on setting up $100,000 degrees, cutting 20 per cent of the higher education budget and holding the Senate to account—over a barrel and with a shotgun to its head—by saying they would not fund NCRIS, our most prestigious investigation body in terms of science.


We are deeply concerned by the ongoing commitment of this coalition government to cut funding from health and education. What we have seen since they came to power in terms of their real action in this area is cuts to valuable program such as Youth Connections. We wonder what is going to be targeted in the next budget. From 2010 to 2013, Youth Connections across the country cost $286 million. That is a lot of money for every household but in terms of the budget of a nation it is a small investment in very vulnerable young people. At a cost of just $76.8 million in its final year, 2014, this program delivered for extremely vulnerable young Australians who had fallen out of school the little support that they needed to connect back into education or back into life. But this government, driven by an ideology that sees investment as a cost not an investment, cut that program. Right across this country now, as the Youth Connections program has disappeared, connections to education, jobs, training and a future for young people are absolutely falling apart.


In terms of health, what we have seen with this disastrous set of policies that changed from May to December. again in January and again in March is the shameful way in which this Liberal-National coalition government is determined to hurt Medicare and everyone that it protects this country. They will cut it to the bone. While they might be making noises that they have pulled their GP tax—and some may be fooled—let's be clear that the minister confirmed that this government is absolutely committed to putting a price signal on Medicare. This is what they said: 'It is definitely good policy to put the right price and value signals in health to make sure that people value the service they get from doctors.' Well, they cannot value the service they get from doctors if they cannot get to the doctor—and that is what this lot have got cooked up in the next budget. We will be watching closely to defend health and education at every turn.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2015-03-25,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (17:34):  I rise to make some comments on this MPI before us today. It is interesting to listen to the scaremongering from those opposite. Senator O'Neill spoke about the coalition's 'austerity'. It is not austerity; it is the responsible and sensible management of this nation's economy—something the previous Labor government failed to do. And it is because the previous Labor government failed to do that that this government is having to take sensible and responsible decisions when it comes to managing the nation's economy. When we look at that—and, of course, we are running up to the budget—it is worth looking at why this government needs to take sensible, responsible decisions when it comes to managing the nation's economy. It is because of the waste and mismanagement that we saw from the previous Labor government.


Let's have a look at what the previous Labor government left us. They left us a trajectory to a debt of $657 billion. In case someone out there was not listening when I said that, let me repeat it. The previous Labor government left us a trajectory to a debt of $657 billion. This coalition government makes absolutely no excuses for responsible, sensible decisions about managing the nation's economy to get it back on track because the previous Labor government left us an economic basket case. What does that actually mean for people across the country? It means we are paying $1 billion a month in interest because of the previous Labor government's waste and mismanagement.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator NASH:
  I will take that interjection from the senator opposite: 'What about health and education?' Let's have a look at that. Guess what? With the $1 billion we are paying in interest every month, we could have a new tertiary hospital in every city. That is what we could have when it comes to health. When it comes to things we need right across the country, we could have 12 kilometres of road every single day. But we cannot fund these things, because of the previous Labor government's debt. So for the senator to come in here and say that it is this coalition government's austerity is absolutely gobsmacking. It is because of their mess that they left us that we are in this situation—the previous Labor government's mess.


Let's just have a look at the sort of things that led us to that mess. Under the Home Insulation Program, the pink batts, $2 billion was mismanaged, with over $1 billion spent fixing the mistakes. Under the set-top box program, Labor wasted $67 million on administration costs to run a program to install set-top boxes in people's homes for an average of $350 a home even though Harvey Norman offered the same deal for $168. Everybody remembers, under the previous Labor government, FuelWatch and Grocery Choice. Nearly $30 million was spent setting them up, and then they were dumped. And this one is one that those on this side of the chamber are forever stunned about: the previous Labor government sold the parliamentary billiard tables that used to be in this building for $5,000. But then what happened? The government spent over $102,000 determining whether or not they got value for money.


It is those sorts of things that mean that this government has to take sensible, responsible decisions to get the economy back on track. And we will do that. We take absolute responsibility for doing that. We make no excuses for taking the tough decisions that we know the Australian people need us to take to get this country back on track. At the same time, when we see the scaremongering from the Labor Party about what the government may or may not do, the one thing that we have noticed about the Labor Party, on the other side of this chamber, is that so often they have failed to deal in fact. They do not let the facts get in the way of the story they are trying to sell. And some of the facts are the things that I am going to talk about today: they are about the investments that this government is making in health.


We only have to look at the fact that Commonwealth funding for public hospitals is going to grow. It is going to grow from $13.5 billion to $89 billion over four years—and this in the environment when we hear those on the other side completely ignoring the facts and trying to say that we are cutting funding to public hospitals, which is entirely not true. It is going to increase by nine per cent over 2014-15, nine per cent over 2015-16, nine per cent over 2016-17 and six per cent over 2017-18. Even I can understand that, when you see those percentages going up and up and up, you can see that that is an increase in funding, even though those opposite would try to tell a different story entirely. It is this government that is investing in health. This government is not cutting; we are investing. We only have to look at Indigenous health funding when it comes to health—$3.1 billion over the next four years for Indigenous health. Very interestingly, that is actually $500 million more than it was over the four years previously under Labor—more funding, not a cut. And, of course, we have just announced the $1.4 billion in funding for primary health care for Indigenous health. A lot of that is going to our Aboriginal community-controlled health sector, which, I have to say, does an incredibly good job in delivering primary health care right around the country.


We just see this continual harping by the opposition, saying that the government is going to make cuts. The scaremongering is absolutely unbelievable. Also, we see hypocrisy there when we look at what Labor cut when they were in office. We only have to look at things like agriculture. They cut the department's budget by two-thirds. They cut the AQIS rebate by 40 per cent. And the biggest cut of all in agriculture was in cutting the live export trade. To actually stop, ban, the live export trade for cattle was absolutely appalling. For the Labor Party to come in here and talk about cuts from this government! When we look at their track record, the list just goes on and on. One cut that was particularly galling for people in rural and regional areas was the cut to the students that were going to be able to get independent youth allowance. The previous Labor government tried to rip that money away from regional students right across the country—and you know it, Madam Acting Deputy President O'Neill, and so do the rest of your colleagues on the other side. It took this side, the coalition in opposition, to push and push and harangue and harangue until the Labor government did a backflip. So for the Labor Party to come in here and lecture this government on cuts is absolutely the height of hypocrisy. When we look at the previous Labor government trying to absolutely rip $400 million out of medical research—which they could not do; they had to do a backflip because of the pressure—to come in here and talk about cuts is absolutely the height of hypocrisy.


What we are going to do is manage this nation's economy responsibly and sensibly. We are not going to engage in the sort of economic irresponsibility we saw from the previous Labor government, which left us with, as I said earlier, a trajectory to debt of $667 billion. We are taking the responsibility to fix the mess that Labor left us, and we will do that. It is not only for now but for our children and our grandchildren that we need to fix that mess. Labor might think it is absolutely fine to hand out $900 cheques to people all over the globe, as it turned out. I even knew of somebody that gave a call from a pub in London saying, 'Thanks very much to Kevin Rudd for the $900 cheque.' This coalition government is going to make the responsible and sensible decisions we need to fix the mess that the previous Labor government left us. The Australian people elected us to do it, and that is what we are going to do. We are going to make sure that we do that so that we get the best outcomes and a sustainable future for people living right across this country, not only in rural and regional areas but in cities and from side to side of this nation. We are going to fix the economic mess.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-03-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:45):  If only those things were true. If only we had reality and not just rhetoric from Senator Nash. I rise to speak on the Abbott government's failure to rule out further cuts to health and education. It is worth emphasising right here that we are talking in this debate about further cuts. We are not even talking about the $80 billion cuts already proposed to take effect over the next 10 years. But this government will not rule out even deeper cuts. How many more billions can we expect to see ripped out of our schools and hospitals in this government's desperate attempt to steady their sinking policy ship?


Of course, the rule-in rule-out game is a scourge of modern politics. But this was a door that the coalition chose to open and walk through voluntarily when yesterday they announced no further cuts to the foreign aid budget. But what further cuts will there be? The Abbott government must also rule out further cuts to education because we already have a system which is suffering from chronic underfunding. It is a system which stifles the opportunities that are available to hundreds of thousands of Australian children, and because education is such an important investment in the potential of our population it also limits our nation's economic potential. It is an absolutely crazy and irresponsible way to go.


Our public schooling system, which educates the majority of Australian students, is the bedrock of our future society. Whether you look at it from a social or an economic perspective, there are huge benefits to all of us in investing properly in our schools. The Gonski review into school funding found truly staggering levels of inequity in Australia across the Australian system. They found disadvantaged children lagged years behind their peers. It is a scandal in a wealthy country like Australia. This was not because of a lack of intelligence; it was because of a lack of opportunity. How can we expect students to learn in school classrooms that cannot afford to have adequate heating or cooling? How can we expect classrooms to function adequately when more and more is demanded of teachers and they do not receive the support that they need to be able to do their job? How can we expect literacy and numeracy rates to rise when a student's chance in life is more likely to be defined in Australia by their socio-economic status then by their ability or their dedication?


Further funding cuts to education must be ruled out by this Abbott government. But that is not enough. Our schools need more than the status quo because we know that inequality is still rising in Australia, despite the best efforts of the Gonski review to shine a light on this scandal in Australia that compares so badly with our OECD peers. Inequality in Australia is still rising. This government has broken a string of election promises, and it did so when it announced not only that it would not fully implement the Gonski school funding reforms but, as well as that, that it would make drastic cuts to education generally.


Sucking billions out of our school funding system and our education system now will actually cost us trillions in terms of lost productivity and social costs down the track. Just yesterday I met with families of disabled children who are here to plead with the Minister for Education to keep his promise to introduce a needs based disability loading in the upcoming federal budget. It is appalling that parents have to come to plead for an education for their kids. They were begging for a decent education for their children, just as any of us would expect, and that is a crying shame in the Australia of today. They told heart-breaking stories of children who could not get the support they need, not because of a lack of will from their parents or their teachers but simply because the money and the resources were not there. Because of this, up to 100,000 children with disability are receiving no funded support in Australia, and many more are not receiving the funding they need to meet their needs.


These parents are not only worried about getting their children through the school year. They are also worried, of course, about what comes next. They know that without support to stay in schools their children may never gain the skills they need to join the workforce. I can only imagine what struggle these families will face when the Abbott government's further cuts will come into effect. What a huge waste of potential with so many children achieving below their best. The Abbott government must rule out further cuts to education.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-03-25,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (17:50):   I rise today to speak to this matter of public importance, that being the Abbott government's refusal to rule out further cuts to health and education in my state, New South Wales. We are obviously on the eve of a state election, and we are six weeks out now from the next federal budget. I will put to this place that the commitments that were made on the eve of the last election that there would be no cuts to health and no cuts to education have obviously not been met. 


On budget night last year, almost a year ago to the day, we learned that the commitment of the government to a Gonski unity ticket applied only to the first four years of Labor's six-year transition. Their long-term allocation of Commonwealth funding for schools is not consistent with the principles and reforms recommended by the Gonski panel. The Liberal Party's pre-election policy on higher education stated that they would, firstly, ensure the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding and, secondly, work with the sector to reduce the burden of red tape, regulation and reporting.




Senator Seselja:
  Say it like you mean it, Sam.




Senator DASTYARI:
  What Australia got was a proposal for wholesale deregulation of the higher education sector. What Australia got was the prospect of $100,000 university degrees.




Senator Seselja:
  Do it like Dougie does it.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, could you please stop the interjections from the good senator from the Australian Capital Territory, who I note is not a New South Wales senator?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  Given that you are seeking my assistance, Senator Dastyari, Senator Seselja, could you refrain from interjecting.




Senator DASTYARI:
  It is clear that he is afraid of the truth.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Dastyari, please take your seat. Senator Seselja on a point of order.




Senator Seselja:
  I know it is in accordance with standing orders that if a senator asks for protection from the chair then there should be no interjection, so I will definitely take your advice!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I appreciate your compliance, Senator Seselja. Senator Dastyari, proceed—with no interjections!




Senator DASTYARI:
  I just get concerned that I think some senators on the other side are afraid of some of the truths and the facts that are being put on the record by me. They will do what they can to try to silence me! I just want to be clear that when it comes to standing up for New South Wales I will not be shushed in this place!


Tony Abbott and the Liberals want to take Australia down the path of a two-tiered higher education system. The Americanisation of our universities will put a degree beyond the reach of many young people in New South Wales. A university degree should depend on hard work and good marks, not your parents' bank balance. A degree should never be a debt sentence for students and their families, who are already struggling to make ends meet. Australia needs an education system that provides an opportunity for every young Australian who wants one.


The tragedy of what we have seen happen in terms of education reform, at both the school level and the higher education level, is that the actions of this government have not met the rhetoric they took to the last federal election. If the people of Australia had been given a frank assessment and frank information about the reality of the horrors that were going to transpire after the election on both higher education reform and school funding, I believe it would have had a large impact on the federal election.


When it comes to the issue of education funding, there is an opportunity for the people of New South Wales to have their say on it this weekend—to actually have their say on the model and what has been proposed by the government, particularly the failure of the New South Wales state government to stand up and fight against the cuts, particularly the cuts to the Gonski reforms, which the government has failed on. There is an opportunity available to New South Wales residents this weekend. I urge them to take that opportunity.


I also wish to speak about the cuts to health we have seen unfold, especially in future funding for our health sector. At the launch of the coalition's health policy, on 22 August 2013, Mr Abbott, the then Leader of the Opposition stated:


… I am giving an absolute commitment here today that the overall levels of health funding will be maintained.


But his budget imposed an $80 billion cut to health and education spending over next decade. Also, in August 2013, Mr Abbott stated, 'We are not shutting any Medicare locals.' But all 61 Medicare Locals will now be scrapped and replaced with new local health networks, which are a pale imitation of what was being provided.


While the Prime Minister has now backed down in the face of massive community opposition, he has, by attempting to introduce a GP tax, also broken his promise that there will be no new taxes. It was a $5 tax, a $20 tax and then a $7 tax. The figure kept changing, but when it settled at the $7 model it was estimated that this would cost Australian families $3.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs—a hit on the most vulnerable Australians.


When we are sitting here in this chamber in Canberra we talk about these things as big principles, but I want to talk about the reality of what some of this means at the local hospital level. I would like to speak briefly about the challenges facing one area of Sydney, and I am picking this area because I think it is a good example. I am referring to the St George region in Sydney's South-East and those who live and work in the suburbs along the Eastern Suburbs train line in places like Rockdale and Kogarah, and also the residents from all across the state of NSW who have cause to call upon the services of St George Hospital.


St George Hospital, located near the shoreline of Botany Bay and close to Sydney Airport, serves the entire state of New South Wales, whether it is the cattleman near Cobar who has fallen from a horse, or kids in Kogarah who have come off their skateboards. The emergency ward at St George Hospital is one of the most overstretched in New South Wales. Under the national benchmark, hospitals are required to treat 81 per cent of emergency patients within four hours of presentation. St George Hospital is well below this target, with 41 per cent waiting more than four hours for treatment. Between July and September 2014, more than 870 patients were still in the emergency department nearly 14 hours after arriving. The South East Sydney Local Health District's Asset Strategic Plan 2012-2017 documented numerous failings at St George Hospital. I quote them here:


The current ICU [Intensive Care Unit] capacity is saturated and land locked. There is 1 bathroom for 15 critical patients and nil for CICU [Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit].


The plan also states that there is a 'high infection control risk' and 'refurbishment for hybrid theatres will not provide adequate space for technology'.


I am very conscious of the time and there is much more I would have liked to have said on this topic. But I do want to say that the people of New South Wales have an opportunity this weekend to stand up and be heard on these issues.


In conclusion, I thank the good senator from the ACT for hearing me in silence!

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:58):  Unlike Senator Dastyari, I will not be claiming my right to have the Acting Deputy President's protection from interjections, because, as you would know Acting Deputy President O'Neill, it is within the standing orders that where interjections are helpful to debate they are allowed, and I was certainly going to be very helpful to Senator Dastyari! But a senator can claim the protection of the chair, which Senator Dastyari has done. So good on him for claiming that protection! I think it is nice that he feels the need to do that rather than have a genuine debate about it.


There is a reason he did not want to hear it: most of what he was saying was absolute claptrap. There was no truth in it. He was making it up as he went along, and the last thing he would have wanted was an alternative voice in that debate. We do look forward to the New South Wales election. It will be interesting to see whether the Labor Party does better this time than they did when Sam Dastyari was running their campaign! It will be interesting to see the comparison between the two results. 




Senator Dastyari:
  I'm sure they'll do much, much better.

Senator Cameron:
  Then you had to kneecap a senator to get in here!




Senator SESELJA:
  We can compare notes on the 36 per cent TPP! But I should not get sidetracked by these issues, because what I wanted to do was actually put some facts on the table that Senator Dastyari neglected, which is why he did not want to engage in that debate. I will go a little bit to Senator Dastyari's home state, as well as other states.


Let us start with hospitals, because hospital funding from the Commonwealth is increasing at a significant rate. Commonwealth funding for hospitals, contrary to what those opposite say, is expected to grow significantly in the future, from $13.5 billion in 2013-14 to $18.3 billion in 2017-18, an increase of almost $5 billion. What part of that is a cut? We have to put facts on the table to counter the misrepresentations from those opposite. Hospital funding will grow from $13½ billion in 2013-14 to $18.3 billion in 2017-18. 


In Queensland, hospital funding will increase from $3 billion in 2014-15 to $3.7 billion in 2017-18—a $700 million increase in Queensland. In New South Wales, Senator Dastyari's home state, it will increase from $4.7 billion in 2014-15 to almost $5.8 billion in 2017-18. That is a massive increase—from $4.7 billion to $5.8 billion in New South Wales. Then we go to Victoria, where it will increase from $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion; in South Australia, from $1 billion to $1.3 billion; in Western Australia, from $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion; in the ACT, from $283 million to $300 million; and, in Tasmania, from $312 million to $380 million. In the Northern Territory, hospital funding will increase each year from $153 million in 2014-15 to $192 million in 2017-18. 


Those are the facts. That is what is happening under the coalition government, despite the absolute financial mess left by the economic vandals on the other side, the Labor Party, supported by those other economic vandals, the Greens. Despite that, we are seeing a massive increase in Commonwealth investment in hospitals in this country, as I have just laid out state by state, territory by territory.


Labor claimed that, in the never-never, beyond the forward estimates, they would somehow find billions of extra dollars over and above the billions of extra dollars that we are actually delivering. We know that claim was false. We know they could not have done it. It will be interesting to hear—and I do not know if it is Senator Cameron who will be following me in speaking—from Labor senators whether or not they will now commit to that growth beyond the out years that they apparently were so keen on but could never find the money for. We are delivering the billions of extra dollars.


The test for the Labor Party now is that, if they believe in that policy—if they believe in the never-never projections that they did not fund, they were not prepared to fund and they could not find the money for—they should commit to it. We could actually have a policy now from the Labor Party that, if they are re-elected beyond the out years, beyond the increases that we are delivering, they will have massive increases on top of that. If we do not hear that, we will know that it is all hollow rhetoric: they never intended to deliver it. They did not have the capacity to deliver it and now they will not commit to it. But perhaps they will prove me wrong, and we will hear them say in this debate, 'Yes, we actually now are going to be able to deliver it. It's a promise. We will deliver.' I do not think they will.


Let us go to education. Total recurrent Commonwealth funding to all schools across Australia will total over $65 billion as at MYEFO over the 2014-17 funding period. Of course, we are delivering more in these four years than the Labor Party were going to deliver, because they ripped out $1.2 billion. So not only are we delivering the increase; we are delivering an extra $1.2 billion. If Labor had been re-elected, there would be $1.2 billion less in the four-year budget period for schools in this country. That is a fact. 


Total Commonwealth funding to all schools across Australia will increase by $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase from 2014-17: 9.3 per cent from 2014-15; 8.2 per cent from 2015-16; and 9.1 per cent from 2016-17. Total Commonwealth funding to government schools will grow by $1.8 billion by 2017, a 37.1 per cent increase, while funding to the non-government sector will grow by 24.5 per cent over the same period. Here in the ACT, we know that funding for government schools will grow by $10 million by 2017, a 13.8 per cent increase, while funding for the non-government sector will grow by 20.5 per cent over the same period.


This MPI is scaremongering. It is wrong. The facts are that we are increasing health and education funding, even if we inherited Labor's— (Time expired)

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (18:06):  I rise to contribute to this discussion on further cuts to health and education. If Tasmanian Liberal members of this place had told the truth about the cuts they had planned to both health and education, it is likely that they would not be members of this parliament today. The people of Tasmania would not have voted for members of any political party who came to this place and advocated a cut in resources and funds to the University of Tasmania or additional health costs and charges being imposed on our sick, elderly and disabled people. The Liberal members of this palace, as well as the lower house three amigos, have gleefully been part of a disgusting, cowardly and dishonourable campaign to ambush the University of Tasmania and every other Australian university with a 20 per cent cut to their funding.




Senator Ruston:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I think the senator should refer to members in the other place by their correct titles and not 'the three amigos'.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Smith
):  I remind Senator Lambie that members should be referred to by their correct titles.




Senator Cameron:
  On the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: it is quite clear that we use rhetorical flourishes. Senator Lambie has not identified anyone. I think using the term 'the three amigos' when you do not identify anyone is quite in order.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron—there is no point of order.




Senator LAMBIE:
  Recently I met personally with Professor Rathjen at a dinner in Parliament House, and I have met him on other occasions as well. Professor Rathjen's bombshell disclosure on Tasmanian ABC radio that, without additional funding, the future of the Burnie and Launceston campuses of the University of Tasmania could be in jeopardy was a brave move given the pattern of bullying behaviour exhibited by federal Liberal members towards academics who blew the whistle on the dangers associated with the proposed higher education changes.


The federal Liberals in Tasmania never guaranteed the $400 million of capital funding which is needed to help the University of Tasmania prosper and grow. All they wanted was to allow mainland higher education providers into the Tasmanian market to compete with the University of Tasmania. The Liberals know that the University of Tasmania will be harmed if higher education competitors are allowed to undercut it. Tasmania's reputation as a quality higher education provider and place of research excellence would have been damaged under the Liberals' plan. In addition, the Liberals' plan would have guaranteed the deregulated cost of degrees for university students would have skyrocketed.


In this debate, the Liberals have also failed to answer two of my important questions. Firstly, if the Nordic countries can deliver the best higher education in the world to their young people for free, why can't we? Secondly, in 1995 we spent 0.9 per cent of our GDP on higher education per annum and in 2013 we spent 0.6 per cent of our GDP on higher education. Why can't Australia boost our investment in higher education—investing in our kids, the future of Australia—to one per cent? There is no reason why the Liberal Party cannot do this, they just refuse to because they cannot prioritise things correctly. That seems to be happening a great deal in this chamber.


In closing, I note that federal funding for the Mersey hospital still has not been guaranteed or settled on—like much other Indigenous health funding around Australia. I raised this issue with the new health minister Sussan Ley, and I appreciate the time she gave me and her consideration. I would ask that this funding be guaranteed and delivered as soon as possible.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:10):  I am pleased to participate in this discussion on two of the key issues for this country—the health of the population and the education of the population. I note that Senator Nash made a 10- minute contribution and in my estimation she managed to talk about her own portfolio, and I will be very generous, for about a minute and a half, if that. We had a minute and a half from the junior minister on her portfolio. It was a pathetic performance. All we heard was the old rhetoric from the coalition about balanced budgets and responsible and sensible management of the economy. Who in this country believes that the coalition are capable of sensible and responsible management of the economy? No-one, really, because they have seen the budget. We know the budget was based on a complete fallacy. Prior to the election, people were told there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to the SBS, no cuts to the ABC and no cuts to pensions. That was the line being run out, and it was nothing more than a line. 


When did we see the coalition's real policy? We saw the real coalition policy in the budget. In the budget we saw a move away from every promise they made—on health, on education, on the ABC, on the SBS and on pensions. It is one of the worst-received budgets ever. The budget was so bad that 40 per cent of the Liberal backbench wanted to get rid of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. That is how bad the budget was. Coalition backbenchers are now coming in and basically saying that they are economically responsible. How can it be economically responsible to take $80 billion out of the budget for health and education? What is responsible about that? What is responsible about targeting the weakest and most vulnerable people in our community? None of that is responsible. 


Senator Cormann was asked repeatedly yesterday in question time to rule out further cuts to health and hospitals, and he just refused to do it. Hopefully, sometime, Senator Nash can be in the same shot as Senator Cormann and maybe she can do the same as the foreign minister and put her head in her hands, shake her head in disgust and look with disgust at the Treasurer. Maybe Senator Nash can do that with Senator Cormann and maybe we will save further cuts to health and education. It seems to have worked in the other place when the foreign minister shook her head and looked disgusted about the contribution from the Treasurer, so maybe we should try doing that. Maybe the National Party, just for once, could stop using the rhetoric of opposition, could stop attacking the trade union movement in this country and concentrate on the issues that are good for rural and regional Australia. Maybe it could deal with the issues of a decent health system in rural and regional Australia and a decent education system—public schools that are well-resourced. Maybe for once we can hear the National Party deal with these important issues, but what do we get? We get the argument that Australia is an economic basket case. That was just put to the sword, that argument. It was put to the sword by the Minister for Trade and Investment, Mr Robb. What did Mr Robb say in a publication called: Why Australia: Benchmark report 2015—this is a senior frontbench Liberal. He says:


With more than 23 years of uninterrupted annual economic growth, a AAA sovereign risk profile and diverse, globally competitive industries, Australia remains well placed to build on an impressive record of prosperity.


Either we have got a budget emergency or Mr Robb has got it right. I know what the answer to that is: Mr Robb has got it right. We have got a AAA credit rating. We have had 23 years of uninterrupted economic growth, and yet we get scare campaigns from the coalition trying to justify the worst budget ever in this country. 


The people of New South Wales have to understand when they go to the polls that this is the Liberal Party that Mr Baird is the leader of, and Mr Baird supports the economic ideology of Mr Abbott. He cuddles up to Mr Abbott. He wears the same colour tie as Mr Abbott. He is part of the team. He is part of the club. He is a Liberal through and through. 


What is going to happen in New South Wales as a result of this budget? New South Wales schools will lose around $9.6 billion; and $1.3 billion from New South Wales universities. We are watching the TAFE system being decimated under federal and state Liberal coalition governments. New South Wales hospitals will lose more than $16½ under the Prime Minister's budget. 


We have Senator Seselja coming in here saying, 'We're increasing expenditure.' It is the oldest trick in the book. You just look at the GDP of the country and say: 'We're increasing expenditure,' but it does not tell you the real story. The real story is in the budget papers. That is where you look for the real story. If you look in the budget papers, what do they say about public hospitals in this country under the coalition government—$57 billion being cut out over a decade? That is what the budget papers say. That is in the budget, and you cannot come in here with some political argument from your advisers to try and give you cover for cutting $57 billion out. This is what is going to hurt people in New South Wales. If you are a family on $65,000 a year and you are going to be $6,000 worse off, how are you going to pay for your education? How are you going to pay for your health? It is just impossible. 


Pensioners—how are they going to pay for more when they are being ripped off to the tune of $80 a week under the projected cuts by the coalition government? A hundred New South Wales seniors will be $886.60 worse off each year as a result of the government's plan to abolish the seniors supplement. Then we will get petrol taxes imposed on top of that. 


The people who vote for the National Party drive more and use more petrol. They are not poor people who do not have a car; they are actually poor people who need a car. They use a car. They use petrol, and yet we have got a Treasurer here who says that poor people do not drive. Well, where were the National Party—where were the doormats of the Senate—when this was being doled out? We never heard a word from the Nationals and we never heard a word from the Premier of New South Wales, Mike Baird. 


He started saying, 'We can't afford these cuts.' Since then, there has not been another word. The Liberal coalition team have kicked in. They are trying to cover up the real effects of this budget. This budget is bad for New South Wales. It is bad for education. It is bad for health and it is bad for the economy. (Time expired)

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:20):  Praise the Lord time has expired on Senator Cameron who is struggling to wind himself up and get all hot under the collar about the National Party not standing up for regional Australia. We will never stop standing up for regional Australia. We will never stop standing up to make sure that more rural kids get to school and university, more young people get into jobs and have bright and prosperous futures; more of our population as they age, have access to ageing in their own communities; and that indeed our hospital services are filled with regional doctors, nurses and allied health professionals who are trained in the regions. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Smith
):  Order! Senators are reminded that senators are to be heard in silence. 




Senator McKENZIE:
  Thank you so much, Mr Acting Deputy President Smith: Senator Cameron can get quite wild and woolly when it is such a boring matter of public importance. I tell you: the matter before us today is a little bit like the Labor Party's policy initiatives—it is all blank ideas and question marks above their heads as the tactics team the night before, or Senator Brown maybe early this morning, gathered around the whip's or the leader's table and asked: 'What have you got? What have you got? I've got nothing. It's like our policy drawer—nothing.' So we are here talking about cuts to health and education. Last week, it was the 'budget of despair'; this week, the talking points are all about cuts. The rhetoric just stays the same because they cannot face the reality. The reality is that there have not been any cuts to education funding and there have not been any cuts to health funding. Indeed, this government is very proud of investing in those two areas which underpin the social architecture of our communities. 


I think that the contribution from Labor senators—like so many of their contributions in this place since the election—simply shows that they cannot deal with the legacy of their own government. They cannot deal with the reality that the debt and deficit legacy that they left our government and, indeed, our nation to deal with is significant. In 2012-13 the price of iron ore was $126 per tonne; the price is projected to come in at $60 over 2014-15. That is a significant cut in revenue. This is the reality that we are dealing with. We are dealing with a budget that was constructed over those six years and that actually had all the payment down the track. It was big on promises and very good on the media release, but very elusive in ensuring that those promises were paid for in the forward estimates. Those opposite come in now moaning and wailing about years 5 and 6 of Gonski, about year 5 and year 6 of this, and about year 10 of that. In reality, if they had had the economic acumen which they needed to run a strong budget for the nation in the national interest, they would have ensured that they put those figures into their budget. 


Who can forget the cuts to education under the Labor government? They cut $6.6 billion from 2011-12 to 2016-17. They do not talk about that, do they? Right throughout the budget of 2013-14 we had almost $1 million in cuts as the efficiency dividend; we had the removal of the 10 per cent HECS/HELP discount, $276 million; the conversion of student start-up scholarships to student loans, $1.1 billion. It just goes on and on. We talk about it all the time; you guys cut $6.5 billion out of higher education.


Who can forget that in 2012, health minister Tanya Plibersek cut funding to my home state of Victoria, and those cuts had a real impact on hospital budgets right around my state. The cuts were $107 million across the whole year and $475 million across four years. Those were Labor Party cuts whilst they were in government to health services in regional areas, on the front-line. Hospitals felt them. Bendigo Health's hospital urgently needed the money that it was promised and that was not delivered: $1.676 million in the red as a result of the failure of the then health minister to fund public hospitals. The Royal Women's Hospital had to plan to cut gynaecological and core services for women and babies. Dr Galbally said: 


These service cuts will have a significant impact on the health of Victorian women …


That was as a result of the $107 million cut to Victorian hospitals thanks to the now deputy leader of the Shorten opposition, Ms Plibersek. Similarly, in Maryborough, the fabulous local member, Mr Dan Tehan, raised the issue of the $173,000 funding cut to Maryborough's public hospital. So when Senator Cameron comes in and wails and moans about this side of the chamber, worrying about what happens on the ground in regional areas to health and education services, we are not the ones out there cutting funds to hospitals in those very places and affecting front-line services. I could go on and on.


What we are interested in, in this government, is securing the future for our nation—a future where young people can get a job; where Indigenous Australians are included not only in our Constitution but in our social and economic fabric in a very real way; where we have an education system that is accessible, equitable and excellent; and where there is a healthcare system that retains our world-class status. These are exactly the types of things that this side of the parliament is interested in securing for the future of our nation and our citizenry. We are passionate about that. That is exactly why we got into politics: to ensure that we can have those things and that our nation is set up for the 21st century. We have to pay for it. We have to ensure that we are responsible in government. It is exactly what we are hoping to deliver. We are looking forward to our next budget to ensure that we continue it.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (18:27):  Since commencing my role in the Senate, I have watched the Abbott government break promise after promise. In my home state of Queensland, we have endured harsh budget cuts not only at a federal level but also at the state level. Across Queensland, all levels of government have let the people of Queensland down. CSG mining has been allowed to expand at an alarming rate, damaging the environment, water, soil, land and air. Of further concern, it is also impacting the health of farmers and landowners across the state. 


The people of Queensland need increased investment in health and education, not cuts. We need additional resources allocated to support the people of Queensland who have been, and continue to be, impacted by the toxic effects of CSG mining. People are experiencing migraines, skin complaints, blood noses, breathing issues and other chronic health conditions. The chemicals used in CSG mining are known to cause serious health problems, including cancer. Landowners affected by CSG mining cannot afford doctors to assist them. I call on the government to do the right thing and allocate increased funding to the health sector; get medical teams out to regional and rural areas of Australia to treat people who are becoming sick from CSG mining; set up an independent testing centre; and start conducting proper comprehensive tests to determine the level of contamination that is occurring in people, animals, water, soil and the air as a result of CSG mining. These people need help. No-one is listening to them. The government must stop turning a blind eye and do something now to help all Australians affected by CSG mining.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (18:30):  I present the fourth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 4 of 2015, dated 25 March 2015 together with Work of the committee in 2014.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator POLLEY:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report on the work of the committee in 2014.


I rise to speak to the tabling of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee's report on the work of the committee in 2014.




Background



As most senators would be aware, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee scrutinises each bill introduced into the parliament and reports to the Senate if it considers that a provision in a bill may:


(i) trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties;


(ii) make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers;


(iii) make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions;


(iv) inappropriately delegate legislative powers; or


(v) insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny.




Changes to standing orders



There have been some changes to standing orders. A significant change for the committee in 2014 was the amendment of standing orders 24 and 25, agreed to on 15 July. These amendments arose following the committee's 2012 report into its future role and direction. Important changes to the standing orders in relation to a number of areas were agreed to, including an amendment to standing order 25. This amendment inserted standing order 25(2A), which provides that when legislation committees are examining bills they should take into account any comments on the bills published by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Further information in relation to the changes to standing orders 24 and 25 is contained in the report.




The work of the committee in 2014



The work of the committee in scrutinising bills against its five scrutiny principles assists and improves parliamentary consideration of legislation in a number of important ways. Outcomes of the committee's work include:


amendments to bills;


improved explanatory material;


more informed consideration of issues in legislation committee reports; and


more informed debate in the Senate and committees.


The committee's 2014 annual report outlines some key achievements of the committee during the year, and I would like to take this opportunity to briefly comment on a few of those.


The report notes that an important aspect of the committee's work in 2014 was scrutinising several significant counterterrorism and national security bills. The committee commented on a number of issues in relation to these bills and, as a result, explanatory material associated with the bills was revised.


The committee regularly requests that additional information be included in explanatory memoranda to ensure that provisions of bills on which the committee has commented are adequately explained. The committee therefore welcomed the revisions to the explanatory memoranda for the national security and counterterrorism bills following the committee's scrutiny of the bills.


Several government amendments to the national security and counterterrorism bills were also moved as a result of the committee's comments. For example, in relation to the authorisation of 'special intelligence operations', an amendment was moved so that a 'special intelligence operation authority' is now required to state a description of the nature of the authorised conduct (rather than just a 'general description' of the nature of that conduct).


The committee also routinely forwards its comments on bills to Senate legislation committees. The annual report outlines some examples of reports by legislation committees that have drawn on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's comments, such as the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry into the provisions of the Australian Citizenship and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2014.


The report also notes examples where the committee's comments have been referred to in debate in the Senate and at public hearings of legislation committees inquiring into bills. For example, during a hearing of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee into the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's comments in relation to the exclusion of the common law rules of natural justice were raised by witnesses appearing at the hearing.




Issues of continuing interest



The report also notes some issues which the committee will continue to monitor into the future. For example, the committee will closely monitor provisions that delegate legislative powers to ensure that the disallowance process applies and that any departure from this approach is fully justified in the explanatory material. The committee also monitors these provisions to ensure that important matters are included in primary legislation, rather than delegated legislation. For example, in 2014 the committee noted its preference that legislative authority for arrangements and grants, following the High Court's decisions in the Williams cases, should be included in primary legislation to allow full parliamentary involvement in, and consideration of, such proposals.


The committee will also continue to monitor the classification of expenditure items in appropriation bills and may query instances in which expenditure items appear to be inappropriately classified as 'ordinary annual services of the government' as this prevents the Senate from exercising its constitutional right to amend non-ordinary annual services items.




Focus for 2015



In addition to undertaking its general scrutiny function, the committee has also considered areas in which it may focus its attention during 2015 to support an increased awareness of, and access to, the committee's work. In particular, the committee intends to introduce new information resources on its website, such as guidelines containing practical information about the committee's work and scrutiny expectations.


The committee also plans to undertake a project that will emphasise the importance of providing comprehensive explanatory material and which will be intended to help those drafting explanatory memoranda to make them as useful as possible. The committee will continue to liaise with other committees, including Senate legislation committees, the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, in 2015.


Finally, on behalf of the committee I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work and assistance of the committee's legal adviser, Associate Professor Leighton McDonald. I would also like to acknowledge the assistance of ministers and departments, as their responsiveness to the committee is critical to the legislative process as it ensures that the committee can perform its scrutiny functions effectively. And, noting the committee's long-standing practice of undertaking its scrutiny in a non-partisan, apolitical and consensual way, I also thank all of my current and former scrutiny committee colleagues for their understanding of the committee's approach to its work and their commitment to it. I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the hardworking Committee Secretary, Ms Toni Dawes, and her team. We all in this place appreciate the outstanding work that is done by our committee secretaries.


I commend the committee's report, Work of the committee in 2014, and the committee's fourth report and Alert Digest No. 4 of 2015 to the Senate, and I look forward to its next annual report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND RESOURCES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2015


The Public Governance and Resources Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2015 (the Bill) would, if enacted, amend 33 Acts, in relation to matters of a governance or resource management nature.


The Bill follows on from the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2014 (PGPA C&T Act), which implemented a range of amendments to the enabling legislation of Commonwealth entities and companies to harmonise their operation with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act) from 1 July 2014.  


The Bill is part of a broader Public Management Reform Agenda and represents the next stage in the Government's approach towards streamlining and simplifying resource management and governance arrangements across the Commonwealth. While the PGPA C&T Act made changes to 242 Acts to reflect the introduction of the PGPA Act, not all enabling legislation could be amended due to the complexity of some arrangements. This Bill involves:


technical amendments that would further improve the operation of the PGPA Act, including a provision to support the administration of GST obligations by non-corporate Commonwealth entities;


amendments to provisions within the PGPA C&T Act that would streamline transitional arrangements supporting the implementation of the PGPA Act; 


amendments to the enabling legislation of Commonwealth entities intended for inclusion in the PGPA C&T Act but unable to proceed at that time due to complexity of arrangements; and


amendments to improve and clarify the governance and resource management arrangements of the enabling legislation of Commonwealth entities that have been identified in consultations with those entities during and since the development of the PGPA C&T Act.


While many of the amendments in the Bill are technical in nature, they provide greater certainty in relation to the operation of the PGPA Act.  


For example; arrangements operating under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (the FMA Act) for the administration of GST obligations were continued pending further consultation with affected entities.  These arrangements were only preserved until 30 June 2015.


The outcome of this process, which included the development and consideration of a discussion paper, was that these arrangements should continue, and the Bill provides the necessary support for the continuation of existing GST arrangements for non-corporate Commonwealth entities from 1 July 2015.  


Another example relates to repayments by the Commonwealth.  The transitional arrangements in the PGPA C&T Act will be amended to clarify that repayments by the Commonwealth are covered by section 77 of the PGPA Act, regardless of when the money was received by the Commonwealth.  Section 77 of the PGPA Act ensures that the consolidated revenue fund can be appropriated when a repayment is required and no other appropriation for the repayment exists.


The Bill also proposes amendments directed at improving efficiency and reducing red tape by harmonising and improving alignment with the PGPA Act across the statute book.  For example, the Bill: 


updates references in Commonwealth legislation from the FMA Act and CAC Act to the new financial framework to remove any outstanding ambiguities over the application of provisions; and


simplifies enabling legislation where provisions of the PGPA Act cover an issue previously dealt with in enabling legislation, such as disclosure of interest arrangements, which are provided for in section 29 of the PGPA Act.  The Clean Energy Regulator Act 2011 currently contains disclosure of interest requirements that are duplicative and represent unnecessary red tape.  The Bill would amend the Clean Energy Regulator Act 2011 to streamline these arrangements.


The Bill also contains amendments to entity enabling legislation, as identified by Ministers, to improve and clarify their broader governance and resource management arrangements.  


The Bill would amend the Air Services Act 1995 to address a longstanding issue involving the exposure of Airservices Australia to undue foreign currency risk, due to limitations on hedging activities.  The Bill amends the Air Services Act 1995 to address this issue, by enabling Airservices Australia to undertake activities to effectively mitigate the risk of adverse financial consequences to the entity. 


The Bill, if enacted, will support the PGPA Act and simplify regulatory requirements to contribute to long-term efficiencies, such as achieving improved governance, transparency and accountability arrangements for Commonwealth entities within the Australian Government.


The Bill  is another step towards streamlining and simplifying resource management and governance arrangements across the Commonwealth.


I commend the Bill.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (22:30):  In the available time this evening, I would like to focus on an issue that I would contend is among the most significant financial issue facing Western Australia and of particular significance for pastoralists in my home state. Native title is a complex issue that has a greater impact on Western Australia than any other Australian jurisdiction. It is worth placing the present situation in some historical context. 


On 3 February 1994, shortly after the Native Title Act was passed by the federal parliament, the then Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating wrote to the Western Australian Premier of the day, Richard Court, pledging that the Commonwealth would bear 'the lion's share of the burden for compensating for native title'. The offer made was that the Commonwealth would fund up to 75 per cent of the compensation costs arising from the validation of past acts on determined native title land. 


Five years later under a coalition government, on 22 August 1998, that position was reconfirmed with the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard, writing to the Premier of Western Australia, again Mr Court, stating that the Commonwealth would fund 75 per cent of all future native title compensation as well as validation of past acts.


Almost two years after Labor returned to federal office in August 2009, the Commonwealth Attorney-General advised the Western Australia government that there would be a suspension of the deal that had been reached between the states and the Commonwealth in relation to the funding of native title compensation due to the global financial crisis. In May 2011, the Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett received a letter from the then Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, which advised him that the federal government would no longer honour the agreement and that $241 million of debt arising from the Commonwealth's 2009 decision to suspend the deal would not be paid to Western Australia. 


Separate to this issue is the question of funding for respondents in native title claims, which was another area in which the former Labor government sold out the interests of Western Australian pastoralists. Following the decision of the High Court in the Mabo No. 2 case in 1992, the Commonwealth enacted the Commonwealth Native Title Act 1993. That legislation sets out the various processes through which native title can be recognised and protected. Section 213A of the Native Title Act 1993 provides financial assistance for native title respondents for reasonable legal representation and disbursement costs incurred in native title proceedings, including funding for native title officers. That assistance remained in place for almost 20 years through the Keating, Howard and Rudd governments and for the bulk of the Gillard government.


However, a system that had provided a measure of stability and certainty for nigh on two decades was ended by the stroke of a pen on 1 January 2013, when the Gillard government withdrew funding assistance for respondents in native title claims. This meant that henceforth, respondents were required to fund their own legal representation and to pay for their own legal costs. At the same time, the Gillard government withdrew its funding for native title officers, which had a huge impact on the pastoral and commercial fishing sectors across Western Australia, and forced some primary organisations to withdraw from native title proceedings.


As a senator for Western Australia, I was exceptionally pleased when early in the life of this coalition government, Attorney-General Senator Brandis announced that this government would be restoring funding for respondents in native title claims. It was announced that from 1 January 2014, the Abbott government will be providing $2.2 million over two years to assist people who demonstrate that a native title claim is likely to have a significant impact on their interests. This includes pastoralists, local councils, commercial fishers and miners, as well as native title officers. The reinstatement of this funding allows for fair and equitable finalisation of existing native title claims, and will hopefully alleviate the uncertainly that arose when the Gillard government suddenly changed the rules in the middle of the game. Yet, as I said at the beginning of my contribution, this is a complex issue, and the reinstatement of funding does not in and of itself resolve all those complications, which I will highlight in a moment.


It is worth bearing in mind that there are about 100 unresolved native title claims in the pastoral regions of Western Australia, of which 85 are active claims that affect 513 pastoral leases across Western Australia. The vast bulk of these claims are over land that falls within the federal electorate of Durack, of which I am the patron senator. In Western Australia all native title claims are determined in the Federal Court with the Western Australian state government as first respondent. As the only native title rights that can coexist with a pastoral lease are those that are not inconsistent with the rights of the pastoralists, pastoralists hold existing interests in Crown land concurrently with native title holders and, as such, they have a real interest in native title claims. Thus, it stands to reason that, just like native title claimants, they too should be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard in Federal Court on matters in connection with native title proceedings.


The optimal outcome for all parties involved in native title claims is for them be resolved through mediation rather than litigation, utilising Indigenous Land Use Agreements—voluntary agreements that primarily relate to land access. These agreements are registered and held by the National Native Title Tribunal. They bind all persons who hold native title to the agreement, whether they were parties or not.


The native title mediation process can often provide the only occasion on which all relevant stakeholders have an opportunity to meet and discuss any issues or concerns about the relationship between coexisting native title rights and interests and pastoralist rights and interests. Over the past two decades, both pastoralists and native title claimants have found this process useful as it promotes successful outcomes, generally reached in a non-adversarial manner. Due to the remoteness and vast distance covered by WA's pastoral region, it can often be practically and financially difficult for individual pastoralists to participate in native title proceedings. This has led to the establishment of group representation, utilising native title officers from recognised industry representative bodies funded through the Native Title Respondent Funding Scheme. In WA the only recognised body for the pastoral industry is the Pastoralists and Graziers Association. In Queensland it is AgForce, and in the Northern Territory it is the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association. The involvement of a key industry representative body ensures effective coordination and management of pastoral interests and thereby facilitates the resolution of native title matters. Without this form of group representation there would be significantly more individual respondents to native title claims, which would increase divisions in the community and make consent determinations in particular more difficult to achieve.


Following the withdrawal of funding by Labor in 2013, native title representative bodies established various processes to reduce the amount of funding previously used through legal representation, primarily by assuming the lead role in instructing lawyers on all matters; restricting the use of lawyers to only those instances where clear legal advice was required; and obtaining quotes on each legal matter when required. After the reinstatement of funding for native title respondents by the Abbott government in 2013, there were significant changes over the previous scheme, with funding going directly to legal representatives and limited funding for representative organisations. This has, in my view, hampered the capacity for effective group representation in native title determinations. In the case of Western Australia, this is further complicated by the fact that the state has recently revised its approach to consent determinations and will no longer provide a position paper to respondents summarising its view of the suitability of a claim for a consent determination.


The state of Western Australia has indicated that it now wishes for native title claimants to engage directly with respondents. As a result of this, pastoralists will require further support from their representative bodies. Without continued funding support, pastoralists and their representative organisations will be unable to continue in their role as coordinating the pastoral response to native title claims. Ultimately this will disadvantage both pastoralists and native title claimants, not to mention the native title process, which is at its most effective when conducted in a non-adversarial manner. Resolving this issue in a manner satisfactory to all parties will be challenging but is not impossible given the genuine goodwill that I believe exists across all sides of the native title process. As a senator for Western Australia I look forward to playing my part in working with colleagues to secure funding for group representation after 1 January 2016 so that our native title framework operates in a manner that is fair and provides certainty to all parties.
