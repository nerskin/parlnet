Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (09:31):  It does not give me a great deal of pleasure to rise to speak to the Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill 2014, but I want to congratulate my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson for bringing this bill forward. It still leaves me somewhat speechless that behind the scenes the Australian executive—through our trade minister and senior trade bureaucrats—are negotiating a treaty that would see Australia effectively subordinate state and national law to global corporate trade law. What this bill seeks to do is take on one element of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is being negotiated in secret as we speak and which, depending on which rumours you believe, may be as close as two or three weeks away from being signed and then presented to this parliament. This is as a trade agreement being signed under cover of total darkness. Isn't it interesting that when the global community gets together to negotiate difficult and complex environmental agreements that happens out in the open? The negotiators from various parties trying to hammer out climate change agreements have to do that in open forum. Sure, there are deals done in back rooms and all the usual things that go on, but everybody knows what it is that Australia would be potentially signing up to. When it comes to global trade agreements, not even the minister necessarily knows. 


I think that the first thing that we need to get very clear about when we consider the Trans-Pacific Partnership is that this is not a free trade agreement in the sense that we are used to. It is not even being negotiated between sovereign governments. It is actually being negotiated between large corporate entities in various sectors, and those corporations—whether big pharma, rights holders, the biotechnology industry or agriculture; take your pick—are then handing negotiating positions to trade negotiators in various countries and having those positions hammered into a text. This is an agreement being hammered out by global corporations in their benefit. It is an investors' rights agreement; it is not a free trade agreement.


We only know the little that we know about the actual text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership because whistleblowers have leaked draft chapters of the text—two iterations of the IP chapter and one iteration of the chapter relating to environmental protection—to the WikiLeaks website. While that organisation has been hammered from all quarters, it has never been proven to be more important than now as the place where we can go to find out exactly what is being done in our name. 


So I congratulate Senator Whish-Wilson for bringing forward this very targeted bill. It obviously does not go to the entire scope of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because nobody will tell us exactly what that is, but it does go to the very specific notion of investor-state dispute mechanisms—one of those acronyms that might make your eyes glaze over, until you realise that what it allows to happen would be for multinational corporations to sue sovereign governments. This parliament considers itself sovereign, and I know from personal experience that the mob at the Tent Embassy and around the country—traditional owners—would take very strong issue with that. The business of sovereignty in this country is probably the most important piece of unfinished business for us to confront. But the fact is that, from the prayers that were just read in, you would assume that those from all sides of this parliament come in here charged with making and amending laws and providing good governance in the interests of everyone across this continent. But what happens if the laws that we pass in here are found to be offensive to the profit-generating activities of corporations on the other side of the world? The Australian government—as is actually occurring, although I am not sure many people are aware of it—could be dragged into a tribunal of unelected foreign trade bureaucrats, sued and forced to amend the affecting regulation if it impinges on the profits of a company on the other side of the world.


It sounds insane, but that is in fact precisely what is being negotiated behind closed doors by the Australian government and, when they were in government, by the Australian Labor Party. One of the things that I hope that Senator Carr or whoever speaks on behalf of the Labor Party will do when they are given the opportunity is put some cards on the table and make it very clear where the ALP stand. My understanding is that they would be in support of Senator Whish-Wilson's bill. When they were in government, I think they did have form in opposing investor-state dispute mechanisms that would allow state or federal governments to be sued by corporations who found themselves offended, but it is not at all clear where they stand now. So that is another reason why I would like to thank Senator Whish-Wilson for bringing this debate forward today.


Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who is a Nobel laureate in economics and somebody who spends a fair bit of time thinking about these things, said the following:




The TPP proposes to freeze into a binding trade agreement many of the worst features of the worst laws in the TPP countries, making needed reforms extremely difficult if not impossible.





The investor state dispute resolution mechanisms should not be shrouded in mystery to the general public, while the same provisions are routinely discussed with advisors to big corporations.



None of this is being done in the national interest. This is an agreement being hammered out in the corporate interest. If somebody as esteemed in his field as Professor Stiglitz is of that view, we should take that very, very seriously.


We are fortunate, as I said to those staff, campaigners and journalists in the publishing organisation WikiLeaks, that they have had the bravery to have stayed in business despite the extraordinary persecution that has been meted out to them so that we do have some sense of what is in the IP chapters. There are some very specific concerns. I want to concentrate today mostly on an area that is very dear to me: areas around freedom of information, freedom of speech and digital rights, which are placed explicitly under threat by what we find contained in the IP chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and also by what happens when you bring investor-state dispute mechanisms to bear on some of these issues. A lot of damage was done when Australia signed the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, and I think it has been government policy to try to avoid, if possible, forcing any amendments into domestic law as a result of the IP chapter. It is not at all clear whether that is actually the case. We may be faced with a bill which we will be told, on a 'take it or leave it' basis, that this parliament has to pass.


I would also say, for those who may be following this debate from outside and may be a bit confused by the government's rhetoric of due process, that we have the treaties committee, which is designed to evaluate mechanisms like the TPP. I served on the treaties committee for 5½ years—nearly six years. That committee will not get a copy of the Trans-Pacific Partnership until after the government signs it. And while the committee, in my experience, does apply a very critical eye to these things, the government is not bound to accept any of its recommendations. The treaties committee will do the best that it can, but the agreement will already have been signed—trade ministers' and prime ministers' signatures will already be on the document—by the time Australia's accountability and oversight mechanisms get the chance to take a look at it. And then it will be a case of this parliament being told—effectively with a gun to its head—that it has to pass the enabling legislation to bring some of these provisions into force. What an utterly backwards and antiquated process for dealing with such an important issue.


So, we have already done a certain amount of damage in Australian law. We effectively imported some of the worst aspects of US IP law, without their protections. The US has fair-use clauses, which mean that you cannot be prosecuted under US intellectual property law for doing stuff that is quite clearly not impinging on profits—commercial-scale piracy and that kind of stuff. In Australia the situation is very much unclear, and it appears that the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from what we know of the IP chapters, will make that situation much worse. And that is my principal question of what the rush is in bringing in mandatory data retention legislation—not necessarily so that the Federal Police can go and prosecute people who are found to be file sharing but so that rights holders from the US and elsewhere can go and trawl the metadata records of your teenage kids and send them threatening legal letters and the threat of gargantuan fines unless they pay up, or lengthy court cases unless they pay enormous fines. That is the kind of world that we are potentially stepping into here.


The document as it stands contains disproportionate and inappropriate enforcement provisions. It is all about enforcing the rights of rights holders, most of them from overseas, and there is nothing at all about public interest protections. Just to give you one example, a couple of years ago the Australian Law Reform Commission, partly in response to some of the damaging provisions that we embedded in Australian law after the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement was brought about, conducted quite a detailed inquiry into the copyright regime that prevails here in Australia. One of the recommendations they made at the time was to bring fair-use provisions—to effectively import some of the protective measures that exist in US law. We have the punitive stuff; we do not have the protective provisions.


And the fact is that if we were to now do so—if we sign up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which then embeds all kinds of property rights that did not exist before, for the rights holders—if this parliament then decided to do as the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended and institute a fair-use regime, that could be struck down by unelected trade bureaucrats in a tribunal, and the Australian government might choose to not even contest what would likely be a very expensive and extensive arbitral process. So, it may be that Attorney-General George Brandis, who is quite clearly listening only to the rights holders, does not even decide to contest it. It is that chilling effect on domestic legislation that is such an important and terrifying part of what this government is negotiating behind the scenes. And it looks like extension of copyright terms is in the agreement as well. That effectively just takes material out of the public domain for decades. It makes the work of cultural institutions and collection agencies that much harder, and it robs us of our own culture. 'Copyright term extensions' sounds arcane, but basically it just means all this rich cultural material simply going dark, archival institutions not even being able to digitise or make copies of material that in analogue form is degrading or being lost.


So, we have a very significant problem, and it is one that this parliament will not be able to address until it is far too late. I think one of the simplest things we could do is bring forward this bill for a vote today and pass into Australian domestic law protections against any Australian government signing us up to investor-state dispute mechanisms. That is the thing to do if you are concerned about fracking, if you are concerned about advertising tobacco products in places where kids can see it, if you are concerned about a ban on uranium mining, for example, or any of those issues where communities come into collision with powerful corporate interests, whether it be tobacco, big pharma, genetically modified organisms in our food, or the fracking industry—take your pick. Anywhere that these major collisions between the corporate interest and the public interest are underway, these very same corporations are seeking that power to sue us, to sue this parliament, to sue state parliaments.


Nobody on the government side of this chamber will make eye contact this morning because they have not read the agreement either. They have no idea what is in it. They just hear from our trade bureaucrats: 'It's fine; we're looking after the national interest. It's a free trade agreement like nothing you've ever seen before.' Well, at least that part is true.


But we owe it to ourselves and to our constituents, and to the future flexibility of this legislature to be able to do its job, to protect ourselves from predator capitalism and from these corporate interests, unelected, on the other side of the world, who would like nothing more than to subordinate the law-making power of this chamber and the other place to their own interests. All you would need to prove—and not even really prove; all you would need to be able to show—is your future potential profits in fracking underneath a residential subdivision or farmland, your future potential profits in opening up a carcinogenic uranium mine or your future profits in being able to track down and prosecute teenagers BitTorrenting stuff that they cannot get any other way, to be able to sue a government, to sue this parliament.


So I hope that we will see a measured, intelligent, evidence based debate on this this morning. I hope that the Labor Party will come clean with the Australian population about what its policy actually is. We will be listening beyond words, and we will be looking for a voting intention. And I hope the government might want to stand up and maybe even table a draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. That is not a serious expectation, but how about it? If this document is so benign, if it is in the public interest, if it is going to lead to a massive increase in GDP, if it is going to be a huge benefit to our agricultural sector or whoever else you think you are out there negotiating on behalf of, then put it into the daylight. Let us see the document. Let us see what is being negotiated in our names behind closed doors.


This bill should pass into law. It will not solve many of the issues contained in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, if this government is so reckless as to sign on. We will have to fight that through this parliament and in the community. But, once these agreements are signed, they are perilously difficult to unravel. They are impossible to wind back—because we will have granted property rights effectively across all of our collective futures to these corporations that only care about property rights and the profit motive.


It is our job, I think, to protect the public interest, not the commercial interest and the corporate interest. Our job in here today is to protect the public interest. So I look forward to a resolution of this matter so that we can send this bill to the other place for assent and protect ourselves from making potentially one of the most reckless and dangerous mistakes any parliament could make, which is to handcuff itself from its future legislative obligations to the people of this country.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-02-12,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (09:47):  I must be guilty! Apparently we are all beholden to corporate interests and corporations. I do not know if the strings are visible to people today, but I am just a puppet, apparently, for corporate interests. It is all based on conspiracies. It reminds me—there was a great movie, Team America, and one of the characters in that movie was asked to explain their claims about corporations. They said, 'Oh, yeah, well, corporations are out there, and they do corporationy things, and they go and make money.'


There is no evidence here at all. There is no evidence. And I have not just sat through and listened to Senator Ludlam's speech. I have read Senator Whish-Wilson's first contribution, his second reading speech, and also flicked through Senator Di Natale's speech, and there is no evidence. They have provided no evidence at all. They have only relied on base conspiracy theorists. That is where the Greens are ending up right now. They are relying on conspiracy theories rather than evidence. If these things were so bad, we would have some evidence of their ill effect. We would have some ill effect, because—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  Well, you are putting this bill up. And the requirement is on people bringing a bill to this chamber to provide evidence of why we should put it in place. We should not put legislation in place where there is not an identifiable problem that needs to be fixed. I think we can all agree on that. That is why we should pass laws in this place: to fix a problem that exists. Now, where is the problem?


We have already four FTAs with ISDS provisions in them. We have 21 bilateral trade agreements, bilateral investment agreements, with ISDS provisions in them. Some of those agreements go back 25 years. If there were problems with these provisions they would have manifested themselves. We have agreements with Singapore, Thailand, ASEAN and New Zealand, all with these provisions, but there are no problems. I will not name the 21 countries.


Over those 25 years—and this is something none of the Greens senators have mentioned—how many cases do you think the Australian government has been subject to, under these provisions? Senator Whish-Wilson, you probably know. How many cases?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Why don't you ask the Productivity Commission?




Senator CANAVAN:
  One case. I will get to the Productivity Commission. And that case has not even been resolved yet. This is a well-known case brought by Philip Morris on plain-packaging regulations. I will get to the international evidence, too, Senator Whish-Wilson. 




Senator CANAVAN:
  The Productivity Commission has been verballed a little. I note that some of the Greens senators have taken to quoting the Productivity Commission, saying that we should not include these provisions in ICS agreements. Let us read the whole quote of the Productivity Commission.




Senator Colbeck:
  Selective quotes!




Senator CANAVAN:
  I would not expect the Greens to do selective quoting, but there is a first time for everything. This is exactly what the Productivity Commission said:


Australian Governments should seek to avoid the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions in BRTAs that grant foreign investors in Australia substantive or procedural rights greater than those enjoyed by Australian investors.


I do not dispute that view. But the Greens always leave out that little bit—it is only those bits that provide substantively greater procedural rights. That has not happened in any of these agreements. If it had, we would have seen that evidence.


I listened to Senator Ludlam earnestly worrying about how this provision could stop us dealing with fracking, and I think uranium mining, and all these other things. If you read the Korean FTA that we have only just signed, chapter 18 deals with the environment and these issues that Senator Ludlam raised. The very first article, 18.1, in that chapter says:


Recognizing the right of each Party to establish its own levels of environmental protection and environmental development priorities, and to adopt or modify accordingly its environmental laws and policies, each Party shall ensure that its laws provide for and encourage high levels of environmental protection and shall strive to continue to improve their respective levels of environmental protection, including through such environmental laws and policies.


There are no restrictions against a country acting to protect its environment under the Korean FTA or under any of our other bilateral investment agreements. The Greens have quoted from none of these ISDS agreements to prove otherwise.


Senator Whish-Wilson also raised the point about international evidence. It is true, internationally there is much more experience associated with ISDS clauses. There are, across the world, 2,400 bilateral investment treaties in place. Of those bilateral investment treaties, 90 per cent have not had a single investor claim under them for a treaty breach. Fewer than 10 per cent of these 2,400 agreements have ever been triggered, even once. I did not hear Senator Ludlam say this, but sometimes people claim that there has been a surge in ICS claims. 


There has been an increase. I do not have the numbers of the increase in claims here, but the key point to make is that these increases are proportional to the amount of outward foreign capital investment in the world. I am not sure if I am allowed to use props, but there is a graph from a report I read this morning that shows, very clearly, that the number of claims—sorry, I do have the figures here—have risen to about 600 a year now we are averaging in ISDS claims. But that is directly proportional to the increase in foreign direct investment across the world. It is a very good thing that we have more foreign direct investment. It has allowed economies, particularly developing economies, to increase their growth considerably over the past 50 years. When you think about—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Why did you leave out the US free trade agreement?




Senator CANAVAN:
  Why did we leave out the US free trade agreement? Because we did not need it with the US. We on this side believe we should evaluate these things on a case-by-case basis. Oils ain't oils, Senator Whish-Wilson; through you Mr Deputy President. We should evaluate these things as we see fit. We do not need it with the US because both Australia and the United States have very strong protections against property rights. There was no need for it. So let us look at it on a case-by-case basis. Before I was interrupted, I was talking about foreign direct investment. In 1959, the global stock of FDI was just US$60 billion—not a lot of money at all in the context of the world economy. But today it exceeds $25 trillion. That is a massive growth, and it is a very important growth because it has allowed, particularly, countries which are poorer and which lack capital to access capital from overseas countries. And one of the reasons it has been allowed to grow is thanks to these investment treaties, because they give investors—largely in developed countries, because that is where the capital is—the protection and the rights to make sure that it is—




Senator Fawcett:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order under standing order 197.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I can say that interjections which are not actually disrupting the debate are sometimes tolerated by the chair, particularly if they facilitate the exchange of views and arguments in a debate. However, if Senator Canavan does seek the protection of the chair, I will certainly provide him with that protection.




Senator CANAVAN:
  I am new to this, so perhaps I should. But look, I am quite enjoying it and I think that the Greens senators are enjoying it, so let us continue. I will let you know, Mr Deputy President, if my position changes in that regard.


As I was saying, these protections have been very important to facilitate that growth in investment. Prior to these protections coming into place, it was quite common for governments, particularly in developing countries, to expropriate property or to nationalise property, and to thereby take away the investments that foreign countries had made. Indeed, according to some evidence presented by the United Nations in a paper that I read this morning, in the 14 years prior to the entry into force of the first bilateral investment treaty, there were 875 government takings of foreign-investor property in 62 countries, for which there was no effective remedy. International law at the time provided very few protections for investors in those cases. It meant, of course, that there was a chilling effect on that foreign investment, and that many people would not invest.


I support foreign investment, particularly on the global scale. It is very important. And I do not understand why the Greens are, seemingly, so anti this—because, in other instances, the Greens are very cosmopolitan and very multicultural, and that is a fantastic thing. We should seek to have a world that shrinks, and becomes smaller, and in which we tighten our relationships with each other. Investment certainly does that. Trade helps to build relations; trade helps to make sure countries stay friendly with each other. But investment does it even more; when you buy something at the shop, you have a relationship with the shopkeeper, but when you invest in his business, you have a permanent relationship. We should seek to encourage that between countries. These treaties and agreements have also allowed us to move away from what was sometimes called gunboat diplomacy. That was a regrettable period in American history but, many times, the US government—in the 19th century in particular, and into the 20th century—used its military force to ensure that its investors were protected and that its trade rights were maintained. But I think we would all agree that that was not the right way to go about things. These new treaties have allowed investors—from the US, but actually more from Europe; the evidence is that European investors have been the biggest users of these clauses—protections, without the need to resort to governments offering military threats or, in the worst cases, military interventions. It is much better that we should jaw-jaw rather than war-war. Of course we are going to have disagreements through these agreements, and sometimes we might not get the best results we would like—although, as I said earlier, that has not happened to Australia yet. But it is much better that we resolve these disputes through a legal process rather than a more direct and violent one.


I also just want to go to some of the evidence in the international jurisprudence, and it goes to some of the points Senator Ludlam was making that somehow these provisions undermine the ability of governments to put in place environmental or health protections. In fact, that is not true at all when you actually look at the jurisprudence. Under the NAFTA—the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico, which includes an ISDS clause—there was a case brought by Chemtura, a chemical company. It brought the Canadian government to court. The investor challenged Canadian pesticide regulations, but the tribunal in this case ruled against Chemtura on all claims, and the panel expressly recognised Canada's right to make scientific and environmental regulatory decisions. There was another NAFTA case, called Methanex v United States. Again, the tribunal dismissed all of Methanex's claims of discriminatory treatment and expropriation, noting:


… as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects … a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.


Again, there are well-known protections both in ISDS agreements and in general trade law that allow governments to regulate for the public good.


But that is not to say that these agreements have been without effect. They are not completely timid. These agreements do offer protection, and they have in fact offered protection to Australian investors, because what is often lost here is that it is a two-way street. While these agreements do, of course, protect overseas investors in Australia, they also protect Australian investors overseas. Recently there have been two cases of Australian companies making use of ISDS clauses. In November 2011, a tribunal awarded White Industries Australia Limited, which is an Australian mining company, compensation from the Indian government for violating the India-Australia agreements. There was another case in 2011 where an Australian copper company, Tethyan Copper Company, formally commenced ISDS provisions against the government of Pakistan. In December 2012 Planet Mining, another Australian company, requested that the government of Indonesia consider a claim under a clause in that international agreement. So it is important that our investors and our companies have the protection of these agreements.


I think that property rights should be something that we try to uphold and protect. I am not necessarily surprised that the Greens do not put as high a price on the protection of property rights as other members in this chamber, but we do have international agreements that cover human rights, providing protection against torture and covering other internationally recognised rights issues. Property rights are extremely important as well, and the protection of property rights goes back right to the start of the Enlightenment and the Declaration of Independence in the United States. It is enshrined in our Constitution as well: the government must give just compensation where it acquires property. But we should make sure it is enshrined in these agreements as well, because sometimes courts can look more fondly on domestic investors than they do on foreign investors. We should seek that the same kinds of protections that we think are right and proper in our Constitution and that exist in other constitutions, such as the American government's, be similarly recognised in this agreement.


One reason I think the Greens are promoting something like this is that they do not really believe in that. They do not really believe that property rights should always and everywhere be protected, that property rights are on a par with other types of rights and that governments should not be given licence to simply take property from people without due compensation.


There is a particular issue in Queensland that has been longstanding Greens policy, and it will be detrimental to regional areas and the farming community. If the new Labor government in Queensland seeks to reintroduce tree-clearing laws into that state—as they have promised to do—I bet you they will not offer a cent of compensation to farmers. Farmers previously had the right to clear property on their land to develop it, to make it have value, and that value was embodied in the price they paid for the property. The price they paid for a property included a right to clear the trees on their land, to develop the land, to put irrigation in, to put better pastures in, to put more head of cattle on it and to make more money. 


That was changed almost 15 years ago in Queensland by the former Labor government. It introduced these laws that stripped all of those rights away from farmers. Perhaps some greater protection did need to be put in place, but compensation should have been given. Compensation should be given, in this place, with the powers that we have, because sometimes these debates are presented as though governments are weak, timid and vulnerable institutions that are beholden to corporations, when that is not the truth. We are very powerful. When we use those powers to take things from people, particularly from small businesses and farmers, we should have the guts to stump up with the cash to compensate for that taking of rights.


If we in this chamber had tried to pass the kinds of laws that Queensland had, there possibly would have been a claim under section 51 of the Constitution for farmers. But the Queensland government is not bound by those provisions in our Constitution, unfortunately. In the United States they are. It is the fifth amendment, I think, where due process must be followed for the taking of property. That does bind American state governments, but it does not here in this country, unfortunately. These provisions are something that go to the heart of what we on this side of the chamber believe. Property rights should be protected; we as governments should not abuse our powers by taking from those who are weaker and more vulnerable than us. 


As I said to an interjection earlier, we on this side of the chamber do not insist that all trade agreements have an ISDS clause. As was noted by Senator Whish-Wilson, in the US free trade agreement we did not put that in place. In the Korean free trade agreement we put many more additional protections than have previously existed in ISDS clauses, to ensure that governments do have the power to regulate for the general public good and for order. 


There is some limitation or shortcoming in the way this bill has been drafted. As it has been drafted, it will stop us from entering into all agreements that have an ISDS clause, even if that agreement exempted us from those clauses. There could clearly be a case—even in the TPP—where we would be exempted from some obligations. That would fall foul of this particular bill, if it were passed. So I do not think it is drafted in a way that we should pass it in this chamber. It would unreasonably restrict the role of the executive government in negotiating and signing agreements that promote trade for Australians and protect their investment rights.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-02-12,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:08):  I rise today to say that this Australian parliament should ban investor-state dispute resolution clauses in any agreement that Australia signs. It is as pure and simple as that. 


I find it extraordinary that a government that has made an art form out of talking about Operation Sovereign Borders—suggesting to the Australian community that it is somehow protecting Australia's sovereignty from refugees—would, in fact, be prepared to negotiate away our own national sovereignty. This is the agenda to say that democratically elected parliaments are subject to the demands of corporations; not only multinational corporations but also corporations based in any of the member states of any agreement which is signed. In the case of the Trans-Pacific Partnership that is Australia, the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam.


The big point here is this: we have a parliament to make the laws that govern this country in the public interest. That is fundamentally what parliament is about. That is why we are elected to this place. And what is going on at the moment is a negotiation—in secret—of a text of a trade agreement that the Australian community cannot see. We have a government saying: 'Oh, this is normal. We do not share this with people. And actually, the parliament will get to look at it'—yes; after it has been signed off by cabinet, and the parliament then only has the right to either reject the entire treaty or not. The fact of the matter is, this government—Prime Minister Abbott, and the minister, Mr Robb—are negotiating away Australia's sovereignty, and placing it in the hands—particularly in this case—of corporations based in the United States. The shocking thing here is that the United States congress has access to the text. But we do not—we in this parliament do not. But if you are a member of congress in the United States, you can get access to the text—yes, you might have to sign a confidentiality agreement, but you get to see what it is that the American government is signing up to. But we do not. We have no idea. Nobody in Australia— nobody on the street, none of the stakeholders, none of us—knows exactly what is being signed up to. Secrecy, and a lack of transparency really matter in cases like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and in investor-state dispute resolution.


Why am I saying that it is an assault on Australia's sovereignty, and an assault on decisions of the parliament and the judiciary? It is not just parliamentarians like the Greens who are objecting to this; the judiciary is worried as well—because the chilling effect of this is that corporations can sue a government if a government moves to take legislative action which undermines their profits. The classic case that Australians may be familiar with is the Phillip Morris case with the cigarette companies. It is already happening. Phillip Morris is suing Australia under an ISDS provision in a Hong Kong-Australia investment agreement. They have also sued Uruguay for increasing the size of health warnings on cigarette packets. A legal adviser to Uruguay said:


They are bullying us because we are small. This is like David and Goliath. But we will fight because it is our right and duty as a government to protect our citizens' health.


The New Zealand health minister has delayed the introduction of plain packaging in New Zealand because of the fear of being targeted with similar litigation. This is what is known as 'regulatory chill', where governments are afraid to legislate because it may lead to them being sued by a corporation. There are plenty of examples you can think of in Australia where that might happen. You might have it with companies who are wanting to engage in fracking, for example. If Australia brings in a ban, you can see where the companies—if they had already started their operations—would be suing the government—that is, suing the government for bringing in a regulation that protects public health. It is the same in terms of GMOs. We know Monsanto would love to be able to sue Australia because Tasmania has a GMO moratorium. We make sure we do not have GMOs in Tasmania. It is part of our commitment to the environment, but it is also part of our commitment to the clean, green and clever brand of Tasmania. Monsanto would love to sue on that occasion, and it has happened in other jurisdictions.


In the wake of the Fukushima disaster there was a groundswell of opposition to nuclear power in Germany. The government responded to this powerful movement by announcing a shutdown of the nuclear power industry. Soon after, Vattenfall—a Swedish utility that operates two nuclear plants in Germany—demanded compensation of 3.7 billion euros under the ISDS clause of a treaty on energy investments. In responding to the will of the people after what they saw after Fukushima, the government tried to act in the best interests of the health of the German people. And in came the corporation to say, 'You are undermining our profits out of nuclear power and therefore we want compensation.' 


Oil and gas giant Lone Pine is suing the Canadian government for $250 million over Quebec's moratorium on fracking. That is enabled by the ISDS clauses in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Lone Pine alleges that the fracking moratorium reduces 'the expectation of a stable business and political environment'. Never mind the instability that will arise from fracking, including water insecurity, loss of farmland and—ultimately—global warming.


We are also seeing the NGOs coming out. The Sierra Club, in relation to this issue with Canada and Lone Pine, has said: 


If a government is not even allowed to take a time out to study the impact—


of fracking—


without having to compensate a corporation, it puts a tremendous chill on a governments' ability to regulate in the public interest,


You also have a situation with Australian company OceanaGold in El Salvador. The Australian mining company is currently suing El Salvador for $301 million—the equivalent of half the education budget of a poor country, like El Salvador—because it refused to issue them with a gold-mining licence. 


The situation goes back to 2004 when the company applied for a mining permit and assured the government that its work would be environmentally friendly and would provide jobs for local people. In the interim, the damages of mining proliferated in El Salvador. Ninety per cent of the country's surface water became contaminated. There was acid mine drainage, which has killed aquatic life and destroyed water quality in the region, and high rates of disease linked to arsenic poisoning. Currently, just two per cent of El Salvador's water is determined by the government to be of good quality. The El Salvador government said:


… the original application to mine did not meet environmental safety standards and that the proposed mine poses risks to the country's already limited water supplies. OceanaGold denies the risks, even though—


everybody knows—


gold mining is notorious for polluting waterways with arsenic mercury and other toxic metals.


As a result, the government failed to approve the proposal and instituted a moratorium on mining permits, as you would expect they would do in the public interest. 


We are now seeing, under the ISDS clauses of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the company go after the El Salvador government. If the company succeeds, this will significantly reduce the funds available for health care and education. Even if Pacific Rim's claims fail—as many expect—this lawsuit has cost El Salvador almost $13,000,000 to date, which amounts to nearly its entire environment and natural resources spending in 2013. 


That is going on already around the world and that is precisely what Australia is lining up for. I wonder how much it will cost the Australian government to defend the case against Philip Morris? It would be very interesting for the government to tell us how many precious taxpayer dollars have gone into taking it up to Philip Morris in the courts. Philip Morris is suing us for daring to legislate in the public interest about plain packaging. It would be good to hear from the government, in the course of this debate, the cost to the public purse.


I also want to point out that the Labor Party when it was in government wanted to sign up to the free trade agreement with Korea. But I am pleased to say, the minister of the day, Craig Emerson, came out and said:


We considered it long and hard, and we had to stare into the abyss of having to say, 'We can't conclude the agreement with Korea.' As a matter of principle and in keeping with the commitments that we made, we said to Korea, 'No, we cannot do it.'


He went on to say that they opposed it in the Korea FTA because: 


… if we had agreed with it with Korea, it would be inevitable that we would have to agree with it within the Trans Pacific Partnership and other trade agreements. It was obvious to us, if we'd said yes to Korea, how do you say no to the United States?


The Labor government knew at the time that if they signed up to the trade deal with Korea with the ISDS in place it would be rolled over into the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and that is precisely what is happening. It is disgraceful that now that Labor is in opposition they go along with the government's signing up to the free trade agreement with Korea with that investor-state dispute resolution clause in place.


That means Labor and the government in Australia are selling out Australia's sovereignty. They are doing it in secret; there is no text for anyone to see. What is even worse than the U.S. Congress having access to the text while we do not, is that they are asking us to sign off on the text here in Australia. They are asking us to sign it off in this parliament before it is concluded in the US; and the US reserves the right to change it if it does not suit US companies, the US Congress or their consultation process. So, if ever Australia were selling out our sovereignty to US and to corporations, it is under this agreement.


This is the agenda of the corporate world. This is the agenda about getting rid of regulation on a global scale to maximise their absolute destruction of the planet at the lowest possible price and at the expense of local people, jobs, wages, conditions—the whole lot. That is exactly what you are going to see in investor-state dispute resolution and it is why the Europeans are backing off this at a great rate. The European parliament has had a letter from 100 legal and other experts in the field saying, 'Back off this in Europe. It is a bad idea.' They have had to put it on hold and they have had to start looking at what it actually means in the European context to sign up to agreements with investor-state dispute resolution clauses in them.


But think about it: if you have a multinational corporation that is threatening a country, why would a parliament then move to legislate for a ban on fracking or to stop environmental destruction if they knew they were going to incur the wrath of the corporation suing them and the legal costs associated with defending it? The whole point of a parliament and sovereignty is for the parliament to be able to be the ultimate decision makers and for the courts to be the ultimate decision makers in terms of the legal framework, the laws of the country and how the laws of the country are implemented. Once you devolve that decision making power to corporations you might as well give up as a parliament and as a government—and that is precisely what the Abbott government is doing.


The Labor Party knows it. They had this experience with the Korean free trade deal and that is why, to their credit, they did not sign up. They knew what investor-state dispute resolution meant. Tragically, they have now gone onto the same bandwagon as the government. But the people of Australia do not like it. The people of Australia do not like the idea that once again we have a Liberal government that pretends to protect the sovereignty of Australia selling out to the United States and, in particular, selling out to multinational corporations because that is the consequence of what is going on. I have cited the examples—the Philip Morris case, the Canadian case of Lone Pine, the German antinuclear case and the El Salvadorian case of environmental regulation. The trouble with some senators on the other side is that they prefer ignorance and ideology to get in the way of evidence. The evidence I have presented stands alone.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Talk about ignorance and ideology!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT
:  Senator Macdonald, in four minutes and six seconds you will get your turn. Please allow Senator Milne to speak.




Senator MILNE:
  I can tell you that the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Justice Robert French, has raised his concerns that ISDS is effectively establishing a parallel legal system where Australian judges have no voice. Senator Macdonald thinks, obviously, that he knows better than the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Justice Robert French. But I think, Mr Acting Deputy President, that when you have the Chief Justice saying that what you are doing is selling out the sovereignty of the Australian parliament and the Australian legal system, you should start thinking about that. When the Chief Justice is saying that the ISDS is setting up a parallel legal system where Australian judges have no voice, that should be of major concern to Australians. People are already worried that this government is governing for the big end of town. We are seeing it—absolutely—when it comes to their refusal to crack down on tax avoidance; in the huff and puff of the Treasurer before the G20—all about tax avoidance—until we had to ask for a delay in Australia actually engaging in the exchange of information around the world that would lead to a crackdown of tax avoidance. We saw it in MYEFO before Christmas: the tax avoidance measures that were in that document were removed. We are seeing it left, right and centre.


The two greatest threats to humanity and to the planet are the growing inequality around the world in the accumulation of wealth, and global warming. Those two things together are driving massive social unrest and ecological destruction. And the people driving it are the corporate world—the one per cent who own the vast majority of the Earth's resources now, and their wealth, want to secure a regulatory environment which is lowest common denominator, and they want to use these investor-state dispute resolution clauses to do it. This is a dangerous assault on the integrity and capacity of the Australian parliament to govern in the best interests of the Australian people, for our wellbeing and our health. It is being done in secret, handing over to the United States the right to actually change the text—after the Australian parliament has signed off on it. And we will be subject to it after that. What sort of government acts as a doormat to that kind of agreement? I can tell you which sort of government: it is the Abbott government. It is the very people who pretend they are interested in Operation Sovereign Borders, while actually undermining the sovereignty of our nation in a very frightening way.


We only have to look at what is going on with the power of the corporates. We have to take our democracy back, and one way of taking our democracy back is banning investor-state dispute resolution clauses in any agreement that Australia signs. That is the way we take our democracy back, that is the way we restore the sovereignty of our parliament and our legal system, and that is the way we prevent the multinational corporations of the planet from overseeing the best interests of Australian and the environment. And if we do not, we are going to see billions of taxpayers' dollars over the years being set aside in legal cases. And the culprits responsible are sitting in this parliament, pretending to be a responsible government as we speak.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:28):  Anyone who is seriously following this debate, and who heard Senator Canavan a little while ago, would appreciate that nothing the Greens have said—nothing that Senator Milne or Senator Ludlam have said—stands up to a factual assessment. A lot of people who I know follow Senator Ludlam's technical savvy in these areas; you know, he gets on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, with all the buzzwords—




Senator Ludlam:
  I am on it now!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  He is on it right now! But can I just say to you people, please carefully look at anything Senator Ludlam or Senator Milne will tell you, because history shows most everything of what they say is not supported by fact; and it is, in fact, simply lies. It is easy to pick the buzzwords. It is easy to pick the prejudices—these big US corporate giants—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Ludlam on a point of order.




Senator Ludlam:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Macdonald, you have been here for decades, if not hundreds of years. You know very well that it is unparliamentary to accuse other senators in this place or the other of lying. So I ask you to withdraw that and then carry on with your strange rant.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will let that one go. It was part of a wide-ranging debate, but I would urge caution, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  'Strange rant'—that is okay. This is the thing with the Greens political party, hypocrisy knows no bounds. Here is a party talking about 'surrendering Australia's sovereignty'. Which party would have the one-world government, to have Australia sign up and be bound by every single international treaty brought on by anyone around the globe?


You only have to look at the facts of these issues to realise that most everything you hear from people like Senator Ludlam and Senator Milne simply are not supported by truth and accuracy. Sure, pick all the prejudices: fracking, big end of town, nuclear—and the US corporate predators. Never mind any other corporate predators. US corporate predators are the real ones.


Senator Cameron made a very measured address. He clearly indicated the facts. It is obvious that no-one from the Greens political party has read the agreements that have been entered into so far. Senator Canavan quite rightly assisted those Greens members who were interested in truth and accuracy—and I am not sure there are many—on what section 18(1) of the Korean free trade agreement said. He read it out. I could repeat it, but I will not take the time of the Senate.


Australian governments, not just this government but previous governments as well, have entered into a number of interstate dispute-settlement arrangements over a number of years. In free trade and bilateral agreements we already have interstate dispute-settlement provisions in Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements. These include countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Chile, 10 ASEAN countries and New Zealand. We also have agreements with Argentina, China and the Czech Republic. I have not got to the 'big predator' US government yet that the Greens like to talk about. I am sure that is here. 


We have entered into these sorts of agreements with all these countries: Argentina, China, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Laos, Lithuania, Mexico, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uruguay and Vietnam, just to name some of them.


I will try to put a little truth and accuracy into this debate. I will indicate to the Senate the types of obligations covered by ISDS. One of them is that foreigners and locals should be given a similar treatment. How bad is that? It applies to Australians. Do we have different rules for people from other countries? Talk about xenophobia in the Greens political party! It seems to know no bounds. These agreements say that foreigners from one country should be given similar treatment to foreigners from another country—so the Chinese and their trade agreements with Australia will be treated the same as the Americans; they will be treated the same as the Hungarians; they will be treated the same as the South Africans. What sort of a problem does anyone see in that? These agreements also limit the circumstances under which expropriation can take place, and they require provision of adequate compensation. Under the Australian Constitution, if the Australian government expropriates property for good reason, it is required to pay compensation. But the Greens do not think the same should apply to other countries who have property rights in Australia which are expropriated by the federal government. It is okay to pay Australians compensation, because the government is required to under our constitution, but forget the foreigners! We will just take their property and we will not allow for any compensation. These obligations also provide for non-discriminatory treatment and for compensation in the case of armed conflict or civil strife, in any country which Australia has these arrangements with.


While the Greens political party think that this is not appropriate, a company from one country that invests in a different country should be able to freely deal with profits they make as a result of their investment. Otherwise they would not be making the investment. Most countries around the world are seeking investment in their own countries—to help their countries—but are expecting that those who invest will make profits, and will be able to take those profits home as they intended. In fact, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee yesterday had a very interesting roundtable meeting with all of the ambassadors from the Arab countries in the world. It was a great get-together, talking about two-way trade between our countries. I asked all the ambassadors to quickly run through and indicate which of their commodities or services they would like to sell more of to Australia. Some of the ambassadors responded as you would expect—more clothing, more chemicals, more olive oil—but a lot of them said, 'we want Australia to invest in our countries, and to bring Australian expertise into our countries. We know that is good for Australia; they will make profits and help employ some Australians, but we also want that because it will help our countries to develop.' And yet the Greens, by not allowing these ISDS provisions, would seek to make it difficult for Australians to take action against these countries if these countries introduced laws that expropriated Australian investments in their country without compensation. That is what this is all about.


To anyone who is following this debate: do not take anything the Greens say as accurate, but please look into it and please look at history. You will find that almost everything the Greens political party will stir you up about turns out to be absolutely incorrect, but time does not permit me to go through all of those issues.


It is hypocrisy—sheer hypocrisy—for the Greens political party to say that we are surrendering Australia's sovereignty to international corporate giants, when everything the Greens do in this parliament is all about international treaties, and about how Australia should subject itself to the dictates of all of these international bodies; the United Nations and other bodies. They do not want Australia to have a view on uranium, or climate change. They do not want Australians who, by majority, have a different view to some of the members of the international community views on climate change. They want Australia just to accept, willy-nilly, the views of these international bodies without allowing the Australian people to have their say.


The Australian people clearly share my view on the irrational accusations of the Greens about climate change. We all accept the climate is changing. I often say that once upon a time the world was covered in ice and snow, and clearly over the aeons that has changed. Once upon a time the centre of Australia was a rainforest. Clearly that has changed. Clearly climate changes. But there is no accepted evidence at the moment that man's emissions of carbon have been responsible for it. There is no evidence that there has been global warming for 20 years. In fact, the actual scientific evidence suggests otherwise. But the Greens would have Australia's sovereignty—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  That is true. I am sorry. I can give you 50 scientists who say that.




Senator Siewert:
  What scientists?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  See, because they are not—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please address your comments through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you for that unbiased ruling, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am being attacked by members of the Greens political party. You do not pull them up.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, take your seat. Take your seat, Senator Macdonald. All I asked you was to address your comments through the chair, which you know is accepted protocol.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  If you look at the record, you will find that all of my comments are through the chair, and even my response to interjections was through the chair. Please, Mr Acting Deputy President, do your job.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, all I asked you was that you address your comments through the chair, which you know is accepted protocol. You were pointing and yelling at Senator Siewert. You can point and yell at me, but please address your comments through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I would never point or yell at the chair.




Senator Singh:
  I am on my feet, Mr Acting Deputy President.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Sorry, Senator Macdonald. Please take your seat. Senator Singh.




Senator Singh:
  I was on my feet before you.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I was on my feet.




Senator Singh:
  No, I was on my feet before you.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please take your seat. Senator Singh.




Senator Singh:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order, Senator Macdonald is reflecting on the chair, and I ask you to rule accordingly.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  As I was just saying, Senator Macdonald, please just address your comments through the chair. You understand the protocols. Let us continue the debate.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I do not need your protection against the interjections of the likes of Senator Siewert, but if you are making those rulings please be consistent. I will continue on the line that Senator Siewert does not like. Because they are not scientists that she and her group of funny people think are good scientists, they are all to be ignored. You only listen to those who repeat your mantra, Senator Siewert. There are credible scientists around the world—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You laugh, but then I laugh at your ridiculous comments, and so I accept that. But, Mr Acting Deputy President, perhaps you could help me—I address this through the chair—by stopping the consistent interjections I get from the Greens political party.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, I will ask Senator Siewert to cease the interjections and remind everyone in the chamber that interjections are disorderly.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order, I do accept your ruling; however, Senator Macdonald was speaking across the chamber directly to me, so I responded. I apologise to the chamber, but, if you could ask him therefore not to address his comments directly to me across the chamber, that means I will not interject and respond.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Siewert. I will remind Senator Macdonald: please address your comments through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The Australian government has done an absolutely fantastic job in relation to trade. It is a bit like debt, you know: people talk about trade, and they think, 'Trade's something governments do; it doesn't really impact upon us.' It is a bit like that with debt: 'Debt's just something the government will fix up; it doesn't really affect us.' Of course, what we really need is for Australians to understand that debt—and the $7 billion of debt that the Labor Party ran up—does in fact impact upon them very, very seriously. As with people's own household budget, when you borrow from a lender, some day you have to pay it back. And until you pay it back, you have to pay interest on it. But people say, 'That's the government.' Well, sorry, but the government does not have any money. The government only uses the money of taxpayers. So, it is the taxpayers who will have to pay off Labor's debt, which will approach $700 billion. And it is the taxpayers who will have to pay the $30 million a day that we are paying in interest on the Labor Party's debt—the Labor Party supported by the Greens political party. Imagine how many schools, imagine how many hospitals we could build every day with the amount we are now paying to foreign lenders on the debt run up by the Labor-Greens government.


And it is the same with trade. People think, 'Oh, trade—that's something governments do; that's good, but it doesn't really impact upon us.' Sorry: trade is very important to Australia. We are a country that is blessed with natural resources. We are blessed with fine educational institutions. We are blessed with a very energetic and innovative population. But we need to trade to be able to use those assets we have, and that means more jobs for Australians. And these free trade agreements that Andrew Robb has brilliantly concluded, in a very short period of time, mean jobs and wealth for all Australians.


I know Senator Milne is talking about how the corporate giants are ripping off all the poor people in the world. I would just remind Senator Milne that she is part of the one per cent of the world population earning a very, very high income. Yet that never seems to worry Senator Milne. It is okay for her to blame the US corporate giants and the wealthy people everywhere around the world, but I would just remind people that Senator Milne is one of those who is in the one per cent of highest-income earners in the world. And we never seem to get that recognition when we hear Senator Milne viciously attacking corporate investors into our country and indeed other countries.


Trade is important. The free trade agreements have considerably assisted Australians in their lifestyle, in their way of living and, more importantly, in their ability to be fully employed. Those free trade agreements and other trade agreements we have made with people in many instances do have these investor-state dispute settlement arrangements. They have been in place for ages. The Labor Party has entered into agreements where those conditions do apply. They apply for a reason, and that is that they are fair and they treat people equally. It does mean to say that if Australian companies invest somewhere else then those other countries will not confiscate Australian assets without the sort of compensation they would apply to their own nationals.


The Greens political party would have you believe that this means that corporations from around the world—not just America, although they are the only ones you hear about from the Greens—can dictate to Australia how Australia should legislate internally. The agreements we enter into do actually provide that matters relating to health and the environment—and Senator Canavan went into this in some detail—are not impacted by these investor-state dispute settlement arrangements. So, Australia is free to provide whatever it believes is the right legislation in relation to many issues that are clearly set out in these agreements. What they do say, though, is that if the Australian government, for all the right reasons, does confiscate property then the people whose property is confiscated, no matter which country they come from, will be treated the same way as Australian companies and Australian individuals. That is, if, for the right reasons, the government of the day confiscates property, people will be properly compensated for that confiscation. Now, what is wrong with that? I ask the Greens political party: what is wrong with that? Countries that invest in Australia and whose property is confiscated would be treated the same as Australians.


Unfortunately time has escaped me. I was going to raise the stupidity of the ban by the Labor Party and the Greens political on live cattle exports to Indonesia. That is a very good case in point, and, unfortunately, as I said, time is not going to allow me to elaborate on that. But Indonesian companies who had invested in Australia on the basis of a trade arrangement in live cattle that had been in place for decades and whose property was made worthless by a stupid decision of an Australian government should have been in some way compensated for that. But unfortunately time is not going to allow me to continue in that vein—perhaps some other time—but I would urge the Senate to reject this bill. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-12,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:51):  I rise to speak in support of this Greens legislation: the Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill 2014. The purpose of this bill is to prevent the Commonwealth from entering into an agreement with one or more foreign countries that includes particular mechanisms called investor-state dispute settlement clauses, or ISDS clauses. The inclusion of these mechanisms is one of the most insidious trends that we are seeing in modern trade deals.


I applaud Senator Whish-Wilson's great work in bringing this bill forward and encouraging debate on what has the potential not only to shape the kind of world that we bequeath to our kids and our grandkids into the future but to fundamentally undermine the rule of law and democracy itself. They are high claims to make. I am sorry that Senator Macdonald is leaving the chamber, because he invited me to answer some questions that he posed, and he obviously is not particularly interested in hearing those answers. At one point, he scoffed at the idea that Chief Justice Robert French of the High Court of Australia commented with great interest on the issues that are posed by these ISDS clauses and free trade agreements. Indeed, Chief Justice French and many others have raised significant concerns, and I will come to those in the course of my contribution today.


But let's start by asking why these ISDS clauses are so troubling. It is because these are mechanisms by which private investors—corporations who are based outside a sovereign nation with no loyalty to, interest in or concern for the citizens of that nation—can take their own action against the sovereign government of the nation and use the clauses to sue governments for huge amounts of compensation if they can show that a government policy or a change in policy has directly affected their profitability or their investment. In so doing, they can exert a huge influence and control on the laws and policies of nations irrespective of the will of the democratically elected parliaments in those nations. 


This Greens bill is designed to prevent the Australian government from entering into agreements that include these ISDS clauses, to prevent corporations outside Australia from being able to dictate to Australian governments, effectively, the kinds of laws they can and cannot make and—by extension, given that the laws and policies and governments shape the world that we live in—the kind of Australian society that we have. It is interesting, and Senator Milne made this point as well, that we hear a lot about border protection from this government but when it comes to protecting our legal borders—our legal sovereignty: the right of democratically elected governments in Australia to make laws on behalf of all of us and have those upheld by our courts—this government is a bit silent. In fact, they are highly secretive. Right now we have 12 governments, including those of Australia, the US, Japan, Canada and New Zealand, negotiating this far-reaching trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Aspects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, the TPPA, pushed by global corporate interests are seeking to radically dispose of government regulation in the name of enhanced global competition.


We have been invited by Senator Canavan to give evidence of our concerns, but the problem is that these negotiations are conducted totally in secret. So my invitation to Senator Canavan would be that if we have nothing to fear—if, in fact, these concerns that are being raised not only by the Australian Greens but throughout Australian society and internationally are not founded—then reassure us: show us the terms of the negotiations that are happening and we can all go home. In fact, this is a situation where these negotiations are in secret and, for the first time ever in trade deals, they will include discussions to get broad agreement to remove what are called unfair advantages from government state-owned enterprises and their impacts on commercial business.


One hallmark of the way these deals are negotiated is that the Australian public has no right to know what is being negotiated away in our name until the deal is done and dusted, and then it is presented to the sovereign Parliament of Australia with the only option being to vote in favour or against; there is no possibility of changing it; the deal has already been done. We see in the current negotiations for the TPPA, on the back of global corporate interests and pressure, the US government wanting to include a proposal which would allow foreign companies to sue our government and the governments under the agreement for damages if they were to adopt laws or policies that could harm the investment of these global interests. So even if they are laws and policies made in good faith on behalf of the national public interest—laws which may protect public health or the environment—there would be the capacity for outside corporations to challenge those laws and seek large amounts of compensation. That has a chilling effect on the capacity and the willingness of sovereign governments to actually govern in good faith in the interests of the national public. As my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson has already said clearly, what we have set up in these kinds of modern trade deals is a parallel system of governance which gives corporations the right and ability to impinge directly upon our ability as parliamentarians to enact legislation in the public interest—and, in the end, isn't that what we are elected to do?


These ISDS clauses have excited huge concern both nationally and internationally. Indeed, the issue has received serious consideration from many, including High Court Chief Justice Robert French, who is the most eminent judge in Australia. Chief Justice French addressed the Supreme and Federal Courts Judges' Conference in Darwin last year. He provided a very thoughtful paper, and I commend it to those who are interested in learning more about the nature and implications of these ISDS clauses. Senator Macdonald expressed disbelief that Chief Justice French may have been commenting on these issues, so I will pay him the courtesy of forwarding a copy of the paper to him, and I hope that Senator Macdonald will read that.


Chief Justice French focuses on the tensions that can exist between these ISDS mechanisms and the legitimate functions of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of governments. With respect, who would be in a better position to consider these issues in a scholarly way? He sets out the current landscape and, importantly, the implications for the rule of law in Australia. Where there is dispute about the effect of government policy or lawmaking on corporate interests under these agreements, there is a mechanism for that dispute to then go to a system of arbitration, and there have been a great number of concerns about the conduct of the arbitration bodies as they have operated previously when considering disputes under these clauses. So, effectively, if there is government policy or lawmaking and even, indeed, decisions of courts within a sovereign jurisdiction, if a third party outside that sovereign nation wants to dispute the decision, law or policy, they can then take these to an arbitration body.


Chief Justice French in his paper refers to a briefing paper prepared by the European Parliamentary Research Service in January 2014 which describes the concerns raised about the vague formulation of major treaty provisions which leave a wide range of interpretations open to the arbitrators. There is a vagueness and uncertainty in scope and application, which is always a problem in relation to the law. There are also loopholes in these agreements, which can lead to abuses such as nationality shopping by companies, which then create subsidiaries abroad specifically to take advantage of the agreements. Indeed, that is what we have seen in the Philip Morris tobacco case that has been referred to by many of the people making a contribution to this debate.


As for the conduct of the arbitration panels themselves, particular and worrying concerns have been raised. As Chief Justice French states in his paper, 


Arbitral tribunals set up under ISDS provisions are not courts. Nor are they required to act like courts. Yet their decisions may include awards which significantly impact on national economies and on regulatory systems within nation states. Questions have been raised about the consistency2, openness and impartiality of decisions made in ISDS arbitrations.


The briefing paper from the EPRS sets out some specific issues that have been raised:


lack of transparency with varying degrees of secrecy attaching to arbitral processes depending upon the institutions or rules which are applied;


a relatively small pool of arbitrators — arbitrators appointed to ISDS arbitrations are said to be mostly male—


and I guess there are no surprises there—


(95%) and from Europe and North America;


role-swapping by arbitrators who appear from time to time as counsel in ISDS cases;


so sometimes they are on one side of the bench and sometimes they are on the other—


the high cost of ISDS arbitrations — estimated by OECD as averaging about $8 million each;


associated with the high cost and potentially high awards, a growing phenomenon of third party funding of claims by banks, hedge funds and insurance companies in exchange for a share of the proceeds ranging from 20% to 50%;


So there is a little bit of a variation on the no win, no fee or, 'We'll fund it and we'll get a cut of the win,' which is always a real concern in terms of corrupting processes. There is also:


absence of effective review or appeal processes;4


inconsistency in decisions on similar provisions.


It is important to understand that this is not just a vague, theoretical concern that we are dealing with here. This is a live issue. There have already been many cases on foot. Last year the UN Conference on Trade and Development published its annual review of ISDS cases. Fifty-even new cases—these are cases brought by outside parties, by corporations, against governments—were commenced in 2013. That was just below the number in 2012, which was a record year with 62 cases. Most of the claims were brought against nation-states by investors from developed countries—again, no surprises there—and mainly by investors from the European Union and the United States.


And what sort of cases were being brought by these corporate interests? They involved challenges to a range of governmental measures, including measures relating to renewable energy. Why doesn't that surprise me? And who would be bringing those kinds of cases? There were measures allegedly affecting expropriation of assets, revocation of licences and permits, regulation of energy tariffs—energy into the future and the profits that are to be made there is a big one, isn't it—wrongful criminal prosecutions, land zoning decisions, invalidation of patents and sovereign bonds legislations.


As I said, many would be aware of the Philip Morris case where the Australian High Court upheld the validity of legislation made by the Australian parliament to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products. The challenge was brought by a company supported by Philip Morris Ltd to the Australian High Court, but the legislation was upheld. Four months before commencing the action in the High Court, Philip Morris Asia Ltd moved to acquire an interest in Philip Morris Australia so that it then had an interest in this subsidiary. I quote from the Chief Justice French's paper:


That acquisition is said to have reflected a tactic used by private investors seeking to take advantage of bilateral investment treaties and is known as either 'nationality planning' or 'treaty shopping'. It appears to have been related to the existence of a bilateral investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia.


That was a treaty from 1993 which included an ISDS clause. On the basis of that clause Philip Morris is challenging the Australian government for compensation on the basis of the plain packaging laws. We will be interested in seeing what occurs there.


The Australian Greens are significantly concerned that these sorts of clauses and the actions they allow corporations to take against the Australian government and state governments have the potential to shape the kind of world we are going to be leaving to our kids and grandkids. To bring that home and illustrate why I am concerned I am going to tell you about a visit I had last Sunday when I travelled to an area near Mount Gambier in the south-east of South Australia. I attended a celebration there which was a declaration by a small land area near the little town of Mil-Lel. There was a declaration by the residents of that area of their roads and their region being gas field free. Currently there are two exploratory drilling wells from Beach Energy in that area looking for the viability of shale and conventional gas mining, and there is increasing concern among the residents in that area about the risks associated with unconventional gas mining and fracking. There are real issues in that area, which is a rich area of agriculture, wine-growing, cropping and tourism. Also there is a very limited water supply in that area. There is a great deal of concern by the residents that unconventional gas mining will actually destroy the viability of the population, not just the economic viability, but in fact their ability to live there in a healthy way.


I went there and I was absolutely delighted to see proud citizens walking up and handing to the mayor of the District Council of Grant their scrolls—street by street, road by road—and saying, 'We do not accept that there will be unconventional gas mining in our area. We are saying that we are putting faith in the water and food supplies that we need to protect our kids and our grandkids.' When I saw that I felt that there was a strong vote of confidence in what is a real democracy, which is requiring decision-makers to make decisions that are in the interests of all people, not just in the interests of those who have power and influence and who are only interested in making short-term profits.


It is very clear that the ISDS clauses in these free trade agreements, and which will potentially be in the Pacific trade agreement, have the potential to stop our governments from legislating democratically in response to community concerns about environmental issues like mining for conventional gas. There are clear precedents for this kind of action by foreign corporations against governments when they are making law and policy that affects, for instance, energy—and that is what we are talking about here. We are talking about moving away from reliance on fossil fuels to having other sources of clean green energy like renewable energy, like solar and wind and so on.


There is an example in Quebec at the moment where, under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, there was an ISDS clause. On the basis of that clause Lone Pine Resources, an energy company, is currently suing the government of Quebec for $250 million because it had the temerity to suspend shale gas mining while awaiting the outcome of an environmental study into the dangers of that mining. The suspension was brought about because of pressure from the community to examine the health and environmental impacts of that mining. The government response to the community pressure was democracy in action, and we have a large corporation currently suing the Quebec government to chill that decision in the sum of $250 million.


So in the south-east we have, at the moment, an inquiry from the South Australian state parliament into fracking in that area which was initiated by my Greens colleague, the leader of the Australian Greens in the South Australian parliament Mark Parnell MLC. What happens if there is a decision by the state government in responding to the findings of that inquiry, hypothetically speaking, that they were to decide that there should be a moratorium on fracking in the south-east? If we are subject to these sort of ISDS clauses in agreements, which the Australian government has entered into, there is every possibility that an organisation could then take action against the state government for compensation to prevent that sort of decision being made.


We are at a point in history where it is absolutely vital that people's perception that governments are only governing for the rich, the influential and the powerful is changed. There is increasing disillusionment, and I know that everybody in this chamber will be aware of it. When you go and talk to voters, people do not have faith that we are actually fulfilling the trust for which we have been elected, and that is to govern in the interests of all. This is a point in history where we must defend our democracy, and that has to start from the grassroots up. It has to start with respect for the people and for the national interest. Australian governments voluntarily surrendering sovereignty over the policy and the law that we make in this parliament is not only foolish and irresponsible but highly dangerous for the future health and welfare of this nation. But, fundamentally, I believe it is highly dangerous to this nation in being able to remain a viable democracy where our populace has faith in the decisions that we are making. If we lose that I do not know what we will have left. I urge the Senate to support the bill. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:11):  I rise to explain to the chamber and to the wider community why I oppose the Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill of 2014. I read from the explanatory memorandum as supplied by our colleague Senator Whish-Wilson:


The purpose of this Bill is to prevent the Commonwealth from entering into an agreement with one or one more foreign countries that includes investor-state dispute settlement provisions.


Now, I have to say at the outset that I have a lot of respect for Senator Whish-Wilson. He was well educated at Guildford Grammar School, as I understand, in Western Australia. He studied at university in Western Australia, and he has a good, sound understanding of economics and commerce. He has worked in the stock exchanges, as I understand, in Western Australia, in Hong Kong, in New York and in Sydney. So, Senator Whish-Wilson has a very, very good understanding of the world of commerce and particularly the world of international trade.


Senator Whish-Wilson also understands that, in a country that has the land mass of continental USA and the population of New York City, the high level of per capita income, wealth and socioeconomics in this country, indeed, is due to our exporting capacity. We are not like America; we cannot consume the majority of what we produce. We are not like China, which, of course, also can consume. We must rely on exports, we must rely on the inflow of capital, we must rely on the rule of law, and we must, of course, rely on being important players on the world stage. I say again, that section 3 of the explanatory memorandum sets out that the intention of the bill is to prevent the Commonwealth from entering into agreements with foreign countries that include investor-state dispute settlement clauses. How harsh would this be for our little country of 23 million people if we were denied access to the export markets of the world upon which we have relied for so long, which we will need to rely on in the future to sustain the economic wealth and wellbeing of all of our citizens and, indeed, to improve the wellbeing and the socioeconomic conditions of those in our neighbouring and trading regions—Asia, Africa, India and, of course, Central America and Latin American?


It is interesting that in his second reading speech Senator Whish-Wilson draws attention to the fact that the Australian government is currently being sued under the ISDS clauses as a result of a legislative decision the previous government took to require cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging. That is a 1993 agreement; it is 22 years old. Surely everybody in this place realises that we have moved on from the quality of legislation that is 22 years old. I also remind the chamber that this is not yet a settled matter. It is not yet a matter that has had any sort of resolution or judgment. I share concerns. We sat in the committee together. I share the concerns of academics and others. I also share the concerns expressed by the Chief Justice, a fine Western Australian jurist, Robert French. But, at the same time, the role of government is to balance these inputs and to arrive at decisions that are in the best interests of our country, and I want to spell some of those out.


I want to point out, if I may in the time that is available to me, where some of the pitfalls would come if, indeed, we were to pass legislation that prevents the Commonwealth—it does not caution the Commonwealth or give the Commonwealth any leeway in this; it prevents the Commonwealth—entering into an agreement with ISDS provisions. Of course, this blanket prohibition would completely and utterly limit our opportunity to negotiate into the future with foreign countries, be it for inputs or for exports. We could not conclude negotiations which would benefit Australian producers, consumers and investors, the broader community or, indeed, those communities in the countries with which we have such valuable trading relations, and it would impose on the Commonwealth a significant limitation on the ability to pursue our broader trade and investment objectives.


We have spent a lot of time in the last few days, as we have in the last couple of years, in this place debating how we are going to sustain and improve the socioeconomic wellbeing of our country—how we are going to be able to meet the social demands that are so eloquently debated in this place. But, Mr Acting Deputy President, you know that, as Senator Fifield said so well the other day, if the economic agenda and the social agenda are not in alignment, it will be to the demise of each of them. Unfortunately, what this bill, if passed, would do would be to totally limit the opportunity for our economic expansion, particularly at this time.


I feel remiss with the finance minister, Senator Cormann, here, because he is so much better versed than I am in being able to comment on the black clouds that are confronting the world at the moment as we look at what might happen with Greece defaulting or, indeed, jumping into bed with Russia—whose economic circumstances at the moment would be such that you would wonder how Russia would be able to bail Greece out of its current debt crisis. We look at other countries in Europe and the circumstances they are faced with. We have a look at the United States of America, the interest on whose debt—not the debt but the interest on their debt—is a billion dollars per working day at the moment—$250 billion they are borrowing. Senator Whish-Wilson understands this much better than I and as well as the finance minister does. To me, it all points to the fact that we must remember that we are an exporting country.


But, of course, this blanket prohibition that is proposed in the bill is inconsistent with the government's policy, which is to consider the inclusion of ISDS provisions in any free trade or other agreements on a case-by-case basis. It denies the government the opportunity to actually negotiate case by case. It says: 'No, sorry. We can't deal with China. We can't deal with Japan. We can't deal with Korea. We couldn't have dealt with Singapore. We're not allowed to deal with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because we are prevented from even participating.' Nobody in Australia wants to see that—indeed, I do not think Senator Whish-Wilson does. What we do want to see is a very cultured discussion about those elements which are sacrosanct to Australia.


I go back to the point that the 1993 provision is 22 years old. This was not being considered 22 years ago. Possibly it could have been predicted 22 years ago, but nobody is suggesting today that the sorts of agreements that we are negotiating and contemplating have not moved on and are not taking into account those environmental, health and other concerns on which we are, of course, so focused.


The bill proceeds from the view that ISDS invariably represents an unacceptable risk to the public interest and that all provisions are equally severe. We are conscious of potential risks, and I would rely on the excellence of the trade minister—leading and directing the bureaucrats in the department, who are now so well versed in the processes of international trade negotiations—and on being able to govern and to regulate in the public interest in areas such as health and the environment.


On this topic, I would be amazed if in his previous work Senator Whish-Wilson has not come across similar clients. As a businessman myself, and having in the last decade engaged in business activities in Asia, in the Middle East and on the Indian subcontinent, I know that ISDS does not just apply to ogres wanting to come into Australia. ISDS gives a level of protection to Australian industry operating overseas. This is vitally important, because we have the opportunity and indeed, in my view—particularly in the field of agribusiness, in which I spend a lot of my professional time—the compulsion to increase our business activities overseas. I for one would be saying that, in any sorts of agreements that Australia is negotiating, I would want to see our government and our trade negotiators making sure that the interests of Australian business are being protected. Indeed, if we were to prevent the Commonwealth from entering into agreements, we would be cutting off the opportunity for Australian businesses operating overseas to enjoy the protection of ISDS clauses. It is a two-way exercise; it is not just a one-way exercise.


The bill in its current form fails to recognise that agreements containing ISDS can incorporate safeguards to protect the rights of governments and the communities they represent to take decisions in the public interest. The bill suggests that this is not possible; I say that it is. In fact the recent agreement negotiated, again, by trade minister Robb leading the delegation of people who undertook it with the Republic of Korea, contained many more safeguards indeed than earlier agreements. This is how policy works. This is how democracy works. This is how government works. We should always be moving to improve what has gone before us. In the case of Korea these safeguards have been developed in response to concerns about challenges to legitimate public welfare regulation. I, for one, enjoyed the opportunity to participate in the committee and to hear the legitimate concerns of people who not only have the expertise but defend the time. Two instances in the case of Korea where we were not freezing existing policy settings were to do with intellectual property and the environment chapter; exactly the concern that Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Wright have expressed saw itself played out. Indeed, we have ISDS clauses in four existing free trade agreements and 21 bilateral investment treaties—binding obligations that have been ongoing over 25 years—and I remind those listening that we have only ever faced one claim; we are facing that now and that has not yet been tested or resolved. Not bad for a country of 23 million people that exports more than 65 per cent of its produce around the world.


Who, in fact, are the players? Of the bilateral investment treaties that we are considering, more than 90 per cent of the 2,500 in force have operated without a single investor claim. We know that the inflow of capital is vital to this country, and of course the inflow of capital reflects the claims—for Europe, it is about 50 per cent and about 47 per cent of the claims. For the United States, the next biggest player in this game from Australia's point of view, it is 24 per cent of FDI stock outflow from them and 22 per cent of the claims. It is in the resources sector—mining, oil and gas resources—where most of the claims have been made, because they are the sectors in which there is the greatest degree of state involvement, and I hope to come to Mexico in a few moments by way of illustration. The disputes have been mainly around countries with weak legal institutions—Argentina with 53 claims and Venezuela with 36 claims are the two leading respondent states. About a third of all ISDS cases are settled in advance of a ruling, and it is the case that people come to realise it is as expensive to run an ISDS claim as it is to go through the commercial legal process. We see that treaty-based investment protection represents a major advance in the fair treatment of aliens and the peaceful resolution of disputes. When you consider the alternative—withdrawal from these treaties, which is the logical conclusion should the good senator's bill be accepted—then the negative consequences for economic growth in this country and the rule of law are there for all to see.


I want to continue now in terms of what those opportunities are. We are an economy of some $1.6 trillion. The services sector contributes about 70 per cent—about $1.12 trillion—of that economic activity, but at the moment the services sector only contributes 17 per cent—$57 billion of $330 billion—towards export income. Therein lies the opportunity for this country to radically increase the contribution of the services sector to export earnings as resources earnings go down because of the decline in oil and gas prices and of course the price of iron ore and other resources. You turn and say, 'That is all well and good, Senator Back. Where are these opportunities for increasing the services sector from 17 per cent?' Imagine, Finance Minister, if the services sector expanded its export activity from 17 to 34 per cent. Do you know where the answer lies? It lies in those countries with which we have just concluded free trade agreements. When Minister Robb briefed us on the value of the Chinese free trade agreement to our country, as a person involved in agriculture and resources I was thinking, 'This is wonderful.' We already export a lot of iron ore. In fact, for your interest, we actually export 19 tonnes of iron ore per person to our overseas markets—we did that in 2014.


But Minister Robb told us that what the Chinese actually want is access to our services. They want further access, for example, to our education services. Last year our education services to China were valued at in the order of $4 billion. The value of tourism from China to this country is in excess of $1 billion. That is just those two services alone—higher education and tourism—but add in to that the opportunity for services exported for governance, for prudential regulation, for insurance purposes, and the fact that that particular free trade agreement has now guaranteed that Australian service providers will be able to construct, renovate and wholly operate Australian-owned hotels and restaurants in China. How often have we heard, 'Of course, it is all well and good—they can come here to our country, but we cannot do the same.' Under this agreement we can; but if the provisions of Senator Whish-Wilson's bill had prevailed, we could not have. Australian travel agencies and tour operators, for example, are now able to establish wholly Australian-owned subsidiaries in China for tours within China for domestic and foreign travellers. And remember: in 2014, 100 million Chinese travelled outside their country, and it is predicted that, by 2016, that will double. Another area of services that they desperately want and need from us has led to the decision under the free trade agreement that China will permit wholly-owned Australian hospitals and aged-care institutions to be established in China and run and managed by Australians. Those are just three examples, in hospitality, in tourism and in the health and hospital and aged care sectors. And, as I say, there is the value of higher education. That is for just one country. If we expand that to Japan, which also has an ageing population, there is an opportunity for expansion of our services sector.


Mention was made by previous speakers about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I was in Mexico only some three weeks ago, discussing with government officials and industry people—for example from the oil and gas sectors, the hard-rock mining area and the energy sector—the value of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, to Mexico; it has been massive. But the Mexicans said, 'We cannot wait for the inclusion of more Australian investment.' At their geological survey institution they showed me proudly the geological map of Mexico at the one in 250,000 level and noted the fact that, in those mineral-rich areas of Mexico, they have actually now mapped it at one in 50,000. They then turned to me—through you, Mr Deputy President Marshall, to Senator Whish-Wilson—and said: 'Do you know where we got that expertise from, Senator Back? We got it from Geoscience Australia, and we got it from the CSIRO.' How proud do you think I was? And when they said, 'We are now sending 50,000 of our university students away every year to learn more about energy, oil and gas,' I thought, 'What opportunities are there for Australians to get in there, in hard-rock mining, in their services sector, in their corporate governance, in their insurances and in their health sector?' Those opportunities will be open to us, but, indeed, if we were to accept the provisions of this particular bill, we would be denied them because they will have ISDS provisions.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-02-12,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (11:32):  The Greens' Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill 2014 should be passed. Such legislation would play a critical role in protecting and enhancing our democracy, and I very warmly and strongly congratulate Senator Peter Whish-Wilson for initiating this bill before us. I speak about democracy because this really is about protecting democracy—protecting Australia as a sovereign nation, and making it harder to run down the all-important gains that society has managed over a number of decades with regard to labour standards, environmental protection and human rights—because the protection this bill would put in place would bring some balance back to the very damaging aspects of free trade and specifically the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So this bill is urgently needed.


There has been a long history in Australia of opposing some of the very damaging aspects of the push for free trade, and I would like to go into some of that history. I also want to congratulate, as well as Senator Whish-Wilson, many members of the Greens, the union movement, AFTINET, church groups, environment and human rights organisations and aid groups, because they are out there informing the public of how serious it is in terms of the secret negotiations. If the partnership—particularly with regard to the investor-state dispute settlement clauses—is put in place, that would do damage to the very fabric of our society, from our important basis of democratic institutions to so many aspects of our society that, often, we take for granted. So it is incredibly important that we deal with this.


I think it is worth reminding ourselves that a previous government, the Howard government, in 2004 did not include ISDS in that free trade agreement. I mention that because, when former Prime Minister John Howard came in, in the 1990s, his government really got their fingers burnt with what they were trying to do when they were meddling in a very similar scheme—actually, a much more extensive scheme—which large corporations were attempting to impose across the planet.


I am referring here to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. You could really say that the grandparents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and investor-state dispute settlement were the OECD and the MAI—or that the OECD gave birth to the MAI. This was a huge part of the 1990s when various very under-resourced organisations and some key hardworking activists—and, fortunately, emails were just coming into their own at that period—found out what was going on and alerted the world, and so many people rose up in opposition. That opposition was extensive and, ultimately, successful, and the Multilateral Agreement on Investment was put to bed. But now we are seeing it come back in different forms. So I think it is worth looking at what happened in the 1990s, because it is important for us to understand that this has been well debated and has been rejected, en masse, not just by Australians but by people around the world. So I did want to go into some of those aspects.


One important point was made in that debate—and I was very much part of it in the 1990s, since I was at that time the director of AID/WATCH, a non-government organisation monitoring Australia's overseas aid program, and this became a large part of our work—by Noam Chomsky. One of his arguments was that the OECD, as an organisation of rich countries, was more susceptible to direct influence by corporations; that is who they would be representing. He advocated that, when we are considering changes to trade agreements, that should come under a body such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. And there was a real in-depth analysis of how these agreements should occur.


On the side of those backing the MAI, there was a period where the Liberals and Nationals were right out in front, arguing along with the corporate world that the MAI would bring secure and stable investment conditions and regulate investment in a more uniform way. They rejected the idea that it would be a race to the bottom by saying there would be uniform conditions for corporations around the world. But, when people started get to get a hold of the documents and look at the detail, what they could see and what the world was alerted to was that it was in fact a race to the bottom because it was about developing means to erode labour conditions, erode environmental standards and erode human rights—because the power would be there to penalise governments if there were any measures that restricted the profits of the corporations.


Here is a little bit of history, because it is important that we remember that this was all done in secret. How did the world find out about it? There were some lucky breaks, there were some leaks and there were some incredibly hardworking people, mainly from organisations in low-income countries: the Third World Network, the NGO Public Citizen, Global Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Susan George, a very progressive economist at the time who was onto this. The documents were released and the analysis was done. I remember people at the time saying, 'What will kill off the multilateral agreement on investment is people knowing what it really does,' and that is what happened. The documents were analysed, the information was out there and emails started going around. Maybe it was even one of the first examples of an email campaign killing off really bad plans by the corporate world with a few backers—in Australia's case, the Liberal and National parties. I very much congratulate those people, and it was a fantastic campaign to be a part of.


I will go through how it played out in Australia. We had a Stop MAI coalition. It was huge and brought together unions, a whole number of church groups that were incredibly active, aid organisations, environment groups and human rights groups. It culminated on—and I like the date this occurred—11 November 1998 in a newspaper advertisement in The Australian signed by more than 500 organisations, setting out the concerns that we had with this whole legislation. It was important that that was put on the record because again it helped to inform more people, obviously. 


Interestingly, as the movement was growing around the world, the pressure from France was particularly significant because France was the first country to pull the plug on these negotiations and, while I cannot fully explain how the OECD works, that really did cripple the negotiations. Shortly afterwards, the Howard government pulled out of the negotiations as well. But it shows the strength of civil society here and around the world that there were so many people active in a very, very collaborative and constructive way.


Some of the points that we made in the advertisement in The Australianincluded—these are the words from the advertisement at the time: 


The Multilateral Agreement on Investment is a treaty which would give multinational corporations the standing previously only granted to nations, and a freer hand to challenge labour standards, environment protection, social justice and democratic control over all levels of government, worldwide.


It went on to say that Australia must withdraw now and not resume the negotiations in any other form. I emphasise 'not resume the negotiations in any other form', because in the 1990s we were aware of what this was all about. You could feel the momentum building around the movement of opposition. You could feel, as you can sometimes with progressive movements, that a win was in the air. The corporate world is all-powerful. They want to increase their profits; that is what they are on the planet to do. That is why the MAI could well arise in another form. And that is what we are seeing now with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and with the many other so-called free trade agreements. That is why I wanted to give emphasis to why we included that all-important phrase in the advertisement: Australia must withdraw now and not resume the negotiations in any other form. For the record, former Greens Senator Dee Margetts was one of the people who signed that ad, as well as the New South Wales Greens, a whole number of activists and heaps of organisations around the country. As I mentioned, there were about 500 in all.


That brings us to the current problems we are facing, and they are considerable. I urge senators from the other parties to look at this bill closely. There is nothing in it that serves the interests of any group, including corporations, because this form of so-called free trade with its ISDS clauses is a robber-baron form of capitalism, and, in the end, that is not good for the corporate world. Maybe they will increase their profits in the short term, but it will become destructive not just to workers, not just to the environment, not just to people's humans rights; it will bring a breakdown in how our society works. I say that most strongly because over time, over decades and, I believe, over centuries, the different protections, the different regulations and the different standards that we have passed and brought into practice—what some people try and dismiss as green tape and red tape—have come about to improve our society, a society where it is about being collective, about supporting each other. Again, yes, in the short term the corporate world might be really rapt that we have ISDS clauses and they can do all this behind closed doors and hammer governments around the world if their profits are limited. But in the long run it is not going to benefit people. Workers need to get a wage and they should be safe and able to go home at the end of the day—not maimed in some way or killed. We need an environment that is protective and that is there for future generations, not one where we have a huge burden because of the levels of pollution. All these things are interconnected, including how companies operate. So again I would urge all to look closely at this bill. 


International debate around these issues is growing enormously because there is increasing recognition that corporations have too much power over our democracies. This goes back to the starting point, and it is one of the aspects that have impressed me so much about how Senator Peter Whish-Wilson has taken forward the debate around this issue. He has made all the connections and really pinpointed how damaging this legislation would be if it were passed. It is particularly damaging because including ISDS clauses in international trade agreements tips the balance of power further in favour of the corporate world.


The working of our society is already out of balance to a great degree. We need to get back to recognising the broader public interest in terms of public health, public education, public housing—all the issues around our commons. We need to recognise how the public interest works and what we need to look after for a healthy society and for future generations. All these issues are interlinked. They are a reminder of why ISDS clauses have no place in international trade agreements.


ISDS clauses introduce potential risks to the public interest and the sovereignty of any nation. We have seen that in many recent studies. Going back to some of the experience that I gained when we were opposing the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, I remember that some of the Latin American countries had in place rules that said that if a foreign corporation was going to operate in their country the company would be required to employ so many local workers. It was realised that it would be impossible to maintain such a position under the Multilateral Agreement on Investment and that it would limit the rights of countries in improving their conditions. That is how we know of the risks associated with ISDS.


I have mentioned the growing opposition to this form of trade agreement. I would urge senators to look closely at that opposition. Over 100 academic experts to the European Commission inquiry into ISDS found that the many risks that ISDS clauses impose on the public interest cannot be managed simply by having certain safeguards for certain sections of these trade agreements. You cannot put the ISDS clauses and then establish safeguards. That is just a con job to try to make out that something is being done. It cannot be effective. It cannot remove the extraordinary extent of the damage. We must not even go there in the first place. We know that the government proposed safeguards in its deals, such as the Korean free trade agreement. That is not satisfactory. We cannot solve the problem in that way.


Returning to the study by the academic experts to the European Commission, the so-called extensive safeguards were rejected most decisively by those academics as being inadequate. We think that is where considerable attention needs to be paid.


I would like to pay tribute to the many groups who are working on this campaign. One of the leading organisations in Australia is AFTINET, the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network, which has taken up this issue for well over a decade, examining the free trade agreements that have come forward, coming down to parliament, briefing people and putting material out there. Pat Ranald, who is the convenor of AFTINET, in talking about ISDS clauses, stated that they give:


… additional rights to foreign investors to challenge domestic laws which may be made as part of protecting or advancing human rights or environmental sustainability. Those are the kinds of examples that we cite in our submission. So our worry is that ISDS has the potential to undermine or challenge domestic law which seeks to protect those broad principles of human rights and environmental sustainability.


That has very much been a theme of the comments that I have shared with senators today, that the degree of destruction that ISDS would bring to the very fabric of our legal protections, the fabric of so many standards that have been established, goes to the heart of the democratic process. If you have a corporate power that is structured in such a way as to be higher, greater, than parliaments or governments then clearly it is a challenge to democracy. That is why we Greens are giving so much emphasis to this and why so much of civil society in Australia has examined this and is alerting people to these problems.


I do believe that this is a time when we need to take the strongest stand. It is informative that Justice French has written a very substantial paper about this in which he goes into this issue in detail. I understand that some of the senators from other parties may not be willing to take on board what the Greens are saying, but I want to emphasise that this is much wider than ourselves. I would very much urge that you read the very detailed paper that Justice French wrote, because he raises the very critical aspects of the lack of transparency involved. As I mentioned in relation to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, it was because of some incredibly hard work, some good breaks, some leaks, that word was able to spread about the damage it would do. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement also is highly secretive, but some excellent work has been done by Civil Society and  by Senator Peter Whish-Wilson to get the word out. Justice French adds to this all-important work, particularly in identifying issues around the lack of transparency. You see that this is a recurring theme when you start to examine what is going on. When something is as secretive as this, one has to ask why that is. The answer is because those who are involved know that it will be deeply unpopular, that if people understand the detail the opposition to it will start growing and will apply more pressure. My guess is that they probably remember what happened in the 1990s, probably many of them were around then. They learnt from their side of politics wanting to serve the corporate interests how to manage the debate around this. Again, they have tried to keep it secret. Senator Peter Whish-Wilson is to be congratulated. This bill is excellent and it should be passed.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! A remarkable convergence of the clocks means that time for this debate has now expired.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-02-12,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (09:31):  It does not give me a great deal of pleasure to rise to speak to the Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill 2014, but I want to congratulate my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson for bringing this bill forward. It still leaves me somewhat speechless that behind the scenes the Australian executive—through our trade minister and senior trade bureaucrats—are negotiating a treaty that would see Australia effectively subordinate state and national law to global corporate trade law. What this bill seeks to do is take on one element of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is being negotiated in secret as we speak and which, depending on which rumours you believe, may be as close as two or three weeks away from being signed and then presented to this parliament. This is as a trade agreement being signed under cover of total darkness. Isn't it interesting that when the global community gets together to negotiate difficult and complex environmental agreements that happens out in the open? The negotiators from various parties trying to hammer out climate change agreements have to do that in open forum. Sure, there are deals done in back rooms and all the usual things that go on, but everybody knows what it is that Australia would be potentially signing up to. When it comes to global trade agreements, not even the minister necessarily knows. 


I think that the first thing that we need to get very clear about when we consider the Trans-Pacific Partnership is that this is not a free trade agreement in the sense that we are used to. It is not even being negotiated between sovereign governments. It is actually being negotiated between large corporate entities in various sectors, and those corporations—whether big pharma, rights holders, the biotechnology industry or agriculture; take your pick—are then handing negotiating positions to trade negotiators in various countries and having those positions hammered into a text. This is an agreement being hammered out by global corporations in their benefit. It is an investors' rights agreement; it is not a free trade agreement.


We only know the little that we know about the actual text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership because whistleblowers have leaked draft chapters of the text—two iterations of the IP chapter and one iteration of the chapter relating to environmental protection—to the WikiLeaks website. While that organisation has been hammered from all quarters, it has never been proven to be more important than now as the place where we can go to find out exactly what is being done in our name. 


So I congratulate Senator Whish-Wilson for bringing forward this very targeted bill. It obviously does not go to the entire scope of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because nobody will tell us exactly what that is, but it does go to the very specific notion of investor-state dispute mechanisms—one of those acronyms that might make your eyes glaze over, until you realise that what it allows to happen would be for multinational corporations to sue sovereign governments. This parliament considers itself sovereign, and I know from personal experience that the mob at the Tent Embassy and around the country—traditional owners—would take very strong issue with that. The business of sovereignty in this country is probably the most important piece of unfinished business for us to confront. But the fact is that, from the prayers that were just read in, you would assume that those from all sides of this parliament come in here charged with making and amending laws and providing good governance in the interests of everyone across this continent. But what happens if the laws that we pass in here are found to be offensive to the profit-generating activities of corporations on the other side of the world? The Australian government—as is actually occurring, although I am not sure many people are aware of it—could be dragged into a tribunal of unelected foreign trade bureaucrats, sued and forced to amend the affecting regulation if it impinges on the profits of a company on the other side of the world.


It sounds insane, but that is in fact precisely what is being negotiated behind closed doors by the Australian government and, when they were in government, by the Australian Labor Party. One of the things that I hope that Senator Carr or whoever speaks on behalf of the Labor Party will do when they are given the opportunity is put some cards on the table and make it very clear where the ALP stand. My understanding is that they would be in support of Senator Whish-Wilson's bill. When they were in government, I think they did have form in opposing investor-state dispute mechanisms that would allow state or federal governments to be sued by corporations who found themselves offended, but it is not at all clear where they stand now. So that is another reason why I would like to thank Senator Whish-Wilson for bringing this debate forward today.


Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who is a Nobel laureate in economics and somebody who spends a fair bit of time thinking about these things, said the following:




The TPP proposes to freeze into a binding trade agreement many of the worst features of the worst laws in the TPP countries, making needed reforms extremely difficult if not impossible.





The investor state dispute resolution mechanisms should not be shrouded in mystery to the general public, while the same provisions are routinely discussed with advisors to big corporations.



None of this is being done in the national interest. This is an agreement being hammered out in the corporate interest. If somebody as esteemed in his field as Professor Stiglitz is of that view, we should take that very, very seriously.


We are fortunate, as I said to those staff, campaigners and journalists in the publishing organisation WikiLeaks, that they have had the bravery to have stayed in business despite the extraordinary persecution that has been meted out to them so that we do have some sense of what is in the IP chapters. There are some very specific concerns. I want to concentrate today mostly on an area that is very dear to me: areas around freedom of information, freedom of speech and digital rights, which are placed explicitly under threat by what we find contained in the IP chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and also by what happens when you bring investor-state dispute mechanisms to bear on some of these issues. A lot of damage was done when Australia signed the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, and I think it has been government policy to try to avoid, if possible, forcing any amendments into domestic law as a result of the IP chapter. It is not at all clear whether that is actually the case. We may be faced with a bill which we will be told, on a 'take it or leave it' basis, that this parliament has to pass.


I would also say, for those who may be following this debate from outside and may be a bit confused by the government's rhetoric of due process, that we have the treaties committee, which is designed to evaluate mechanisms like the TPP. I served on the treaties committee for 5½ years—nearly six years. That committee will not get a copy of the Trans-Pacific Partnership until after the government signs it. And while the committee, in my experience, does apply a very critical eye to these things, the government is not bound to accept any of its recommendations. The treaties committee will do the best that it can, but the agreement will already have been signed—trade ministers' and prime ministers' signatures will already be on the document—by the time Australia's accountability and oversight mechanisms get the chance to take a look at it. And then it will be a case of this parliament being told—effectively with a gun to its head—that it has to pass the enabling legislation to bring some of these provisions into force. What an utterly backwards and antiquated process for dealing with such an important issue.


So, we have already done a certain amount of damage in Australian law. We effectively imported some of the worst aspects of US IP law, without their protections. The US has fair-use clauses, which mean that you cannot be prosecuted under US intellectual property law for doing stuff that is quite clearly not impinging on profits—commercial-scale piracy and that kind of stuff. In Australia the situation is very much unclear, and it appears that the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from what we know of the IP chapters, will make that situation much worse. And that is my principal question of what the rush is in bringing in mandatory data retention legislation—not necessarily so that the Federal Police can go and prosecute people who are found to be file sharing but so that rights holders from the US and elsewhere can go and trawl the metadata records of your teenage kids and send them threatening legal letters and the threat of gargantuan fines unless they pay up, or lengthy court cases unless they pay enormous fines. That is the kind of world that we are potentially stepping into here.


The document as it stands contains disproportionate and inappropriate enforcement provisions. It is all about enforcing the rights of rights holders, most of them from overseas, and there is nothing at all about public interest protections. Just to give you one example, a couple of years ago the Australian Law Reform Commission, partly in response to some of the damaging provisions that we embedded in Australian law after the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement was brought about, conducted quite a detailed inquiry into the copyright regime that prevails here in Australia. One of the recommendations they made at the time was to bring fair-use provisions—to effectively import some of the protective measures that exist in US law. We have the punitive stuff; we do not have the protective provisions.


And the fact is that if we were to now do so—if we sign up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which then embeds all kinds of property rights that did not exist before, for the rights holders—if this parliament then decided to do as the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended and institute a fair-use regime, that could be struck down by unelected trade bureaucrats in a tribunal, and the Australian government might choose to not even contest what would likely be a very expensive and extensive arbitral process. So, it may be that Attorney-General George Brandis, who is quite clearly listening only to the rights holders, does not even decide to contest it. It is that chilling effect on domestic legislation that is such an important and terrifying part of what this government is negotiating behind the scenes. And it looks like extension of copyright terms is in the agreement as well. That effectively just takes material out of the public domain for decades. It makes the work of cultural institutions and collection agencies that much harder, and it robs us of our own culture. 'Copyright term extensions' sounds arcane, but basically it just means all this rich cultural material simply going dark, archival institutions not even being able to digitise or make copies of material that in analogue form is degrading or being lost.


So, we have a very significant problem, and it is one that this parliament will not be able to address until it is far too late. I think one of the simplest things we could do is bring forward this bill for a vote today and pass into Australian domestic law protections against any Australian government signing us up to investor-state dispute mechanisms. That is the thing to do if you are concerned about fracking, if you are concerned about advertising tobacco products in places where kids can see it, if you are concerned about a ban on uranium mining, for example, or any of those issues where communities come into collision with powerful corporate interests, whether it be tobacco, big pharma, genetically modified organisms in our food, or the fracking industry—take your pick. Anywhere that these major collisions between the corporate interest and the public interest are underway, these very same corporations are seeking that power to sue us, to sue this parliament, to sue state parliaments.


Nobody on the government side of this chamber will make eye contact this morning because they have not read the agreement either. They have no idea what is in it. They just hear from our trade bureaucrats: 'It's fine; we're looking after the national interest. It's a free trade agreement like nothing you've ever seen before.' Well, at least that part is true.


But we owe it to ourselves and to our constituents, and to the future flexibility of this legislature to be able to do its job, to protect ourselves from predator capitalism and from these corporate interests, unelected, on the other side of the world, who would like nothing more than to subordinate the law-making power of this chamber and the other place to their own interests. All you would need to prove—and not even really prove; all you would need to be able to show—is your future potential profits in fracking underneath a residential subdivision or farmland, your future potential profits in opening up a carcinogenic uranium mine or your future profits in being able to track down and prosecute teenagers BitTorrenting stuff that they cannot get any other way, to be able to sue a government, to sue this parliament.


So I hope that we will see a measured, intelligent, evidence based debate on this this morning. I hope that the Labor Party will come clean with the Australian population about what its policy actually is. We will be listening beyond words, and we will be looking for a voting intention. And I hope the government might want to stand up and maybe even table a draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. That is not a serious expectation, but how about it? If this document is so benign, if it is in the public interest, if it is going to lead to a massive increase in GDP, if it is going to be a huge benefit to our agricultural sector or whoever else you think you are out there negotiating on behalf of, then put it into the daylight. Let us see the document. Let us see what is being negotiated in our names behind closed doors.


This bill should pass into law. It will not solve many of the issues contained in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, if this government is so reckless as to sign on. We will have to fight that through this parliament and in the community. But, once these agreements are signed, they are perilously difficult to unravel. They are impossible to wind back—because we will have granted property rights effectively across all of our collective futures to these corporations that only care about property rights and the profit motive.


It is our job, I think, to protect the public interest, not the commercial interest and the corporate interest. Our job in here today is to protect the public interest. So I look forward to a resolution of this matter so that we can send this bill to the other place for assent and protect ourselves from making potentially one of the most reckless and dangerous mistakes any parliament could make, which is to handcuff itself from its future legislative obligations to the people of this country.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-02-12,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (09:47):  I must be guilty! Apparently we are all beholden to corporate interests and corporations. I do not know if the strings are visible to people today, but I am just a puppet, apparently, for corporate interests. It is all based on conspiracies. It reminds me—there was a great movie, Team America, and one of the characters in that movie was asked to explain their claims about corporations. They said, 'Oh, yeah, well, corporations are out there, and they do corporationy things, and they go and make money.'


There is no evidence here at all. There is no evidence. And I have not just sat through and listened to Senator Ludlam's speech. I have read Senator Whish-Wilson's first contribution, his second reading speech, and also flicked through Senator Di Natale's speech, and there is no evidence. They have provided no evidence at all. They have only relied on base conspiracy theorists. That is where the Greens are ending up right now. They are relying on conspiracy theories rather than evidence. If these things were so bad, we would have some evidence of their ill effect. We would have some ill effect, because—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  Well, you are putting this bill up. And the requirement is on people bringing a bill to this chamber to provide evidence of why we should put it in place. We should not put legislation in place where there is not an identifiable problem that needs to be fixed. I think we can all agree on that. That is why we should pass laws in this place: to fix a problem that exists. Now, where is the problem?


We have already four FTAs with ISDS provisions in them. We have 21 bilateral trade agreements, bilateral investment agreements, with ISDS provisions in them. Some of those agreements go back 25 years. If there were problems with these provisions they would have manifested themselves. We have agreements with Singapore, Thailand, ASEAN and New Zealand, all with these provisions, but there are no problems. I will not name the 21 countries.


Over those 25 years—and this is something none of the Greens senators have mentioned—how many cases do you think the Australian government has been subject to, under these provisions? Senator Whish-Wilson, you probably know. How many cases?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Why don't you ask the Productivity Commission?




Senator CANAVAN:
  One case. I will get to the Productivity Commission. And that case has not even been resolved yet. This is a well-known case brought by Philip Morris on plain-packaging regulations. I will get to the international evidence, too, Senator Whish-Wilson. 




Senator CANAVAN:
  The Productivity Commission has been verballed a little. I note that some of the Greens senators have taken to quoting the Productivity Commission, saying that we should not include these provisions in ICS agreements. Let us read the whole quote of the Productivity Commission.




Senator Colbeck:
  Selective quotes!




Senator CANAVAN:
  I would not expect the Greens to do selective quoting, but there is a first time for everything. This is exactly what the Productivity Commission said:


Australian Governments should seek to avoid the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions in BRTAs that grant foreign investors in Australia substantive or procedural rights greater than those enjoyed by Australian investors.


I do not dispute that view. But the Greens always leave out that little bit—it is only those bits that provide substantively greater procedural rights. That has not happened in any of these agreements. If it had, we would have seen that evidence.


I listened to Senator Ludlam earnestly worrying about how this provision could stop us dealing with fracking, and I think uranium mining, and all these other things. If you read the Korean FTA that we have only just signed, chapter 18 deals with the environment and these issues that Senator Ludlam raised. The very first article, 18.1, in that chapter says:


Recognizing the right of each Party to establish its own levels of environmental protection and environmental development priorities, and to adopt or modify accordingly its environmental laws and policies, each Party shall ensure that its laws provide for and encourage high levels of environmental protection and shall strive to continue to improve their respective levels of environmental protection, including through such environmental laws and policies.


There are no restrictions against a country acting to protect its environment under the Korean FTA or under any of our other bilateral investment agreements. The Greens have quoted from none of these ISDS agreements to prove otherwise.


Senator Whish-Wilson also raised the point about international evidence. It is true, internationally there is much more experience associated with ISDS clauses. There are, across the world, 2,400 bilateral investment treaties in place. Of those bilateral investment treaties, 90 per cent have not had a single investor claim under them for a treaty breach. Fewer than 10 per cent of these 2,400 agreements have ever been triggered, even once. I did not hear Senator Ludlam say this, but sometimes people claim that there has been a surge in ICS claims. 


There has been an increase. I do not have the numbers of the increase in claims here, but the key point to make is that these increases are proportional to the amount of outward foreign capital investment in the world. I am not sure if I am allowed to use props, but there is a graph from a report I read this morning that shows, very clearly, that the number of claims—sorry, I do have the figures here—have risen to about 600 a year now we are averaging in ISDS claims. But that is directly proportional to the increase in foreign direct investment across the world. It is a very good thing that we have more foreign direct investment. It has allowed economies, particularly developing economies, to increase their growth considerably over the past 50 years. When you think about—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Why did you leave out the US free trade agreement?




Senator CANAVAN:
  Why did we leave out the US free trade agreement? Because we did not need it with the US. We on this side believe we should evaluate these things on a case-by-case basis. Oils ain't oils, Senator Whish-Wilson; through you Mr Deputy President. We should evaluate these things as we see fit. We do not need it with the US because both Australia and the United States have very strong protections against property rights. There was no need for it. So let us look at it on a case-by-case basis. Before I was interrupted, I was talking about foreign direct investment. In 1959, the global stock of FDI was just US$60 billion—not a lot of money at all in the context of the world economy. But today it exceeds $25 trillion. That is a massive growth, and it is a very important growth because it has allowed, particularly, countries which are poorer and which lack capital to access capital from overseas countries. And one of the reasons it has been allowed to grow is thanks to these investment treaties, because they give investors—largely in developed countries, because that is where the capital is—the protection and the rights to make sure that it is—




Senator Fawcett:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order under standing order 197.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I can say that interjections which are not actually disrupting the debate are sometimes tolerated by the chair, particularly if they facilitate the exchange of views and arguments in a debate. However, if Senator Canavan does seek the protection of the chair, I will certainly provide him with that protection.




Senator CANAVAN:
  I am new to this, so perhaps I should. But look, I am quite enjoying it and I think that the Greens senators are enjoying it, so let us continue. I will let you know, Mr Deputy President, if my position changes in that regard.


As I was saying, these protections have been very important to facilitate that growth in investment. Prior to these protections coming into place, it was quite common for governments, particularly in developing countries, to expropriate property or to nationalise property, and to thereby take away the investments that foreign countries had made. Indeed, according to some evidence presented by the United Nations in a paper that I read this morning, in the 14 years prior to the entry into force of the first bilateral investment treaty, there were 875 government takings of foreign-investor property in 62 countries, for which there was no effective remedy. International law at the time provided very few protections for investors in those cases. It meant, of course, that there was a chilling effect on that foreign investment, and that many people would not invest.


I support foreign investment, particularly on the global scale. It is very important. And I do not understand why the Greens are, seemingly, so anti this—because, in other instances, the Greens are very cosmopolitan and very multicultural, and that is a fantastic thing. We should seek to have a world that shrinks, and becomes smaller, and in which we tighten our relationships with each other. Investment certainly does that. Trade helps to build relations; trade helps to make sure countries stay friendly with each other. But investment does it even more; when you buy something at the shop, you have a relationship with the shopkeeper, but when you invest in his business, you have a permanent relationship. We should seek to encourage that between countries. These treaties and agreements have also allowed us to move away from what was sometimes called gunboat diplomacy. That was a regrettable period in American history but, many times, the US government—in the 19th century in particular, and into the 20th century—used its military force to ensure that its investors were protected and that its trade rights were maintained. But I think we would all agree that that was not the right way to go about things. These new treaties have allowed investors—from the US, but actually more from Europe; the evidence is that European investors have been the biggest users of these clauses—protections, without the need to resort to governments offering military threats or, in the worst cases, military interventions. It is much better that we should jaw-jaw rather than war-war. Of course we are going to have disagreements through these agreements, and sometimes we might not get the best results we would like—although, as I said earlier, that has not happened to Australia yet. But it is much better that we resolve these disputes through a legal process rather than a more direct and violent one.


I also just want to go to some of the evidence in the international jurisprudence, and it goes to some of the points Senator Ludlam was making that somehow these provisions undermine the ability of governments to put in place environmental or health protections. In fact, that is not true at all when you actually look at the jurisprudence. Under the NAFTA—the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico, which includes an ISDS clause—there was a case brought by Chemtura, a chemical company. It brought the Canadian government to court. The investor challenged Canadian pesticide regulations, but the tribunal in this case ruled against Chemtura on all claims, and the panel expressly recognised Canada's right to make scientific and environmental regulatory decisions. There was another NAFTA case, called Methanex v United States. Again, the tribunal dismissed all of Methanex's claims of discriminatory treatment and expropriation, noting:


… as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects … a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.


Again, there are well-known protections both in ISDS agreements and in general trade law that allow governments to regulate for the public good.


But that is not to say that these agreements have been without effect. They are not completely timid. These agreements do offer protection, and they have in fact offered protection to Australian investors, because what is often lost here is that it is a two-way street. While these agreements do, of course, protect overseas investors in Australia, they also protect Australian investors overseas. Recently there have been two cases of Australian companies making use of ISDS clauses. In November 2011, a tribunal awarded White Industries Australia Limited, which is an Australian mining company, compensation from the Indian government for violating the India-Australia agreements. There was another case in 2011 where an Australian copper company, Tethyan Copper Company, formally commenced ISDS provisions against the government of Pakistan. In December 2012 Planet Mining, another Australian company, requested that the government of Indonesia consider a claim under a clause in that international agreement. So it is important that our investors and our companies have the protection of these agreements.


I think that property rights should be something that we try to uphold and protect. I am not necessarily surprised that the Greens do not put as high a price on the protection of property rights as other members in this chamber, but we do have international agreements that cover human rights, providing protection against torture and covering other internationally recognised rights issues. Property rights are extremely important as well, and the protection of property rights goes back right to the start of the Enlightenment and the Declaration of Independence in the United States. It is enshrined in our Constitution as well: the government must give just compensation where it acquires property. But we should make sure it is enshrined in these agreements as well, because sometimes courts can look more fondly on domestic investors than they do on foreign investors. We should seek that the same kinds of protections that we think are right and proper in our Constitution and that exist in other constitutions, such as the American government's, be similarly recognised in this agreement.


One reason I think the Greens are promoting something like this is that they do not really believe in that. They do not really believe that property rights should always and everywhere be protected, that property rights are on a par with other types of rights and that governments should not be given licence to simply take property from people without due compensation.


There is a particular issue in Queensland that has been longstanding Greens policy, and it will be detrimental to regional areas and the farming community. If the new Labor government in Queensland seeks to reintroduce tree-clearing laws into that state—as they have promised to do—I bet you they will not offer a cent of compensation to farmers. Farmers previously had the right to clear property on their land to develop it, to make it have value, and that value was embodied in the price they paid for the property. The price they paid for a property included a right to clear the trees on their land, to develop the land, to put irrigation in, to put better pastures in, to put more head of cattle on it and to make more money. 


That was changed almost 15 years ago in Queensland by the former Labor government. It introduced these laws that stripped all of those rights away from farmers. Perhaps some greater protection did need to be put in place, but compensation should have been given. Compensation should be given, in this place, with the powers that we have, because sometimes these debates are presented as though governments are weak, timid and vulnerable institutions that are beholden to corporations, when that is not the truth. We are very powerful. When we use those powers to take things from people, particularly from small businesses and farmers, we should have the guts to stump up with the cash to compensate for that taking of rights.


If we in this chamber had tried to pass the kinds of laws that Queensland had, there possibly would have been a claim under section 51 of the Constitution for farmers. But the Queensland government is not bound by those provisions in our Constitution, unfortunately. In the United States they are. It is the fifth amendment, I think, where due process must be followed for the taking of property. That does bind American state governments, but it does not here in this country, unfortunately. These provisions are something that go to the heart of what we on this side of the chamber believe. Property rights should be protected; we as governments should not abuse our powers by taking from those who are weaker and more vulnerable than us. 


As I said to an interjection earlier, we on this side of the chamber do not insist that all trade agreements have an ISDS clause. As was noted by Senator Whish-Wilson, in the US free trade agreement we did not put that in place. In the Korean free trade agreement we put many more additional protections than have previously existed in ISDS clauses, to ensure that governments do have the power to regulate for the general public good and for order. 


There is some limitation or shortcoming in the way this bill has been drafted. As it has been drafted, it will stop us from entering into all agreements that have an ISDS clause, even if that agreement exempted us from those clauses. There could clearly be a case—even in the TPP—where we would be exempted from some obligations. That would fall foul of this particular bill, if it were passed. So I do not think it is drafted in a way that we should pass it in this chamber. It would unreasonably restrict the role of the executive government in negotiating and signing agreements that promote trade for Australians and protect their investment rights.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:08):  I rise today to say that this Australian parliament should ban investor-state dispute resolution clauses in any agreement that Australia signs. It is as pure and simple as that. 


I find it extraordinary that a government that has made an art form out of talking about Operation Sovereign Borders—suggesting to the Australian community that it is somehow protecting Australia's sovereignty from refugees—would, in fact, be prepared to negotiate away our own national sovereignty. This is the agenda to say that democratically elected parliaments are subject to the demands of corporations; not only multinational corporations but also corporations based in any of the member states of any agreement which is signed. In the case of the Trans-Pacific Partnership that is Australia, the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam.


The big point here is this: we have a parliament to make the laws that govern this country in the public interest. That is fundamentally what parliament is about. That is why we are elected to this place. And what is going on at the moment is a negotiation—in secret—of a text of a trade agreement that the Australian community cannot see. We have a government saying: 'Oh, this is normal. We do not share this with people. And actually, the parliament will get to look at it'—yes; after it has been signed off by cabinet, and the parliament then only has the right to either reject the entire treaty or not. The fact of the matter is, this government—Prime Minister Abbott, and the minister, Mr Robb—are negotiating away Australia's sovereignty, and placing it in the hands—particularly in this case—of corporations based in the United States. The shocking thing here is that the United States congress has access to the text. But we do not—we in this parliament do not. But if you are a member of congress in the United States, you can get access to the text—yes, you might have to sign a confidentiality agreement, but you get to see what it is that the American government is signing up to. But we do not. We have no idea. Nobody in Australia— nobody on the street, none of the stakeholders, none of us—knows exactly what is being signed up to. Secrecy, and a lack of transparency really matter in cases like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and in investor-state dispute resolution.


Why am I saying that it is an assault on Australia's sovereignty, and an assault on decisions of the parliament and the judiciary? It is not just parliamentarians like the Greens who are objecting to this; the judiciary is worried as well—because the chilling effect of this is that corporations can sue a government if a government moves to take legislative action which undermines their profits. The classic case that Australians may be familiar with is the Phillip Morris case with the cigarette companies. It is already happening. Phillip Morris is suing Australia under an ISDS provision in a Hong Kong-Australia investment agreement. They have also sued Uruguay for increasing the size of health warnings on cigarette packets. A legal adviser to Uruguay said:


They are bullying us because we are small. This is like David and Goliath. But we will fight because it is our right and duty as a government to protect our citizens' health.


The New Zealand health minister has delayed the introduction of plain packaging in New Zealand because of the fear of being targeted with similar litigation. This is what is known as 'regulatory chill', where governments are afraid to legislate because it may lead to them being sued by a corporation. There are plenty of examples you can think of in Australia where that might happen. You might have it with companies who are wanting to engage in fracking, for example. If Australia brings in a ban, you can see where the companies—if they had already started their operations—would be suing the government—that is, suing the government for bringing in a regulation that protects public health. It is the same in terms of GMOs. We know Monsanto would love to be able to sue Australia because Tasmania has a GMO moratorium. We make sure we do not have GMOs in Tasmania. It is part of our commitment to the environment, but it is also part of our commitment to the clean, green and clever brand of Tasmania. Monsanto would love to sue on that occasion, and it has happened in other jurisdictions.


In the wake of the Fukushima disaster there was a groundswell of opposition to nuclear power in Germany. The government responded to this powerful movement by announcing a shutdown of the nuclear power industry. Soon after, Vattenfall—a Swedish utility that operates two nuclear plants in Germany—demanded compensation of 3.7 billion euros under the ISDS clause of a treaty on energy investments. In responding to the will of the people after what they saw after Fukushima, the government tried to act in the best interests of the health of the German people. And in came the corporation to say, 'You are undermining our profits out of nuclear power and therefore we want compensation.' 


Oil and gas giant Lone Pine is suing the Canadian government for $250 million over Quebec's moratorium on fracking. That is enabled by the ISDS clauses in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Lone Pine alleges that the fracking moratorium reduces 'the expectation of a stable business and political environment'. Never mind the instability that will arise from fracking, including water insecurity, loss of farmland and—ultimately—global warming.


We are also seeing the NGOs coming out. The Sierra Club, in relation to this issue with Canada and Lone Pine, has said: 


If a government is not even allowed to take a time out to study the impact—


of fracking—


without having to compensate a corporation, it puts a tremendous chill on a governments' ability to regulate in the public interest,


You also have a situation with Australian company OceanaGold in El Salvador. The Australian mining company is currently suing El Salvador for $301 million—the equivalent of half the education budget of a poor country, like El Salvador—because it refused to issue them with a gold-mining licence. 


The situation goes back to 2004 when the company applied for a mining permit and assured the government that its work would be environmentally friendly and would provide jobs for local people. In the interim, the damages of mining proliferated in El Salvador. Ninety per cent of the country's surface water became contaminated. There was acid mine drainage, which has killed aquatic life and destroyed water quality in the region, and high rates of disease linked to arsenic poisoning. Currently, just two per cent of El Salvador's water is determined by the government to be of good quality. The El Salvador government said:


… the original application to mine did not meet environmental safety standards and that the proposed mine poses risks to the country's already limited water supplies. OceanaGold denies the risks, even though—


everybody knows—


gold mining is notorious for polluting waterways with arsenic mercury and other toxic metals.


As a result, the government failed to approve the proposal and instituted a moratorium on mining permits, as you would expect they would do in the public interest. 


We are now seeing, under the ISDS clauses of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the company go after the El Salvador government. If the company succeeds, this will significantly reduce the funds available for health care and education. Even if Pacific Rim's claims fail—as many expect—this lawsuit has cost El Salvador almost $13,000,000 to date, which amounts to nearly its entire environment and natural resources spending in 2013. 


That is going on already around the world and that is precisely what Australia is lining up for. I wonder how much it will cost the Australian government to defend the case against Philip Morris? It would be very interesting for the government to tell us how many precious taxpayer dollars have gone into taking it up to Philip Morris in the courts. Philip Morris is suing us for daring to legislate in the public interest about plain packaging. It would be good to hear from the government, in the course of this debate, the cost to the public purse.


I also want to point out that the Labor Party when it was in government wanted to sign up to the free trade agreement with Korea. But I am pleased to say, the minister of the day, Craig Emerson, came out and said:


We considered it long and hard, and we had to stare into the abyss of having to say, 'We can't conclude the agreement with Korea.' As a matter of principle and in keeping with the commitments that we made, we said to Korea, 'No, we cannot do it.'


He went on to say that they opposed it in the Korea FTA because: 


… if we had agreed with it with Korea, it would be inevitable that we would have to agree with it within the Trans Pacific Partnership and other trade agreements. It was obvious to us, if we'd said yes to Korea, how do you say no to the United States?


The Labor government knew at the time that if they signed up to the trade deal with Korea with the ISDS in place it would be rolled over into the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and that is precisely what is happening. It is disgraceful that now that Labor is in opposition they go along with the government's signing up to the free trade agreement with Korea with that investor-state dispute resolution clause in place.


That means Labor and the government in Australia are selling out Australia's sovereignty. They are doing it in secret; there is no text for anyone to see. What is even worse than the U.S. Congress having access to the text while we do not, is that they are asking us to sign off on the text here in Australia. They are asking us to sign it off in this parliament before it is concluded in the US; and the US reserves the right to change it if it does not suit US companies, the US Congress or their consultation process. So, if ever Australia were selling out our sovereignty to US and to corporations, it is under this agreement.


This is the agenda of the corporate world. This is the agenda about getting rid of regulation on a global scale to maximise their absolute destruction of the planet at the lowest possible price and at the expense of local people, jobs, wages, conditions—the whole lot. That is exactly what you are going to see in investor-state dispute resolution and it is why the Europeans are backing off this at a great rate. The European parliament has had a letter from 100 legal and other experts in the field saying, 'Back off this in Europe. It is a bad idea.' They have had to put it on hold and they have had to start looking at what it actually means in the European context to sign up to agreements with investor-state dispute resolution clauses in them.


But think about it: if you have a multinational corporation that is threatening a country, why would a parliament then move to legislate for a ban on fracking or to stop environmental destruction if they knew they were going to incur the wrath of the corporation suing them and the legal costs associated with defending it? The whole point of a parliament and sovereignty is for the parliament to be able to be the ultimate decision makers and for the courts to be the ultimate decision makers in terms of the legal framework, the laws of the country and how the laws of the country are implemented. Once you devolve that decision making power to corporations you might as well give up as a parliament and as a government—and that is precisely what the Abbott government is doing.


The Labor Party knows it. They had this experience with the Korean free trade deal and that is why, to their credit, they did not sign up. They knew what investor-state dispute resolution meant. Tragically, they have now gone onto the same bandwagon as the government. But the people of Australia do not like it. The people of Australia do not like the idea that once again we have a Liberal government that pretends to protect the sovereignty of Australia selling out to the United States and, in particular, selling out to multinational corporations because that is the consequence of what is going on. I have cited the examples—the Philip Morris case, the Canadian case of Lone Pine, the German antinuclear case and the El Salvadorian case of environmental regulation. The trouble with some senators on the other side is that they prefer ignorance and ideology to get in the way of evidence. The evidence I have presented stands alone.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Talk about ignorance and ideology!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT
:  Senator Macdonald, in four minutes and six seconds you will get your turn. Please allow Senator Milne to speak.




Senator MILNE:
  I can tell you that the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Justice Robert French, has raised his concerns that ISDS is effectively establishing a parallel legal system where Australian judges have no voice. Senator Macdonald thinks, obviously, that he knows better than the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Justice Robert French. But I think, Mr Acting Deputy President, that when you have the Chief Justice saying that what you are doing is selling out the sovereignty of the Australian parliament and the Australian legal system, you should start thinking about that. When the Chief Justice is saying that the ISDS is setting up a parallel legal system where Australian judges have no voice, that should be of major concern to Australians. People are already worried that this government is governing for the big end of town. We are seeing it—absolutely—when it comes to their refusal to crack down on tax avoidance; in the huff and puff of the Treasurer before the G20—all about tax avoidance—until we had to ask for a delay in Australia actually engaging in the exchange of information around the world that would lead to a crackdown of tax avoidance. We saw it in MYEFO before Christmas: the tax avoidance measures that were in that document were removed. We are seeing it left, right and centre.


The two greatest threats to humanity and to the planet are the growing inequality around the world in the accumulation of wealth, and global warming. Those two things together are driving massive social unrest and ecological destruction. And the people driving it are the corporate world—the one per cent who own the vast majority of the Earth's resources now, and their wealth, want to secure a regulatory environment which is lowest common denominator, and they want to use these investor-state dispute resolution clauses to do it. This is a dangerous assault on the integrity and capacity of the Australian parliament to govern in the best interests of the Australian people, for our wellbeing and our health. It is being done in secret, handing over to the United States the right to actually change the text—after the Australian parliament has signed off on it. And we will be subject to it after that. What sort of government acts as a doormat to that kind of agreement? I can tell you which sort of government: it is the Abbott government. It is the very people who pretend they are interested in Operation Sovereign Borders, while actually undermining the sovereignty of our nation in a very frightening way.


We only have to look at what is going on with the power of the corporates. We have to take our democracy back, and one way of taking our democracy back is banning investor-state dispute resolution clauses in any agreement that Australia signs. That is the way we take our democracy back, that is the way we restore the sovereignty of our parliament and our legal system, and that is the way we prevent the multinational corporations of the planet from overseeing the best interests of Australian and the environment. And if we do not, we are going to see billions of taxpayers' dollars over the years being set aside in legal cases. And the culprits responsible are sitting in this parliament, pretending to be a responsible government as we speak.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:28):  Anyone who is seriously following this debate, and who heard Senator Canavan a little while ago, would appreciate that nothing the Greens have said—nothing that Senator Milne or Senator Ludlam have said—stands up to a factual assessment. A lot of people who I know follow Senator Ludlam's technical savvy in these areas; you know, he gets on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, with all the buzzwords—




Senator Ludlam:
  I am on it now!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  He is on it right now! But can I just say to you people, please carefully look at anything Senator Ludlam or Senator Milne will tell you, because history shows most everything of what they say is not supported by fact; and it is, in fact, simply lies. It is easy to pick the buzzwords. It is easy to pick the prejudices—these big US corporate giants—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Ludlam on a point of order.




Senator Ludlam:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Macdonald, you have been here for decades, if not hundreds of years. You know very well that it is unparliamentary to accuse other senators in this place or the other of lying. So I ask you to withdraw that and then carry on with your strange rant.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will let that one go. It was part of a wide-ranging debate, but I would urge caution, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  'Strange rant'—that is okay. This is the thing with the Greens political party, hypocrisy knows no bounds. Here is a party talking about 'surrendering Australia's sovereignty'. Which party would have the one-world government, to have Australia sign up and be bound by every single international treaty brought on by anyone around the globe?


You only have to look at the facts of these issues to realise that most everything you hear from people like Senator Ludlam and Senator Milne simply are not supported by truth and accuracy. Sure, pick all the prejudices: fracking, big end of town, nuclear—and the US corporate predators. Never mind any other corporate predators. US corporate predators are the real ones.


Senator Cameron made a very measured address. He clearly indicated the facts. It is obvious that no-one from the Greens political party has read the agreements that have been entered into so far. Senator Canavan quite rightly assisted those Greens members who were interested in truth and accuracy—and I am not sure there are many—on what section 18(1) of the Korean free trade agreement said. He read it out. I could repeat it, but I will not take the time of the Senate.


Australian governments, not just this government but previous governments as well, have entered into a number of interstate dispute-settlement arrangements over a number of years. In free trade and bilateral agreements we already have interstate dispute-settlement provisions in Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements. These include countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Chile, 10 ASEAN countries and New Zealand. We also have agreements with Argentina, China and the Czech Republic. I have not got to the 'big predator' US government yet that the Greens like to talk about. I am sure that is here. 


We have entered into these sorts of agreements with all these countries: Argentina, China, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Laos, Lithuania, Mexico, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uruguay and Vietnam, just to name some of them.


I will try to put a little truth and accuracy into this debate. I will indicate to the Senate the types of obligations covered by ISDS. One of them is that foreigners and locals should be given a similar treatment. How bad is that? It applies to Australians. Do we have different rules for people from other countries? Talk about xenophobia in the Greens political party! It seems to know no bounds. These agreements say that foreigners from one country should be given similar treatment to foreigners from another country—so the Chinese and their trade agreements with Australia will be treated the same as the Americans; they will be treated the same as the Hungarians; they will be treated the same as the South Africans. What sort of a problem does anyone see in that? These agreements also limit the circumstances under which expropriation can take place, and they require provision of adequate compensation. Under the Australian Constitution, if the Australian government expropriates property for good reason, it is required to pay compensation. But the Greens do not think the same should apply to other countries who have property rights in Australia which are expropriated by the federal government. It is okay to pay Australians compensation, because the government is required to under our constitution, but forget the foreigners! We will just take their property and we will not allow for any compensation. These obligations also provide for non-discriminatory treatment and for compensation in the case of armed conflict or civil strife, in any country which Australia has these arrangements with.


While the Greens political party think that this is not appropriate, a company from one country that invests in a different country should be able to freely deal with profits they make as a result of their investment. Otherwise they would not be making the investment. Most countries around the world are seeking investment in their own countries—to help their countries—but are expecting that those who invest will make profits, and will be able to take those profits home as they intended. In fact, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee yesterday had a very interesting roundtable meeting with all of the ambassadors from the Arab countries in the world. It was a great get-together, talking about two-way trade between our countries. I asked all the ambassadors to quickly run through and indicate which of their commodities or services they would like to sell more of to Australia. Some of the ambassadors responded as you would expect—more clothing, more chemicals, more olive oil—but a lot of them said, 'we want Australia to invest in our countries, and to bring Australian expertise into our countries. We know that is good for Australia; they will make profits and help employ some Australians, but we also want that because it will help our countries to develop.' And yet the Greens, by not allowing these ISDS provisions, would seek to make it difficult for Australians to take action against these countries if these countries introduced laws that expropriated Australian investments in their country without compensation. That is what this is all about.


To anyone who is following this debate: do not take anything the Greens say as accurate, but please look into it and please look at history. You will find that almost everything the Greens political party will stir you up about turns out to be absolutely incorrect, but time does not permit me to go through all of those issues.


It is hypocrisy—sheer hypocrisy—for the Greens political party to say that we are surrendering Australia's sovereignty to international corporate giants, when everything the Greens do in this parliament is all about international treaties, and about how Australia should subject itself to the dictates of all of these international bodies; the United Nations and other bodies. They do not want Australia to have a view on uranium, or climate change. They do not want Australians who, by majority, have a different view to some of the members of the international community views on climate change. They want Australia just to accept, willy-nilly, the views of these international bodies without allowing the Australian people to have their say.


The Australian people clearly share my view on the irrational accusations of the Greens about climate change. We all accept the climate is changing. I often say that once upon a time the world was covered in ice and snow, and clearly over the aeons that has changed. Once upon a time the centre of Australia was a rainforest. Clearly that has changed. Clearly climate changes. But there is no accepted evidence at the moment that man's emissions of carbon have been responsible for it. There is no evidence that there has been global warming for 20 years. In fact, the actual scientific evidence suggests otherwise. But the Greens would have Australia's sovereignty—



Senator Siewert interjecting—

  That is true. I am sorry. I can give you 50 scientists who say that.




Senator Siewert:
  What scientists?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  See, because they are not—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please address your comments through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you for that unbiased ruling, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am being attacked by members of the Greens political party. You do not pull them up.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, take your seat. Take your seat, Senator Macdonald. All I asked you was to address your comments through the chair, which you know is accepted protocol.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  If you look at the record, you will find that all of my comments are through the chair, and even my response to interjections was through the chair. Please, Mr Acting Deputy President, do your job.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, all I asked you was that you address your comments through the chair, which you know is accepted protocol. You were pointing and yelling at Senator Siewert. You can point and yell at me, but please address your comments through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I would never point or yell at the chair.




Senator Singh:
  I am on my feet, Mr Acting Deputy President.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Sorry, Senator Macdonald. Please take your seat. Senator Singh.




Senator Singh:
  I was on my feet before you.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I was on my feet.




Senator Singh:
  No, I was on my feet before you.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please take your seat. Senator Singh.




Senator Singh:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order, Senator Macdonald is reflecting on the chair, and I ask you to rule accordingly.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  As I was just saying, Senator Macdonald, please just address your comments through the chair. You understand the protocols. Let us continue the debate.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I do not need your protection against the interjections of the likes of Senator Siewert, but if you are making those rulings please be consistent. I will continue on the line that Senator Siewert does not like. Because they are not scientists that she and her group of funny people think are good scientists, they are all to be ignored. You only listen to those who repeat your mantra, Senator Siewert. There are credible scientists around the world—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You laugh, but then I laugh at your ridiculous comments, and so I accept that. But, Mr Acting Deputy President, perhaps you could help me—I address this through the chair—by stopping the consistent interjections I get from the Greens political party.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, I will ask Senator Siewert to cease the interjections and remind everyone in the chamber that interjections are disorderly.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order, I do accept your ruling; however, Senator Macdonald was speaking across the chamber directly to me, so I responded. I apologise to the chamber, but, if you could ask him therefore not to address his comments directly to me across the chamber, that means I will not interject and respond.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Siewert. I will remind Senator Macdonald: please address your comments through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The Australian government has done an absolutely fantastic job in relation to trade. It is a bit like debt, you know: people talk about trade, and they think, 'Trade's something governments do; it doesn't really impact upon us.' It is a bit like that with debt: 'Debt's just something the government will fix up; it doesn't really affect us.' Of course, what we really need is for Australians to understand that debt—and the $7 billion of debt that the Labor Party ran up—does in fact impact upon them very, very seriously. As with people's own household budget, when you borrow from a lender, some day you have to pay it back. And until you pay it back, you have to pay interest on it. But people say, 'That's the government.' Well, sorry, but the government does not have any money. The government only uses the money of taxpayers. So, it is the taxpayers who will have to pay off Labor's debt, which will approach $700 billion. And it is the taxpayers who will have to pay the $30 million a day that we are paying in interest on the Labor Party's debt—the Labor Party supported by the Greens political party. Imagine how many schools, imagine how many hospitals we could build every day with the amount we are now paying to foreign lenders on the debt run up by the Labor-Greens government.


And it is the same with trade. People think, 'Oh, trade—that's something governments do; that's good, but it doesn't really impact upon us.' Sorry: trade is very important to Australia. We are a country that is blessed with natural resources. We are blessed with fine educational institutions. We are blessed with a very energetic and innovative population. But we need to trade to be able to use those assets we have, and that means more jobs for Australians. And these free trade agreements that Andrew Robb has brilliantly concluded, in a very short period of time, mean jobs and wealth for all Australians.


I know Senator Milne is talking about how the corporate giants are ripping off all the poor people in the world. I would just remind Senator Milne that she is part of the one per cent of the world population earning a very, very high income. Yet that never seems to worry Senator Milne. It is okay for her to blame the US corporate giants and the wealthy people everywhere around the world, but I would just remind people that Senator Milne is one of those who is in the one per cent of highest-income earners in the world. And we never seem to get that recognition when we hear Senator Milne viciously attacking corporate investors into our country and indeed other countries.


Trade is important. The free trade agreements have considerably assisted Australians in their lifestyle, in their way of living and, more importantly, in their ability to be fully employed. Those free trade agreements and other trade agreements we have made with people in many instances do have these investor-state dispute settlement arrangements. They have been in place for ages. The Labor Party has entered into agreements where those conditions do apply. They apply for a reason, and that is that they are fair and they treat people equally. It does mean to say that if Australian companies invest somewhere else then those other countries will not confiscate Australian assets without the sort of compensation they would apply to their own nationals.


The Greens political party would have you believe that this means that corporations from around the world—not just America, although they are the only ones you hear about from the Greens—can dictate to Australia how Australia should legislate internally. The agreements we enter into do actually provide that matters relating to health and the environment—and Senator Canavan went into this in some detail—are not impacted by these investor-state dispute settlement arrangements. So, Australia is free to provide whatever it believes is the right legislation in relation to many issues that are clearly set out in these agreements. What they do say, though, is that if the Australian government, for all the right reasons, does confiscate property then the people whose property is confiscated, no matter which country they come from, will be treated the same way as Australian companies and Australian individuals. That is, if, for the right reasons, the government of the day confiscates property, people will be properly compensated for that confiscation. Now, what is wrong with that? I ask the Greens political party: what is wrong with that? Countries that invest in Australia and whose property is confiscated would be treated the same as Australians.


Unfortunately time has escaped me. I was going to raise the stupidity of the ban by the Labor Party and the Greens political on live cattle exports to Indonesia. That is a very good case in point, and, unfortunately, as I said, time is not going to allow me to elaborate on that. But Indonesian companies who had invested in Australia on the basis of a trade arrangement in live cattle that had been in place for decades and whose property was made worthless by a stupid decision of an Australian government should have been in some way compensated for that. But unfortunately time is not going to allow me to continue in that vein—perhaps some other time—but I would urge the Senate to reject this bill. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-12,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:51):  I rise to speak in support of this Greens legislation: the Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill 2014. The purpose of this bill is to prevent the Commonwealth from entering into an agreement with one or more foreign countries that includes particular mechanisms called investor-state dispute settlement clauses, or ISDS clauses. The inclusion of these mechanisms is one of the most insidious trends that we are seeing in modern trade deals.


I applaud Senator Whish-Wilson's great work in bringing this bill forward and encouraging debate on what has the potential not only to shape the kind of world that we bequeath to our kids and our grandkids into the future but to fundamentally undermine the rule of law and democracy itself. They are high claims to make. I am sorry that Senator Macdonald is leaving the chamber, because he invited me to answer some questions that he posed, and he obviously is not particularly interested in hearing those answers. At one point, he scoffed at the idea that Chief Justice Robert French of the High Court of Australia commented with great interest on the issues that are posed by these ISDS clauses and free trade agreements. Indeed, Chief Justice French and many others have raised significant concerns, and I will come to those in the course of my contribution today.


But let's start by asking why these ISDS clauses are so troubling. It is because these are mechanisms by which private investors—corporations who are based outside a sovereign nation with no loyalty to, interest in or concern for the citizens of that nation—can take their own action against the sovereign government of the nation and use the clauses to sue governments for huge amounts of compensation if they can show that a government policy or a change in policy has directly affected their profitability or their investment. In so doing, they can exert a huge influence and control on the laws and policies of nations irrespective of the will of the democratically elected parliaments in those nations. 


This Greens bill is designed to prevent the Australian government from entering into agreements that include these ISDS clauses, to prevent corporations outside Australia from being able to dictate to Australian governments, effectively, the kinds of laws they can and cannot make and—by extension, given that the laws and policies and governments shape the world that we live in—the kind of Australian society that we have. It is interesting, and Senator Milne made this point as well, that we hear a lot about border protection from this government but when it comes to protecting our legal borders—our legal sovereignty: the right of democratically elected governments in Australia to make laws on behalf of all of us and have those upheld by our courts—this government is a bit silent. In fact, they are highly secretive. Right now we have 12 governments, including those of Australia, the US, Japan, Canada and New Zealand, negotiating this far-reaching trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Aspects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, the TPPA, pushed by global corporate interests are seeking to radically dispose of government regulation in the name of enhanced global competition.


We have been invited by Senator Canavan to give evidence of our concerns, but the problem is that these negotiations are conducted totally in secret. So my invitation to Senator Canavan would be that if we have nothing to fear—if, in fact, these concerns that are being raised not only by the Australian Greens but throughout Australian society and internationally are not founded—then reassure us: show us the terms of the negotiations that are happening and we can all go home. In fact, this is a situation where these negotiations are in secret and, for the first time ever in trade deals, they will include discussions to get broad agreement to remove what are called unfair advantages from government state-owned enterprises and their impacts on commercial business.


One hallmark of the way these deals are negotiated is that the Australian public has no right to know what is being negotiated away in our name until the deal is done and dusted, and then it is presented to the sovereign Parliament of Australia with the only option being to vote in favour or against; there is no possibility of changing it; the deal has already been done. We see in the current negotiations for the TPPA, on the back of global corporate interests and pressure, the US government wanting to include a proposal which would allow foreign companies to sue our government and the governments under the agreement for damages if they were to adopt laws or policies that could harm the investment of these global interests. So even if they are laws and policies made in good faith on behalf of the national public interest—laws which may protect public health or the environment—there would be the capacity for outside corporations to challenge those laws and seek large amounts of compensation. That has a chilling effect on the capacity and the willingness of sovereign governments to actually govern in good faith in the interests of the national public. As my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson has already said clearly, what we have set up in these kinds of modern trade deals is a parallel system of governance which gives corporations the right and ability to impinge directly upon our ability as parliamentarians to enact legislation in the public interest—and, in the end, isn't that what we are elected to do?


These ISDS clauses have excited huge concern both nationally and internationally. Indeed, the issue has received serious consideration from many, including High Court Chief Justice Robert French, who is the most eminent judge in Australia. Chief Justice French addressed the Supreme and Federal Courts Judges' Conference in Darwin last year. He provided a very thoughtful paper, and I commend it to those who are interested in learning more about the nature and implications of these ISDS clauses. Senator Macdonald expressed disbelief that Chief Justice French may have been commenting on these issues, so I will pay him the courtesy of forwarding a copy of the paper to him, and I hope that Senator Macdonald will read that.


Chief Justice French focuses on the tensions that can exist between these ISDS mechanisms and the legitimate functions of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of governments. With respect, who would be in a better position to consider these issues in a scholarly way? He sets out the current landscape and, importantly, the implications for the rule of law in Australia. Where there is dispute about the effect of government policy or lawmaking on corporate interests under these agreements, there is a mechanism for that dispute to then go to a system of arbitration, and there have been a great number of concerns about the conduct of the arbitration bodies as they have operated previously when considering disputes under these clauses. So, effectively, if there is government policy or lawmaking and even, indeed, decisions of courts within a sovereign jurisdiction, if a third party outside that sovereign nation wants to dispute the decision, law or policy, they can then take these to an arbitration body.


Chief Justice French in his paper refers to a briefing paper prepared by the European Parliamentary Research Service in January 2014 which describes the concerns raised about the vague formulation of major treaty provisions which leave a wide range of interpretations open to the arbitrators. There is a vagueness and uncertainty in scope and application, which is always a problem in relation to the law. There are also loopholes in these agreements, which can lead to abuses such as nationality shopping by companies, which then create subsidiaries abroad specifically to take advantage of the agreements. Indeed, that is what we have seen in the Philip Morris tobacco case that has been referred to by many of the people making a contribution to this debate.


As for the conduct of the arbitration panels themselves, particular and worrying concerns have been raised. As Chief Justice French states in his paper, 


Arbitral tribunals set up under ISDS provisions are not courts. Nor are they required to act like courts. Yet their decisions may include awards which significantly impact on national economies and on regulatory systems within nation states. Questions have been raised about the consistency2, openness and impartiality of decisions made in ISDS arbitrations.


The briefing paper from the EPRS sets out some specific issues that have been raised:


lack of transparency with varying degrees of secrecy attaching to arbitral processes depending upon the institutions or rules which are applied;


a relatively small pool of arbitrators — arbitrators appointed to ISDS arbitrations are said to be mostly male—


and I guess there are no surprises there—


(95%) and from Europe and North America;


role-swapping by arbitrators who appear from time to time as counsel in ISDS cases;


so sometimes they are on one side of the bench and sometimes they are on the other—


the high cost of ISDS arbitrations — estimated by OECD as averaging about $8 million each;


associated with the high cost and potentially high awards, a growing phenomenon of third party funding of claims by banks, hedge funds and insurance companies in exchange for a share of the proceeds ranging from 20% to 50%;


So there is a little bit of a variation on the no win, no fee or, 'We'll fund it and we'll get a cut of the win,' which is always a real concern in terms of corrupting processes. There is also:


absence of effective review or appeal processes;4


inconsistency in decisions on similar provisions.


It is important to understand that this is not just a vague, theoretical concern that we are dealing with here. This is a live issue. There have already been many cases on foot. Last year the UN Conference on Trade and Development published its annual review of ISDS cases. Fifty-even new cases—these are cases brought by outside parties, by corporations, against governments—were commenced in 2013. That was just below the number in 2012, which was a record year with 62 cases. Most of the claims were brought against nation-states by investors from developed countries—again, no surprises there—and mainly by investors from the European Union and the United States.


And what sort of cases were being brought by these corporate interests? They involved challenges to a range of governmental measures, including measures relating to renewable energy. Why doesn't that surprise me? And who would be bringing those kinds of cases? There were measures allegedly affecting expropriation of assets, revocation of licences and permits, regulation of energy tariffs—energy into the future and the profits that are to be made there is a big one, isn't it—wrongful criminal prosecutions, land zoning decisions, invalidation of patents and sovereign bonds legislations.


As I said, many would be aware of the Philip Morris case where the Australian High Court upheld the validity of legislation made by the Australian parliament to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products. The challenge was brought by a company supported by Philip Morris Ltd to the Australian High Court, but the legislation was upheld. Four months before commencing the action in the High Court, Philip Morris Asia Ltd moved to acquire an interest in Philip Morris Australia so that it then had an interest in this subsidiary. I quote from the Chief Justice French's paper:


That acquisition is said to have reflected a tactic used by private investors seeking to take advantage of bilateral investment treaties and is known as either 'nationality planning' or 'treaty shopping'. It appears to have been related to the existence of a bilateral investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia.


That was a treaty from 1993 which included an ISDS clause. On the basis of that clause Philip Morris is challenging the Australian government for compensation on the basis of the plain packaging laws. We will be interested in seeing what occurs there.


The Australian Greens are significantly concerned that these sorts of clauses and the actions they allow corporations to take against the Australian government and state governments have the potential to shape the kind of world we are going to be leaving to our kids and grandkids. To bring that home and illustrate why I am concerned I am going to tell you about a visit I had last Sunday when I travelled to an area near Mount Gambier in the south-east of South Australia. I attended a celebration there which was a declaration by a small land area near the little town of Mil-Lel. There was a declaration by the residents of that area of their roads and their region being gas field free. Currently there are two exploratory drilling wells from Beach Energy in that area looking for the viability of shale and conventional gas mining, and there is increasing concern among the residents in that area about the risks associated with unconventional gas mining and fracking. There are real issues in that area, which is a rich area of agriculture, wine-growing, cropping and tourism. Also there is a very limited water supply in that area. There is a great deal of concern by the residents that unconventional gas mining will actually destroy the viability of the population, not just the economic viability, but in fact their ability to live there in a healthy way.


I went there and I was absolutely delighted to see proud citizens walking up and handing to the mayor of the District Council of Grant their scrolls—street by street, road by road—and saying, 'We do not accept that there will be unconventional gas mining in our area. We are saying that we are putting faith in the water and food supplies that we need to protect our kids and our grandkids.' When I saw that I felt that there was a strong vote of confidence in what is a real democracy, which is requiring decision-makers to make decisions that are in the interests of all people, not just in the interests of those who have power and influence and who are only interested in making short-term profits.


It is very clear that the ISDS clauses in these free trade agreements, and which will potentially be in the Pacific trade agreement, have the potential to stop our governments from legislating democratically in response to community concerns about environmental issues like mining for conventional gas. There are clear precedents for this kind of action by foreign corporations against governments when they are making law and policy that affects, for instance, energy—and that is what we are talking about here. We are talking about moving away from reliance on fossil fuels to having other sources of clean green energy like renewable energy, like solar and wind and so on.


There is an example in Quebec at the moment where, under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, there was an ISDS clause. On the basis of that clause Lone Pine Resources, an energy company, is currently suing the government of Quebec for $250 million because it had the temerity to suspend shale gas mining while awaiting the outcome of an environmental study into the dangers of that mining. The suspension was brought about because of pressure from the community to examine the health and environmental impacts of that mining. The government response to the community pressure was democracy in action, and we have a large corporation currently suing the Quebec government to chill that decision in the sum of $250 million.


So in the south-east we have, at the moment, an inquiry from the South Australian state parliament into fracking in that area which was initiated by my Greens colleague, the leader of the Australian Greens in the South Australian parliament Mark Parnell MLC. What happens if there is a decision by the state government in responding to the findings of that inquiry, hypothetically speaking, that they were to decide that there should be a moratorium on fracking in the south-east? If we are subject to these sort of ISDS clauses in agreements, which the Australian government has entered into, there is every possibility that an organisation could then take action against the state government for compensation to prevent that sort of decision being made.


We are at a point in history where it is absolutely vital that people's perception that governments are only governing for the rich, the influential and the powerful is changed. There is increasing disillusionment, and I know that everybody in this chamber will be aware of it. When you go and talk to voters, people do not have faith that we are actually fulfilling the trust for which we have been elected, and that is to govern in the interests of all. This is a point in history where we must defend our democracy, and that has to start from the grassroots up. It has to start with respect for the people and for the national interest. Australian governments voluntarily surrendering sovereignty over the policy and the law that we make in this parliament is not only foolish and irresponsible but highly dangerous for the future health and welfare of this nation. But, fundamentally, I believe it is highly dangerous to this nation in being able to remain a viable democracy where our populace has faith in the decisions that we are making. If we lose that I do not know what we will have left. I urge the Senate to support the bill. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:11):  I rise to explain to the chamber and to the wider community why I oppose the Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill of 2014. I read from the explanatory memorandum as supplied by our colleague Senator Whish-Wilson:


The purpose of this Bill is to prevent the Commonwealth from entering into an agreement with one or one more foreign countries that includes investor-state dispute settlement provisions.


Now, I have to say at the outset that I have a lot of respect for Senator Whish-Wilson. He was well educated at Guildford Grammar School, as I understand, in Western Australia. He studied at university in Western Australia, and he has a good, sound understanding of economics and commerce. He has worked in the stock exchanges, as I understand, in Western Australia, in Hong Kong, in New York and in Sydney. So, Senator Whish-Wilson has a very, very good understanding of the world of commerce and particularly the world of international trade.


Senator Whish-Wilson also understands that, in a country that has the land mass of continental USA and the population of New York City, the high level of per capita income, wealth and socioeconomics in this country, indeed, is due to our exporting capacity. We are not like America; we cannot consume the majority of what we produce. We are not like China, which, of course, also can consume. We must rely on exports, we must rely on the inflow of capital, we must rely on the rule of law, and we must, of course, rely on being important players on the world stage. I say again, that section 3 of the explanatory memorandum sets out that the intention of the bill is to prevent the Commonwealth from entering into agreements with foreign countries that include investor-state dispute settlement clauses. How harsh would this be for our little country of 23 million people if we were denied access to the export markets of the world upon which we have relied for so long, which we will need to rely on in the future to sustain the economic wealth and wellbeing of all of our citizens and, indeed, to improve the wellbeing and the socioeconomic conditions of those in our neighbouring and trading regions—Asia, Africa, India and, of course, Central America and Latin American?


It is interesting that in his second reading speech Senator Whish-Wilson draws attention to the fact that the Australian government is currently being sued under the ISDS clauses as a result of a legislative decision the previous government took to require cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging. That is a 1993 agreement; it is 22 years old. Surely everybody in this place realises that we have moved on from the quality of legislation that is 22 years old. I also remind the chamber that this is not yet a settled matter. It is not yet a matter that has had any sort of resolution or judgment. I share concerns. We sat in the committee together. I share the concerns of academics and others. I also share the concerns expressed by the Chief Justice, a fine Western Australian jurist, Robert French. But, at the same time, the role of government is to balance these inputs and to arrive at decisions that are in the best interests of our country, and I want to spell some of those out.


I want to point out, if I may in the time that is available to me, where some of the pitfalls would come if, indeed, we were to pass legislation that prevents the Commonwealth—it does not caution the Commonwealth or give the Commonwealth any leeway in this; it prevents the Commonwealth—entering into an agreement with ISDS provisions. Of course, this blanket prohibition would completely and utterly limit our opportunity to negotiate into the future with foreign countries, be it for inputs or for exports. We could not conclude negotiations which would benefit Australian producers, consumers and investors, the broader community or, indeed, those communities in the countries with which we have such valuable trading relations, and it would impose on the Commonwealth a significant limitation on the ability to pursue our broader trade and investment objectives.


We have spent a lot of time in the last few days, as we have in the last couple of years, in this place debating how we are going to sustain and improve the socioeconomic wellbeing of our country—how we are going to be able to meet the social demands that are so eloquently debated in this place. But, Mr Acting Deputy President, you know that, as Senator Fifield said so well the other day, if the economic agenda and the social agenda are not in alignment, it will be to the demise of each of them. Unfortunately, what this bill, if passed, would do would be to totally limit the opportunity for our economic expansion, particularly at this time.


I feel remiss with the finance minister, Senator Cormann, here, because he is so much better versed than I am in being able to comment on the black clouds that are confronting the world at the moment as we look at what might happen with Greece defaulting or, indeed, jumping into bed with Russia—whose economic circumstances at the moment would be such that you would wonder how Russia would be able to bail Greece out of its current debt crisis. We look at other countries in Europe and the circumstances they are faced with. We have a look at the United States of America, the interest on whose debt—not the debt but the interest on their debt—is a billion dollars per working day at the moment—$250 billion they are borrowing. Senator Whish-Wilson understands this much better than I and as well as the finance minister does. To me, it all points to the fact that we must remember that we are an exporting country.


But, of course, this blanket prohibition that is proposed in the bill is inconsistent with the government's policy, which is to consider the inclusion of ISDS provisions in any free trade or other agreements on a case-by-case basis. It denies the government the opportunity to actually negotiate case by case. It says: 'No, sorry. We can't deal with China. We can't deal with Japan. We can't deal with Korea. We couldn't have dealt with Singapore. We're not allowed to deal with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because we are prevented from even participating.' Nobody in Australia wants to see that—indeed, I do not think Senator Whish-Wilson does. What we do want to see is a very cultured discussion about those elements which are sacrosanct to Australia.


I go back to the point that the 1993 provision is 22 years old. This was not being considered 22 years ago. Possibly it could have been predicted 22 years ago, but nobody is suggesting today that the sorts of agreements that we are negotiating and contemplating have not moved on and are not taking into account those environmental, health and other concerns on which we are, of course, so focused.


The bill proceeds from the view that ISDS invariably represents an unacceptable risk to the public interest and that all provisions are equally severe. We are conscious of potential risks, and I would rely on the excellence of the trade minister—leading and directing the bureaucrats in the department, who are now so well versed in the processes of international trade negotiations—and on being able to govern and to regulate in the public interest in areas such as health and the environment.


On this topic, I would be amazed if in his previous work Senator Whish-Wilson has not come across similar clients. As a businessman myself, and having in the last decade engaged in business activities in Asia, in the Middle East and on the Indian subcontinent, I know that ISDS does not just apply to ogres wanting to come into Australia. ISDS gives a level of protection to Australian industry operating overseas. This is vitally important, because we have the opportunity and indeed, in my view—particularly in the field of agribusiness, in which I spend a lot of my professional time—the compulsion to increase our business activities overseas. I for one would be saying that, in any sorts of agreements that Australia is negotiating, I would want to see our government and our trade negotiators making sure that the interests of Australian business are being protected. Indeed, if we were to prevent the Commonwealth from entering into agreements, we would be cutting off the opportunity for Australian businesses operating overseas to enjoy the protection of ISDS clauses. It is a two-way exercise; it is not just a one-way exercise.


The bill in its current form fails to recognise that agreements containing ISDS can incorporate safeguards to protect the rights of governments and the communities they represent to take decisions in the public interest. The bill suggests that this is not possible; I say that it is. In fact the recent agreement negotiated, again, by trade minister Robb leading the delegation of people who undertook it with the Republic of Korea, contained many more safeguards indeed than earlier agreements. This is how policy works. This is how democracy works. This is how government works. We should always be moving to improve what has gone before us. In the case of Korea these safeguards have been developed in response to concerns about challenges to legitimate public welfare regulation. I, for one, enjoyed the opportunity to participate in the committee and to hear the legitimate concerns of people who not only have the expertise but defend the time. Two instances in the case of Korea where we were not freezing existing policy settings were to do with intellectual property and the environment chapter; exactly the concern that Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Wright have expressed saw itself played out. Indeed, we have ISDS clauses in four existing free trade agreements and 21 bilateral investment treaties—binding obligations that have been ongoing over 25 years—and I remind those listening that we have only ever faced one claim; we are facing that now and that has not yet been tested or resolved. Not bad for a country of 23 million people that exports more than 65 per cent of its produce around the world.


Who, in fact, are the players? Of the bilateral investment treaties that we are considering, more than 90 per cent of the 2,500 in force have operated without a single investor claim. We know that the inflow of capital is vital to this country, and of course the inflow of capital reflects the claims—for Europe, it is about 50 per cent and about 47 per cent of the claims. For the United States, the next biggest player in this game from Australia's point of view, it is 24 per cent of FDI stock outflow from them and 22 per cent of the claims. It is in the resources sector—mining, oil and gas resources—where most of the claims have been made, because they are the sectors in which there is the greatest degree of state involvement, and I hope to come to Mexico in a few moments by way of illustration. The disputes have been mainly around countries with weak legal institutions—Argentina with 53 claims and Venezuela with 36 claims are the two leading respondent states. About a third of all ISDS cases are settled in advance of a ruling, and it is the case that people come to realise it is as expensive to run an ISDS claim as it is to go through the commercial legal process. We see that treaty-based investment protection represents a major advance in the fair treatment of aliens and the peaceful resolution of disputes. When you consider the alternative—withdrawal from these treaties, which is the logical conclusion should the good senator's bill be accepted—then the negative consequences for economic growth in this country and the rule of law are there for all to see.


I want to continue now in terms of what those opportunities are. We are an economy of some $1.6 trillion. The services sector contributes about 70 per cent—about $1.12 trillion—of that economic activity, but at the moment the services sector only contributes 17 per cent—$57 billion of $330 billion—towards export income. Therein lies the opportunity for this country to radically increase the contribution of the services sector to export earnings as resources earnings go down because of the decline in oil and gas prices and of course the price of iron ore and other resources. You turn and say, 'That is all well and good, Senator Back. Where are these opportunities for increasing the services sector from 17 per cent?' Imagine, Finance Minister, if the services sector expanded its export activity from 17 to 34 per cent. Do you know where the answer lies? It lies in those countries with which we have just concluded free trade agreements. When Minister Robb briefed us on the value of the Chinese free trade agreement to our country, as a person involved in agriculture and resources I was thinking, 'This is wonderful.' We already export a lot of iron ore. In fact, for your interest, we actually export 19 tonnes of iron ore per person to our overseas markets—we did that in 2014.


But Minister Robb told us that what the Chinese actually want is access to our services. They want further access, for example, to our education services. Last year our education services to China were valued at in the order of $4 billion. The value of tourism from China to this country is in excess of $1 billion. That is just those two services alone—higher education and tourism—but add in to that the opportunity for services exported for governance, for prudential regulation, for insurance purposes, and the fact that that particular free trade agreement has now guaranteed that Australian service providers will be able to construct, renovate and wholly operate Australian-owned hotels and restaurants in China. How often have we heard, 'Of course, it is all well and good—they can come here to our country, but we cannot do the same.' Under this agreement we can; but if the provisions of Senator Whish-Wilson's bill had prevailed, we could not have. Australian travel agencies and tour operators, for example, are now able to establish wholly Australian-owned subsidiaries in China for tours within China for domestic and foreign travellers. And remember: in 2014, 100 million Chinese travelled outside their country, and it is predicted that, by 2016, that will double. Another area of services that they desperately want and need from us has led to the decision under the free trade agreement that China will permit wholly-owned Australian hospitals and aged-care institutions to be established in China and run and managed by Australians. Those are just three examples, in hospitality, in tourism and in the health and hospital and aged care sectors. And, as I say, there is the value of higher education. That is for just one country. If we expand that to Japan, which also has an ageing population, there is an opportunity for expansion of our services sector.


Mention was made by previous speakers about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I was in Mexico only some three weeks ago, discussing with government officials and industry people—for example from the oil and gas sectors, the hard-rock mining area and the energy sector—the value of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, to Mexico; it has been massive. But the Mexicans said, 'We cannot wait for the inclusion of more Australian investment.' At their geological survey institution they showed me proudly the geological map of Mexico at the one in 250,000 level and noted the fact that, in those mineral-rich areas of Mexico, they have actually now mapped it at one in 50,000. They then turned to me—through you, Mr Deputy President Marshall, to Senator Whish-Wilson—and said: 'Do you know where we got that expertise from, Senator Back? We got it from Geoscience Australia, and we got it from the CSIRO.' How proud do you think I was? And when they said, 'We are now sending 50,000 of our university students away every year to learn more about energy, oil and gas,' I thought, 'What opportunities are there for Australians to get in there, in hard-rock mining, in their services sector, in their corporate governance, in their insurances and in their health sector?' Those opportunities will be open to us, but, indeed, if we were to accept the provisions of this particular bill, we would be denied them because they will have ISDS provisions.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (11:32):  The Greens' Trade and Foreign Investment (Protecting the Public Interest) Bill 2014 should be passed. Such legislation would play a critical role in protecting and enhancing our democracy, and I very warmly and strongly congratulate Senator Peter Whish-Wilson for initiating this bill before us. I speak about democracy because this really is about protecting democracy—protecting Australia as a sovereign nation, and making it harder to run down the all-important gains that society has managed over a number of decades with regard to labour standards, environmental protection and human rights—because the protection this bill would put in place would bring some balance back to the very damaging aspects of free trade and specifically the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So this bill is urgently needed.


There has been a long history in Australia of opposing some of the very damaging aspects of the push for free trade, and I would like to go into some of that history. I also want to congratulate, as well as Senator Whish-Wilson, many members of the Greens, the union movement, AFTINET, church groups, environment and human rights organisations and aid groups, because they are out there informing the public of how serious it is in terms of the secret negotiations. If the partnership—particularly with regard to the investor-state dispute settlement clauses—is put in place, that would do damage to the very fabric of our society, from our important basis of democratic institutions to so many aspects of our society that, often, we take for granted. So it is incredibly important that we deal with this.


I think it is worth reminding ourselves that a previous government, the Howard government, in 2004 did not include ISDS in that free trade agreement. I mention that because, when former Prime Minister John Howard came in, in the 1990s, his government really got their fingers burnt with what they were trying to do when they were meddling in a very similar scheme—actually, a much more extensive scheme—which large corporations were attempting to impose across the planet.


I am referring here to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. You could really say that the grandparents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and investor-state dispute settlement were the OECD and the MAI—or that the OECD gave birth to the MAI. This was a huge part of the 1990s when various very under-resourced organisations and some key hardworking activists—and, fortunately, emails were just coming into their own at that period—found out what was going on and alerted the world, and so many people rose up in opposition. That opposition was extensive and, ultimately, successful, and the Multilateral Agreement on Investment was put to bed. But now we are seeing it come back in different forms. So I think it is worth looking at what happened in the 1990s, because it is important for us to understand that this has been well debated and has been rejected, en masse, not just by Australians but by people around the world. So I did want to go into some of those aspects.


One important point was made in that debate—and I was very much part of it in the 1990s, since I was at that time the director of AID/WATCH, a non-government organisation monitoring Australia's overseas aid program, and this became a large part of our work—by Noam Chomsky. One of his arguments was that the OECD, as an organisation of rich countries, was more susceptible to direct influence by corporations; that is who they would be representing. He advocated that, when we are considering changes to trade agreements, that should come under a body such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. And there was a real in-depth analysis of how these agreements should occur.


On the side of those backing the MAI, there was a period where the Liberals and Nationals were right out in front, arguing along with the corporate world that the MAI would bring secure and stable investment conditions and regulate investment in a more uniform way. They rejected the idea that it would be a race to the bottom by saying there would be uniform conditions for corporations around the world. But, when people started get to get a hold of the documents and look at the detail, what they could see and what the world was alerted to was that it was in fact a race to the bottom because it was about developing means to erode labour conditions, erode environmental standards and erode human rights—because the power would be there to penalise governments if there were any measures that restricted the profits of the corporations.


Here is a little bit of history, because it is important that we remember that this was all done in secret. How did the world find out about it? There were some lucky breaks, there were some leaks and there were some incredibly hardworking people, mainly from organisations in low-income countries: the Third World Network, the NGO Public Citizen, Global Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Susan George, a very progressive economist at the time who was onto this. The documents were released and the analysis was done. I remember people at the time saying, 'What will kill off the multilateral agreement on investment is people knowing what it really does,' and that is what happened. The documents were analysed, the information was out there and emails started going around. Maybe it was even one of the first examples of an email campaign killing off really bad plans by the corporate world with a few backers—in Australia's case, the Liberal and National parties. I very much congratulate those people, and it was a fantastic campaign to be a part of.


I will go through how it played out in Australia. We had a Stop MAI coalition. It was huge and brought together unions, a whole number of church groups that were incredibly active, aid organisations, environment groups and human rights groups. It culminated on—and I like the date this occurred—11 November 1998 in a newspaper advertisement in The Australian signed by more than 500 organisations, setting out the concerns that we had with this whole legislation. It was important that that was put on the record because again it helped to inform more people, obviously. 


Interestingly, as the movement was growing around the world, the pressure from France was particularly significant because France was the first country to pull the plug on these negotiations and, while I cannot fully explain how the OECD works, that really did cripple the negotiations. Shortly afterwards, the Howard government pulled out of the negotiations as well. But it shows the strength of civil society here and around the world that there were so many people active in a very, very collaborative and constructive way.


Some of the points that we made in the advertisement in The Australianincluded—these are the words from the advertisement at the time: 


The Multilateral Agreement on Investment is a treaty which would give multinational corporations the standing previously only granted to nations, and a freer hand to challenge labour standards, environment protection, social justice and democratic control over all levels of government, worldwide.


It went on to say that Australia must withdraw now and not resume the negotiations in any other form. I emphasise 'not resume the negotiations in any other form', because in the 1990s we were aware of what this was all about. You could feel the momentum building around the movement of opposition. You could feel, as you can sometimes with progressive movements, that a win was in the air. The corporate world is all-powerful. They want to increase their profits; that is what they are on the planet to do. That is why the MAI could well arise in another form. And that is what we are seeing now with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and with the many other so-called free trade agreements. That is why I wanted to give emphasis to why we included that all-important phrase in the advertisement: Australia must withdraw now and not resume the negotiations in any other form. For the record, former Greens Senator Dee Margetts was one of the people who signed that ad, as well as the New South Wales Greens, a whole number of activists and heaps of organisations around the country. As I mentioned, there were about 500 in all.


That brings us to the current problems we are facing, and they are considerable. I urge senators from the other parties to look at this bill closely. There is nothing in it that serves the interests of any group, including corporations, because this form of so-called free trade with its ISDS clauses is a robber-baron form of capitalism, and, in the end, that is not good for the corporate world. Maybe they will increase their profits in the short term, but it will become destructive not just to workers, not just to the environment, not just to people's humans rights; it will bring a breakdown in how our society works. I say that most strongly because over time, over decades and, I believe, over centuries, the different protections, the different regulations and the different standards that we have passed and brought into practice—what some people try and dismiss as green tape and red tape—have come about to improve our society, a society where it is about being collective, about supporting each other. Again, yes, in the short term the corporate world might be really rapt that we have ISDS clauses and they can do all this behind closed doors and hammer governments around the world if their profits are limited. But in the long run it is not going to benefit people. Workers need to get a wage and they should be safe and able to go home at the end of the day—not maimed in some way or killed. We need an environment that is protective and that is there for future generations, not one where we have a huge burden because of the levels of pollution. All these things are interconnected, including how companies operate. So again I would urge all to look closely at this bill. 


International debate around these issues is growing enormously because there is increasing recognition that corporations have too much power over our democracies. This goes back to the starting point, and it is one of the aspects that have impressed me so much about how Senator Peter Whish-Wilson has taken forward the debate around this issue. He has made all the connections and really pinpointed how damaging this legislation would be if it were passed. It is particularly damaging because including ISDS clauses in international trade agreements tips the balance of power further in favour of the corporate world.


The working of our society is already out of balance to a great degree. We need to get back to recognising the broader public interest in terms of public health, public education, public housing—all the issues around our commons. We need to recognise how the public interest works and what we need to look after for a healthy society and for future generations. All these issues are interlinked. They are a reminder of why ISDS clauses have no place in international trade agreements.


ISDS clauses introduce potential risks to the public interest and the sovereignty of any nation. We have seen that in many recent studies. Going back to some of the experience that I gained when we were opposing the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, I remember that some of the Latin American countries had in place rules that said that if a foreign corporation was going to operate in their country the company would be required to employ so many local workers. It was realised that it would be impossible to maintain such a position under the Multilateral Agreement on Investment and that it would limit the rights of countries in improving their conditions. That is how we know of the risks associated with ISDS.


I have mentioned the growing opposition to this form of trade agreement. I would urge senators to look closely at that opposition. Over 100 academic experts to the European Commission inquiry into ISDS found that the many risks that ISDS clauses impose on the public interest cannot be managed simply by having certain safeguards for certain sections of these trade agreements. You cannot put the ISDS clauses and then establish safeguards. That is just a con job to try to make out that something is being done. It cannot be effective. It cannot remove the extraordinary extent of the damage. We must not even go there in the first place. We know that the government proposed safeguards in its deals, such as the Korean free trade agreement. That is not satisfactory. We cannot solve the problem in that way.


Returning to the study by the academic experts to the European Commission, the so-called extensive safeguards were rejected most decisively by those academics as being inadequate. We think that is where considerable attention needs to be paid.


I would like to pay tribute to the many groups who are working on this campaign. One of the leading organisations in Australia is AFTINET, the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network, which has taken up this issue for well over a decade, examining the free trade agreements that have come forward, coming down to parliament, briefing people and putting material out there. Pat Ranald, who is the convenor of AFTINET, in talking about ISDS clauses, stated that they give:


… additional rights to foreign investors to challenge domestic laws which may be made as part of protecting or advancing human rights or environmental sustainability. Those are the kinds of examples that we cite in our submission. So our worry is that ISDS has the potential to undermine or challenge domestic law which seeks to protect those broad principles of human rights and environmental sustainability.


That has very much been a theme of the comments that I have shared with senators today, that the degree of destruction that ISDS would bring to the very fabric of our legal protections, the fabric of so many standards that have been established, goes to the heart of the democratic process. If you have a corporate power that is structured in such a way as to be higher, greater, than parliaments or governments then clearly it is a challenge to democracy. That is why we Greens are giving so much emphasis to this and why so much of civil society in Australia has examined this and is alerting people to these problems.


I do believe that this is a time when we need to take the strongest stand. It is informative that Justice French has written a very substantial paper about this in which he goes into this issue in detail. I understand that some of the senators from other parties may not be willing to take on board what the Greens are saying, but I want to emphasise that this is much wider than ourselves. I would very much urge that you read the very detailed paper that Justice French wrote, because he raises the very critical aspects of the lack of transparency involved. As I mentioned in relation to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, it was because of some incredibly hard work, some good breaks, some leaks, that word was able to spread about the damage it would do. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement also is highly secretive, but some excellent work has been done by Civil Society and  by Senator Peter Whish-Wilson to get the word out. Justice French adds to this all-important work, particularly in identifying issues around the lack of transparency. You see that this is a recurring theme when you start to examine what is going on. When something is as secretive as this, one has to ask why that is. The answer is because those who are involved know that it will be deeply unpopular, that if people understand the detail the opposition to it will start growing and will apply more pressure. My guess is that they probably remember what happened in the 1990s, probably many of them were around then. They learnt from their side of politics wanting to serve the corporate interests how to manage the debate around this. Again, they have tried to keep it secret. Senator Peter Whish-Wilson is to be congratulated. This bill is excellent and it should be passed.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! A remarkable convergence of the clocks means that time for this debate has now expired.

Proposal to refer a bill to a committee:





Name of bill:



Criminal Code Amendment (Animal Protection) Bill 2015 (to be originated in the Senate on Wednesday, 11 February 2015)

Senator BUSHBY:
  I move:


That the report be adopted.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,4,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2015-02-12,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (11:52):  I move:


That at the end of the motion, add, ""but, in respect of:


(a) the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014, the Education and Employment Legislation Committee report by 17 March 2015."".


This amendment has been circulated to the chamber. It asks for a change of date to the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014 report to 17 March 2015. In moving that amendment we just seek to have consistency in gathering all the information before this place. As we all know, yesterday this place endorsed a references committee inquiry into the impact of this legislation and the reporting date of that is 17 March. So we believe that all the available information about the background, the impact and the engagement of this very important legislation—significant legislation as we know—should be made known to the Senate at around the same time so that we then have an informed debate in this place.


Under the selection of bills process, we would have an earlier date of report for the legislation committee, which would then open up the opportunity for debate in this place on legislation before the references committee, which has terms of reference which are clearly into a range of issues around the legislation and its impact, has completed. So, on that basis, we ask for consistency of reporting date—again, so the Senate has access to all information available.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,4,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (11:54):  I speak to Senator Moore's amendment. It is the government's position that the recommendation in the Selection of Bills Committee report should stand as adopted by the Selection of Bills Committee. Of course, as all members would appreciate, the Selection of Bills Committee operates on a consensus basis. It is my understanding that when that committee met last night there was consensus between all the parties and party whips participating in that process to accept this proposal.


This, of course, is the normal type of handling of legislation before this place. We need to appreciate that the higher education bills have been before the Senate previously and that they have been subject to Senate inquiry previously, but that the government has adopted some amendments to them. We have brought them back in an amended form and therefore we welcome scrutiny. We are open to scrutiny and we are open to having appropriate inquiries into this legislation.


We are so open to scrutiny that the government yesterday was quite happy to support and see passed through the very broad terms of reference for a references inquiry that were put forward by the opposition and other senators. We are quite happy to see those inquiries take place, but the Senate needs to recognise that that is a broad references inquiry with quite wide terms of reference. This is, as proposed in the Selection of Bills Committee, the normal process for handling legislation before this Senate: the legislation is referred to a legislation committee and it is considered in a timely manner through that legislation committee.


Of course, this is a timely approach; 12 March gives ample opportunity for the exploration of evidence and reporting. We are simply talking about five days difference at the end reporting date between what Senator Moore is proposing and what the Selection of Bills Committee has adopted. But, notably, that means that of the remaining sitting days through this session there are only six sitting days after Senator Moore's date left for the carriage or dealing with of this legislation, whereas if the government's date of 12 March is adopted there are eight sitting days through which debate can happen.


And we all know that higher education debate in this place attracts an awful lot of speakers! It attracts an awful lot of participants. The second readers list tends to be extraordinarily long, and so the government, in wanting to manage properly its legislative agenda through this place, thinks that having eight days available to it is appropriate and is a sensible way to make sure that everybody who wants to give a second reading speech will have ample opportunity to do so and that everybody who then wants to participate in a committee stage should, hopefully, have ample opportunity to do so.


Of course, during the course of debate—whenever it might be instigated in those eight days, if that occurs—the references committee is due to report back, assuming it reports back on time and on the terms agreed to by the Senate yesterday. But we think it is proper that there is certainty and that the legislation itself—as against and distinct from the broader issues encompassed in the terms of reference that were adopted yesterday—is properly examined, goes through the normal processes and comes back to the Senate before that final sitting fortnight so that it can be considered through that. My understanding is that Senator McKenzie, as chair of that legislation committee, is quite happy to cooperate with the references committee to minimise any difficulties for witnesses in the lodging of submissions and appearance at hearings, to ensure that it is as seamless and smooth for participants and senators as possible. All the government is seeking to do is manage its program and its legislation in a sensible way whilst ensuring that we can have the scrutiny that all senators want for this important reform.


So I would urge the Senate to accept the Selection of Bills Committee report as presented, as agreed to at its meeting last night.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Moore be agreed to.

Under the selection of bills process, we would have an earlier date of report for the legislation committee, which would then open up the opportunity for debate in this place on legislation before the references committee, which has terms of reference which are clearly into a range of issues around the legislation and its impact, has completed. So, on that basis, we ask for consistency of reporting date—again, so the Senate has access to all information available.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (11:54):  I speak to Senator Moore's amendment. It is the government's position that the recommendation in the Selection of Bills Committee report should stand as adopted by the Selection of Bills Committee. Of course, as all members would appreciate, the Selection of Bills Committee operates on a consensus basis. It is my understanding that when that committee met last night there was consensus between all the parties and party whips participating in that process to accept this proposal.


This, of course, is the normal type of handling of legislation before this place. We need to appreciate that the higher education bills have been before the Senate previously and that they have been subject to Senate inquiry previously, but that the government has adopted some amendments to them. We have brought them back in an amended form and therefore we welcome scrutiny. We are open to scrutiny and we are open to having appropriate inquiries into this legislation.


We are so open to scrutiny that the government yesterday was quite happy to support and see passed through the very broad terms of reference for a references inquiry that were put forward by the opposition and other senators. We are quite happy to see those inquiries take place, but the Senate needs to recognise that that is a broad references inquiry with quite wide terms of reference. This is, as proposed in the Selection of Bills Committee, the normal process for handling legislation before this Senate: the legislation is referred to a legislation committee and it is considered in a timely manner through that legislation committee.


Of course, this is a timely approach; 12 March gives ample opportunity for the exploration of evidence and reporting. We are simply talking about five days difference at the end reporting date between what Senator Moore is proposing and what the Selection of Bills Committee has adopted. But, notably, that means that of the remaining sitting days through this session there are only six sitting days after Senator Moore's date left for the carriage or dealing with of this legislation, whereas if the government's date of 12 March is adopted there are eight sitting days through which debate can happen.


And we all know that higher education debate in this place attracts an awful lot of speakers! It attracts an awful lot of participants. The second readers list tends to be extraordinarily long, and so the government, in wanting to manage properly its legislative agenda through this place, thinks that having eight days available to it is appropriate and is a sensible way to make sure that everybody who wants to give a second reading speech will have ample opportunity to do so and that everybody who then wants to participate in a committee stage should, hopefully, have ample opportunity to do so.


Of course, during the course of debate—whenever it might be instigated in those eight days, if that occurs—the references committee is due to report back, assuming it reports back on time and on the terms agreed to by the Senate yesterday. But we think it is proper that there is certainty and that the legislation itself—as against and distinct from the broader issues encompassed in the terms of reference that were adopted yesterday—is properly examined, goes through the normal processes and comes back to the Senate before that final sitting fortnight so that it can be considered through that. My understanding is that Senator McKenzie, as chair of that legislation committee, is quite happy to cooperate with the references committee to minimise any difficulties for witnesses in the lodging of submissions and appearance at hearings, to ensure that it is as seamless and smooth for participants and senators as possible. All the government is seeking to do is manage its program and its legislation in a sensible way whilst ensuring that we can have the scrutiny that all senators want for this important reform.


So I would urge the Senate to accept the Selection of Bills Committee report as presented, as agreed to at its meeting last night.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Moore be agreed to.

Senator MILNE:
  I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.


I table the explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



As a Parliament, we should be striving to ensure Australians have access to the information they need to make informed consumer choices, particularly in relation to food. We should also be seeking to support Australian producers, by ensuring that consumers can clearly identify Australian made products.


This Bill seeks to achieve these aims by amending the Competition and Consumer Act by creating specific provisions for country of origin labelling requirements for food.




Public Views



This is an issue that has gained considerable public momentum since we first reviewed this legislation in the Parliament. It is a topic on which there is a clear and united public view. Whenever the question is asked, overwhelmingly Australians tell us that they want to be able to easily identify and buy Australian-grown food, and overwhelmingly they are frustrated in that desire by current country of origin labelling.


As surveys conducted by consumer group CHOICE illustrate, Australians care about knowing if their food was grown and/or manufactured in Australia. This is also reflected in Roy Morgan polling, which found that 89% of respondents indicated that it was important the food they buy is Australian, and 82% indicating that it is important that the food is packaged in Australia.


The legislation currently in place does not reflect the importance placed on accurate country of origin labelling by consumers. We should be striving to improve current practices, which is what this Bill seeks to achieve.




Current Practices are Misleading 



Unfortunately for consumers, the majority of whom do see buying Australian-made as important, identifying local products can be very difficult, with current regulations lax and sometimes misleading. Though the Food Standard Code requires the country of origin to be stated on the label, there are many loopholes easily exploited by manufacturers that ultimately confuse consumers.


For example, a product can state it is 'Made in Australia', so long as 51% of the value of the product has been 'substantially transformed' in Australia – including not just the consumable product itself, but also the packaging. In theory, a product can be completely imported, but simply mixed or packaged locally and still be labelled 'Australian Made'. Research by CHOICE highlighted that ""only 12% [of consumers] were able to accurately identify the meaning of 'Made in Australia'''.


As the Blewett Food Labelling Review highlighted, ""Consumer knowledge of and trust in the food system is conveyed and reinforced via the food label…Labels are a key communication link between food growers, manufacturers, health professionals, governments and communities."" As a Parliament, we need to ensure that this communication link is trustworthy and straightforward for consumers; that is what this legislation seeks to achieve. 




What the Bill d
oes



This Bill acts to allay concerns surrounding food labelling by making it easier for consumers to access clear, accurate information about their purchases through the creation of a simple three-tier standard of labelling for food with any form of Australian origin or processing.


In the first instance, it retains the well-established premium label of 'Product of Australia'; all the significant ingredients and processing must have occurred in Australia in order to make this claim.


For fresh unpackaged food, it also allows the use of 'Grown in Australia' as this is a clear and now well-established and understood claim.


Secondly, for food that has been manufactured in Australia, that is substantially transformed, it requires such packaged food to be labelled 'Manufactured in Australia'. This term is specified to replace 'Made in Australia' because consumer research has shown that people confuse the term 'Made in', thinking it denotes the origin of the food, not just where it was processed.


This amendment will achieve two important improvements:


it will clarify for consumers that the label is about where the food has been processed, not where the ingredients are from, and so provide a strong label identifying local manufacture to help Australians support local jobs in food processing; and


it will help prevent imported food from masquerading as Australian content by making it clear that this label only speaks to the processing, not the ingredients.


A further reform in this Bill is that it provides for the creation of regulations to provide clear guidance on the meaning of 'substantial transformation' in relation to food processing. It is clear from the evidence that understanding what qualifies as food manufacturing—that is substantial transformation—is a grey area, and some companies push the envelope in their claims.


It must be remembered that the purpose of the substantial transformation test is to reward significant investment and jobs in local food manufacturing. The system breaks down if manufacturing claims are made for much lesser and often more transient investments.


Therefore this Bill provides for a regulation to list processes that do not qualify as substantial transformation. This would significantly increase the clarity and transparency of 'Manufactured in Australia' claims, and support local food processing jobs.


It is worth noting too, that historically the companies investing in genuine food manufacturing in Australia are the most likely to also be sourcing local food for their products. To further encourage clear labelling of Australian ingredients, this Bill allows for the voluntary highlighting of local content that comprise significant ingredients—for example a chocolate might therefore be labelled ""Manufactured in Australia from Australian milk"".


This allows for the fact that there are some foods manufactured in Australia that don't use all local ingredients for the simple reason that Australia does not produce them in sufficient quantity for it to be possible—cocoa beans for making chocolate being a good example. But it does allow for local significant ingredients to be differentiated, which in turn means that consumers can reward local content and greater transparency at the cash register.


Finally the Bill establishes a third tier of labelling to deal with packaged food that does not have sufficient Australian content or processing to qualify for the other claims. At the moment these products use the least understood—by as little as 3% of Australians in fact—and most frustrating current country of origin claims, those known as 'qualified claims'—terms such as 'Made from imported and local ingredients'.


These vague catch-all statements at best confuse and frustrate consumers, and they certainly don't support informed decisions. This Bill prohibits them, and instead requires any packaged food that has some level of Australian processing or content, but that does not meet 'Product of' or 'Manufactured in' claims, to simply say ""Packaged in Australia"".


By providing three tiers of country of origin claims, this Bill offers an opportunity to greatly simplify a complex and frustrating area of food labelling. It responds specifically to years of consumer research, showing that Australians equally want to know where their food is from, and where it was processed.




Conclusion



Consumers want to make informed purchases, and they want to support Australian producers, and they want clear country of origin labelling that allows them to easily identify and choose to purchase food grown and processed in Australia. As Parliamentarians, we need to be facilitators of this process. In order for consumers to fulfil this desire, we need to make sure they have access to accurate information, and that means ensuring our food labelling laws are robust.


I believe this Bill offers a tangible step forward to improving country of origin labelling for food, one that has support from organisations representing Australian growers, local jobs in food manufacturing and information transparency for consumers.


There are no doubt further reforms we could and should consider over time. It is still difficult, for example, for some forms of local processing that support local jobs to get recognition under these proposed labelling claims—and the existing system. However, the ability to pursue further improvements should not be used as a reason to oppose the reforms this Bill offers. 


For Australian farmers and food manufacturers, this Bill is urgent. As the news continues to be filled with stories of Australian food manufactures going into administration or slashing their intake of local content, and as Australian farmers struggle to keep market share at home against a rising tide of cheap imports, it has never been more timely to help Australians identify and buy local food. It is time to act.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:43):  I rise in support of this legislation. Efforts to improve energy efficiency continue to be the fastest and cheapest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. Australians have embraced their responsibility to reduce energy consumption at home; however, there are further efficiencies to be realised in our workplaces. The Commercial Building Disclosure—CBD—scheme was initiated by the Labor government in 2010. It requires owners and operators of large commercial office buildings to audit the energy efficiency of their buildings and disclose this information to potential purchasers and leasers.


This information empowers the business community to make concerted decisions about their energy consumption, as well as better understand their associated ongoing costs. Accounts show that the commercial building sector's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is at 10 per cent of Australia's total emissions, and this figure is rising. This source of emissions must be addressed as part of our broader strategy to reduce Australia's contribution to global climate change.


I note that this amendment bill addresses issues that have been raised by key stakeholders in an attempt to reduce red tape in regard to complying with the existing legislation. However, I also know that stakeholders harbour concerns regarding this government's commitment to energy efficiency measures into the future. I call on the government to show leadership in supporting Australians to improve energy efficiency so that our community and our economy can take advantage of the opportunities that these efforts create.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:03):  Any discussions in relation to the acquisition of such an important defence capability, of necessity, need to be dealt with in a sensitive manner and not with the bull-in-a-china-shop attitude of the shadow minister for defence, Senator Conroy, whose behaviour we have seen on display at Senate estimates attacking high-level men in uniform. So let's not pretend there is any sensitivity for matters defence from the shadow minister for defence. The situation is clear. We are working through it in a methodical, purposeful manner, a manner that would be completely foreign to the shadow minister who presided over the debacle of the NBN and the Australian national overseas TV network, on which the Auditor-General had plenty to say about you, Senator Conroy.

I refer to reports of the Attorney-General's lavish, taxpayer funded dinner at a topnotch restaurant in London's Corinthia Hotel.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (14:55):  When I visited the United Kingdom in March of last year I hosted an official dinner in honour of leaders of the United Kingdom's arts community. Among the guests at that dinner, of whom there were six people not four as has been erroneously reported, at an approximate cost of $180 per head not $300 per head as has been erroneously reported, was Sir Peter Bazalgette, the Chairman of Arts Council England and Sir Jonathan Mills, the Director of the Edinburgh Festival.


You should know, Senator Sterle, that it is very common for ministers of governments—Labor and coalition—to host official receptions. The restaurant at which the reception was hosted was chosen not by me but by DFAT. It was chosen because it was the in-house restaurant of a hotel at which I was accommodated. That venue was chosen not by me but by DFAT. Senator Sterle, I inquired recently whether or not the Corinthia Hotel is the hotel of choice of the Australian High Commission in London. I was told by the acting high commissioner that, for the last three or four years, all ministers who travelled to London had been accommodated at the Corinthia Hotel. Every minister who has travelled to London, whose travel arrangements have been made by the Australian High Commission, was accommodated at the Corinthia Hotel. That was not their decision; it was the decision of the high commission.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:05):  I move:




That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.




At the end of this first week when the Prime Minister has now declared that we are in a period of good government, after 520 days of bad government, we see in the answers to the questions that we have received today the failing government that continues to trot out the same old platitudes. The 520 days of bad government simply continues at the end of this first week of the new parliamentary year.


I want to take note in particular of the response to the question from Senator Conroy to Senator Abetz. Senator Conroy asked:


Has the Prime Minister made yet another 'captain's pick' and agreed to have Australia's next submarine fleet built by Japan?


I particularly want to note this one because, for those who might not quite be aware, what we are talking about here is the largest single government project since Federation. So the scale of what we are talking about here with these submarines is nothing to be pushed to the side. We are talking about the single largest government project since Federation. In response to that question—has the Prime Minister made a captain's pick and decided to do a secret, dirty, dodgy deal behind the scenes with Japan?—we had trouble hearing, but it needs to show on the record that the response from Senator Abetz was a clear no to those of us who were here in the chamber. Senator Wong made an effort to make sure that that went on the transcript, and just in case there is a problem I want to make note of it in my response today as well. We have had an assurance now from Senator Abetz that the answer to that question is: no, the Prime Minister has not made a captain's pick. But the truth is going to come out, and that is why it is important that we get this on the record. What we have seen so far with this government is that, day after day, this is a government that says one thing and does another; a Prime Minister who has been caught on too many occasions saying one thing and doing another.


There was also Senator Conroy's supplementary question which went to the fact that we have been led to understand that the Prime Minister's department or some other department of government actually went to the trouble of preparing draft talking points—draft media releases and draft supporting documents—to make an announcement that a deal had indeed been done with Japan. But they are hiding from it; the minister said he could not confirm it and that he is going to take it on notice. It will be very interesting to get a factually accurate and truthful answer to that question, because this is a government that is running away as fast as it can from each of the promises it has made. It is revealing lie after lie, day after day, and the Australian people are absolutely awake to it.


But of all of the questions that were taken today I have to say that in my view the very worst performance was from Senator Ronaldson, who said he was 'simply unaware' of the fact that this government has slashed legal aid funding. He said, 'Yes, there is $1.3 billion going to legal services,' but a cut of $15 million has a very significant impact on the veterans that he is supposed to be representing—not just here in the chamber, but in the cabinet. To be unaware that there has been a cut to the services is an indictment on the minister's lack of awareness of the need to look after the vet community. He has been presiding during a period when they have shut down veterans' offices right across the country. Throughout New South Wales, there have been too many closures—one in particular in the seat of Robertson on the Central Coast—which has a large vet population—serving the entire population of over 300,000.



Make no mistake, while applauding the efforts of the private sector in supporting a commemoration of Anzac, this government has been slashing services for our veterans. And the most notable of those is the slashing of ADF pay, which is a great disgrace. I am very mindful of the efforts of many senators in this place to call them to redress there. This is a government that is not answering the questions that the Australian people are asking. They are not truthfully answering the questions that are being asked here in this chamber, and today we saw another performance of a government that is out of control—a government in chaos. The only method we see is their coming in every day and denying the mistakes that they have made. Senator Ronaldson's failure to look after the Defence community—those who have served our country—is on the record again today. His failure to accurately and truthfully represent what he is doing is also on the record today. (Time expired)

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Training) (15:10):  Where to begin? In the grab bag of grievance and opportunism put forward by the opposition today in a lame attempt to perform the important role of an opposition holding the government to account, I am not sure where to pick the peak. But I will start with this, Mr Deputy President Marshall: you are a Victorian senator here, as am I. Today we saw from Senator Kim Carr an attack upon the government for actually trying to deliver one of Victoria's most critical infrastructure projects—the East West Link. This government is proud to have put forward money to make sure Victoria gets its fair share of important nation-building infrastructure. This government has ensured and will seek to continue to ensure that the economic vandalism of those opposite, who seek to tear up contracts signed by the previous Victorian government to deliver this critical road project that will stop Melbourne from coming to a standstill every time a single car breaks down on the West Gate Bridge, does not continue. This government will oppose the efforts of the Victorian government in spending a billion dollars to put 7,000 people out of work—in spending a billion dollars to invoke sovereign risk and make it so that everyone in Australia, and every state and Commonwealth government, will have a risk premium built into their contracts, all because of the actions of the Labor Party.


But that is not what the Labor Party said when this project was first brought forward. In fact, Mr Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, described the East West Link as 'crucial to jobs and economic growth.' He also said Labor would not support the tearing up of contracts, just as the then state Leader of the Opposition, Daniel Andrews, said before the state election. But now that he has been elected, now that the former leader of the opposition has to kowtow to the militant CFMEU thugs in Victoria, what we have is a Labor Party that is determined to tear up a contract and try to pretend this will not invoke not only a cost for Victorians now but a significant cost into the future. Every government until this point has abided by the contracts that previous governments have signed. This government, when confronted with the mess of the National Broadband Network—that was not subject to a full cost-benefit analysis, that was running late, and that was tens of billions of dollars over budget—abided by the contracts and renegotiated them under those terms to deliver a faster broadband network to the majority of Australians.


Yet those opposite, kowtowing to the noisy Greens in the inner suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney—in this case, in particular, in Melbourne—want to deny the right of a Victorian government to effectively ever sign a contract that can be trusted again. Yesterday in the newspaper the Victorian government was threatening legislation to abrogate a contract and to abrogate the terms of that contract. The previous Victorian government was faced with debacle after debacle—in particular, the desalination plant and the myki ticketing system—but that government lived by the terms of the contracts signed by the previous government. Yet this government in Victoria—the new government—supported by those opposite, comes into this place and criticises this government for delivering Victoria's fair share of infrastructure funding—$1.5 billion to build a 22-kilometre road to relieve congestion in Melbourne. Just as the creation of the Western Ring Road and the Northern Ring Road did in Melbourne in the 1990s and 2000s, this would create massive job opportunities not only in building but by actually increasing work opportunities in what are now sometimes dormitory suburbs. There is a huge logistics business that comes out of western Melbourne now because of the western ring road. There are new manufacturing industries in northern Melbourne because of access to the ring road and the airport. Yet this opposition wants to put 7,000 people out of work and support the tearing up of contracts, despite what they said previously, which is that they would not support that. And they described this project as crucial to jobs and economic growth.


When it comes to submarines, the Labor Party cries crocodile tears, because, if they cared about ASC and if they cared about jobs in Adelaide, they would have done something rather than strip capital expenditure out of the defence budget year after year after year. That saw defence expenditure fall overall to its lowest level since before World War II. The Labor Party is nothing but opportunistic. It is crying crocodile tears for the jobs of Australians.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:15):  I have sat through numerous debates in this chamber over the last 10 years, but, jeez, you hear some beauties in here! And when I say 'beauties' I really have got my tongue in my cheek. When I hear a parliamentary secretary from Victoria use the terminology he has used around job losses, saying that Labor is 'crying crocodile tears', I actually do question the quality of some of the people in this building. If you could feign some sympathy for the terrible announcements by your government that unfortunately see thousands of Australian jobs going, Senator Ryan—through you, Mr Deputy President Marshall—it would not be so bleedingly obvious that you do not care about Australian jobs.


Senator Ryan actually used the word that I was trying to figure out. There are a lot of words that one could wrap one's tongue around to describe this Abbott government, but I will have to use Senator Ryan's word, and it is 'debacle'. And what a debacle we have seen—18 months or 520 days of debacle—in this country! And the saddest part is that as each day goes by, I think: 'Goodness me! No wonder the Australian public have turned off Australian politics!'


When the Prime Minister came in, he had a few three word slogans, like 'grown-up government' and 'no more surprises'. And one of his classics, of course, was 'Stop the boats'. A lot of us thought that 'Stop the boats' was about those poor souls who were paying some of the scum of the world, people smugglers, to bring them in to Australia, but when the Prime Minister said 'Stop the boats' I had no idea that he meant stopping building Australian boats! I had no idea that 'Stop the boats' actually referred to submarines!


I do not come from South Australia, but I have actually got it really clear: we have seen a debacle, particularly in the last few weeks. We have known that from the downfall of the previous Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston, who, when quizzed in this chamber by Senator Gallacher about Australian jobs at the Australian Submarine Corporation, in attacking Senator Gallacher uttered that infamous line: 


… I wouldn't trust them to build a canoe …


And it has just escalated from there. It is just not good enough. If the Prime Minister had—and I do not know whether he has—done a deal with the Japanese to build submarines for Australia, he should have just had the guts to come and face the Australian people and say, 'A deal is done.' But instead he wheeled out poor defenceless Senator Edwards. He is a government senator from South Australia who, I have no doubt, has compassion for Australians' jobs in his state. The Prime Minister wheeled him out, and, under the guise of getting his vote and maybe other South Australians' votes in the leadership contest last Monday, gave him some loose guarantee. Senator Edwards has been trying to defend this. And I have no doubt that Senator Edwards was told by the Prime Minister—and if I am wrong the Prime Minister can come out and defend himself—that he would allow the ASC to enter a competitive tender.


As to the word 'tender'—fine! You can wheel out all the government ministers—and I saw that shocking interview with the now Minister for Defence, Mr Andrews, in which he used the line, when being questioned down there in Adelaide, that he was the minister and he would use the words that he wanted to use, and in which he came out with this phrase 'a competitive evaluation process'. What the hell that means I have absolutely no idea! But if there are some whiz-kids out there who can explain to me how a competitive evaluation process equals a competitive tender then I am all ears—and that is no pun intended when I am having a crack at the Prime Minister!


But, with the greatest respect, and in fairness, it is not just about the jobs that we have seen lost in South Australia in submarine building and shipbuilding and manufacturing; it is also the risk we put our submariners at—not to mention the thousands and thousands of jobs that will be gone in this country, like Australian jobs in the automobile manufacturing industry.


This government, in its time in opposition, used three word slogans like 'grown-up government' and 'no more surprises'. My goodness me—I have never realised how much I have missed truck driving, because at least when you are truck driving and you are out there in the Kimberley and the Pilbara, you are meeting real Australians. I was meeting real people. I was meeting genuine people. And I cannot put any faith in there being genuine people in this government because they have not even got the intestinal fortitude to face the Australian people and say: 'Yes, we've traded off your job. We've given it to Japan.'

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:20):  If Senator Sterle had spoken to real people in the last 12 months, he would understand that real people, all Australians, wanted to get rid of the job-destroying carbon tax—the tax that sent Australian jobs overseas, including jobs in the motoring industry, under the watch of Senator Kim Carr as industry minister. If Senator Sterle had bothered to speak to any Australians in the last 12 months, he would understand that Australians liked the wealth that the mining industry brought to Australia. But the Labor Party, with their lackeys in the Greens, put in that mining tax that stopped investment in Australian industry.


I would ask Senator Sterle to have a look at the Bowen Basin. Have a look at Mackay, Bowen, Rockhampton and Townsville now. All those people who worked in the mining industry are now looking for work. All those small businesses that supported the mining industry and supported the economy of Townsville and Mackay are now struggling because of the Labor Party's indifference to the mining industry, and their continuous attacks on those who invest in Australia in mining.


If Senator Sterle had spoken to any Australians, he also would have understood that all Australians have an abhorrence of the unrestricted flow of illegal maritime arrivals into Australia. More importantly, as well as abhorrence, there is despair that so many fellow human beings lost their lives because of the Greens political party and the Australian Labor Party welcoming and supporting criminal people-smugglers, which allowed this to happen in our country.


They are just three very, very important things that this government has addressed. We have stopped the boats, we have got rid of the mining tax and we have given the mining industry a bit of support and encouragement.


On infrastructure, Mr Abbott wants to be known as the 'infrastructure Prime Minister', and I tell you he will be. As I drive the length and breadth of roads in Queensland, I am amazed—and sometimes a little bit annoyed, I might say!—by the enormous amount of work that is being done on Queensland roads, and this is happening elsewhere as well. The Northern Sydney freight corridor; the Great Northern Highway and the North West Coastal Highway in Western Australia; the Midland Highway in Tasmania; the Bruce Highway in Queensland, almost permanently under repair under this government; the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan; the Pacific Highway in New South Wales: all of these things are actually happening under the current coalition government. And that is just what is happening now. We also have plans for additional roadworks: the WestConnex, the Toowoomba second range crossing, the north-south road corridor in Adelaide—the list goes on.


But the most important thing this government has done is started the long, hard task of turning around the economy after the Labor government's financial incompetence and mismanagement. I remind listeners that, when Labor came to office, they were given $60 billion in credit, $60 billion in the bank, by the Howard Liberal government. At the end of their term, just six short years later, the Labor government had not just spent that $60 billion but run up a debt which, if it had not been corrected, would be approaching $700 billion, costing us some $30 million each and every day—which has to be borrowed—in interest payments. Imagine how many schools, hospitals and roads we could build with $30 million a day, if it had not been for the Labor-Greens alliance's wasteful trashing of the Australian economy.


So we have a big job to do but we do not resile from it. It is going to be tough, it is not going to be popular, but it is something that has to be done because that $700 billion has to be repaid by Australia. Governments themselves have no money; they only use taxpayers' money. Shame on the Australian Labor Party and their Greens allies that they could have put future Australia to that expense.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:25):  I focus today on the very disappointing answers given by Senator Ronaldson in question time. Senator Brown asked a very legitimate question of Senator Ronaldson in regard to the impact on veterans of the government's decision to cut $15 million from legal aid in last year's budget. That is an important question to ask, and it is our job as the opposition to ask such questions. I understand that, because of the chaos, dysfunction and disunity in the government, Senator Ronaldson may well been distracted this week; but the way he handled Senator Brown's question was absolutely abysmal.


First of all, he commented that he did not agree with the premise of the question. Well, that is fair enough. But he then went on to comment that he thought it was 'a very silly question'. I do not think that asking questions about the reduction of any sort of funding to support veterans—and if it is not happening he could have just said, 'No, it's not happening'—is 'silly'. Does the minister think that veterans are not worthy of legal aid? Why else would he call it 'a very silly question'?


We know there is chaos and confusion on the government side of this chamber. We have seen it all week. We know they do not talk to each other, obviously. The minister does not know what is going on in his own portfolio. He does not even appear to know which senators are from his own home state. How atrocious is that? If we talk to high-school students, between them they can usually tell us the names of the senators from their home state. Here is a senator who does not even know which state Senator Brown comes from. Actually, I am not concerned that he did not know which state Senator Brown came from; I am concerned that he did not know that she was not from his state. I find that a bit strange. I know who all the government senators from my state of Tasmania are and I find it passing strange that Senator Ronaldson does not. I am wondering what else Senator Ronaldson might have had on his mind—if there are still things going on over on that side in regard to leadership challenges that Senator Ronaldson might be focused on.


As I said, it is pretty unfortunate that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs could not have given a more satisfactory answer, because it is an issue of utmost concern. Both the New South Wales Bar Association and the Australian Bar Association have condemned the cruel and unnecessary cuts that Minister Ronaldson's government have made to legal aid. We know that these cuts have impacted on the people that Minister Ronaldson is meant to protect—that is, veterans and their families. The New South Wales Bar Association commented recently:


Veterans and their families will no longer be funded to retain private lawyers in cases where they challenge decisions of the Australian Government in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a pension or Gold Card.


They continued:


It is troubling that war veterans and their families may face the prospect of not having legal representation or legal representation of their own choice when challenging decisions of the Commonwealth in relation to pensions and the Gold Card. In these very same cases the Commonwealth is routinely represented by lawyers of its choice.


I am sure that many senators have helped constituents who have been disadvantaged by an erroneous decision made by a government department or agency—I know I have. However, removing funding for a program that helps veterans and their families—amongst many other groups, I might add—is unfair and completely unnecessary. I can just imagine a poor war widow having to take on the might of the Commonwealth government unrepresented because she cannot gain a lawyer under legal aid to fight against an erroneous decision. She should be able to gain legal representation of her own choosing to fight on her behalf. The fact that she cannot is utterly unfair. It is an extremely disappointing outcome and an entirely unnecessary situation. It was extremely disappointing answer from the minister, who should be on top of his portfolio and should be aware of what is happening. (Time expired)

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I understand that, even though she has not yet told me in detail, Senator Payne is going to make a statement to the Senate. You will be able to take note of that statement without leave. Senator Payne, you do not need leave.




Senator PAYNE:
  I rise to make a short statement in relation to the order of the Senate concerning the status of negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.


Concluding an ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement is one of the Australian government's top trade priorities. As a region-wide free trade agreement, the TPP is an opportunity to achieve new, commercially-meaningful market access for Australian goods and services exports, to strengthen investment and to further integrate the Australian economy into the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region.


The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement will be unprecedented in its scale and level of ambition. There are 12 countries that are negotiating the TPP: Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. They represent almost 40 per cent of the global economy, or around US$28 trillion. The TPP countries accounted for a third of Australia's total trade in 2012-13.


The negotiations on the TPP are now at an advanced stage. TPP leaders met on 10 November 2014 on the margins of APEC. They welcomed the significant progress made in recent months and instructed ministers and negotiators to make concluding the TPP a top priority. TPP negotiators again met in New York from 25 January to 1 February 2015 and made important progress on a range of issues, including the rules on trade in goods, intellectual property and state-owned enterprises. The TPP parties are working towards the goal of finalising the negotiations in the first quarter of 2015. This is an achievable goal if the parties can finalise market access negotiations and make the necessary decisions to resolve difficult outstanding issues on the trade rules. The next meeting of ministers and officials from TPP countries is scheduled to take place in mid-March 2015.


Australia is working hard to conclude negotiations, but will not sacrifice a comprehensive, ambitious TPP outcome in order just to obtain a quick deal. Australia's negotiating positions in the TPP have been, and continue to be, guided by consultations with stakeholders, including peak bodies, businesses and interested individuals. The Australian government commenced public domestic consultations in late 2008 and will continue to take every available opportunity to consult with stakeholders.


In accordance with the government's treaty-making process, once the TPP text is agreed by the negotiating parties it will be tabled in parliament for 20 joint sitting days to facilitate public consultations and scrutiny by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. This will be an opportunity for public and parliamentary discussion of the TPP agreement prior to binding treaty action being taken.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:40):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


The first point I would make is that this minister and this government have only come in here to make what was, frankly, an extremely short and extremely uninformative statement to this chamber because they were ordered to do so by the Senate chamber. It reminds us yet again how this government simply refuses to bring the parliament into its confidence when it comes to the priorities it has for the TPP and the conduct of those negotiations, but also, most importantly, of the government's position on key issues which will affect and which could affect Australia for better—or not.


I do welcome the statement from the minister. What I would say, again, is that we have been urging for this for some time and regrettably have had to take the step of obtaining an order of the Senate for the minister to make a statement. We believe that this government has failed to keep the parliament and the public informed of the nature and progress of its trade negotiations, and this includes in relation to the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. In fact, we have urged Minister Robb to make a full ministerial statement about these matters, which he has declined to do. It is very interesting: the government is very happy to trumpet the benefits of agreements on the basis of press releases but much less happy to tell Australians what its approach is or how it is going to treat some very difficult issues—some of which I will turn to in a moment.


The minister, in her statement, talked about some of the issues which I think Australians are entitled to more information on, because the government's approach to them could vary substantially affect our domestic regulatory arrangements: intellectual property, for example. If the government is suggesting that there might be wholesale changes—for example, to copyright law—I think it is incumbent upon the government to have a dialogue with the Australian community and this parliament about that. Is the government guaranteeing, for example, that our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will not be affected? I think the government should be up-front with Australians about the detail of that. My view is—and I say this as someone who is pro-trade—that the government should engage with the community, explaining and defending its position on these difficult issues before signing an agreement on behalf of the Australian people: it should.


I would make this point: my party, the Australian Labor Party, has had a recognition of the benefits of trade liberalisation for over 40 years. We have recognised that it can boost growth, create jobs, forge more competitive industries and give consumers greater choice and lower prices. Let's recall some of the reforms that Labor in government has made—reforms which were about opening up the Australian economy and our society to the world: bringing down the postwar tariff barriers, floating the dollar, deregulating the financial sector, pursuing multilateral trade liberalisation, initiating the APEC forum, working to bring together the G20, identifying and embracing the opportunities for Australia in the region by placing the Australia in the Asian century white paper at the centre of national debate and opposing protectionist responses to the global financial crisis both at home and abroad. We understand that global trade has contributed to significant real price reductions for Australian families. Let's recall that trade liberalisation and many other policies under the Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments have contributed to over two decades of continued economic growth, a feat no other country has achieved.


Reflexive opposition to trade agreements is not the Labor way. We will always assess proposed agreements on their merits to ensure that they are in the national interest. I do agree with those who make the very good policy point that the greatest potential benefits from trade can be delivered through the WTO and multilateral trade reform. Bilateral and regional trade agreements can be beneficial but often deliver second- or third-best outcomes. I have consistently stated that such agreements must serve as a stepping stone to stronger multilateral progress. But in the absence of substantial progress at the WTO we do take the view that the pursuit of agreements with trading partners is a legitimate task for government.


Let's turn to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As the minister referenced, 12 countries, which account for some 40 per cent of global GDP, are taking part in the TPP talks, and a high-quality, comprehensive TPP could deliver access for goods and services in countries with which we do not have existing bilateral trade agreements and it could add billions of dollars a year to the global economy. I make the point that our support for trade is not because of some ideological, neoliberal position, as some have suggested in this place. It is because we understand that access to export markets and trade are central to ensuring jobs and better wages and conditions for Australians.


A very good example of that is domestic final demand, which is essentially a measure of economic growth—GDP barring exports. If you look at what has happened to domestic final demand over the last decade, you will see that in the period post June 2012, in these last few years, we have seen quite subdued domestic demand. What that tells us is that we cannot rely only on our domestic economy to generate the economic growth needed to create jobs. I say this in the context of a government which is currently presiding over not only subdued domestic demand but also an unemployment rate at 6.4 per cent. So I say to those who have indicated a position that is anti trade, the reason the Labor Party has supported trade and continues to support trade agreements is because we want more jobs and better economic growth for Australians.


But—and this is the reason why Labor joined the TPP negotiations under the former government, and it is a very important point—notwithstanding any potential benefits, the Trans-Pacific Partnership must not do a number of things. It must not affect our ability to deliver public services. It must not undermine labour and environmental standards. It must not reduce the capacity of Australians to access affordable medicine through the PBS. It should not radically alter the existing legal balance between creators and consumers of intellectual property. That is the Labor Party's view, and in relation to investor-state dispute settlement, I again say what I have previously said: this government should not sign a Trans-Pacific Partnership which would provide foreign corporations with legal rights that are superior to the rights of domestic businesses. That is our view.


I note that the minister raised a couple of those controversial issues, which are not esoteric but potentially have implications for domestic regulatory arrangements, in her speech. But do you know what she did not do? She did not tell us what their position was. She did not tell us what the red lines are that the government is taking. She did not tell us what approach the government is going to take when it comes to issues such as intellectual property. She did not tell us whether wholesale changes to our intellectual property regime are contemplated. I think Australians have a right to know that.


Rather than arrogantly dismissing some of the concerns which have been legitimately expressed in the community about the TPP, as this government and the Minister for Trade do, by suggesting this is all about people who hate trade, perhaps the Minister for Trade could actually take people into his confidence and talk to them about what he is trying to achieve, how he is going to protect things like our PBS, how he is going to approach the issue of investor-state clauses and why an agreement would be beneficial. But they do not do that. They simply dismiss the concerns raised by anybody as being illegitimate. As somebody who is on record over many years advocating the benefits of Australia's closer engagement with the growing economies of Asia, I find it very disappointing that this government chooses not to engage, because I think it ensures that people's concern and fear is intensified. Rather than dismissing the calls for transparency—and the minister representing did it again today when she said, 'We don't want to put text forward.'—perhaps the government should go to the heart of the matter and be much more up-front with this parliament and the community about its intentions around the TPP and how it will handle some of the difficult issues and what some of the bottom lines are so there is not the sort of reaction which one can expect from some quarters. But I suspect the government will not do that.


It really does stand in stark contrast to the way the US Trade Representative engages with Congress. I saw a press release from Mike Froman, who is the US Trade Representative, about the number of meetings he has had with Congress in relation to the TPP. I cannot recall—and I will come back if I am incorrect—but I think it was over 1,000. He has had hundreds of meetings with legislators about the approach of the Obama administration to the TPP. Now the government would say that it is a different system, and it is true that it has a different constitutional set of arrangements when it comes to external treaty making. But the principle of engagement, I think, is one that could be transposed to Australia, and it would benefit the government if it did that. Instead, they are dragged kicking and screaming to provide information. The minister today, again, has given a statement less than two minutes long, with almost no information other than the talking points. Today, she answered a question on the China free trade agreement. We still have not seen anything other than the glossies and a press release in relation to that. These are important agreements, and I think Australians are entitled to more engagement by the government on these issues.


On this point of transparency, in addition to requiring a statement by the minister, the Senate order made yesterday draws to her attention an order made on 11 December 2013 requiring bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements to be tabled at least 14 days before signing. Labor's position—let's be very clear—is that parliament should see the final text of trade agreements before they are signed. We do not side with all those who call for every draft negotiated text to be placed in the public domain. As a party of government, we understand that sometimes that may not be helpful to achieving the best outcome for Australia. I have to say, as someone who has been involved in negotiations, I think only people who have never conducted negotiations between government would think it was a reasonable demand to have every draft text in the public arena. But let's not correlate the release of every draft text with greater transparency. There are other ways in which governments can ensure greater transparency in relation to their trade negotiations than being required to release every draft text that is on the table for consideration. And, in fact, if those who seek greater transparency could advocate and join with us in requiring the government to make more detailed information available, the government may not have the refuge of the obvious defence that executive governments ought not have to release every draft text of every negotiation, whether it be trade or anything else.


The fundamental core issue here is that the government is not updating this parliament and the community about progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And it is certainly not being clear with this parliament and the community about its attitude when it comes to those difficult issues on which Australians have very strong views—whether it be investor-state clauses, intellectual property arrangements or many other matters. The government should be up-front about its objectives, it should be up-front about the broad parameters it takes into trade negotiations and it should deal with some of the concerns which the community has raised. That is a common-sense proposition.


I think the government's approach to these matters of trade really demonstrates some of the deeper political problems the government is having and the attitude the government takes. I do not understand why this government thinks everything has to be a fight. I do not understand why this government thinks that it cannot actually engage with others. There is growing concern about the government's approach on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. What I would say to the government is this: your unwillingness to engage with the community is giving free rein to uninformed speculation and giving rise to greater concern, and that is not helpful. It is time this government fulfilled its responsibility to the nation by explaining its position on key issues and by listening and responding to community concerns.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-02-12,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (15:56):  I see the challenge and the disconnect with this trade agreement slightly differently to Senator Wong. I think the Australian people and other countries around the world who are also conducting large plurilateral trade agreements, such as the European Union, have seen these agreements as simply being about business deregulation. We know from leaked documents through WikiLeaks that there are 29 chapters in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. We know from these leaked documents that what is being negotiated, in secret, behind closed doors, are actually the laws of our country. Only a small component of this trade deal is actually traditional trades in goods and services in the way we understand them—in terms of looking at issues around tariffs, changes to quotas, classic trade liberalisation.


This is business deregulation in areas of significant public interest. Senator Wong has already covered some of those very sensitive issues, like IP and access to cheap and affordable medicines. We know they are on the table. The three very important words Senator Payne mentioned in both of her summaries, including today in question time, were 'difficult outstanding issues' that need to be resolved. There is a very good reason why they are difficult outstanding issues: they are very sensitive and they present significant risks to us and our economy.


As we have opened up our economy over the years, as we have liberalised our economy, we do not have much left to trade. There are the so-called sacred cows, like our IP laws, digital rights, environmental standards. In that I could include a broad range of things, such as labelling, local procurement, local content in media and the operation of state-owned enterprises. Actually, it is the first time that laws that will impact, potentially, government-owned enterprises that compete in commercial spaces have been included in a trade deal.  If we do not have carve-outs in areas like broadcasting, who knows what the future of the ABC and SBS will be under a deal like this? We are dealing with a very, very broad set of negotiations that impact just about every aspect of Australian life.


When I came to the Senate it was my understanding that we, as parliamentarians—both at a federal level and at a state level, and even at a local government level—make the laws in this country. We are elected by the people to make laws in this country—not negotiators behind closed doors or the trade minister, and not corporations or governments abroad. We make the laws in this country. So how is it that we have got ourselves in a situation where we have secret trade deals?


Senator Payne, I went to a couple of these TPP briefings. They were confidential. The media was not allowed. We got no information whatsoever on anything. We got very similar summaries to what you just gave. They were hardly exploratory or explanatory around the issues that were worrying people in the room. Whereas we know, factually, especially in the US, that special interests, especially business interests, have had significant ongoing access to these negotiations for a long period of time. To suggest that somehow it has been an open and transparent process is patently false. It has been a secret process.


As Senator Wong was saying, no doubt there are sensitivities to releasing this information. But this is where I think the disconnect is. If this was not just about business deregulation, if this was also about how the exchange of goods and services could be a force for good in our society, I do not think there would be opposition to trade deals. That is the difference between those who advocate for fair trade and those who advocate for free trade. This is an absolutely critical point to my party, the Greens, and our philosophy around trade deals.


If you are negotiating business access and deregulation and negotiating exporting and importing investment across borders, given that just about every environmental problem and social problem that we have in Australia, in this region and internationally is the result of a business decision, what better time to deal with environmental issues, labour standards and other key areas of public importance than during those trade deals?


This is not a fantasy. I have had a couple of productive meetings with the US consulate on the TPPA over the last few years. They said to me, 'Senator, you are going to support this deal because it is going to be good for the environment. It is going to be good for improving labour standards in the region.' There have been discussions and papers published in the US about binding agreements amongst the countries in the TPP on sustainable fishing practices, species and biodiversity loss, deforestation and emissions schemes in the region. But we have seen in the leaked chapter on the environment that there is nothing of the sort. There is not only no binding or enforceable agreements; there is weak language that we know our government has helped rewrite so that there is no action at all on environmental issues. Economic problems are environmental problems and vice versa. These are, contrary to what Senator Cormann said in estimates, the right opportunities to fix this and get this right.


I had dinner last night at ANU with some very interesting academics and this is a topic that we discussed. One international expert who studies international law said, 'These kind of agreements could also be very useful when we are dealing with businesses behind closed doors to get agreements on information sharing around tax avoidance and profit shifting.' That is an issue that we have discussed in this chamber very recently, and the Senate is going to be looking into it. Why is it that it is only about business deregulation, companies making more profits and us removing barriers to the free exchange of goods and services?


This is why I think the Australian public is deeply suspicious of deals like this and why they rightly raise concerns over the lack of transparency and the influence of large, powerful corporations over governments, not only our government. They are writing our laws behind closed doors. We in this building have a right to know. We supported Senator Wong's order for the production of documents to have the TPP released 14 days before it is signed by cabinet. We would have preferred for that to be released much earlier but at least this is much better than having it signed by cabinet and sent to JSCOT. We can look at it and we can make as much commentary in the world as we want but it will make no difference at the end of the day when it gets put up for a vote. You either stand in front of a speeding train or you get out of the way. There may very well be some good things in this deal. But at the moment we know nothing about it except what we have seen from leaked chapters, and what we know is of significant concern. I would say to Senator Payne that, if you want the Australian public to back your trade deals and you have nothing to hide, release the details.


Australians are also suspicious because trade deals are always overpromised and they always underdeliver, especially our bilateral trade deals. We have recently seen a very good report released by ANU about essentially what a load of rubbish our free trade deal with the US has been. What has it achieved for this economy? The Productivity Commission has talked about this. Even the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry raised valid questions about the benefits of bilateral trade deals. We have so many of them, you have to wonder whether this is a political exercise to get headlines and to act as a distraction from domestic issues.


Something was made very clear during Prime Minister Tony Abbott's address in reply to the Governor-General's speech. I think it was in the second paragraph of that speech when he said, 'This government will be remembered for its free trade deals.' As Senator Payne said, this was a trifecta of trade deals. Well, I do not think the Australian people are going to be kind, because with potential benefits also come potential costs.


It is time to end the secrecy. It is time for the Australian parliament to do its job in making laws and look at this now, before it is too late, before it is signed and before this entire region is locked into an agreement that allows union officials and organisers in Vietnam to be locked up and that allows human rights abuses in countries, like Brunei, that we are going to be trading with, not to mention enormous environmental degradation problems across the South-East Asian region—when all it will seem that we care about are profits and businesses. Trade theory says that that brings benefits to our countries and that those who lose—and, invariably, there are losers, like the car industry, which got sold down the river—are somehow compensated by the winners. That is what a textbook will tell you. But what happens when those winners actually do not live in Australia but are multinational companies operating out of here? In the real world, the losers are not compensated. There are always costs to these deals, but the government never highlights those. It always oversells and always under-delivers.


It is time to be honest. Release the TPP text or at least consider Labor's order for the production of documents to release it 14 days before it is signed, as a sign of good faith to the Australian people that you will allow scrutiny of this document before it is signed and before the media spin machine gets in action. If I as a senator or I as a citizen of this country raise a valid concern about changes to patent lengths on pharmaceuticals, suddenly I am anti-jobs or I am anti-economics—I am down at the bottom of the garden with the fairies. I am raising very real, serious issues here that are live and being raised all around the world. So, Senator Payne, through you, Chair, I ask once again that you at least consider releasing this text or, if you do not, give the Australian public a good reason why not.


Question agreed to.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Human Services) (15:36):  I seek leave to make a short statement to the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Is leave granted?




Senator Wong:
  Mr Deputy President, I just want to clarify with you whether, if I grant leave, I will have the capacity without seeking leave pursuant to the order to—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I understand that, even though she has not yet told me in detail, Senator Payne is going to make a statement to the Senate. You will be able to take note of that statement without leave. Senator Payne, you do not need leave.




Senator PAYNE:
  I rise to make a short statement in relation to the order of the Senate concerning the status of negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.


Concluding an ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement is one of the Australian government's top trade priorities. As a region-wide free trade agreement, the TPP is an opportunity to achieve new, commercially-meaningful market access for Australian goods and services exports, to strengthen investment and to further integrate the Australian economy into the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region.


The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement will be unprecedented in its scale and level of ambition. There are 12 countries that are negotiating the TPP: Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. They represent almost 40 per cent of the global economy, or around US$28 trillion. The TPP countries accounted for a third of Australia's total trade in 2012-13.


The negotiations on the TPP are now at an advanced stage. TPP leaders met on 10 November 2014 on the margins of APEC. They welcomed the significant progress made in recent months and instructed ministers and negotiators to make concluding the TPP a top priority. TPP negotiators again met in New York from 25 January to 1 February 2015 and made important progress on a range of issues, including the rules on trade in goods, intellectual property and state-owned enterprises. The TPP parties are working towards the goal of finalising the negotiations in the first quarter of 2015. This is an achievable goal if the parties can finalise market access negotiations and make the necessary decisions to resolve difficult outstanding issues on the trade rules. The next meeting of ministers and officials from TPP countries is scheduled to take place in mid-March 2015.


Australia is working hard to conclude negotiations, but will not sacrifice a comprehensive, ambitious TPP outcome in order just to obtain a quick deal. Australia's negotiating positions in the TPP have been, and continue to be, guided by consultations with stakeholders, including peak bodies, businesses and interested individuals. The Australian government commenced public domestic consultations in late 2008 and will continue to take every available opportunity to consult with stakeholders.


In accordance with the government's treaty-making process, once the TPP text is agreed by the negotiating parties it will be tabled in parliament for 20 joint sitting days to facilitate public consultations and scrutiny by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. This will be an opportunity for public and parliamentary discussion of the TPP agreement prior to binding treaty action being taken.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2015-02-12,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:40):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


The first point I would make is that this minister and this government have only come in here to make what was, frankly, an extremely short and extremely uninformative statement to this chamber because they were ordered to do so by the Senate chamber. It reminds us yet again how this government simply refuses to bring the parliament into its confidence when it comes to the priorities it has for the TPP and the conduct of those negotiations, but also, most importantly, of the government's position on key issues which will affect and which could affect Australia for better—or not.


I do welcome the statement from the minister. What I would say, again, is that we have been urging for this for some time and regrettably have had to take the step of obtaining an order of the Senate for the minister to make a statement. We believe that this government has failed to keep the parliament and the public informed of the nature and progress of its trade negotiations, and this includes in relation to the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. In fact, we have urged Minister Robb to make a full ministerial statement about these matters, which he has declined to do. It is very interesting: the government is very happy to trumpet the benefits of agreements on the basis of press releases but much less happy to tell Australians what its approach is or how it is going to treat some very difficult issues—some of which I will turn to in a moment.


The minister, in her statement, talked about some of the issues which I think Australians are entitled to more information on, because the government's approach to them could vary substantially affect our domestic regulatory arrangements: intellectual property, for example. If the government is suggesting that there might be wholesale changes—for example, to copyright law—I think it is incumbent upon the government to have a dialogue with the Australian community and this parliament about that. Is the government guaranteeing, for example, that our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will not be affected? I think the government should be up-front with Australians about the detail of that. My view is—and I say this as someone who is pro-trade—that the government should engage with the community, explaining and defending its position on these difficult issues before signing an agreement on behalf of the Australian people: it should.


I would make this point: my party, the Australian Labor Party, has had a recognition of the benefits of trade liberalisation for over 40 years. We have recognised that it can boost growth, create jobs, forge more competitive industries and give consumers greater choice and lower prices. Let's recall some of the reforms that Labor in government has made—reforms which were about opening up the Australian economy and our society to the world: bringing down the postwar tariff barriers, floating the dollar, deregulating the financial sector, pursuing multilateral trade liberalisation, initiating the APEC forum, working to bring together the G20, identifying and embracing the opportunities for Australia in the region by placing the Australia in the Asian century white paper at the centre of national debate and opposing protectionist responses to the global financial crisis both at home and abroad. We understand that global trade has contributed to significant real price reductions for Australian families. Let's recall that trade liberalisation and many other policies under the Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments have contributed to over two decades of continued economic growth, a feat no other country has achieved.

I make the point that our support for trade is not because of some ideological, neoliberal position, as some have suggested in this place. It is because we understand that access to export markets and trade are central to ensuring jobs and better wages and conditions for Australians.

In that I could include a broad range of things, such as labelling, local procurement, local content in media and the operation of state-owned enterprises. Actually, it is the first time that laws that will impact, potentially, government-owned enterprises that compete in commercial spaces have been included in a trade deal.  If we do not have carve-outs in areas like broadcasting, who knows what the future of the ABC and SBS will be under a deal like this? We are dealing with a very, very broad set of negotiations that impact just about every aspect of Australian life.


When I came to the Senate it was my understanding that we, as parliamentarians—both at a federal level and at a state level, and even at a local government level—make the laws in this country. We are elected by the people to make laws in this country—not negotiators behind closed doors or the trade minister, and not corporations or governments abroad. We make the laws in this country. So how is it that we have got ourselves in a situation where we have secret trade deals?


Senator Payne, I went to a couple of these TPP briefings. They were confidential. The media was not allowed. We got no information whatsoever on anything. We got very similar summaries to what you just gave. They were hardly exploratory or explanatory around the issues that were worrying people in the room. Whereas we know, factually, especially in the US, that special interests, especially business interests, have had significant ongoing access to these negotiations for a long period of time. To suggest that somehow it has been an open and transparent process is patently false. It has been a secret process.


As Senator Wong was saying, no doubt there are sensitivities to releasing this information. But this is where I think the disconnect is. If this was not just about business deregulation, if this was also about how the exchange of goods and services could be a force for good in our society, I do not think there would be opposition to trade deals. That is the difference between those who advocate for fair trade and those who advocate for free trade. This is an absolutely critical point to my party, the Greens, and our philosophy around trade deals.


If you are negotiating business access and deregulation and negotiating exporting and importing investment across borders, given that just about every environmental problem and social problem that we have in Australia, in this region and internationally is the result of a business decision, what better time to deal with environmental issues, labour standards and other key areas of public importance than during those trade deals?


This is not a fantasy. I have had a couple of productive meetings with the US consulate on the TPPA over the last few years. They said to me, 'Senator, you are going to support this deal because it is going to be good for the environment. It is going to be good for improving labour standards in the region.' There have been discussions and papers published in the US about binding agreements amongst the countries in the TPP on sustainable fishing practices, species and biodiversity loss, deforestation and emissions schemes in the region. But we have seen in the leaked chapter on the environment that there is nothing of the sort. There is not only no binding or enforceable agreements; there is weak language that we know our government has helped rewrite so that there is no action at all on environmental issues. Economic problems are environmental problems and vice versa. These are, contrary to what Senator Cormann said in estimates, the right opportunities to fix this and get this right.


I had dinner last night at ANU with some very interesting academics and this is a topic that we discussed. One international expert who studies international law said, 'These kind of agreements could also be very useful when we are dealing with businesses behind closed doors to get agreements on information sharing around tax avoidance and profit shifting.' That is an issue that we have discussed in this chamber very recently, and the Senate is going to be looking into it. Why is it that it is only about business deregulation, companies making more profits and us removing barriers to the free exchange of goods and services?


This is why I think the Australian public is deeply suspicious of deals like this and why they rightly raise concerns over the lack of transparency and the influence of large, powerful corporations over governments, not only our government. They are writing our laws behind closed doors. We in this building have a right to know. We supported Senator Wong's order for the production of documents to have the TPP released 14 days before it is signed by cabinet. We would have preferred for that to be released much earlier but at least this is much better than having it signed by cabinet and sent to JSCOT. We can look at it and we can make as much commentary in the world as we want but it will make no difference at the end of the day when it gets put up for a vote. You either stand in front of a speeding train or you get out of the way. There may very well be some good things in this deal. But at the moment we know nothing about it except what we have seen from leaked chapters, and what we know is of significant concern. I would say to Senator Payne that, if you want the Australian public to back your trade deals and you have nothing to hide, release the details.


Australians are also suspicious because trade deals are always overpromised and they always underdeliver, especially our bilateral trade deals. We have recently seen a very good report released by ANU about essentially what a load of rubbish our free trade deal with the US has been. What has it achieved for this economy? The Productivity Commission has talked about this. Even the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry raised valid questions about the benefits of bilateral trade deals. We have so many of them, you have to wonder whether this is a political exercise to get headlines and to act as a distraction from domestic issues.


Something was made very clear during Prime Minister Tony Abbott's address in reply to the Governor-General's speech. I think it was in the second paragraph of that speech when he said, 'This government will be remembered for its free trade deals.' As Senator Payne said, this was a trifecta of trade deals. Well, I do not think the Australian people are going to be kind, because with potential benefits also come potential costs.


It is time to end the secrecy. It is time for the Australian parliament to do its job in making laws and look at this now, before it is too late, before it is signed and before this entire region is locked into an agreement that allows union officials and organisers in Vietnam to be locked up and that allows human rights abuses in countries, like Brunei, that we are going to be trading with, not to mention enormous environmental degradation problems across the South-East Asian region—when all it will seem that we care about are profits and businesses. Trade theory says that that brings benefits to our countries and that those who lose—and, invariably, there are losers, like the car industry, which got sold down the river—are somehow compensated by the winners. That is what a textbook will tell you. But what happens when those winners actually do not live in Australia but are multinational companies operating out of here? In the real world, the losers are not compensated. There are always costs to these deals, but the government never highlights those. It always oversells and always under-delivers.


It is time to be honest. Release the TPP text or at least consider Labor's order for the production of documents to release it 14 days before it is signed, as a sign of good faith to the Australian people that you will allow scrutiny of this document before it is signed and before the media spin machine gets in action. If I as a senator or I as a citizen of this country raise a valid concern about changes to patent lengths on pharmaceuticals, suddenly I am anti-jobs or I am anti-economics—I am down at the bottom of the garden with the fairies. I am raising very real, serious issues here that are live and being raised all around the world. So, Senator Payne, through you, Chair, I ask once again that you at least consider releasing this text or, if you do not, give the Australian public a good reason why not.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:14):  At the request of Senator Moore, I move:


That the Senate condemns the Abbott Government for its litany of broken promises which are hurting low- and middle-income earners, harming the economy, damaging business and consumer confidence, costing jobs, undermining fairness, and changing Australia for the worse. 


We have seen an extraordinary first week of parliament for 2015, so I think it is appropriate that we do a summary of what has happened. The Australian people know that the Prime Minister has no vision for this country, and that has been demonstrated. What did he say? There has been a bad government for 520 days. On 9 February, my birthday, he said, 'Good government starts today.' Well, we have not seen any evidence of that thus far—it is only Thursday, and we know they are pretty slow off the mark.


This government's agenda is built on lies and broken promises. It is built on policies which are hurting low-income people—families, pensioners, students, job seekers and the homeless. If you fit into any of those categories, you are in the government's sights. That sums up this government's first budget: if you are marginalised in Australia, you will suffer under this Liberal government's agenda. The first Abbott-Hockey budget will go down in our country's history as a budget which tore away at the very fabric of what makes this country great—fairness. Fairness is what we as Australians stand for. We believe in giving people a helping hand up, not a handout.


But, since taking office, the Abbott government has launched an unprecedented attack on low- and middle-income Australians. And they are wondering why they do not have support from the Australian community. No wonder the Australian people no longer trust the Prime Minister to lead this country. It beggars belief. When you go to an election promising not to do X, Y and Z but, when you get into government, you do X, Y and Z, what do you think people are going to think? What do you think is going to happen? Your political capital has been used up. Tony Abbott's political capital has been used up. So it really does not matter whether those on the other side change the leader, choose a new prime minister, as I have said on more than one occasion this week. You can take Tony Abbott out of the Lodge, but you can never take the unfairness out of the Liberal Party.


Those opposite may not know what it is like to live from pay cheque to pay cheque, but there are millions of Australians who do. The majority of Australians live from pay cheque to pay cheque and they are hurting. I know personally of the hardship of having to depend on your pay cheque from pay to pay. I know personally what it is like to live on a disability pension. I know what it is like to get to the end of a fortnight and not have enough money to scrape together to buy a carton of milk for your children. I know what it is like. I do not talk the talk; I have actually walked the walk, and so have many others. So we have a better comprehension of what it means when they make these savage attacks on low- and middle-income families. We know what effect it is having when they change the indexation on pensioners. We know what effect that has on their daily living costs. We know what effect that is going to have when they try to go into an aged-care facility.


We know what it is like when you break your promise not to have any cuts to education. It is blatantly wrong that in the future, if the government gets its way, families will only be able to send their children to university if they can afford it, if their credit card is big enough. Otherwise, those young people are going to be burdened for decades because they cannot afford the fees. It is all very well for those on the other side to deny that there are going to be $100,000 degrees. But we know that, if you want a decent degree, that is what is going to happen. But those opposite are determined to take us down the American track. Anyone who has done any reading, anyone who watches the news, anyone who has been to the US understands what an expensive and disadvantaged society it is for low-income people and the poor. When it comes to education, that is the gateway to having a brighter future. So we should be investing more in education, not cutting it—not making it harder for those who want to go on to university, those who worked very hard to get the marks to go on to tertiary education.


And if those opposite really believed in education they would not be cutting funding to the TAFE system in this country. Going to the last election, those opposite y said that they would not cut funding to TAFE. But what did they do? They want to introduce a GP tax. GPs around the country are very hardworking, as we know, and no-one appreciates them more than I do. They are not usually politically motivated to go out and campaign against a Liberal government; they are more likely to come after our side. But what did those opposite do? They energised the GPs to mount a campaign. So it did not matter what surgery you went to, there were petitions there. When I went to see the doctor we spent the first half of the consultation talking about the gross neglect of health by those on the opposite side.


So what do we have now? We have someone who went to the last election as the Leader of the Opposition who had a really good reputation for saying no, no, no and being terribly negative. The only problem is that they have not been able to transition into government, and he has now lost the confidence of his own caucus. So the Australian people are now waiting in limbo to see when the axe will fall on Tony Abbott. It really does not matter whether it is Malcolm Turnbull or Julie Bishop who becomes the leader. Their DNA is all the same. They have all sat around the cabinet table and agreed to and supported the policy decisions they have taken and the budget they wanted to bring down in this country.


We on this side always stand up for fairness, equality and giving a helping hand to those who need it most. We know what the Treasurer would say when people like me talk about the poor and those who need a helping hand. What was the response of the Treasurer of this country when they put the fuel tax up? He said: 'Poor people don't drive cars.' Well, here is a news bulletin: they do actually drive cars. Pensioners drive cars and students trying to get an education drive cars. That statement is what those people on the other side believe is happening in our community. They are so out of touch. It is extraordinary that a Treasurer of a rich country like Australia would believe that poor people do not drive cars. Maybe he would prefer that they did not.


When they slug the pensioners, change the indexation and increase the fuel tax, they never consider the pensioners who are on such a limited income and who will have to pay more for public transport and for their heating costs. When we were in government—and it is something that I am very proud of—we gave the biggest increase in the country's history to the pensioners of our country, because we knew and recognised that they needed that. Did they need more? Is there more to be done? Of course there is, but those opposite—as usual—have slugged those who can least afford it.


Why should a family have to make a choice—that is, when they have got three or four kids, or a couple of kids, and mum and dad are sick—about who will be able to go the doctor? Then we had the unfortunate incidents where we had older Australians and pensioners concerned about—even when they did go to their doctor; if they could afford it and could find someone who would bulk-bill them—whether they would be able to afford to have their scripts filled. I had a pharmacist talking to me and relaying the concern that he had about people coming in and asking, 'Do I really need to take this medication every day? Can I just take it every other day, because I don't think I will be able to afford it?' That is outrageous. That is a blight on this government and it would be a blight on us in this place if we were to allow those things to happen.


I often talk about what is happening in my home state of Tasmania. Unfortunately, we have been doing it pretty tough over there. We do not have a really good record and, certainly, there is nothing that we can be proud of about the amount of young people who are going on to tertiary education. I know so many people—from when I went out to the University of Tasmania campus in Launceston and I spoke to the students out there—who were actually the first in their family to go on to university and have that opportunity. They said that many of them would not be able to afford to go with these changes. Why should those people with a disability who want to go on to tertiary education—to better themselves and to give themselves a brighter future—be denied the opportunity because of these changes? Why should mature-age students be disadvantaged and not be able to have that same opportunity?


The local member for the seat of Bass in my home state of Tasmania has stayed silent. He denies these things almost on a daily basis—particularly when I am in the media, I write a letter to an editor or, heaven forbid, someone else from the community questions this budget and the policies that this government has adopted and is trying to enforce onto the Australia community—and then he attacks those people who dared to raise these issues and challenge him on the direction that this government is trying to take the Australian community in.


History dictates, when it comes to the Liberals, that all Liberal governments are the same. If you go back through history, through the Howard years, through the Abbott years and further, they always have this in their DNA and they always have this on their radar: their attacks and their policies are always directed, in a negative sense, towards those who can least afford it. We know that their real friends are in the big end of town. But even the big end of town is not happy with them at the moment.


Just look at what pearl of wisdom those opposite have proposed from a public policy perspective on higher education: in an 'ideal' world, those opposite would have every student in Australia paying $100,000 or more to go to university. How out of touch are those opposite? As I have said on a number of occasions, why should prospective students and parents have to make a decision about whether all their children will be able to be afforded the opportunity to have a tertiary education or they will have to make a choice? Will we go back to the good old days, which I would say are the bad old days, of when it was usually the male who got the opportunity to go on and have an education?


Over the last 523 or 524 days, this country has been waiting for a good government to arrive. The Prime Minister of this country said on Monday that a good government was going to start and they had been a bad government up until now. We are waiting to see any evidence of a good government. Those on the other side will reflect on the former Labor government and talk about what a rabble we were, but those people have taken the cake. They are the champions of dysfunction, rabble and arrogance. They are a government of chaos and a government who are quite clearly out of touch with the Australian community. They are a government that have no direction, they have no vision and they have no policies.


You can talk about the effect of the promises that they took to the election: no cuts to education, no cuts to health and no changes to the pension. They said they would be a government of creating jobs, jobs and jobs. Well, we are seeing the numbers from today that demonstrate that, once again, they are a failure: unemployment has risen to 6.4 per cent, which is a 12-year high. This Liberal government has run business confidence into the ground. Businesses are not investing in capital, people are not investing in property and, if this government had its way, our young people would not be investing in their education.


On this side, we believe in a strong economy that delivers for all Australians and does not leave people behind. This government would divide people into the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots. That is not a country that I want to live in and I do not believe that is a type of country that Australians want to live in. Fairness, as I said before, is what makes us great. We are mates with each other and we stand together for each other. We on this side are going to stand together with those on the crossbench to ensure that this government does not get its way and that they do not implement these heartless policies and inflict more pain and hardship on the living standards of all Australians—let alone those who are the most disadvantaged in this country.


In my area of responsibility, aged care, when this government came in it had their own war, particularly concerning the dementia supplement for those with severe psychological and behavioural problems. It was not until I asked a question in February last year that it dawned on them that perhaps we ought to be keeping an eye on this expense. Then what did we see? We waited months and months for them to come up with a new policy for how we were going to help those people that are caring for those with the most severe behavioural problems. What we have now is a fly-in squadron of a policy and no-one knows how it is going to work, how the money is going to be used, what accountability there will be—but it is still not enough to help on a day to day basis those who are caring for some of the most vulnerable people in our community. It comes back to fairness—making sure that those who are the most vulnerable have the help that they need to. It is fairness by making sure that we have world's best practice when it comes to aged care—the Living Longer. Living Better package that we implemented when we were in government was a great step forward because we took with us the aged care sector. We had that support. There is still more work to be done. Now we have a new minister who has been put into this area of responsibility, and he has been put in there because they are trying to soften his image so that he has a better image when he rolls Joe Hockey and becomes the next Treasurer.


Those who believe in fairness in this country believe that there needs to be access to universal health care and education. We believe in a secure pension system. We believe we should support those people who have disabilities and those who have caring responsibilities, and those people who are looking for employment deserve the help they need to get back into the workforce. Let us not forget that those opposite are the ones who believe that if you are under 30 and cannot find a job you should go without any assistance for six months. What do they think those young people are going to do? What is that going to do to our community? We know what it is going to do—it is going to cause more mental health issues, it is going to lead to more crime in our communities and it is not going to lead to one new job or any assistance for those young people.


Let us be honest, not much is going the way of those opposite at the moment. If I were to summarise the last few weeks—or in fact the last 523 days—I would say that things have not really been going their way. But when things are not going your way you do not throw your toys out of the cot like they are doing at the moment. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Those opposite are now asking themselves what they do with Tony Abbott—they know the Australian people no longer trust them, they are not listening to them, so what do they do with him? Some have a short-term vision that Malcolm Turnbull or Julie Bishop is going to change the way the Australian people view this government. They will not, because the people know what Malcolm Turnbull was like when the was the previous leader. Those opposite know what he was like, but the backbench is desperate. They are blaming Tony Abbott, but they should be looking at themselves. They are not listening to the community; they are not out there listening to the people. If they were moving around the community, they would not be persisting with this harsh, heartless budget. That budget will not get through because those on this side and on the crossbench—those who have a social conscience—will not allow it to go through. 


It is an indictment of this government that it has been built on lies—lie after lie after lie. We say, 'Bring on your new leader when you are ready, when you have a bit of guts, but in the meantime we are going to stand and defend fairness in this country.' We will always stand for fairness and we will always speak up for those who are the most vulnerable in this community. (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:35):  The motion we are debating reads:


That the Senate condemns the Abbott Government for its litany of broken promises which are hurting low- and middle-income earners, harming the economy, damaging business and consumer confidence, costing jobs, undermining fairness, and changing Australia for the worse.


The only thing I can say is what abject hypocrisy this motion demonstrates. Australia is not in the kind of condition that I know many of the people who voted for the coalition government in 2013 would have liked it to be in is not because of the actions of the coalition government but because of the vandalistic actions of those who sit opposite. One of the things that those opposite will fail to tell you is that when they came into government in 2007 they inherited a $60 billion surplus—there was $60 billion in the bank. That surplus was there so that the Australian public could be confident that when something needed to be done, when some major infrastructure project came along—




Senator Gallacher:
  Like the GFC, or something like that?




Senator RUSTON:
  Exactly, so that when something like the GFC came along they would have some money in the bank and could put some investment back into the community. But, no, they did not do that—they basically went on a wasteful, unproductive spending spree for six years. I have no problem whatsoever with the injection of funds into productive endeavours but they injected money into the stimulus package so that people in Australia could go and buy foreign-built television sets and the like. The stimulation of that sort of retail spending really did not have any long-term benefit for the economy. It might have given a short-term sugar hit to the economy, but it did not deliver the long-term sustainable economic growth pattern that we needed to put our economy on an even keel. We got our sugar hit, but we got nothing afterwards. I am quite happy to accept that the $60 billion that was inherited by the Labor government in 2007 could have wisely been spent at a time like the GFC, because I think everybody accepts that it was a tough time for economies around the world, but we could have done so much more with that $60 billion than just throw it at pink batts and things like that.


The cold hard reality is that we basically inherited your problems. To sit here today and put a motion before the House to suggest that the Australian economy is not powering ahead because of actions of this government is absolutely ludicrous. I will just mention a few facts. As I mentioned, the Labor government converted the record surpluses of the Howard government into record deficits. Labor delivered around $2 billion worth of deficits, with $123 billion worth of deficits yet to come when they left office. They promised surpluses in 2012-2013 on over 500 separate occasions, and they did not deliver any of them. The budget legacy of Labor includes that the budget is unlikely to return to surplus within the next decade, unless of course the coalition government are allowed to put in place the budget repair measures that we took to the Australian people when we said, 'We are going to repair the budget.' I do not think anybody on the other side can doubt that we told the Australian public, as part of our promise to them when we went to the election, that we were going to repair the budget, that we were going to get the budget back into surplus and that we were going to deal with Australia's debt problem. I do not think anybody can doubt that. They can squawk all they like, but I do not think they can doubt that. 


Basically, we have a situation where, unless we take action now, the debt of the Australian nation will rise to $667 billion within the next 10 years. Just to put that into some sort context, that is $25,000 for you, for Senator Conroy, for Senator Gallacher, for Senator Birmingham, for Senator Ryan, for the clerks and for the Hansard reporters. But it will not just be for them; for your children, for my children and for everybody's child in Australia, it will be $25,000 a day. What we need to remember in this place—and what we so often forget, and sometimes the media forget to portray it like this—is that this debt is actually not the debt of the government. This is the debt of the Australian people, because the Australian people, in a sense, own their government. If we do not address the issues that we have with our debt and deficit problem, and the expanding debt and deficit problem, all we are doing is knocking the problems of today on to our children in the future because we are outspending our means at the moment—so what we are saying is that it is okay for us to spend our kids' money. 


The debt at the moment is already costing us billions of dollars in interest. I think it is about $14 billion in gross interest payments this year. That is $40 million a day. Think about what $40 million a day, or $14 billion a year, could build you. In my home state of South Australia—and Senator Gallacher will see this when we drive down North Terrace—the construction of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital is a $3 billion infrastructure project. Whether you do or you do not like where it is, it is going to be a fabulous piece of infrastructure for South Australians—$3 billion. With $14 billion of gross debt annually, we could build quite a number of hospitals; in fact, we could probably build a new hospital in every capital city. 


Have a look at the amount of money that we spend on child care in a year. The debate has obviously been around productivity in dealing with the issue of child care and getting more of our mothers back into the workforce as quickly as possible. Imagine what $14 billion a year would be able to do in that space, not just in giving the opportunity for women and mothers to get back to work but also for the productivity that it could generate. 


I think we need to contextualise the size of the problem that we are dealing with before we decide that we are going to condemn a government that is trying to deal with a legacy that I think is almost incomprehensible to the people of Australia. We often talk about small numbers—people can understand that—but once you get into these sorts of billions and we are talking about numbers the size of telephone numbers, people just cannot comprehend what this debt situation really means. To everybody who is listening, $25,000 has been stuck on your credit card because of the actions of the previous Labor government and the refusal of those opposite to allow us to address that problem.


There would have been no doubt by anybody in Australia that when we went to the election we told the people of Australia that we wanted to get rid of the carbon tax, we wanted to get rid of the mining tax, we wanted to stop the boats and we wanted to build the roads of the 21st century. I said it so many times that I almost got ready to scream myself for the amount of times I said it. The Australian public, and that includes those people who did not vote for us—the Labor voters, the Greens voters and those people who voted Independent—would all have known that that was the platform on which we sought to be the government of this country. 


When we got into this place on the first sitting day after the election in 2013, you would have thought it was reasonable for those opposite to accept the fact that those particular things that we had very clear policy positions on, that we had a mandate to undertake, would have been allowed to pass in this place. In 2007, prior to defeating the Howard Liberal government, Labor went to the election and ran a very hard campaign on Work Choices. Despite the fact that the coalition had the numbers in the Senate after that election, we allowed the passage of the repeal of the legislation surrounding Work Choices because we believed that the people of Australia had spoken and had told us, when they voted us out of government and voted the Labor Party into government, that they did not want Work Choices.  So Work Choices was dead, and we allowed it to go. 


So what happened when we got into government in 2013? When we came into this place and sought to repeal the carbon tax—because that was the No. 1 message in our election campaign—those opposite said 'No;' they were not going to let us repeal the carbon tax; they were going to stop us. So we had to wait out the nine-month hiatus between being elected to government and the Senate changing over and the crossbenchers coming in, which then denied the Labor-Greens coalition their majority in this place, to be able to rid the Australian people of the burden of the carbon tax.


So it comes down to being a responsible government. And I accept that governments have to be responsible, but oppositions have to be responsible too. On the behaviour of this opposition—in cahoots with the Greens, who should know better because they have been here long enough—to the Labor Party in particular I say: you have got to be a responsible opposition too. And do not tell us that we are not listening to the people. You are not listening to the people. The people wanted the carbon tax gone. You would not let it go. It had to be the crossbenchers who did it.


It was the same thing with the mining tax. There was no doubt that we were going to remove the mining tax. But, once again, when we came into this place, we could not get rid of it until we had a change of composition in the Senate.


It was the same thing with the boats. The Greens were probably more to blame for this one, but you voted with them. We said that we wanted to put this suite of activities and actions in place to stop the boats. But, of course, no—the Greens had to block the temporary protection visa legislation and the package of initiatives that we needed to put through to stop the boats. And I might say: when we eventually got them through, the boats actually did stop.


But it is about being a responsible parliament. A responsible parliament includes having a responsible opposition as well as having a responsible government.


All of this notwithstanding, some positive things are happening at the moment out there—things like the signing of the free trade agreements with China, Korea and Japan, and, hopefully, the negotiation of the trade agreement with India this year. These have all been amazingly positive things. And you have only got to go out to rural and regional Australia to see what a difference they have made in our primary production sector, which will now have the opportunity, over the next few years, to access these amazing growing markets—markets in which, for the first time in a very long time, Australia actually has a distance advantage. In the past, our traditional markets were Europe and the US, so we were further away than those trading countries we were seeking to compete with. But we are quite a lot closer to Asia than to anywhere else, and it is a burgeoning area.


Congratulations to the minister—and nobody could not congratulate Minister Robb, and of course Minister Robb is part of this government—on being able to achieve, in such a short period of time, these three trade agreements, and hopefully this year the fourth trade agreement, which is going to be of massive benefit to all Australians but, obviously, most particularly to those in rural and regional areas.


Another thing that has been of terrific benefit has been the deregulation agenda that this government has been putting in place. We have sought to remove the unnecessary and burdensome red tape that costs businesses and people on a daily basis.


We said that we wanted to deregulate. If you went and did a vox pop down the street and asked people, 'Would you like to have all of the regulation and compliance burden that is put on you removed unless it has a positive purpose for being there? Would you like to see it gone?' then I am sure that everybody would say, 'That would be fine.' But, no, we are actually seeing—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  Ah, I see Senator Conroy is here in the chamber today—those opposite blocking the passage of our deregulation bill in relation to communications, so that the Do Not Call Register is put in jeopardy. I would just like to say: it would be really nice if we could just deal with some of these sensible things sensibly. There are obviously going to be a number of things that we disagree on, but it seems that we disagree on many things that we do not need to disagree on, and that seems to be one of them.


But let us have a look at some of the things that have been a little more positive. I admit that some of the positive economic indicators are only just starting to show. We have a long way to go.




Senator Conroy:
  Higher unemployment.




Senator RUSTON:
  But there are a number of things that are happening at the moment. There were 200,000 more jobs created last year. That is about 585 new jobs every day. So in 2014 jobs growth was more than triple the rate in 2013.




Senator Conroy:
  Unemployment went up!




Senator RUSTON:
  So you have got to remember what you are comparing some of these things to.




Senator Conroy:
  You've got to get some new speaking notes!




Senator RUSTON:
  And, to those opposite who are interjecting—and that may not be picked up by the transcript—I say, as I said at the start of this: a lot of the blame for this, or in fact the lion's share of the blame for this, and for any of the negativity in our economy at the moment, can be landed firmly at your feet, because you are not allowing this government to get on with its economic agenda, because every time we try to do anything you try and block it. You trashed the economy—




Senator Conroy:
  Liar, liar, pants on fire!




Senator RUSTON:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, can I take a point of order in the middle of a speech?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  Senator Conroy, it might help if you would withdraw that comment.




Senator Conroy:
  Oh dear, oh dear! I withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Senator.




Senator RUSTON:
  In concluding, to allow others to participate in the debate on this ludicrous motion, I will just say that, having spent six years trashing the economy, and then having spent the last 18 months refusing to allow us to fix up the economy, and having knowingly condemned future generations to paying for the excesses of this generation, I would be very interested to see whether anybody on the other side of this chamber, when they get up to speak—because I know a number of them are going to do so—has any constructive suggestions about how we are going to turn around the debt and deficit mess that we inherited from you, so that we actually can turn around the fortunes of this nation, so that we do not condemn our children and their children to a life of paying back the debt that we have racked up on their behalf because you opposite will not allow us to fix up our debt and deficit problem.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-02-12,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:51):  I start with a frank assessment of where we are as a nation, and I think it is important to look at some of the fundamentals here. Let us start with the economy and some of the key indicators in terms of how our economy is going. If we look at last year, we had a quarterly rate of economic growth of about one per cent. Then we had the budget, that infamous budget, and the economy took a massive hit. Economic growth halved, down to about 5.6 per cent; it dropped further, by about 0.3 per cent; and it is still on the way down. Economic growth is on the way down. It is falling, rather than rising. Do not listen to the huff and bluster that you hear in this place. Look at what the Reserve Bank say about the economic outlook. They say that growth is continuing at a below-trend pace. They say that domestic demand is weak. They say that, looking towards the future, it will be below trend for somewhat longer.


Look at unemployment. In 2012, the unemployment rate was about 5.3 per cent; in 2014, it was over six per cent. That is worse than it was at the peak of the global financial crisis. Again, do not take our word for it; look at what the Reserve Bank say. They expect unemployment to get worse before it gets better. And is not just unemployment. Underemployment has been a problem for a long time. Unemployment figures do not talk about levels of underemployment. But, again, underemployment is now getting worse.


I think it is important to be honest about the role that governments can play in shaping the direction of our economy. It is a very interconnected world, and we are very much subject to the global economic tides, the ebbs and flows, that go along with that. Since the Hawke and Keating reforms of the eighties and nineties, which produced many benefits, the levers that governments have at their disposal are limited. But the one thing that governments do have some control over, the one thing that governments can influence, is a very precious, intangible commodity: confidence. That is something that governments do shape. What we have now is a crisis of confidence. There is a crisis of confidence in this government, its people and its policies, and that starts at the Prime Minister and flows down. That is the heart of the problem for this government, and it started with the budget. 


It is very clear that the crisis of confidence we are experiencing at the moment started with the budget, a budget that came as great shock to the Australian community. Despite the promises of no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to the ABC, we saw a budget that was an attack on the sick, the poor, the young and the old. It was a budget that tore up the social contract, a contract that was developed on the back of generations before us, based on the notion that we are an egalitarian country and that we look after people who are poorer than us and people who are unwell. It was a contract that said: 'This is who we are as a nation. This is what we stand for.' And the budget tore that up. It was a budget that fundamentally redefined who the Australian people were, and they did not like it. It was not just that they did not like it; they did not have confidence in the people who were telling us the direction that we needed to head in. 


We had Joe Hockey trying to defend the budget, making ridiculous statements like 'poor people don't drive cars and, if they do, they don't go very far'. He said people work for the government for six months, implying that the ordinary rate of tax for an average Australian is 50 per cent. That is nonsense, utter nonsense. He made these absurd claims that people were going to live until they were 150 and that we needed to make these sorts of cuts because, if we did not, we were going to end up like Greece—comparing the Australian economy to that of Greece. That is the sort of language that leads to a crisis of confidence.


In health care, we saw the same thing. We saw a range of policies implemented based on a lie. We had a health minister saying that Medicare was unsustainable, in the face of all of the evidence saying the opposite. We had the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report saying that growth in spending on health was lower than it had been in the past 30 years. We saw Commonwealth spending on health as a proportion of GDP actually decline. The government came up with figures like 'a 100 per cent increase in Medicare', but they forget the fact that our GDP has increased by almost that much. These are some of the most basic and deliberate misrepresentations of how our health system is performing. 


We have a good health system; we can make it better. But the government tried to implement a range of policies that attacked the very heart of our health system—that is, the principle of universality. You see, you can fund a health system in two ways. You can fund it through progressive tax so that, at the point of access, everybody is entitled to use it. That is why I have no problem with millionaires being bulk-billed. The alternative is the US model. You do not collect the tax revenue; you ask people to pay for it at the point of service. That results in a much less fair system and a much more expensive one. It is why the US spends twice what we do on health as a proportion of GDP.


I also say in the middle of this debate that what is being called 'the GP tax' is not a tax. Every time the Labor Party talk about this as a tax, they are undermining the very thing we should be doing, which is arguing for a fair tax take to fund these services. This is not a tax. It is a co-payment. It is a user-pays model and it dismantles the very core of what Medicare is, and that is a universal system of health insurance. Again, it was not just about the co-payment policy; it was about the way it was implemented. We had version 1, version 2 and then version 3, and today, I understand, version 4 is on the table but it is not on the table. Of two different members of the government, one is suggesting it is on again and the other that it is off again. I do not know—I genuinely do not know—whether the co-payment is still government policy. It is no wonder the former health minister has been voted the worst health minister of all time.


Education is no different. We have the spectre now of $100,000 degrees. We have a situation where universities do not know what to charge their students. I do not blame universities and their vice-chancellors for getting out there and arguing in support of some of these changes, and I know some of them are. It is because they are starved of funds. They want to get on and do their jobs, but we have a government that is not prepared to fund higher education. It is the brains of this country that our economic prosperity comes from. Why we would starve our universities of funding, why we would continue to argue for user-pays models in education that discriminate against the poorest and most vulnerable, and people living in regional areas, is beyond me.


In welfare we had the prospect of young kids being taken off Newstart after six months. How on earth is somebody who has no income support, who cannot find a job, who is in a regional community, who might have a chronic health problem and has to go and see their GP a couple of times a month supposed to survive?


The list goes on. We had the review of the renewable energy target, with the brazen, shameless appointment of a climate denier like Dick Warburton to review the renewable energy target. From a government that prides itself on supporting business we have uncertainty in a multibillion dollar business, a business that could be one of the powerhouses in driving our economy forward. Right now we have uncertainty in the renewable energy sector because we have a renewable energy target but both sides are not prepared to say, 'This is it. This is the level of certainty we need, and let's make sure that business knows where they're operating from.' We have had R&D slashed. We have had funding for the CSIRO slashed. We have had funding for the ABC slashed. We have had funding for SBS slashed. We have had public services slashed. And then we had the spectre of the paid parental leave that was, that wasn't, that was, that wasn't.


It is hard to go past the Prime Minister's role in all of this. It is a tough gig being the Prime Minister of a country. I would not wish it on my worst enemy. It is a tough gig, but it has to be said that he has been an international embarrassment. Do you remember him creating that new country Canadia? The suppository of all wisdom? Knights and dames? Then, today, I understand, he tried to compare job losses with the Holocaust. We have a Prime Minister who is showing himself to be unfit for office. People right around the country who have Rhodes scholarships must feel at the moment that the currency of their degree has been debased. It is no wonder that we have had the leadership turmoil we have seen over the past week.


What we are seeing is trust and integrity in government being destroyed. I have always believed that people might not agree with you on every policy proposition, but if they trust you, if they respect you, if they believe you have integrity you can take them with you. This is a government that has lost the trust of the Australian community. It has lost the trust of the Australian community because it promised one thing and did another. What it did was a fundamental attack on the values that we believe are important and that define us as a nation.


Amidst all that, we have a chaotic government. They are divided. They are dysfunctional. They have lost the trust of the Australian people. They can accept some responsibility and stop blaming the electorate for their problems. The electorate is not absent minded; they know very clearly how they feel about this government.


A few words of advice: stop attacking the social contract. People in this country value Medicare. They fought for it. They want it preserved. They want it built up, not torn down. That is what they want. They think it is important to have income support for people who are down on their luck. The last thing people want is a city filled with young people pushing shopping trolleys around because they cannot find a job, cannot find a house and have all their belongings with them while they look for crisis accommodation. We do not want to go down that path. We want to have an education system that ensures that someone from a regional community or a low-income background can afford to get a university degree and pull themselves out of the position they are in.


We value the ABC. We value SBS. We want our public broadcasters improved. We value the public sector. Public servants are our doctors, our nurses and our teachers. They are the people who help make this country function. Sure, address wasteful spending. We agree with you, there are some areas of waste that we can address. I have written to the Minister for Health and said, 'Let's have a conversation about health care and the areas where we can get better value for money.' Let us stop funding things that do not work. It is important to accept that there are areas where there is waste in the system, but you have to drop your ideological baggage. It is not just about spending. Be honest with the Australian community. We are a low-taxing country. People do not like paying tax—I accept that—but we are low-taxing country and the big end of town is not pulling its weight. It is not. Let us start with the enormous tax concessions in the mining industry. Why is it that people like Gina Rinehart get cheap fuel? Why do they get billion-dollar discounts on their fuel bills when ordinary people have to pay the full value of fuel excise? Let us drop the enormous subsidies that exist on fuel for the big end of town, in particular the mining industry. Look at superannuation and negative gearing. There are huge concessions enjoyed by high-income earners. While they enjoy those concessions we are asking people on low incomes to pay more to see a doctor and to pay more for an education, but if they cannot find a job they are not going to be looked after. That is not the sort of country we are. Let us tackle tax avoidance head on. Let us look at the enormous offshoring that goes on with big multinationals, who are creating elaborate tax avoidance schemes—some of them legal, some of them not. Just yesterday we had someone suggest that these are as bad as, if not worse than, the bottom-of-the-harbour tax avoidance schemes that we saw in the seventies and the eighties. The challenge for this country is to take on the big vested interests, to accept that we have a great country with a social contract that we all enjoy. The government ignores that at its peril, because on the trajectory they are on they will not make it to the end of this year.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2015-02-12,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (17:06):  I rise to support the motion before the chamber. This week, we saw the Liberal Party go to war with itself, perhaps the last group of Australians it has not picked a fight with. They picked fights with pensioners, university students, unions, people needing to see a GP and even the ABC. And now they are turning their divisive politics inwards.


Under this government we have seen unfair policy after unfair policy being resoundingly rejected by the Australian public and also by the Senate. And yet the Liberals think that simply changing the spokesman will make Australians forget about the cruel and repeated attacks on the very fabric of our society that this government has undertaken during their 16-month reign. And let us not forget the complicit National Party in all of this, supporting the decline of rural health, the jacking up of petrol prices and the lack of any real plan for Northern Australia without so much as a peep. The Nationals: asleep on the job since Menzies.


The Liberal's unfair budget and their broken promises are hurting Australians by around $6,000 a year for the average family. And this is from a government which claims to be interested in lowering the cost of living. This government is so out of touch and so right wing in its views that it is little wonder that the public are not buying anything it is selling. The unbridled outrage from the community with regard to making Prince Philip a knight was remarkable to see.


But what gave the public anger momentum was that this decision encapsulated everything about this government to date: behind the times, out of touch, bowing to external interests and without consultation. That is what fired everyone up: it was the ultimate 'captain's call'. 


And if the policies alone are not bad enough, it is the completely ad-hoc and flying-by-the seat-of-their-pants-way of governing that is angering the public and now, finally, the Liberal backbench. Before I go into detailing some of these examples of poor policy and backflips, I want to give a contrast to this cruel and bitter federal government. I would like to offer my congratulations to what in all likelihood will be a new Labor government in my home state of Queensland. What a campaign, and what a fantastic result for Queensland! Labor were outspent, outmanned and severely outnumbered against an arrogant LNP, that saw government as some sort of birthright and that saw office as a way to help their mates and to get square with their perceived enemies. The size of the groundswell of community support for a change in government surprised the LNP, who thought they could ignore their promises to the public and act in any way they pleased without consequence.


The Prime Minister clearly does not get it, when he describes the Victorian and Queensland election results as a 'fit of absent-mindedness' by voters. When all else fails, blame the public. So I congratulate Annastacia Palaszczuk—hopefully, soon-to-be Premier Palaszczuk—and look forward to dealing with a Queensland government that will genuinely have Queenslanders' best interests at its core.


Whilst I would love to congratulate each and every candidate, both successful and unsuccessful, time may prevent me from doing so. So I will congratulate those new Labor MPs in and around the north of Brisbane where my office is: Nikki Boyd in Pine Rivers, Shane King in Kallangur, Chris Whiting in Murrumba, Mark Ryan in Morayfield, Rick Williams in Pumicestone, Stirling Hinchliffe in Sandgate, Leanne Linard in Nudgee, former senator Mark Furner in Ferny Grove, Kate Jones in Ashgrove, Steven Miles in Mount Coot-tha and Grace Grace in Brisbane Central. I look forward to working with all of them to help bring back good governance in Queensland.


I just return now to the federal government and will look at some of the examples which have led to concerns and to this motion before the chamber. Firstly, let's deal with the intergenerational report. The intergenerational report must be released every five years; it is the law of the land. Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott have been too caught up in internal dysfunction and in trying to sell their unpopular and unfair budget to the point where the Treasurer is in breach of the very law his Liberal Party colleague Peter Costello created. What is Mr Hockey hiding in this report?


Let's look at the tax white paper. It is overdue. The failure of the Abbott government to pass their cruel budget has clearly demonstrated their inability to connect with the Australian people. How can the Australian people seriously trust the Abbott government on fair tax reform?


Let's look at the renewable energy target, the RET. The coalition's gamed review of the RET has led to investment in renewable energies leaving Australia's shores. This ideological crusade has permanently wounded our wind and solar industries in particular. When Germany is leaving Australia behind on solar power, you know there is a serious problem with this government's approach. I refer to the ARENA report on solar energy of 2013, which noted:


Solar energy is a vast and largely untapped resource. Australia has the highest average solar radiation per square metre of any continent in the world.


And yet when we look at the international comparison, Germany leaves us for dead—as does the United States, Spain, China, the Republic of Korea, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada and Portugal.


Additionally, the coalition misled the Australian people in 2013 when they stated that they were not expecting to make any changes to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA. However, Tony Abbott's budget of lies and twisted priorities did exactly that, announcing that the ARENA would be abolished.


Let's look at workplace relations. Senator Abetz says that the coalition will not legislate to change penalty rates. But you cannot trust the Abbott government. They are already laying the groundwork via the Productivity Commission and are letting the more-loyal backbenchers off the leash with regard to penalty rates. Why can't they be upfront in their plans? One need only have a look at the news article of 5 September last year from the ABC, whose headline stated 'Liberal backbencher Alex Hawke calls for penalty rates to be cut …'. This article quoted Mr Hawke:


""If you change penalty rates now, in six to 12 months you'd start to see an impact of more small businesses taking on more young people,"" he said.


""Given that Sundays are no longer sacrosanct ... having to pay a 75 per cent loading [is] an old concept.""


So that is their answer to jobs: cutting wages and conditions of workers. Of course, Mr Hawke's call flies in the face of the coalition's election promise to make no changes to penalty rates in this term of government, and this Productivity Commission inquiry is an opportunity to reintroduce Work Choices by a different name.


On the issue of privatisation, the Queensland election result clearly indicates that Queenslanders are opposed to asset sales. Yet the coalition's Asset Recycling Fund Bill is nothing but a bullying tactic to force states and territories to sell off their assets if they want to obtain Commonwealth funding for much-needed infrastructure. This is a sneaky way to impose their ideological agenda of blanket privatisation and reduced government services. As we saw in the Queensland election, an asset sale is an asset sale. You can try calling it a lease, Strong Choices or asset recycling, but in the end you cannot fool the public, particularly in the most decentralised state in the country, where regional communities often depend on vital government services to stay viable. I did not hear the Nationals standing up to their coalition partners on that issue either.


On the issue of the GP tax, before the 2013 election Tony Abbott made no mention of a GP tax. Yet, like all his other broken promises, his unfair budget imposed a $7 GP co-payment on Australian families just for seeing the doctor. Despite two backflips and the dumping of a minister, this government is still committed to taxing families more to see the doctor. Why won't they listen to Australians?


On the issue of paid parental leave, the Prime Minister's signature policy is in tatters. This was a policy he persistently promised to deliver yet has, like countless other promises, backflipped on. If the Prime Minister were serious about engaging in productivity gains he would reverse the government's cuts from child care of over $1 billion dollar that leave working families even worse off under this unfair, cruel budget.


On the issue of university deregulation, the Abbott government should stop its ideological attack on Australian universities. The twisted view that students should have to pay up to $100,000 for a degree will, quite literally, kill the hopes and dreams of thousands of potential students who will not be able to justify the higher cost of attending university. This government needs to scrap their plans to bring this policy back from the dead after the Senate killed it off last year.


On the issue of submarines, not due to the opinion of dozens of eminent defence experts and not due to the pleas of the South Australian government and local members but on the eve of a vote on his leadership the Prime Minister gave a promise for a tender process. I feel for Senator Edwards. He is trying to stand up for his state, and I can appreciate that. But the way this Prime Minister has played him is reprehensible. One the most important military procurements in our nation's history was put up for grabs to win a single vote in a leadership challenge. That is remarkable. I have visited the Collins class submarines at ASC in Adelaide and, unlike this government, I could not help but be impressed and incredibly proud of what we are capable of building in Australia. The experts are on board. The industry and the public are on board. It is time the government got on board.


On the issue of business confidence, confidence in the business community—the alleged base of the Liberals—has been hammered by the never-ending chopping and changing of reviews, policies and ministers that has been the Abbott government so far. So far this term, the Liberal playbook in any area seems to be: (1) promise moderate changes before the election; (2) commission a sham review; (3) use the sham review to propose policy that is infinitely more extreme than previously promised; (4) be genuinely surprised when the public does not support the new policy. For many policies you can also add in the optional fifth step: perform a half-backflip. But they manage to mess that up as well. The end result is that no-one knows where they stand, and no-one knows what on earth is going on. The end result is backbenchers announcing policy to the media based on promises from the Prime Minister, then being contradicted within minutes.


This government has changed its views and double-crossed itself so many times on so many issues that its head must be spinning. They go on about blaming the previous government for their own poor economic management, but I would suggest they have a look a step further back. Let's ask the IMF about their spending, and I quote from The Age here:


Australia's most needlessly wasteful spending took place under the John Howard-led Coalition government rather than under the Whitlam, Rudd or Gillard Labor governments, an international study has found.


The International Monetary Fund examined 200 years of government financial records across 55 leading economies.


It identifies only two periods of Australian ""fiscal profligacy"" in recent years, both during John Howard's term in office—in 2003 at the start of the mining boom and during his final years in office between 2005 and 2007.


The Rudd government's stimulus spending during the financial crisis doesn't rate as profligate because the measure makes allowance for spending needed to stabilise the economy.


We have heard that 'good government' has allegedly started this week. It must be a pretty slow starter because I am yet to see it.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:22):  I am at a loss to understand why Senator Moore continues to give me these gifts. Yesterday, I thought that the gift of the MPI that she gave me was for my birthday, but I do not quite know why she has served it up again and given me the opportunity to share with the Australian people the absolute failure and the incompetence of the last Labor government. I take the opportunity to remark on Senator Ketter's comments with regard to Queensland, which is where, at the University of Queensland, I undertook my undergraduate studies. I will just check with a fine Queenslander, Senator O'Sullivan. Senator Ketter, in that era Queensland was debt free. As I recall, one of the proud claims of the then Queensland government was that all retail fuel prices throughout Queensland were exactly the same. It did not matter if it was Cairns, Mareeba or Brisbane, they were all the same. Today, you have an $89 billion debt.


Do you remember when John Howard won government? He and Peter Costello inherited a $96 billion debt from the Labor government and Mr Keating. But that was shared at the time amongst about 18 or 19 million people. Today, that $89 billion, nearly $90 billion, debt is shared amongst four million Queenslanders. And that represents $22½ thousand of debt for every single person in that state. And do you know what? It has to be paid back. What was the Newman government able to do in terms of retiring debt? Not too much, but what it did do was retire a $6 billion deficit. That is the difference between what you get in each year and what you actually pay out in expenditure each year. They reduced it by more than two-thirds—from $6 billion down to $2.7 billion. So that is what we have in Queensland today. Good luck to the good people of Queensland, because all they are going to see is that $89 billion debt just go up and up and up. That $22½ thousand per person is going to go up, Senator O'Sullivan. 


I would agree with Senator Ketter that we did make one mistake on coming into government in 2013. I will tell you what it was: we actually believed the outgoing Labor government. How stupid would you have to be to do so! But we believed in them that that year there was going to be an $18 billion deficit. 



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  Do you know what it turned out to be? In case Senator Bilyk did not hear it, it was not $18 billion; it was $40 billion. A deficit, as we all know, is that shortfall between what you get in each year and what you give out each year. Over the six years of the Labor government, they managed to run up $200 billion of deficit, whilst they ran from a surplus and approached about $600 billion in debt. As we all know, that translates to $1 billion a month, $33 million a day. It is about $1½ million an hour that this country is borrowing overseas, not to repay the debt but just to repay the interest. And how often do many of us in this place reflect on where we need to have funds to spend in the welfare sector, to spend in the pension sector, to spend on child care, et cetera? But when you watch that $1,000 million a month just going offshore, that is the new teaching hospital every month, that is the two new primary schools every day, seven days a week, that we are losing because we are paying back Labor's debt. Yes, there was a mistake by the incoming government, and that was that we believed the figure of $18 billion.


Acting Deputy President Seselja, you know—and those of us who have run businesses throughout our lives know—that leadership is about responding to changing circumstances. What are the circumstances today? The Labor government enjoyed the best terms of trade in Australia's history. They inherited no debt, no deficit. They inherited about $40 billion that was earning about $5 billion a year interest that was actually going into programs, et cetera—absolutely incredible. But we went to an election and we made a few promises. The first one was that we would get rid of the regressive carbon tax, because the carbon tax was simply putting the foot on the hose of industry, jobs and businesses. It was sending industry offshore; it was costing more for energy.


When young people come to my office and they want you to do this and do that, I say to them, 'In a population of 23 million in a land mass the size of continental USA, why do you think we have one of the highest per capita incomes in the world?' And they say, 'We lived on the sheep's back.' Well, it is a long, long time ago that we got a pound per pound of wool. Then they say, 'It's gold.' No, it is not gold. 'It's Iron ore.' We have probably had iron ore for six, seven, eight, nine or 10 years. Eventually, they cannot answer the question, so I say to them: 'Do you know why we are such a wealthy country per capita? It's because of cheap energy.' That has been it—nothing else, nothing more. We do not have the population. We do not have the population of the United States. We do not have the population of China and the other Asian countries. We have got—or did have—cheap energy.


So what did the carbon tax do? It attacked Australia's one great advantage. So we said we would reverse it, and we did. Who was the mining tax going to affect? Mainly, of course, Western Australia. That did not worry Labor, because they have so little representation in Western Australia. Even good Senator Bullock, before he came into this place, and others at the time, said, 'Don't do this.' We stood up here day after day and said, 'You will not bring in a mining tax, because it will make no money.' Did the then Labor government listen? No. What did they do? They not only made a prediction that they were going to earn $4½ billion a year when we told them it would earn them nothing. But, do you know what good old Mr Swan—that responsible and that best Treasurer in the world—went out and did? He spent it! Could you imagine a household getting the hope or the promise of $4,500 or a business getting $45,000, and at the beginning of the financial year saying, 'You beauty, I am going to go out and spend the $45,000 or the $4,500, or whatever it is.' Would any responsible household or business do that? Of course it would not. Mr Swan did. He made all these promises. He said, 'We're going to increase superannuation, we're going to change every circumstance, we're going to make all these concessions for everyone.' He built up expectations and hopes. And what happened when he earned nothing from his mining tax? Of course, they were dashed. And so we quite rightly committed them to the dustbin.


Today we have had discussions about the shocking circumstance of the number of people who came here illegally on boats. I will make only one comment about that. We speak about the 1,200 people lost at sea. I spent some time last year with two of my Senate colleagues undertaking the Sovereign Borders program up in Darwin at the Larrakeyah Barracks. I remember one morning speaking to some of the naval personnel who had in fact been at sea during those horrific circumstances. I asked them, 'How real is the figure of 1,200 lost at sea?' One of them said to me, 'Senator Back, the 1,200 were the ones that we pulled out of the water. The number is unknown, but it is infinitely greater than that 1,200.' I will not reflect further at this time on that circumstance.


But I will go on and say that, when Mr Abbott as the Prime Minister was confronted with the opportunity of providing financial support to SPC Ardmona, he said, 'No. Industry and business have got to learn to stand on their own two feet.' I would just make this observation. Do you know when the start of the demise of SPC Ardmona was? It is important to put this on the record. It actually started during the fruit harvest some years earlier at SPC Ardmona when a then industrial official went to the company right in the middle of picking and harvesting and influenced its workers to threaten to strike and arranged a circumstance in which the conditions of employment became such that the company became absolutely uneconomical and unprofitable. Do you know who that then union official was? It was one William Shorten, the now leader of the federal opposition here in this place. So we cannot divorce industrial activities from this but I, for one, will always do my best to encourage employment. I have a long record of encouraging employment, opportunity and skills development for those who have worked or are working with me or for me.


I will also go to some of the issues we are facing. Why are we looking at some of the budget problems we have? It is because the then Labor government identified $5 billion of savings that we supported once we came into government in this place. But what have that group of people on the other side done? They have opposed them. They have opposed their own budget savings.


I will go to higher education. It is a shame that Senator Carr is not here. Senator Carr knows as well as I do, despite his ranting and ravings, that it was the Labor Party's intention to cut some $6 billion out of higher education. In fact, by April 2013 they had started that process. I do not think it is to the credit of Labor senators to talk about $100,000 degrees. Let me give you one example. The University of Western Australia is among the top 100 universities in the world. Paul Johnson, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia and an honest, ethical man, has said that the cost of undergraduate degrees at UWA will be $16,000 per annum. A three-year education degree will be three times $16,000, which is $48,000, not $100,000. A four-year agriculture degree will cost four times $16,000, which is $64,000. Perhaps Senator Carr needs to go back to school or borrow a calculator. For heaven's sake, do not insult the intelligence of this place by going on about $100,000 degrees when that university alone, one of the top universities in the world, has said what degrees will really cost. Either that or bring Professor Johnson in here and call him a liar to his face.


Those higher education opportunities will particularly enhance the opportunity for low socioeconomic Australians to avail themselves of scholarship schemes to go to university without fees. Regional universities are now being denied Commonwealth supported places for sub-university programs which will then lead students on towards university degrees. They are being denied them completely. I cannot understand why or how that circumstance is occurring.


Senator Ketter drew attention to jobs, as did Senator Moore. The government is costing jobs, is it? The job advertisement level, according to the ANZ, is growing at 13.6 per cent per annum at the moment—the fastest growth in 3.5 years. Two hundred thousand jobs have been created, equating to just under 600 jobs a day. In 2014 jobs growth was more than triple that of 2013. Is this evidence of costing jobs? These are not coalition figures; these are from the ANZ. The Dun and Bradstreet business expectations survey says it is the best outlook for 10 years.


Bill Evans, the chief economist at Westpac, made this observation the other day in response to the Reserve Bank's decision. He said, 'This lift in confidence should allay any concerns that rate cuts in the current environment of record low rates can be a negative for confidence.' I have a lot of faith in Bill Evans. I have followed him for a long time. I believe that he knows what he is talking about.


If Senator Moore thinks consumer confidence is down she should know that retail trade is up 4.1 per cent higher than last year. We will be introducing a small business tax cut of 1.5 per cent. The ANZ consumer confidence index is at its long-term average. We saw in 2014 a 10 per cent increase in the number of companies registered. These are what will go out and employ people. There are 21,000 new companies, and that does not take account of sole traders, partnerships or other business activities. Senator Whish-Wilson quite rightly said today that small business is the engine room of this country. It is where there is and will be employment.


I have already spoken about the fuel industry and electricity costs. We know that electricity costs are down. We know that fuel costs are down. For how long they will be I do not know. I would not be banking on it, but at least they are down at the moment. These are taking pressures off everybody in the economy.


But I am particularly concerned about and interested in employment prospects. We have at the moment in the hospitality and tourism industry an urgent need for 85,000 to 90,000 jobs to be filled. There is an urgent need now. That is before we get to the ongoing onslaught of new inbound tourists as our Australian dollar goes down. There is $4 billion of value to us in the China-Australia free trade agreement from education related services and exports. There was $1.7 billion last year of revenue to this country just from tourism from China. We have 85,000 to 90,000 jobs in that one sector alone. In the sector which I am very interested in and, of course, passionately associated with, agriculture and agribusiness, the opportunities for our country are vast. Like tourism and hospitality, as Senator Nash knows only too well, many of those jobs are in rural and regional areas. Many of them are jobs that do not require a high degree of skills, but there is the opportunity for skills development.


If only the Labor opposition would stop the negativism. If only they would come in here and act as adults and help in the whole process of improving the economy, of creating jobs and of stimulating activity, the whole of this Australian economy and all of its people would be an awful lot better off.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-02-12,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:38):  It is not often I get the opportunity to follow Senator Back in a debate. I am very pleased to be able to do that today. Listening to Senator Back thrash around, regurgitating the same old rhetoric that the Australian public have rejected, is just pathetic—absolutely pathetic.


Let us go to one of the issues that Senator Back raised: the issue of jobs. The key players on jobs are the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and what have they said today about this incompetent, arrogant, unreal government? One hundred thousand more Australians are unemployed since the last election—100,000 jobs gone under the watch of Prime Minister Abbott and the rabble that he presides over. It is really is an issue where the only job that the Prime Minister cares about is his own job. The unemployment rate is the highest it has been since 2002. We had Senator Ruston in here earlier, and Senator Back, waffling on about what great economic managers they are and what a problem they inherited, and they have been demonstrated today again to be economic incompetents and to be absolutely incapable of dealing with the issue of employment growth in this country. There has been a 1.1 per cent spike in youth unemployment under the watch of the coalition government. This is the same government that wants to make sure that unemployed youth do not get access to any government support for six months. What is wrong with this government?


In South Australia, where this government basically told the car industry to go away—'Go and find an investment somewhere else'—and get out of the country, we now have this big jump in unemployment. It has the highest unemployment in the country, at 7.3 per cent, and that is before the car industry job losses hit South Australia. It is at 7.3 per cent now, and the car industry losses are to go on top of that. There has been a deal done with the Spanish government to build the submarines in Spain, and that will mean more job losses in South Australia. This government does not care about jobs. All the leadership of this government care about is their own jobs—that is all they care about.


Look at the pathetic performance we have had in South Australia. Senator Edwards was dragged kicking and screaming to stand up publicly for jobs in South Australia. We never heard a peep out of him when Senator Johnston, the former defence minister, said that South Australians could not build a canoe. There was not a peep out of any South Australian senator—not a word. They just copped this diminution of the reputation of South Australian workers, and they did it without a peep—not a mention of that issue.


Then, suddenly, the South Australian senators understand they have a political time bomb ticking away underneath them and that this is not acceptable. On top of destroying the car industry, the coalition are destroying the submarine and shipbuilding industry. That political time bomb ticks away and what does Senator Edwards do? He has an epiphany. He suddenly recognises that there are jobs on the line in South Australia, an area with high unemployment, the highest unemployment in the country, with the government not caring about South Australian workers. So he actually does the right thing and he starts standing up for South Australian workers. But then he does a deal with the Prime Minister that he would provide his vote to the Prime Minister in return for an open, competitive tender. The Prime Minister gives him that commitment. Senator Edwards goes out the next day, parades himself as being a great hero in South Australia and says, 'I've delivered a competitive tender for South Australian industry. Look how good I am.'


As soon as he got the words out of his mouth, he was being hammered into the ground. I feel sorry for Senator Edwards—I really do feel sorry—because at least he did the right thing in the end. He was doing it belatedly, but he got there and he eventually did the right thing. He traded his vote for the promise in return of trying to help employment in South Australia. The competitive tender did not last too long. It became an 'open evaluation process', or whatever it is being called—something that nobody knows what it means or what it is about. Then it became an 'opportunity to participate'.


Senator Edwards tried to go out and defend himself in the media—not very successfully, I do not think anyone would argue—but then he was humiliated again by South Australian frontbencher Mr Jamie Briggs, who came out and basically accused Senator Edwards of lying. In all my watching of politics in this country, I have never heard a government minister accusing a fellow member of their party of lying. This is something new in politics and it shows you exactly the problem we have with an incompetent government that is only interested in maintaining jobs, maintaining the perks of office, and is not prepared to look after the workers in this country. So I really feel sorry for Senator Edwards. His reputation is now that of someone who has lied. That is the reputation Senator Edwards has. And it has not been brought about by the Labor Party—because we do not believe he did lie. It has not been brought about by his political opponents on this side, it has been brought about by his political enemies on the other side. Senator Edwards is a much diminished figure after this fiasco. He does not deserve to be treated like that because, eventually, he stood up for jobs in South Australia. Senator Edwards, in my view, should continue to defend his reputation before it is gone forever. Senator Edwards, for all his faults, for all his ideological incompetence, for all his economic incompetence, tried to do the right thing and has been absolutely buried by his own side.


This is something I have never seen before. What is he trying to do? He is trying to do what the Economic Development Board in South Australia is that right thing, and that is to build the submarines in South Australia. The Economic Development Board in South Australia have said that Australia would be around $525 million a year better-off if the submarines are built in Australia—a half a billion dollars a year benefit to this economy by building the submarines in Australia—and 3,000 more Australian jobs will be saved every year over the 40-year life of the project if the submarine is built in Australia. These are massive figures, massive amounts of jobs, and I am glad Senator Edwards belatedly come to the view that he should stand up and fight on that position.


The unemployment rate is only one aspect of the failure of this government. The biggest failure of this government is a failure of trust and a failure of credibility. You see, no-one trusts this government. It does not matter whether it is Senator Ruston, Senator Back or Senator Cormann who gets up and runs the same rhetoric that has been run by this government since it came into power, people have stopped listening. And do you know why? It is because they do not trust you. You cannot lie continually to the Australian public and get away with it unscathed. I remember clearly when, on the night before the 2013 election, Tony Abbott, then Leader of the Opposition, went to the Penrith football club and said there would be no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. Well, not one of those commitments has been kept.


Attacking the ABC, one of the most respected organisations in this country, is, I think, a bit low. The ABC is clearly an independent organisation that is delivering what the Australian public expect—a news service that can be respected and is independent. I have heard Senator O'Sullivan attack the ABC. I have heard him say that was one of the good things the government has done. Senator O'Sullivan, I do not think the constituents out in rural and regional Australia really think that is a good thing to do. I think your constituents actually believe that the ABC provides a good service to the community and that it is worth paying for.


I think your constituents need a National Party that is going to stand up for their needs out in rural and regional Australia—not a National Party that simply does the bidding of the Liberal Party, is a pale imitation of what the National Party used to be and is not prepared to stand up for rural and regional Australia on health, education and welfare. The National Party are so pathetic. They are not prepared to stand up for their own constituency, and that is why the voters in rural and regional Australia are looking for alternatives to the National Party. That is why we are seeing Liberals and independents getting elected in rural and regional Australia. The Nationals have abandoned the needs of rural and regional Australia.


Where are people depending more on jobs? In rural and regional Australia. They need jobs in rural and regional Australia. Where are people who are on welfare? The majority, or a lot of them, are in rural and regional Australia. What is the National Party sitting back and letting the Liberal Party do? Cut $80 a week over 10 years out of the pensions. Have you actually gone out and told the constituents of rural and regional Australia that you are sitting back dumb, sitting back and say nothing, when the pensions will be reduced by $80 a week over a 10-year period? I do not think so.


There are many unemployed 23-year-olds in rural and regional Australia. They are being cut $50 a week, which is 18 per cent of the income. There is nothing fair about that. That is why the Australian public have said that the budget that this government delivered is one of the most unfair budgets this country has ever seen. A single parent with an eight-year-old child will lose $60 a week, which is a 12 per cent cut in their income. Where is the fairness in that? It is just not there. For families on $65,000 a year, their income will be cut $6,000 a year.


That is why the coalition have lost the confidence and the trust of the Australian people. That is because you have acted on ideology and not the interests of the Australian public. You come in here and you mouth the same rhetoric, day after day, hoping it will see you through. The robotic rhetoric of Senator Cormann is not cutting through. You have got a Treasurer who is not cutting through. You have got a Prime Minister who is totally incompetent and does not even have the confidence of a massive amount of his backbench.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  What nonsense!




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator O'Sullivan says, 'What nonsense.' This shows you that these people are just defying reality. They just do not accept reality. It was not the Labor Party who had the vote in your party room and it was not the Labor Party that was rebelling; it was your own backbench that was rebelling, because they are now listening to the Australian public and the Australian public are saying that your budget was unfair, you have not done the right thing and you cannot be trusted. You cannot be trusted and that is why you are in the position that you are in, where your party room is falling apart and where your Prime Minister is on a day-to-day probation. If there is another mistake, you are gone and the Malcolm Turnbull minions are in control. That is the problem you have got. You took the schoolkids bonus away, you cut $36 billion out of education and you cut $80 billion out of health—no wonder the Australian public look at you guys askance.


It is not only the Australian public. You have got the Council on Foreign Relations, who promote themselves as supporting globalisation, free trade, reducing financial regulation on transnational corporations and economic consolidation into regional blocks—on it goes. It is a right-wing organisation. What does one of their experts say in the Council of Foreign Relations' journal? They say:


Is Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott the most incompetent leader of any industrialized democracy?


I can answer that question very easily: yes. They say:


There are world leaders who appear dangerously unhinged, making policy based on whims, advice from a tiny handful of advisers, or some other highly unscientific formula.


They name a few of those leaders, such as Korea's Kim Jong-un and Russia's Vladimir Putin. They say:


But none of these leaders run a rich and powerful democracy… Tony Abbott, however, is in charge of a regional power, a country that is the twelfth largest economy in the world and the only rich world nation to have survived the 2008-9 financial crisis unscathed.


That was thanks to the Labor Party.


Yet in less than two years as prime minister, Abbott has proven shockingly incompetent, which is why other leaders within his ruling coalition, following a set of defeats in state elections, may now scheme to unseat him. They should: Abbott has proven so incapable of clear policy thinking, so unwilling to consult with even his own ministers and advisers, and so poor at communicating that he has to go.


That is only the start of the analysis from the right-wing think tank. The coalition are in political trouble and economic trouble. They will not survive because they are unfair and untrustworthy and have lied their way into power. (Time expired)

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (17:58):  I would like to thank Senator Cameron for his contributions. I heard his contributions yesterday and he again said that somehow it was a bad thing that we were ideologically based. I have got to say to him, again: absolutely, we are. We are based in sound philosophies. Despite the absolute mess you left us, we have taken responsibility for dealing with it. You have adopted a year zero approach: what debt, what issues and what problems? We clearly have a very different perspective on success.


Our economy is growing at 2.7 per cent. The best you achieved is 1.9 per cent. Last year, we did create 213,000 jobs and 223,000 new companies, which are all employing Australians. Retail trade figures are up for seven months in a row. We have scrapped the carbon tax, which is at a tangible benefit of $550 per family. Wonderfully for our states, we have scrapped that ridiculous mining tax that you spent against where you never raised any money. We have got $50 billion in infrastructure packages to create new wealth and new jobs. We have 85 projects underway already in 18 months with another 94 underway.


We have made a decision on the new Western Sydney airport. After 10 years of discussion—in which you did nothing—for our free-trade agreement, we have now got three free-trade agreements, which represents over 50 per cent of our exports. We have got $1 trillion in new environmental approvals. Again, they are to create the jobs of the future. We have cut $2 billion in red tape, which was strangling our small businesses. We are putting in place the long-term structural reforms to fix your budget mess. We have stopped the boats. To me, that is success in 18 months.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:02):  This report on the Defence Materiel Organisation is so important in the context of the situation we are facing in South Australia at the moment. We have a government that has done a deal with the Japanese government to build submarines in Japan and that has, by taking that approach, abandoned the work force and the community of South Australia. This is during a period when South Australia has the highest unemployment rate in the country—7.3 per cent. They have not yet felt the effects of this government's killing off of the car manufacturing sector in this country, and now more jobs are being sent overseas from the submarine project.


I want to indicate how important this submarine project is. According to the Economic Development Board of South Australia, 3,000 Australian jobs will be created every year over the 40-year life of the project if it is built in Australia. How ridiculous it is for the Prime Minister to make another captain's call and hand this project to the Japanese. This is absolutely outrageous. We see bickering and backstabbing in this incompetent coalition. When Senator Edwards belatedly stands up for his own state, belatedly stands up for jobs in South Australia, what happens to him? He is accused of lying by his own frontbench. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I have had a look at this report and I cannot see anything in it—perhaps I am reading the wrong one—about the Defence Materiel Organisation that would in any way justify Senator Cameron's contribution. 




Senator McLucas:
  On the point of order, Mr President: as you know, in taking note of documents you have historically, as have other Presidents in the past, allowed a wide-ranging discussion.'




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  It has to be relevant to the report, though.




Senator McLucas:
  I suggest it is, in the context of the way we have these discussions when we take note of documents. Mr President, you have ruled that way, appropriately, in the past and I encourage you to do the same again.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, you do raise a valid point of order but also Senator McLucas has summed it up correctly, that traditionally these debates have been wide-ranging. However, the debate must be constrained around the subject matter. Senator Cameron is relevant to the topic at this point. Senator Cameron, be very careful about your accusations, also, in relation to other senators. In the last few days accusations and implications have been made about senators and about truthfulness, and we need to be very careful that implications are not directed towards senators or groups of senators.




Senator CAMERON:
  On the point of order, Mr President: I would ask you to go through Hansard and look at my comments in relation to the submarines and Senator Edwards. You will not find that I have in any way accused Senator Edwards of lying.



The PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order, Senator Cameron. I have indicated to you that you can continue your remarks—you are being relevant in the context of this debate but I have issued a warning about being very careful about reflections on senators. That goes for all senators.




Senator CAMERON:
  I certainly would not wish to reflect on any senator in this place. All I am doing in my contributions is outlining the backbiting, the infighting and the backstabbing that is going on in the coalition party room over the issue of submarines. In terms of defence materiel, this would be the biggest defence materiel project ever in this country. 



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  It is absolutely no wonder that Senator Macdonald is on his feet trying to close this debate down, because this is a huge embarrassment for an already embarrassed government, for an already incompetent government, for a government that is so arrogant that it thinks it can continue to run the rhetoric that has seen losses in Victoria and a massive change of government in Queensland—unheard of—but it still wants to run this rhetoric of sending jobs overseas and of privatisation. The public do not accept the position of the coalition in relation to these issues. It is not me and it is not the Labor Party that are accusing Senator Edwards of lying. It is the coalition's own party leadership and their own frontbench. It is not the Labor Party. In fact, we have been in here defending Senator Edwards for belatedly seeing the need to defend jobs in South Australia. 


I take the view that jobs are important. The Defence Materiel Organisation can play a role in creating jobs in this country. When, under the coalition, this country has the highest unemployment rate it has had for 20 years, we need every job we can get, and we should not be handing the submarine build to the Japanese because of a captain's pick by a beleaguered Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who does not even have the confidence of his own backbench, and by a coalition government in disarray—a coalition government that is not trusted by the Australian public.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:09):  The report from the Defence Materiel Organisation, as usual, is a good one. It does highlight some issues. I was trying to get Senator Cameron to refer to the page in the report that he was speaking about. Of course, he did not, because, even though he has been here for a while now, he never seems to bother following the rules of the Senate, which are there for a reason and which should be followed.


One of the difficulties that the Defence Materiel Organisation have experienced, which they refer to, is the cost of doing business in Australia. The carbon tax imposed by the Labor government, which Senator Cameron and the Greens were part of, simply made manufacturing in Australia uncompetitive, and that included defence manufacturing. It is so sad that a party like the Labor Party, which is supposed to be looking after the workers, did so much to destroy workers' jobs and send jobs overseas. That is one of the problems for the defence industry and the Defence Materiel Organisation: procuring manufacturing activity in Australia was made so difficult because of the additional costs of doing anything because of the Labor Party's carbon tax. 


Under the Labor Party's carbon tax and under the watch of Senator Kim Carr as industry minister, we know that the Australian car industry was shut down. It became entirely uncompetitive. Through evidence given to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, we know that the unions are jobs' worst enemy in Australia. The corruption in the trade union movement, of which Senator Cameron and the senator from Far North Queensland are a part of—they are all ex-union people—




Senator Urquhart:
  What about me?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  And you too—you are part of the union movement. If you are in the Labor Party, you do not get into this chamber unless you have been able to heavy some union into supporting you in getting a job in this place. You never would have got a decent job anywhere else. But the unions put you in here, and you are here to look after the union movement. 



The PRESIDENT:  Through the Chair, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I should be saying this through you, Mr President. But I am diverting from the Defence Materiel report, to which I am speaking. I again make the point that the corruption you see in the trade union movement impacts upon the costs of doing business in manufacturing in Australia. And that is why, as the Defence Materiel Organisation points out, there have been some difficulties in giving defence industries the support that we would have hoped for. 


I do not want to prolong the Senate today, but I simply say that Senator Cameron's interpretation of the report—which I know he has not read and which he is speaking to today without any indication of what is actually in the report—makes my argument. The reason it is so difficult for any defence industry activity in Australia is that the Labor Party imposed a carbon tax that sent Australian jobs overseas. That was quite obvious in the defence area, and, in fact, in any area, because our competitors overseas did not have those sorts of imposed costs and they do not have a corrupt trade union movement, as we do—which the royal commission has clearly evidenced. Those sorts of things make it very difficult for Australia to have a manufacturing industry, make it very difficult for Australia to do what we want to do in the defence materiel area. So I would just urge Senator Cameron, when he speaks on these things, to understand what the real problem is with industry support in this country. It is the Labor Party. (Time expired)

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (18:37):     I rise to speak on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report, Current requirements for labelling of seafood and seafood products, which is a very interesting report with, I think, a great recommendation. From the outset it became evident that there was a hole in the system that needed to be fixed and virtually every witness who appeared before the committee believed there will be great benefits when Australians know that what they are eating is Australian seafood. There has been no requirement on those in the food service sector such as restaurants, fish and chip shops, or pubs and clubs, to identify the a seafood's origins outside the Northern Territory. The committee actually went to Darwin and had a good, close look at the industry there.


The Master Fish Merchants Association of Australia told the committee at our Sydney hearing that imported seafood accounted for in excess of 70 per cent of the seafood we eat, and to have a proper country-of-origin labelling system in place would make it a level playing field. Amazingly, there is a company called Australis Barramundi. You would think that that would be nice Australian barramundi. No, it is farmed barramundi from Vietnam. I think the ACCC are very aware of this situation, but people are confused. The association also said that the Australian fisheries industry is managed properly and is sustainable. It pointed out that fisheries are highly regulated and that stocks are actually increasing. I hope the Greens take note of that.


Helen Jenkins from the Australian Prawn Farmers Association said that a practical solution to give Australian consumers more clarity and confidence in making their choice is to write 'Australian' or 'imported' on menus or blackboards. Go to a fish and chip shop and today's special would be identified as Australian or imported. There is not too much cost in that. She suggested that a proper, universal labelling system could see huge investment in farmed prawns, and even predicted that it would increase 17-fold and that job numbers could climb from the current 300 to 5,000. One concerning point raised by the prawn farmers was that there is cheating going on when some overseas seafood is being substituted for the more expensive Australian product. The fines are minimal. One fine was just $6,000, which they said is a slap on the wrist, so perhaps these fines should be higher.


The Australian Barramundi Farmers Association told us that 90 per cent of people preferred Australian fish. Of the 20,000 tonnes of whole barramundi consumed annually, 40 per cent is Australian produce. When mandatory labelling was introduced in the Northern Territory there was an increase in seafood consumption, and the barramundi industry all but guaranteed that, if the labelling were introduced nationally, barramundi production would increase, and that means more jobs.


Matthew Evans gave some interesting evidence in a private capacity. He talked about the difference in environmental standards between our seafood industry and those overseas. He mentioned he had been on a fish farm in China where he saw cigarette butts, an oil slick and polystyrene floating through the farms and dog droppings in the water next to the farm. He said that you would not see that on Australian fish farms. I agree with him.


In the Northern Territory a licence is required to catch, process or sell fish, and the requirement to label seafood was introduced in November 2008 by way of a licence condition on fish retailers and on licensees such as restaurants, cafes, bistros and hotels. The requirement means that all seafood not harvested in Australia and advertised for sale for public consumption must be labelled as 'imported'. 'Advertised' includes menus, menu boards, brochures and pamphlets. In terms of the Northern Territory experience, a study has shown that 90 per cent of fish retailers were compliant within three months of the introduction of the laws, and surveys of retail establishments have shown that costs of complying with labelling are between $100 and $500 per annum, largely due to ongoing menu changes.


These surveys have also shown that consumers respond positively to seafood labelling that provides them with information about their choices. Consumers have preference for local seafood and are prepared to pay a premium. After freshness, supporting local industry and origin labelling were key factors in consumer decisions. This has all meant that in the Northern Territory the trawl fishery has gone from a $4 million to a $30 million turnover in eight years, or from 500 tonnes to 3,000 tonnes, because Australians can see that they are eating Australian grown fish—Australian produce.


Just as we are seeing in the honey industry where some imported brands could be misconstrued as being Australian unless you investigate further, it is also happening in the seafood industry. Robert Fish, Chairman of the Northern Territory Seafood Council, told us of overseas imports riding on the good Australian name on labels. The committee has brought the misleading labelling of Australis Barramundi to the attention of the ACCC, as I said, which is actually farmed in Vietnam. The Australian Barramundi Farmers Association emphasised that, as country of origin is second only to freshness in guiding consumer choices, it was unacceptable that a cheaper product could dominate the higher value end of the market due to lack of consumer knowledge.


Proprietors of restaurants, bars and fish and chip shops in the Northern Territory who gave evidence to the committee upheld the view that consumers have a right to know what they are eating and why they may be paying more for local seafood. The point was made that labelling seafood not only informs consumers but also builds trust as consumers know what they are getting for the price they pay. Not everyone or every organisation took the view that mandatory labelling for all sectors was a good idea. The New South Wales Food Authority made the point that the Northern Territory produces iconic seafood species, including single-species of barramundi and mud crabs, while other states, in particular New South Wales, produce a diverse range of many different species of seafood, many of which do not entail demands for protection. It argued that, for this reason, mandating country-of-origin labelling at restaurants may add a burden to the industry without any benefit at retail level.


In summary, the committee holds the view that mandating country-of-origin labelling in relation to fish products sold in restaurants and other cooked seafood outlets comprises an effective, simple and cost-effective means of achieving a level playing field for Australian and overseas seafood producers. To this end, the committee recommends the removal of the exemption, subject to a transition period of no more than 12 months. I hope the government takes this recommendation on board as a matter of urgency, as it is a simple fix supported by the majority.    We cannot afford to have our local industries competing with one hand tied behind their back against the imports which are not only coming in cheaper but even purporting to be Australian. For years I have pushed for a proper labelling system, and here is just a simple example of why.


I would like to thank those groups and individuals who lodged submissions and those who gave evidence and enlightened the committee on the way the seafood industry works. Thank you to the secretariat and also my fellow committee members; we were all on the same page during this inquiry. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (18:37):     I rise to speak on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report, Current requirements for labelling of seafood and seafood products, which is a very interesting report with, I think, a great recommendation. From the outset it became evident that there was a hole in the system that needed to be fixed and virtually every witness who appeared before the committee believed there will be great benefits when Australians know that what they are eating is Australian seafood. There has been no requirement on those in the food service sector such as restaurants, fish and chip shops, or pubs and clubs, to identify the a seafood's origins outside the Northern Territory. The committee actually went to Darwin and had a good, close look at the industry there.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2015-02-12,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (18:45):  Today's Sydney Morning Herald reports that an ALP tribunal has found that the mailing addresses of at least 20 ALP members' ballot papers for the federal Labor leadership election in 2013 were altered at the request of a staff member of Senator Dastyari. The addresses were changed to the home address of a Mr Hicham Zraika, who is reportedly serving a suspension from the Labor Party for branch stacking and other 'unworthy conduct', including falsifying the meeting records of his own branch.


The article reports that the changes of mailing address were requested by Mr Michael Buckland, who at the time worked as a senior policy adviser for Senator Dastyari. Mr Buckland previously worked for Mr Walt Secord MLC and, perhaps not insignificantly, from 2009 to 2010 for the Transport Workers Union. I note that evidence recently given to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption states that in 2010 a Mr Michael Buckland came up from New South Wales to help a McLean Forum financed campaign in support of the Biagini team in Queensland.


Serious questions need to be asked of Senator Dastyari and Mr Shorten. Did either of them know about this vote stacking reported in today's Sydney Morning Herald? Was Senator Dastyari aware of, or involved in, the apparently mischievous activities of his staff member Mr Buckland? Mr Shorten won the leadership vote by only two per cent. How widespread was this apparent ballot rigging and was he legitimately elected?


The actions emanating from Senator Dastyari's office do not sit comfortably with his claims to want the Labor Party reformed to give more power to rank and file members and to involve the community in preselections. He has previously told reporters that the three things that really matter are how a party chooses its policies, how it chooses its parliamentary candidates and how it chooses its leaders. We have now seen how much Senator Dastyari cares about rank and file participation in how a party chooses its parliamentary candidates. While promoting the importance of rank and file or even community involvement in preselections, he was happy to be parachuted into his own safe Senate candidacy as a 'nominee' with the blessing of factional backers and the party's administrative committee—no rank and file scrutiny whatsoever. We have also seen how much Senator Dastyari cares about rank and file participation in the choice of leader. This is the same faceless senator who pulled the strings to cut down one Prime Minister and abandon another, and then spectacularly failed to win majority government in either case.


The Labor party needs to get right to the bottom of this scandal and take steps to deal with any branch stacking or vote fiddling. An ALP tribunal may have suspended the middleman who received the redirected ballot papers, but what has happened to any others involved in this episode? Today's report of these irregularities in the ballot that installed Bill Shorten as Labor leader casts doubt on the validity of the vote. I note that Senator Dastyari would not provide comment on this story to The Sydney Morning Herald. I am surprised that Senator Dastyari has not made a statement to the Senate to personally explain this situation and what he knew about the machinations of his staff member. I call on the senator to do so.
