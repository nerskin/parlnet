"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,1999-08-31,"—My question without notice is directed to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Does the government agree with noted Pricewaterhouse tax expert Mr Geoffrey Lehmann's analysis that GST input tax credits are assessable income? For example, is it the case that if a business has $110,000 worth of GSTable sales and $99,000 worth of GSTable expenses then the taxable profit will be $11,000, which includes the $1,000 of net GST which will have been remitted to the ATO? Why then is the government conning small business into believing that they will not bear the burden of the GST when a noted tax expert, unlike the Assistant Treasurer, is claiming that they will? Isn't this extra taxing of small business by stealth?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Input Tax Credits</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,1999-08-31,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Maybe I should be clear and unambiguous in this question because I think that small business will be interested in the answer that the government gives. Will the minister guarantee that the net payment of GST will be tax deductible and therefore ensure that GST input tax credits are not assessable income? That is clear and unambiguous.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Input Tax Credits</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-08-31,"—I think that it is well worth while to make a few general comments on what the senator raised. If we go back into the history of tax reform, one of the driving forces behind tax reform was small business. One of the reasons that they wanted to have tax reform is that they saw that the current tax system supported by Labor was an absolutely unholy mess. That is what they saw. They wanted this government to move forward, as did the farmers, medium sized business and big business. They wanted this government to move forward and make sure that there was reform of this tax system. Let me make it quite clear that one of the big beneficiaries of tax reform is small business. We are taking billions of dollars of costs off business as a result of tax reform. We are taking billions of dollars of the cost of exports off business as a result of this tax reform. We are delivering huge tax cuts to taxpayers as a result of tax reform. Can I make it clear that we are giving 
 real rises in pensions and benefits as a result of tax reform.
We went to the election on tax reform, and there was one group that supported us very strongly in relation to tax reform, and that was small business. There is one group that continues to support us strongly in relation to tax reform, and that is small business.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. The question as I heard it was a question about whether input tax credits are assessable income. That was the question.
—No, it wasn't.
—Yes, it was. That was absolutely the question that was asked. What we are getting is a tour, and a very feeble one, of the government's reasons for introducing a GST. Madam President, can you ask the minister, who has got only about a minute to go now, or a bit more, to please answer the direct question that has been put to him rather than fill up the available time with useless rhetoric that is probably erroneous in any case?
—There is no point of order.
—I was asked about the impact of tax reform on small business, and that is exactly what I am giving you.
—No. Input tax credits as assessable income. Answer the question, why don't you? Stop running away from it. You don't know the answer, do you. If you don't know the answer, sit down.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. It simply cannot be acceptable to this chamber to have hysterical outbursts of the nature that Senator Cook has just imposed on us on a number of occasions. I would very much urge you to indicate to him that that sort of behaviour is totally unacceptable. He is out of control.
—I was about, before the point of order was taken, to draw your attention to the standing orders, Senator Cook. Your behaviour is unacceptable.
—I raise a point of order, Madam President. It is one of relevance. There was a clear question asked here. It is 
 relevant that in this chamber, in which the government is supposed to be accountable, we get an answer to the question put. If the government refuses to answer it and filibusters, wastes time and dodges the answer, it is no wonder that we on this side get a bit testy. Would you direct the minister to actually answer the question that was put to him and not pad out and hide his answer between irrelevant details?
—On the point of order, Madam President: it was very clear from the question that I was asked about the impact of the GST on small business. I have outlined in detail the particular response that is required. If there is other information that the senator wants, we will always try to assist.
—You weren't asked that question, and you know it.
—I was asked about small business, and that is the answer I am giving.
—Order! The minister must relate to the subject matter that is given. Have you completed your answer, Senator?
—No, thank you, Madam President. I have not completed by answer. Madam President, can I also make the point that small business do not want to do one thing. Do you know what small business do not want to do? They do not wish to go back to the wholesale sales tax system that was part of Labor's policy. For a Labor member of the Senate to get up and attempt to pretend that small business will not benefit from tax reform is quite wrong. They are big winners, as are indeed taxpayers, as are indeed pensioners.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Input Tax Credits</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-08-31,"—I inform Senator Harris that the office of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided me with some information that answers his question earlier today. An investigation into complaints of vibration and 
 stability problems was announced in December last year, as Senator Harris rightly said. The Federal Office of Road Safety did receive those complaints. Road User International, consultants to the department, are conducting the investigation. The time required for the work has increased significantly because of the technical complexity of the issues raised and some legal action taken by owners of the vehicles involved.
A draft interim report detailing complaints received and the overall investigation process was distributed to owners, manufacturers and interested parties for comment in June 1999. The report is also publicly available via the Internet. Thirteen vehicles have been inspected and test driven, and instrumented testing of five of these plus a further two benchmark vehicles is now complete. Work is now progressing on simulation analysis and preparation of a draft final report. I am advised that the draft final report is expected to be completed very shortly. It will be circulated to interested parties for comment before a final report is produced and submitted to the department. I will ask Mr Anderson's office to make sure that Senator Harris receives a copy of the final report when it is available.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Transport: Heavy Vehicles</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-08-31,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Coal Mining Legislation Amendment (Oakdale Collieries and Others) Bill 1999, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Statement of reasons for introduction and passage in the 1999 spring sittings.
COAL MINING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (OAKDALE COLLIERIES) BILL 1999
Purpose of the Bill
To amend the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 so as to enable and require payments from the Fund (previously established by the Act) to certain former employees in the black coal industry, particularly former employees of Oakdale Collieries Pty Limited, in respect of outstanding entitlements arising from the termination of their employment (where the employer has entered administration or liquidation on or after 1 January 1999).
To amend the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 so as to remove the statement of the purpose for which the levy under this act was originally imposed, given the amendments to the Funding Act which will enable the Fund to provide payments in respect of the entitlements other than long service leave, in the specific cases of these closures,
Reasons for urgency
Without this legislation, former employees of the Oakdale and Merrywood Collieries would be unlikely to receive more than a small share of their entitlements. Employees are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the absence of payments since the termination of their employment in respect of entitlements other than long service leave. The Government is committed to securing payment of outstanding entitlements for these employees as soon as possible.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-31,"—To refresh the committee's memory, at the moment we are dealing with the Labor amendments which would ensure that regional forest agreements from the mainland would be able to be vetted by each house of parliament. There are exceptions. They are the regional forest agreements for East Gippsland and the Central Highlands of Victoria, which for reasons which are unfathomable have been left off the list.
Tasmania, which suffers two-thirds of the export woodchip industry eating into its forests, is also left out. That is because of the power of the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania to insist that the woodchippers' rights are pre-eminent in that state. Although world heritage forests are at stake, including 
 enormous tracts of rainforest—and these are now ending up on the woodchip piles on the Burnie wharf en route to the Japanese paper mills—the Bacon government, which says it is in favour of making sure this industry works to the benefit of Tasmania, does not want the Senate or the House of Representatives to look at that agreement.
I reiterate here that hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money is going into this regional forest agreement process. It is unconscionable—to use the last word I used before this debate broke off yesterday—that the government should say to the taxpayers of Australia, `Well, we are putting hundreds of millions of dollars of your money basically into infrastructure to support the job shedding woodchip industry, but we don't want parliament to account for it.' I cannot think of any other example of such enormous amounts of money being out of the reach of parliamentary survey.
The Democrats moved an amendment to ensure that the Tasmanian, East Gippsland and Central Highlands RFAs were included but, though I supported that amendment, it failed in the Senate last night. So we are left with the regional forest agreements in the rest of the country to be at least vetted by the Senate. You will note that overnight I have added a new amendment here. I draw that to the government's and opposition's attention. Hopefully, through that, we will avoid the problem we have just been dealing with on native title. This amendment is to ensure that, where regional forest agreements are vetted by the Senate—
—Are you moving an amendment to the opposition amendments?
—No, I am foreshadowing an amendment, Chair. The amendment is to ensure that there will not be a similar situation arise where the Prime Minister gets together with the Premier after the Senate has vetted the regional forest agreement and changes it. So I ask the opposition in particular to look at that overnight for consideration tomorrow, because it is an important amendment to this opposition amendment which I will be supporting.
It goes without saying that the Greens have taken charge of defending Australia's forests in this matter. We think that it is reprehensible that the regional forest agreements are being signed without the parliament looking at them. We think it is reprehensible that Australia's forests are not subject to the protection of at least debate in the parliament before the Prime Minister goes off to see the Premier to give them over to the woodchippers. But be that as it may, we amend this bill where we can.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1999-08-31,"—Tonight I would like to speak again, as I have before, about the fringe benefits tax and the impact it has had in the more remote areas of Australia, particularly the north-west of Western Australia where I have a particular interest. It has to be said that the impact of the fringe benefits tax on development in the north of Western Australia has been quite devastating and has had a very negative impact on regional development. It has led to the loss of population in the north of Australia and led to the development of fly-in fly-out operations, which has meant that new towns have not been created.
Most importantly, I would like to make the point tonight that, while the problems caused by the fringe benefits tax on the pastoral and mining industries in the more remote areas of Australia have been well recognised, the fact is that all businesses and non-taxable institutions, like local government, development commissions and so on—other independent non-taxable bodies in these areas—have also suffered very deleterious effects because of the fringe benefits tax.
The mining and petroleum industry in Australia provides around 82,000 direct jobs and 327,000 indirect jobs and, indeed, it makes a massive contribution to the Austral 
 ian economy. The industry contributes some $60 billion annually to Australia's export markets, or 30 per cent of Australia's total exports. Mining and related industries generally operate in regional and remote areas of our country and, of course, are a big feature of the economy of the North-West of Western Australia. In recognition of the contribution that mining and related industries make to Australia's regional and national economies, and the potential these industries have to provide employment in regional and remote areas, the government has sought to exempt the mining industry from the fringe benefits tax on housing and matters associated with housing, like electricity for airconditioning. That was done in the last budget. In the previous budget, of course, the pastoral industry was exempted from the fringe benefits tax. While that is something I applaud and I think is a very important step—and it will certainly be a very important point in encouraging regional development—there is a very anomalous situation, as I said in my introduction, when it comes to small businesses in remote areas and businesses which might be associated with mineral extraction but not actually doing so by mining, such as the salt industry.
As far as small businesses and local government are concerned, you can have a town like Broome or Karratha or Kununurra where mining industry people have houses and the large mining companies are exempt from the fringe benefits tax paid on subsidies provided to their employees for housing and to cover the cost of electricity. But a subcontractor to those mining companies, or a body like local government—which also has to attract people to those areas and has to offer housing, electricity subsidies, cars, return air fares and so on—not only has to bear the cost of providing those attractions but also has to pay fringe benefits tax on them. This means that small business and non-taxable institutions like local government are put at a huge disadvantage in terms of the extra cost burden they have to bear in bringing people to the remote areas of Australia.
I think it is time that situation was considered and reformed, because it means that 
 there is a significant inhibiting factor to regional development while those types of businesses and organisations are subject to fringe benefits tax. In fact, when one looks into the matter, one finds that in other countries that have a fringe benefits tax, like the United States, Canada and South Africa, the importance of not hindering regional development is recognised in their fringe benefits tax regimes and specific exemptions are made for all businesses, tax exempt organisations and institutions in remote areas so that they do not have to bear the additional cost burden that a fringe benefits tax puts on them in these areas.
I think that in this present atmosphere, where the whole of our tax regime is under review, it would be a very significant step forward for the Australian government to consider exempting all businesses in remote areas from fringe benefits tax on housing and on benefits which are required to attract employees to remote areas, because the people in remote areas, of course, are engaged in regional development. They are often playing a vital part in providing services to the major industries, which are usually the mining industries in those areas, and it is very important that they are encouraged in every possible way.
The Pilbara Development Commission recently published a report on the negative impact of the fringe benefits tax on regional development in the Pilbara. The report stated:
The present system of FBT in Australia has had a significantly negative impact on the development of the Pilbara since the introduction of this tax in 1986. Economic modelling results indicate that without FBT (and assuming an increase in income to compensate for FBT) the gross output of the region would have been 3.4% higher than under the existing system, over 670 additional jobs (supporting 1400 residents) would have been created, and an additional $14.5 million would have been invested and over $413 million in additional consumption expenditure would have been incurred. This is equivalent of an additional $50,000 for every retail establishment in the region. It is estimated that FBT costs business enterprises the equivalent of four jobs per establishment.
I think that is something we should all regret very much, because it shows the extent to which the fringe benefits tax is hindering 
 regional development.	 A recent visit by Dampier Salt brought to my attention another anomaly in the present fringe benefits tax exemption regime. Dampier Salt has plants in the north of Western Australia which produce salt by evaporating sea water. They run sea water into large pans and that is evaporated down to salt, which is then harvested. They also have, near Carnarvon, a plant where they mine salt from a salt lake. For the plant near Carnarvon, the housing of its employees is FBT exempt because the salt is mined. In Karratha and Dampier, where they produce salt by an evaporation process, Dampier Salt has to pay fringe benefits tax on all the benefits paid to its employees, including housing. In the same streets as its employees there are homes of Woodside and Hamersley Iron employees. Those companies do not pay fringe benefits tax on the benefits paid to their employees in terms of housing because they are defined as mining companies.
This is an important issue in terms of regional development. I very strongly believe that, in the interest of promoting regional development, we should follow the example of Canada and provide exemptions for fringe benefits tax on all businesses and tax exempt organisations in the remote areas of Australia.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Fringe Benefits Tax </title>,Adjournment,12,1,speech
