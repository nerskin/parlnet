The PRESIDENT
 (10:01):  This morning I tabled a copy of an order of the Court of Disputed Returns dated 10 March this year declaring Panagiotis Georgiou duly elected as a senator for the state of Western Australia in the place for which Rodney Culleton was returned. Senator Georgiou's term commenced on the date of the order; however, I am advised that he will not be attending the Senate this week but hopes to be well enough to join us next week.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (10:02):  I would like to speak on this very important piece of legislation—the Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. It is probably widely known to, particularly, representatives in this chamber who move through airports on a regular basis—internationally and domestically—how important transport security is. Maintaining a modern system of transport security is a critical function of any government. Recent history illustrates the need for ongoing vigilance, especially in the aviation and airport sector. Labor has a very strong view that aviation security must always come before partisan politics. This legislation provides some simple but necessary changes that will ensure Australia is up to date with the modern system of transport security.


Australia is a signatory to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention, which governs international aviation. Recently, ICAO—the body which is established under the Chicago Convention—increased standards for screening of persons, goods and vehicles in security controlled zones and airports, and there is a need for Australian legislation to be updated to reflect this higher standard. The important point is the increased security in cleared zones.


In a previous life plus one, I actually worked at an airport for over a decade, and I have to tell you that the security in those days was hit-and-miss and problematic, but we lived in a much more benign environment. It has improved strongly since the seventies. The introduction of the aviation security industry card was a very positive step, but what happened alongside the growth of the airline industry was the introduction of a much more competitive framework which meant that employment standards for people in the aviation industry changed—or, arguably, at least their take-home pay dropped. So you had much more part-time employment, much more casual employment and much more competition in the catering sector that supplied airlines. You had competition introduced into the baggage-handling sector of supply of airlines and competition introduced into the freight-forwarding sector. So a plane gets off the ground with a full complement of passengers sitting in seats, and below deck there is an enormous amount of cargo, mail and the like.


There are a number of disparate sectors that combine, if you like, to make that efficiency happen in the economy. Naturally enough, through a free and open market economy, competition to provide those services has increased, and, arguably, it has increased the number of people accessing secure zones at airports. In fact, that is not an argument—that is a fact. The number of people accessing secure zones at every airport in Australia has increased. What has not increased, in my view, is the level of scrutiny and insurance. To be perfectly frank, in the old days it was a great job and you did not stuff it up. These days, it is much more of a part-time—indeed even casual—type of employment. Unfortunately, that degree of competitive pressure increases the potential for risk.


I can remember when the ASIC was introduced. I can remember an actual case with an Australian soldier. He served in the Australian Army working for a freight-forwarding company. He had been working for the company for three years. He could not get an ASIC. It took an inordinate amount of time for him to get an ASIC clearance, and the reason, quite simply, was his surname. His surname was one that attracted the attention of the authorities who approved the ASICs, and they took an inordinate amount of time to approve it. In that time he was virtually denied the opportunity to work at the airport and in the secure areas.


This legislation will authorise the screening of persons, vehicles and goods which are already in the security zone at an airport. So you will have a card to say you are okay to access an airport, but on a regular basis you may well be scrutinised throughout the course of your duties. At the moment, if people leave Adelaide Airport to go for a break they go through a security section and they do not come back that way. So they take their boots off, go through screeners and, if they have gone outside for a medical appointment or to access the car park, they come back through a secure screening point. All visitors are obviously screened. These are critical functions undertaken very well.


At the moment when you are on the job around the airport unloading, loading, moving baggage and freight, and being a security officer you are not subject to scrutiny inside the airport. Recent events, including the bombing of a Metrojet flight in Egypt in October in 2015 and the attempted bombing of a Daallo Airlines flight in Somalia in February last year, underscore the potential threat. I think Australia is at of the same level of risk as anywhere else, but it would be prudent, given the discovery and prosecution of people who have smuggled drugs into Australia, to make the obvious conclusion that criminal activity may not be just related to those. There have been occasions around the airports of Australia where there has been inside knowledge and inside assistance, and people have been prosecuted for assisting in various nefarious activities—the smuggling in of drugs and the like. So obviously there is a need to increase and authorise the screening of persons.


How each airport will use this authority will be a matter between the airport and the Office of Transport Security. Security plans are approved for each airport, so naturally enough the office will go and have a look at the potential risk and they will come up with a security plan. That security plan will then be put in application. The government has indicated that these new arrangements will apply at nine airports—mainland capitals plus the Gold Coast and Cairns. So obviously someone has done a risk assessment of those airports and security plans will be put in place.


The legislation sits alongside enhanced security awareness training for employees and contractors who work in security zones. That training and awareness is probably where most of the good work that we do can be done—deterrence, deterrence, deterrence. People need to be aware that they need to be approved for entrance into an airport and that they need to qualify for their aviation security identification card. They then need to be absolutely aware that whatever facet of their employment they are undertaking in that secured area can also be security checked. I think this is useful and good legislation.


It is important to note, given developments in the current world environment, that the explanatory memorandum to this bill includes the following commitment in a formal statement of compatibility with human rights. On equality and nondiscrimination it says all people have the right to be treated equally and, in keeping with Australia’s egalitarian screening regime applied to aviation passengers, selection of airline or airport workers, visitors and contractors for screening inside the security restricted areas of airports will be purely random. Individuals will not be selected according to their race, religion, gender or other personal characteristics.


As I said earlier, I was aware of one particular case where a person did not get their ASIC for an inordinate period of time. It impacted on his employment. The person was Muslim. He had served in the Australian Army creditably. He was in the transport industry and when the initial ASIC came in he made representations. We were none the wiser. It was over a six-month period that he was seeking his clearance. No clearance was forthcoming. His job was under jeopardy and pressure.


It is extremely important that when this security checking is undertaken of security cleared people in an airport we do not have any stereotyping searches and we do not have anybody doing anything but introducing it purely at random. It should go across all categories, including management. Mine sites do this particularly well with their drug and alcohol policies. Their staff report to work on a day and if their number comes up they go and do the random relevant drug and alcohol testing. As a bit of advice to people: if you do it on a purely random basis it has an immense deterrent effect. No-one who works in that area can be sure that they are not going to be called up and security checked on that day. So a random basis is robust and effective. Labor is strongly of the view that random testing free of any focus on race, religion, gender or personal characteristics will underpin a much more secure Australian airport environment.


On privacy in a case where a frisk research is necessary, an individual may request that the procedure occur in a private room or within a screened area. A frisk search will always be undertaken by someone of the same gender as the person being searched. Airports and governments need to ensure that arrangements exist for this to occur on those occasions. Given our knowledge of various airports around the world, I am sure the facilities exist to be able to undertake those activities.


This bill, the Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016, also authorises greater delegation of powers under aviation and maritime security legislation, such as powers to approve security plans and variations to these plans. This will permit quicker responses—and I think this is absolutely to the heart of security, that we need to be able to respond efficiently, effectively and quickly. The last thing that operators of airports need is to know the challenge exists and not be able to deal with it quickly. This bill will authorise the greater delegation of powers and permit quicker responses.


While some of the language from the government is around removal of regulatory constraints—red tape removal—Labor believes that transport security is too important to be a mere exercise in extending light-handed regulation. While regulatory settings should always be reviewed, Labor supports this legislation first and foremost because it updates security measures to be consistent with world standards, and because it includes an additional and sensible option that enhances the object of removing threats to aviation security.


In Australia we have an enviable safety record. It is a credit to our existing system of regulation. It is a credit to our workforce in the aviation sector—diligent, hardworking, loyal, alert and aware participants in a vital sector of the economy. Having been a worker in that sector, I can attest to the fact that people are smart, they are alert, they are aware, they do look after their environment, and they do look after their industry as best as they possibly can. This legislation will simply build on that existing record. With more than 150 million passengers flying through Australians skies each year, Labor will always support sensible measures that protect Australian citizens and continue the nation's reputation for airline safety. I know in my own home port of Adelaide that we have seen the introduction of international carriers—I suppose the only nagging concern I have there is that the only international that does not fly out of Adelaide is Qantas: they do not take an international route out of Adelaide. But we know now that we are getting China Southern, and we have Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways, Emirates, Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines. It is one of life's great mysteries why the great name Qantas is not in that space, but perhaps that will fix itself over time.


We believe this bill is sensible, effective, efficient legislation, and we strongly support it. It is vital to the safety of the 150 million passengers flying through Australians skies each year. The legislation builds on what we believe is Labor's strong track record in aviation and airport security. When Labor was in government, we oversaw the strengthening of the security regime applying to air cargo, committing $54.2 million to install X-ray screening technology at freight depots. That is probably paying off as we speak, with the introduction of a lot of the new Middle Eastern carriers who are sourcing fresh fruit, meat and other produce out of Australia. That X-ray facility is probably eliminating a lot of red tape and a lot of hurdles to export for our primary producers. I have certainly seen and heard in the Middle East that they are very satisfied with some of the produce that they are able to airfreight out of our airports.


Labor invested an additional $200 million in the nation's aviation security funding which facilitated the introduction of the new and improved technologies at the airport, including the latest body scanners. Those are in effect at all of our airports—and I am not sure which came first, Australia or overseas, but I certainly had to pass through some scanners on a recent trip overseas. The next generation of multi-view X-ray machines and bottle scanners are capable of detecting liquid-based explosives. If we were able to get away without the 'take out your water bottle'—and we all know the case of someone who is in the queue in front of us, who happens to have transgressed most of the advice that they got before they got to the airport, and they go to the scanner with a bottle of water or oversized liquid containers—perhaps if we did have a proper X-ray proposal that picked up the dangerous things that we are looking for, there would be a couple of benefits there: we would get through the line more quickly, and there would be less waste at the various airports.


In relation to increased policing around airports—as we travel around Australia and the world and we see the additional presence at airports—it is an unfortunate necessity. It is not pretty to see people standing with guns at airports but, unfortunately, it seems to be the way of the world, as we speak. Improved security at regional airports is one area where we probably need to be very vigilant. The size of aircraft operating to some of our regional areas now is not insignificant; I know if they are over 30 tonnes, we need to have security facilities in place. If people are truly looking for a weakness in our system, then it probably is in our regional airports—and probably quite properly, given there have been no incidents and the number of passengers is relatively low. It could be an area of concern, but I am sure that those who own the airports will know to put in place good plans. I am sure that the workforces in those areas will recognise the need for those plans and, provided they are introduced with consultation and cooperation, I am sure that those security plans will be very good. They will continue to protect the 150-odd million passengers that are transported by our aviation industry. I support the legislation before the chamber.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-03-20,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (10:21):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak in support of the Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. This bill will amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to allow people, vehicles and goods to undergo aviation security screening within an area or zone at a security controlled airport. The bill will also amend the Aviation Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to allow the secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development to delegate his powers in the acts to more junior Australian Public Service employees.


The declared purpose of the aviation and maritime acts is to safeguard against unlawful interference with aviation, maritime transport and offshore oil and gas facilities. This bill seeks to introduce measures at Australia's major international airports and ports to mitigate what is known as 'the insider threat'. Airport workers such as baggage handlers, caterers, cleaners and engineers have special access to passenger aircraft so they can carry out their important and valuable roles. However, there is potential for this access to be exploited, either willingly or through coercion, to facilitate an attack against a passenger aircraft and its passengers and crew.


The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, in consultation with the aviation industry, has developed a new model for strengthening airside security at Australia's nine major international airports to address the insider threat and to ensure Australia meets its international civil aviation obligations for airside security. These measures, introduced through the bill, are part of a broader suite of regulatory amendments that give effect to the models three components: controls to ensure people, vehicles and goods entering airside areas at Australia's major international airports are authorised to do so; screening of people, vehicles and accompanying goods entering and within the airside areas of the major international airports to detect unauthorised weapons and explosives; and security awareness training for airport and airline employees, including contractors who regularly work within airside areas at the major international airports.


The bill will introduce regulation making powers into the Aviation Act that will enable people, vehicles and goods to be selected for security screening when they are inside an airside area or zone at security controlled airports. This complements existing provisions in the act that provide regulation making powers for the screening of people, vehicles and goods before they enter an airside security area or zone.


The underlying aim of this bill is sound in that it strengthens security measures regarding airport workers, a surprising number of whom are Muslims or other recently arrived immigrants. However, absurdly, this bill subordinates itself to political correctness by refusing to target profiled high-threat groups for screening, and instead boasts:


All people have the right to be treated equally. In keeping with Australia’s egalitarian screening regime applied to aviation passengers, selection of airport and airline workers, visitors and contractors for screening inside the security restricted areas (SRAs) of airports will be conducted on a purely random basis. Individuals will not be selected according to their race, religion, gender, or any other personal characteristic.


Note that screening is to be conducted not in accordance with the threat advice of the Australian Federal Police and ASIO but on a non-discriminatory basis. According to the government, it seems that being non-discriminatory is more important than complying with the advice of our security and intelligence agencies, more important than saving Australian lives. In other words, according to the government a law abiding Christian Aussie from Toowoomba is considered equally likely to be an airport security threat as the killer of Curtis Chang on the streets of Sydney or the Lindt Cafe killer Man Monis.


The fact is that the only way police or security services solve crimes is by targeting individuals with the most likely threat profiles as a first step. Given that screening resources are limited, preventing security screening on the basis of threat groups necessarily means that resources will be spread too thinly and some dangerous elements are likely to be missed. In other words, genuflecting to the politically correct nonsense that airport security screening must be carried out in a non-discriminatory way actually weakens our ability to identify threats to aircraft security. Given that this will mean that some potential threats to our air security will be missed, political correctness risks the lives of Australian travellers.


In the interests of our air travel safety and that of our children, I implore the government to stand up against political correctness and allow prioritisation of screening of those profiled as members of threat groups such as Islamists, particularly those born overseas. Political correctness does not unite; it separates, disrespects and devalues. Accordingly, I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to remove this politically correct limitation from the bill and allow our security services to use their finite resources to target individuals profiled as members of high-threat groups such as Islamist immigrants from the Middle East.


The effect of these proposed amendments will be to remove the requirements in the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 for security screening to be conducted randomly and to then amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to require that screening of individuals be conducted prioritising individuals profiled as members of high-threat groups in accordance with the advice of the AFP and ASIO. One Nation's sensible and highly necessary amendments will allow our airport security personnel to focus their finite resources on the groups of greatest threat, in accordance with the advice of the Australian Federal Police and ASIO, leading to greatly enhanced security and safety for all law abiding Australians.


The fact is that current airport security laws and regulations suffer from divided aims. They try to provide for effective screening, but this aim is compromised by their efforts to also avoid offending vocal minorities. However, if we want to do everything possible to protect Australian families travelling by air, we need to have a single, clear objective untrammelled by fashionable left-wing deference to other political and control objectives.


The fact is that, however much some here may try to duck and weave, run and hide or try to obfuscate the real issue, politicians who support the politically correct goal of nondiscrimination over the safety of our airports are failing to protect Australian families from terrorists. Let us be clear: only Pauline Hanson's One Nation stands uncompromisingly for doing whatever is necessary to safeguard our families. Only One Nation has the guts to say the things that need to be said and to do the things that need to be done. These amendments are an important part of that commitment from us. Of course, I can see across the chamber increasingly red-faced Greens, on a daily basis already starting to fulminate with confected rage that anyone should dare to question their politically correct shibboleths. But let me be clear: Pauline Hanson's One Nation does not question the Greens' sacred politically correct beliefs at all; we refute them utterly. The very idea that anyone would rather risk the safety and security of Australians than admit that their absurdly naive, rose-tinted vision of the world is a child's fantasy is simply offensive. Actually, it is offensively stupid.


Then of course, there are those who do not actually believe in the Greens' 'kumbaya' nonsense but fear the raised voices and clenched fists of their rent-a-crowd supporter mob and their leftist media allies. Such people know that compromising our security is simply wrong, but they lack the courage to tell the truth for fear that the political correctness lynch mob will come for them. To those senators, for whom folding like umbrellas in the face of every squawking minority has become a way of life, we urge you to take the next evolutionary step and join the ranks of the vertebrates. Carpe diem. The time has come for all of us in this country to stand up against the politically correct nonsense that currently hamstrings our security procedures at all airports.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (10:32):  I thank all senators for their contribution to this debate. The Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 will ensure that Australia's transport security framework remains responsive to the evolving security environment and efficient as the transport sector grows. The bill amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to introduce and strengthen airside security measures at Australia's major international airports and to increase the efficiency of government regulatory assessment processes.


A terrorist attack on Australian aviation could result in loss of life, severe economic consequences, public loss of confidence in both the government and the aviation sector and damage to Australia's reputation as a safe and secure destination for international air travel. The bill will strengthen Australia's already robust aviation security system by allowing the implementation of screening in airside areas. This security screening will be applied to airport workers who have access to passenger aircraft in the course of their employment as well as their vehicles and any items they carry.


This new airside security screening will form part of a package of measures to mitigate the insider threat to Australian aviation, which is planned to be rolled out at Australia's highest risk airports over the next year. Implementation of these measures will be progressive, allowing industry time to undertake any necessary capital works and to hire and train staff. Aviation workers who are subject to security screening under the new arrangements will be afforded the same protections as passengers to ensure they are not subject to racial or religious discrimination and that their privacy is protected. These measures will ensure Australians continue to enjoy safe and secure air travel and that Australia remains at the forefront of international best practice.


The bill also implements measures to allow the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development to delegate his powers in the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to lower level Australian Public Service employees. Given the predicted growth in the transport sector and the evolving security environment, these amendments will give the government administrative flexibility. This will ensure that regulatory submissions can be effectively assessed in statutory time frames and that industry demands can continue to be met. The secretary remains responsible for determining which powers under the acts are appropriate to delegate. Significant and complex regulatory powers will remain at senior levels, while only simple regulatory decisions will be delegated to lower level employees.


I thank members for their very constructive contribution to this debate again and I commend this bill to the Senate.

2A


At the end of section


41

(6) Screening of individuals is to be conducted in accordance with the advice of the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, in general prioritising individuals profiled as members of high threat groups.

Omit ""random"".


As set out in the circulated amendments, on behalf of Pauline Hanson's One Nation, our proposed changes to the Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 will refocus security screening from its current deference to political correctness to the single goal of minimising risk to air travellers by responding to identified threats. Specifically, our amendments to the bill before the Senate seek, firstly, to delete the word 'random' from regulation 3.16D(4) of the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005; and, secondly, to add a subsection (6) to section 41 in part 4 of division 2 of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to state:


Screening of individuals is to be conducted in accordance with the advice of the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, in general prioritising individuals profiled as members of high threat groups.


Currently, airport screening is to be conducted not in accordance with the threat advice of the Australian Federal Police and ASIO but on a non-discriminatory, random basis. This ridiculous situation subordinates screening of the highest risk individuals to the political correct goal of being nondiscriminatory. In other words, this places politically correct ahead of the safety and security of Australian families. This left-wing control madness must end. These proposed amendments will remove the requirement in the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 for security screening to be conducted randomly and then amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to require that screening of individuals be conducted whilst prioritising individuals profiled as members of high-threat groups in accordance with the advice of the AFP and ASIO.


One Nation implores other senators to put the safety of our loved ones first and support our efforts to align our security procedures with those of the Israelis and the Americans, for whom airport security is a non-negotiable priority. In that spirit I commend One Nation's amendments to the chamber.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:39):  I wish to advise Senator Roberts that the opposition will not be supporting these amendments. We believe they would allow racial profiling, pure and simple, an approach that law enforcement and national security organisations, both here and overseas, including the United States, are opposed to. When the police and national security agencies start targeting people based on their race it effectively puts a whole community under suspicion. What is more, it virtually guarantees that the innocent will regularly find themselves stopped for little reason beyond the colour of their skin. Racial profiling can also poison relations between authorities and the community. When minority groups feel they are under constant suspicion they are less likely to pass on information that could be vital to solving crimes and, more importantly, preventing terrorist attacks.


Lastly, as the bill's explanatory memorandum quite rightly states:


All people have the right to be treated equally. In keeping with Australia’s egalitarian screening regime applied to aviation passengers, selection of airport and airline workers, visitors and contractors for screening inside the security restricted areas … of airports will be conducted on a purely random basis. Individuals will not be selected according to their race, religion, gender, or any other personal characteristic.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:42):  The Greens are also opposed to Senator Roberts's amendments. We completely reject the hurtful, hateful racism and Islamophobia contained within the proposed amendments. We know that the so-called Christian Aussie that Senator Roberts referred to as being less likely to be a terrorist is in fact just as likely to be a terrorist as any other race of people in Australia. As the Prime Minister has reinforced today, we live in the most successful multicultural nation in the world. The reason we are the most successful multicultural nation is that we respect and celebrate difference and we know that people, regardless of their background and race, are free to be law-abiding Australian citizens.


If Senator Roberts's amendments were successful, everyone of Muslim background would be much more likely to be screened, regardless of there being no justification for that. We know that it would mean that people would be feeling that division. We know what breeds hatred in our community, and it is the racist, hateful and hurtful positions of One Nation. That is what is breeding hatred. It is, in fact, what is breeding unlawful activity in our community. We know that treating everyone equally, regardless of their background, and encouraging and supporting their sense of being valued by all Australians is what will keep us safe.


The Greens want to send the message to people from all backgrounds in Australia that we consider Australians all equal here. We want to keep everybody safe and we know the way to do that is to treat everybody equally. In measures like this, where we are concerned about the safety of Australians, every Australian has the right to be treated the same and treated as equally as other Australians.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2017-03-20,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (10:02):  I would like to speak on this very important piece of legislation—the Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. It is probably widely known to, particularly, representatives in this chamber who move through airports on a regular basis—internationally and domestically—how important transport security is. Maintaining a modern system of transport security is a critical function of any government. Recent history illustrates the need for ongoing vigilance, especially in the aviation and airport sector. Labor has a very strong view that aviation security must always come before partisan politics. This legislation provides some simple but necessary changes that will ensure Australia is up to date with the modern system of transport security.


Australia is a signatory to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention, which governs international aviation. Recently, ICAO—the body which is established under the Chicago Convention—increased standards for screening of persons, goods and vehicles in security controlled zones and airports, and there is a need for Australian legislation to be updated to reflect this higher standard. The important point is the increased security in cleared zones.


In a previous life plus one, I actually worked at an airport for over a decade, and I have to tell you that the security in those days was hit-and-miss and problematic, but we lived in a much more benign environment. It has improved strongly since the seventies. The introduction of the aviation security industry card was a very positive step, but what happened alongside the growth of the airline industry was the introduction of a much more competitive framework which meant that employment standards for people in the aviation industry changed—or, arguably, at least their take-home pay dropped. So you had much more part-time employment, much more casual employment and much more competition in the catering sector that supplied airlines. You had competition introduced into the baggage-handling sector of supply of airlines and competition introduced into the freight-forwarding sector. So a plane gets off the ground with a full complement of passengers sitting in seats, and below deck there is an enormous amount of cargo, mail and the like.


There are a number of disparate sectors that combine, if you like, to make that efficiency happen in the economy. Naturally enough, through a free and open market economy, competition to provide those services has increased, and, arguably, it has increased the number of people accessing secure zones at airports. In fact, that is not an argument—that is a fact. The number of people accessing secure zones at every airport in Australia has increased. What has not increased, in my view, is the level of scrutiny and insurance. To be perfectly frank, in the old days it was a great job and you did not stuff it up. These days, it is much more of a part-time—indeed even casual—type of employment. Unfortunately, that degree of competitive pressure increases the potential for risk.


I can remember when the ASIC was introduced. I can remember an actual case with an Australian soldier. He served in the Australian Army working for a freight-forwarding company. He had been working for the company for three years. He could not get an ASIC. It took an inordinate amount of time for him to get an ASIC clearance, and the reason, quite simply, was his surname. His surname was one that attracted the attention of the authorities who approved the ASICs, and they took an inordinate amount of time to approve it. In that time he was virtually denied the opportunity to work at the airport and in the secure areas.


This legislation will authorise the screening of persons, vehicles and goods which are already in the security zone at an airport. So you will have a card to say you are okay to access an airport, but on a regular basis you may well be scrutinised throughout the course of your duties. At the moment, if people leave Adelaide Airport to go for a break they go through a security section and they do not come back that way. So they take their boots off, go through screeners and, if they have gone outside for a medical appointment or to access the car park, they come back through a secure screening point. All visitors are obviously screened. These are critical functions undertaken very well.


At the moment when you are on the job around the airport unloading, loading, moving baggage and freight, and being a security officer you are not subject to scrutiny inside the airport. Recent events, including the bombing of a Metrojet flight in Egypt in October in 2015 and the attempted bombing of a Daallo Airlines flight in Somalia in February last year, underscore the potential threat. I think Australia is at of the same level of risk as anywhere else, but it would be prudent, given the discovery and prosecution of people who have smuggled drugs into Australia, to make the obvious conclusion that criminal activity may not be just related to those. There have been occasions around the airports of Australia where there has been inside knowledge and inside assistance, and people have been prosecuted for assisting in various nefarious activities—the smuggling in of drugs and the like. So obviously there is a need to increase and authorise the screening of persons.


How each airport will use this authority will be a matter between the airport and the Office of Transport Security. Security plans are approved for each airport, so naturally enough the office will go and have a look at the potential risk and they will come up with a security plan. That security plan will then be put in application. The government has indicated that these new arrangements will apply at nine airports—mainland capitals plus the Gold Coast and Cairns. So obviously someone has done a risk assessment of those airports and security plans will be put in place.


The legislation sits alongside enhanced security awareness training for employees and contractors who work in security zones. That training and awareness is probably where most of the good work that we do can be done—deterrence, deterrence, deterrence. People need to be aware that they need to be approved for entrance into an airport and that they need to qualify for their aviation security identification card. They then need to be absolutely aware that whatever facet of their employment they are undertaking in that secured area can also be security checked. I think this is useful and good legislation.


It is important to note, given developments in the current world environment, that the explanatory memorandum to this bill includes the following commitment in a formal statement of compatibility with human rights. On equality and nondiscrimination it says all people have the right to be treated equally and, in keeping with Australia’s egalitarian screening regime applied to aviation passengers, selection of airline or airport workers, visitors and contractors for screening inside the security restricted areas of airports will be purely random. Individuals will not be selected according to their race, religion, gender or other personal characteristics.


As I said earlier, I was aware of one particular case where a person did not get their ASIC for an inordinate period of time. It impacted on his employment. The person was Muslim. He had served in the Australian Army creditably. He was in the transport industry and when the initial ASIC came in he made representations. We were none the wiser. It was over a six-month period that he was seeking his clearance. No clearance was forthcoming. His job was under jeopardy and pressure.


It is extremely important that when this security checking is undertaken of security cleared people in an airport we do not have any stereotyping searches and we do not have anybody doing anything but introducing it purely at random. It should go across all categories, including management. Mine sites do this particularly well with their drug and alcohol policies. Their staff report to work on a day and if their number comes up they go and do the random relevant drug and alcohol testing. As a bit of advice to people: if you do it on a purely random basis it has an immense deterrent effect. No-one who works in that area can be sure that they are not going to be called up and security checked on that day. So a random basis is robust and effective. Labor is strongly of the view that random testing free of any focus on race, religion, gender or personal characteristics will underpin a much more secure Australian airport environment.


On privacy in a case where a frisk research is necessary, an individual may request that the procedure occur in a private room or within a screened area. A frisk search will always be undertaken by someone of the same gender as the person being searched. Airports and governments need to ensure that arrangements exist for this to occur on those occasions. Given our knowledge of various airports around the world, I am sure the facilities exist to be able to undertake those activities.


This bill, the Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016, also authorises greater delegation of powers under aviation and maritime security legislation, such as powers to approve security plans and variations to these plans. This will permit quicker responses—and I think this is absolutely to the heart of security, that we need to be able to respond efficiently, effectively and quickly. The last thing that operators of airports need is to know the challenge exists and not be able to deal with it quickly. This bill will authorise the greater delegation of powers and permit quicker responses.


While some of the language from the government is around removal of regulatory constraints—red tape removal—Labor believes that transport security is too important to be a mere exercise in extending light-handed regulation. While regulatory settings should always be reviewed, Labor supports this legislation first and foremost because it updates security measures to be consistent with world standards, and because it includes an additional and sensible option that enhances the object of removing threats to aviation security.


In Australia we have an enviable safety record. It is a credit to our existing system of regulation. It is a credit to our workforce in the aviation sector—diligent, hardworking, loyal, alert and aware participants in a vital sector of the economy. Having been a worker in that sector, I can attest to the fact that people are smart, they are alert, they are aware, they do look after their environment, and they do look after their industry as best as they possibly can. This legislation will simply build on that existing record. With more than 150 million passengers flying through Australians skies each year, Labor will always support sensible measures that protect Australian citizens and continue the nation's reputation for airline safety. I know in my own home port of Adelaide that we have seen the introduction of international carriers—I suppose the only nagging concern I have there is that the only international that does not fly out of Adelaide is Qantas: they do not take an international route out of Adelaide. But we know now that we are getting China Southern, and we have Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways, Emirates, Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines. It is one of life's great mysteries why the great name Qantas is not in that space, but perhaps that will fix itself over time.


We believe this bill is sensible, effective, efficient legislation, and we strongly support it. It is vital to the safety of the 150 million passengers flying through Australians skies each year. The legislation builds on what we believe is Labor's strong track record in aviation and airport security. When Labor was in government, we oversaw the strengthening of the security regime applying to air cargo, committing $54.2 million to install X-ray screening technology at freight depots. That is probably paying off as we speak, with the introduction of a lot of the new Middle Eastern carriers who are sourcing fresh fruit, meat and other produce out of Australia. That X-ray facility is probably eliminating a lot of red tape and a lot of hurdles to export for our primary producers. I have certainly seen and heard in the Middle East that they are very satisfied with some of the produce that they are able to airfreight out of our airports.


Labor invested an additional $200 million in the nation's aviation security funding which facilitated the introduction of the new and improved technologies at the airport, including the latest body scanners. Those are in effect at all of our airports—and I am not sure which came first, Australia or overseas, but I certainly had to pass through some scanners on a recent trip overseas. The next generation of multi-view X-ray machines and bottle scanners are capable of detecting liquid-based explosives. If we were able to get away without the 'take out your water bottle'—and we all know the case of someone who is in the queue in front of us, who happens to have transgressed most of the advice that they got before they got to the airport, and they go to the scanner with a bottle of water or oversized liquid containers—perhaps if we did have a proper X-ray proposal that picked up the dangerous things that we are looking for, there would be a couple of benefits there: we would get through the line more quickly, and there would be less waste at the various airports.


In relation to increased policing around airports—as we travel around Australia and the world and we see the additional presence at airports—it is an unfortunate necessity. It is not pretty to see people standing with guns at airports but, unfortunately, it seems to be the way of the world, as we speak. Improved security at regional airports is one area where we probably need to be very vigilant. The size of aircraft operating to some of our regional areas now is not insignificant; I know if they are over 30 tonnes, we need to have security facilities in place. If people are truly looking for a weakness in our system, then it probably is in our regional airports—and probably quite properly, given there have been no incidents and the number of passengers is relatively low. It could be an area of concern, but I am sure that those who own the airports will know to put in place good plans. I am sure that the workforces in those areas will recognise the need for those plans and, provided they are introduced with consultation and cooperation, I am sure that those security plans will be very good. They will continue to protect the 150-odd million passengers that are transported by our aviation industry. I support the legislation before the chamber.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-03-20,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (10:21):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak in support of the Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. This bill will amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to allow people, vehicles and goods to undergo aviation security screening within an area or zone at a security controlled airport. The bill will also amend the Aviation Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to allow the secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development to delegate his powers in the acts to more junior Australian Public Service employees.


The declared purpose of the aviation and maritime acts is to safeguard against unlawful interference with aviation, maritime transport and offshore oil and gas facilities. This bill seeks to introduce measures at Australia's major international airports and ports to mitigate what is known as 'the insider threat'. Airport workers such as baggage handlers, caterers, cleaners and engineers have special access to passenger aircraft so they can carry out their important and valuable roles. However, there is potential for this access to be exploited, either willingly or through coercion, to facilitate an attack against a passenger aircraft and its passengers and crew.


The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, in consultation with the aviation industry, has developed a new model for strengthening airside security at Australia's nine major international airports to address the insider threat and to ensure Australia meets its international civil aviation obligations for airside security. These measures, introduced through the bill, are part of a broader suite of regulatory amendments that give effect to the models three components: controls to ensure people, vehicles and goods entering airside areas at Australia's major international airports are authorised to do so; screening of people, vehicles and accompanying goods entering and within the airside areas of the major international airports to detect unauthorised weapons and explosives; and security awareness training for airport and airline employees, including contractors who regularly work within airside areas at the major international airports.


The bill will introduce regulation making powers into the Aviation Act that will enable people, vehicles and goods to be selected for security screening when they are inside an airside area or zone at security controlled airports. This complements existing provisions in the act that provide regulation making powers for the screening of people, vehicles and goods before they enter an airside security area or zone.


The underlying aim of this bill is sound in that it strengthens security measures regarding airport workers, a surprising number of whom are Muslims or other recently arrived immigrants. However, absurdly, this bill subordinates itself to political correctness by refusing to target profiled high-threat groups for screening, and instead boasts:


All people have the right to be treated equally. In keeping with Australia’s egalitarian screening regime applied to aviation passengers, selection of airport and airline workers, visitors and contractors for screening inside the security restricted areas (SRAs) of airports will be conducted on a purely random basis. Individuals will not be selected according to their race, religion, gender, or any other personal characteristic.


Note that screening is to be conducted not in accordance with the threat advice of the Australian Federal Police and ASIO but on a non-discriminatory basis. According to the government, it seems that being non-discriminatory is more important than complying with the advice of our security and intelligence agencies, more important than saving Australian lives. In other words, according to the government a law abiding Christian Aussie from Toowoomba is considered equally likely to be an airport security threat as the killer of Curtis Chang on the streets of Sydney or the Lindt Cafe killer Man Monis.


The fact is that the only way police or security services solve crimes is by targeting individuals with the most likely threat profiles as a first step. Given that screening resources are limited, preventing security screening on the basis of threat groups necessarily means that resources will be spread too thinly and some dangerous elements are likely to be missed. In other words, genuflecting to the politically correct nonsense that airport security screening must be carried out in a non-discriminatory way actually weakens our ability to identify threats to aircraft security. Given that this will mean that some potential threats to our air security will be missed, political correctness risks the lives of Australian travellers.


In the interests of our air travel safety and that of our children, I implore the government to stand up against political correctness and allow prioritisation of screening of those profiled as members of threat groups such as Islamists, particularly those born overseas. Political correctness does not unite; it separates, disrespects and devalues. Accordingly, I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to remove this politically correct limitation from the bill and allow our security services to use their finite resources to target individuals profiled as members of high-threat groups such as Islamist immigrants from the Middle East.


The effect of these proposed amendments will be to remove the requirements in the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 for security screening to be conducted randomly and to then amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to require that screening of individuals be conducted prioritising individuals profiled as members of high-threat groups in accordance with the advice of the AFP and ASIO. One Nation's sensible and highly necessary amendments will allow our airport security personnel to focus their finite resources on the groups of greatest threat, in accordance with the advice of the Australian Federal Police and ASIO, leading to greatly enhanced security and safety for all law abiding Australians.


The fact is that current airport security laws and regulations suffer from divided aims. They try to provide for effective screening, but this aim is compromised by their efforts to also avoid offending vocal minorities. However, if we want to do everything possible to protect Australian families travelling by air, we need to have a single, clear objective untrammelled by fashionable left-wing deference to other political and control objectives.


The fact is that, however much some here may try to duck and weave, run and hide or try to obfuscate the real issue, politicians who support the politically correct goal of nondiscrimination over the safety of our airports are failing to protect Australian families from terrorists. Let us be clear: only Pauline Hanson's One Nation stands uncompromisingly for doing whatever is necessary to safeguard our families. Only One Nation has the guts to say the things that need to be said and to do the things that need to be done. These amendments are an important part of that commitment from us. Of course, I can see across the chamber increasingly red-faced Greens, on a daily basis already starting to fulminate with confected rage that anyone should dare to question their politically correct shibboleths. But let me be clear: Pauline Hanson's One Nation does not question the Greens' sacred politically correct beliefs at all; we refute them utterly. The very idea that anyone would rather risk the safety and security of Australians than admit that their absurdly naive, rose-tinted vision of the world is a child's fantasy is simply offensive. Actually, it is offensively stupid.


Then of course, there are those who do not actually believe in the Greens' 'kumbaya' nonsense but fear the raised voices and clenched fists of their rent-a-crowd supporter mob and their leftist media allies. Such people know that compromising our security is simply wrong, but they lack the courage to tell the truth for fear that the political correctness lynch mob will come for them. To those senators, for whom folding like umbrellas in the face of every squawking minority has become a way of life, we urge you to take the next evolutionary step and join the ranks of the vertebrates. Carpe diem. The time has come for all of us in this country to stand up against the politically correct nonsense that currently hamstrings our security procedures at all airports.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (10:32):  I thank all senators for their contribution to this debate. The Transport Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 will ensure that Australia's transport security framework remains responsive to the evolving security environment and efficient as the transport sector grows. The bill amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to introduce and strengthen airside security measures at Australia's major international airports and to increase the efficiency of government regulatory assessment processes.


A terrorist attack on Australian aviation could result in loss of life, severe economic consequences, public loss of confidence in both the government and the aviation sector and damage to Australia's reputation as a safe and secure destination for international air travel. The bill will strengthen Australia's already robust aviation security system by allowing the implementation of screening in airside areas. This security screening will be applied to airport workers who have access to passenger aircraft in the course of their employment as well as their vehicles and any items they carry.


This new airside security screening will form part of a package of measures to mitigate the insider threat to Australian aviation, which is planned to be rolled out at Australia's highest risk airports over the next year. Implementation of these measures will be progressive, allowing industry time to undertake any necessary capital works and to hire and train staff. Aviation workers who are subject to security screening under the new arrangements will be afforded the same protections as passengers to ensure they are not subject to racial or religious discrimination and that their privacy is protected. These measures will ensure Australians continue to enjoy safe and secure air travel and that Australia remains at the forefront of international best practice.


The bill also implements measures to allow the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development to delegate his powers in the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to lower level Australian Public Service employees. Given the predicted growth in the transport sector and the evolving security environment, these amendments will give the government administrative flexibility. This will ensure that regulatory submissions can be effectively assessed in statutory time frames and that industry demands can continue to be met. The secretary remains responsible for determining which powers under the acts are appropriate to delegate. Significant and complex regulatory powers will remain at senior levels, while only simple regulatory decisions will be delegated to lower level employees.


I thank members for their very constructive contribution to this debate again and I commend this bill to the Senate.

I have actually been away for the past week, and I have not been reading the Townsville daily bulletin. Senator Macdonald is not here, but I very seldom disagree—



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Wong, can you just be silent for a moment, so I can concentrate on your colleague's question. I very seldom disagree with anything that Senator Ian Macdonald has to say, because I find him to be a very wise member of this chamber. But, Senator Moore, since you raised the question about penalty rates, let me remind you what the effect upon the penalty rates of certain categories of workers has been as a result of the kinds of dirty, behind-the-shed union deals of which the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, is such a champion. 


We learned in the press this morning that a typical KFC worker would, as a result of the Fair Work Commission's determination of some days ago, receive an hourly rate of $24.30, but they will not be receiving that, as a matter of fact, because the relevant union has traded away their penalty rates so that they only receive an hourly rate of $21.19. As a result of the dodgy deals over which Mr Shorten and his mates in the trade union movement preside, those workers at KFC are more than $3.10 an hour worse off than they are under the new rates set by the Fair Work Commission for Sunday penalty rates. 



And it is not just KFC. Let me give you another example from the fast food sector, and that it is a McDonald's worker— (Time expired)

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:02):  That is not what we say. What we do say is that we respect the independent umpire, the Fair Work Commission, and so should you. I do not feel abashed at all in saying that you too, on the Labor side, should respect the independence of the Fair Work Commission, because it used to be the position you all took. It used to be the position you all took. In fact, it was the Gillard government that set up the Fair Work Commission in 2009, and Mr Shorten as a minister in the Gillard and Rudd governments is on the record on numerous occasions saying that the Fair Work Commission is an independent arbiter, it is an independent umpire and its decisions ought to be respected by all parties. So it is not the government that has changed its attitude to the Fair Work Commission, Senator Moore—through you, Mr President. It is you and those on your side of politics who used to say the Fair Work Commission's determinations should be respected and now you say they should be legislatively reversed.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:04):  Senator Moore, once again, I am surprised that you raised this issue, because it is the union that represents hospitality workers and workers in the food sector which has bargained away their penalty rates to a level significantly lower than they would have received under the new determination by the Fair Work Commission some weeks ago. I gave you an example of the KFC worker who will be $3.11 worse off as a result of the agreement the union negotiated than he or she would be under the new Sunday penalty rate arrangements determined by the Fair Work Commission. 


Let me give you another example from the same sector—a McDonald's worker. Under the Fair Work Commission's penalty rate determination, a McDonald's worker would receive a Sunday penalty rate of $24.30 per hour, but, under the arrangements negotiated for them by their union, the union-sanctioned pay rate is only $21.08 an hour—$3.22 an hour less.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Moore and Cameron today relating to penalty rates.


Senator Brandis was his usual self today. His mind was not on the job. We all know he wants to head off somewhere else, whether that is London or Washington, on some job that the Prime Minister gives him. He will not deal with the real issue here. The real issue is that thousands upon thousands of workers in this country will have their pay cut as a result of the penalty rate decision by the Fair Work Commission and the refusal of this government to stand with Labor and ensure that those workers' pay rates are maintained.


Senator Brandis immediately moved to the class-war issue when I raised the question of the lowest paid workers in this country having their take-home pay reduced. I am one of the few—there would be others—blue-collar workers in this place who have actually had to rely on penalty rates in my working life. I did not rely on penalty rates to get myself through university; I relied on penalty rates to feed my family. That is what my penalty rates did. It was not about saving the family trust fund from paying out a bit for the BMW to get me off to university; it was about putting food on the table, getting the kids off to school and putting shoes on their feet. That is what penalty rates did for me and my family, and that is why penalty rates are so important.


The commission has got it so wrong. The commission recognises that this will create hardship for Australian workers. This will create hardship for up to 700,000 Australian workers who stand to lose $77 a week. This is at the same time when this government is prepared to hand over $50 billion to its mates in the big end of town. Tax cuts for the big end of town; wage cuts for ordinary workers—that is what this mob are about. They have got no idea. They are an absolute rabble. They are too busy looking at theoretical arguments on anything other than the issues that are important for Australian workers.


One of the graphs I saw in the fair work decision shows the financial hardship percentage for workers in the fast-food industry. It says 41.5 per cent of workers in the fast-food industry, who stand to lose $77 a week, cannot pay their rent. Some 41½ per cent cannot pay their rent now and yet they are going to get their penalty rates cut. That is absolutely outrageous. It says that 15.6 per cent find difficulty in raising $3,000 in an emergency and 17.6 per cent could not raise $3,000. This is simply a statistic for this lot over here. The same as deaths on building sites are statistics. All they think about is simply a statistic. They do not look at what is behind it. This is another statistic.


They going to run the argument that, if you simply give business more money, they will create more jobs. That trickle-down effect has never worked. You know what is going to happen here? Business profits will increase off the back of the poorest people in the country and they will not employ more people. Workers will only get longer hours at lower rates. This is an outrageous attack by the Fair Work Commission on ordinary workers. It is a bad decision and this mob should be supporting Labor in turning it around.


This is some of the lowest paid, most insecure and most vulnerable workers in Australia having almost 10 per cent of their wages cut. If it were 10 per cent of the wages of a backbencher over there, they would soon be whingeing and screaming about it but, if it is a poor worker, they do not give a damn. (Time expired)

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:11):  You always know when Senator Cameron has got nothing to say—he attacks the person. Sure enough, true to form, who was he attacking today because of the emptiness of his argument? Senator Brandis. I look back to the Golden Slipper on the weekend when She Will Reign burst out and had a win and Winx had its 16th win. If the Fair Work Commission were a racehorse, who would we be pinning it home on? Who owns the Fair Work Commission? The Labor Party. Who trained the Fair Work Commission? The Labor Party. Who rode the Fair Work Commission? The Labor Party. And who was the Chairman of Stewards and the appeal committee of the Fair Work Commission? The Labor Party. It is the creation of the Labor Party under the prime ministership of Ms Gillard. Indeed, the hands-on trainer was none other than the masterful trainer Mr Bill Shorten. They created the Fair Work Commission and stacked it with their own from top to bottom, but the story gets even better.


Mr President and those in the public gallery, do you know what the then minister Mr Shorten did after he had brought in the Fair Work Commission with Ms Gillard? He actually caused it to be amended. He caused the Fair Work Act, Senator Paterson, to be amended. Do you know what he wanted the Fair Work Commission to do? He wanted the commission to incorporate penalty rates because they did not previously exist. He wandered into the stable. He did not want to just win this race; he wanted to make it a one-horse race, and even then it fell at the turn and he was not able to get it across the line because specifically he directed, in that amendment to the Fair Work Act, that Chief Commissioner Iain Ross and three others of the ACTU be appointed to incorporate specifically penalty rates into the Fair Work Act.


What do we see today? We see the results of the masterful Shorten performance. The only problem was he trained the horse as a sprinter, not as a stayer.


At the end of a 500-plus page report—a whole ream of typewritten paper—what did Commissioner Ross and his fellow commissioners conclude? They concluded that it was in order to reduce the Sunday penalty rates down to those of Saturday's penalty rates—not to remove them altogether but to bring them back to Saturday rates. What sort of an own goal was it originally for Ms Gillard, for Mr Shorten and now for the Labor opposition in this place? It is the simple fact, as we know, that it is not governments who create jobs; it is employers who create jobs. It is this side of the chamber, it is the coalition, who will champion and continue to champion business, especially small business.


Mr President, you might have to declare a conflict of interest, because you may once have had one of the burgers from the Hobart Burger King franchise of which I was the proud manager. For the information of those on the other side, the vast majority of the 65 staff members who were in my Burger King business were (a) young people, (b) people who otherwise would not have been employed or (c) people who were underemployed.


As the Attorney-General, our leader in the chamber, eloquently spoke of today when he mentioned KFC and McDonald's—and he probably could have included other fast food businesses—it is not those who work full-time all week who are affected with regard to the changes have been made. We know very well it is those who are otherwise underemployed or unemployed who are the beneficiaries of this circumstance.


Again, this is an own goal for the Labor Party. They created the Fair Work Commission. They asked the Fair Work Commission to include penalty rates. The Fair Work Commission included penalty rates. It came up with its conclusion, and this mob have backed the wrong horse.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2017-03-20,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:17):  I learnt two very unfortunate things in today's discussion. One was that the Leader of the Government in the Senate does not follow the Townsville Bulletin when he is travelling overseas, which was quite concerning! I also learnt that if Senator Back puts a metaphor or a simile into the discussion, he will work very hard on it, as he did in that contribution around racing. I was going to look particularly at the impact of these penalty rate cuts on women workers. If I were to fall into your trap, Senator Back, I would be inclined to say 'fillies', but I will not go there!


There has been considerable discussion around the range of workers who will be impacted by the decision of the Fair Work Commission. I would have hoped that the Office for Women was doing the work to look particularly at what is happening to women workers. But so far, as I found out during Senate estimates, that work has not been done by the Office for Women. But it has been done by a number of organisations, who have looked clearly at who is reliant on penalty rates. It is truly concerning for all of us who are all too aware of the impact of gender on wages in this country. When we strive to ensure that we do have gender equity, we are not striving to see who can have the greatest cuts to their penalty rates. What we are talking about is take-home pay and reliance on full take-home pay to be able to meet those standard cost-of-living expenses with which we all struggle. The data indicates that the deepest cuts and the deepest impacts of these reductions determined by the Fair Work Commission are on women workers.


We know for a fact that the industries that are subject to this first round of cuts are dominated by women workers. Retail and hospitality workers are more likely to receive minimum award wages, and are then more likely to rely on receiving penalty rates on weekends to make sure that they are going to have an effective take-home pay. As other costs increase each week, each month and each year, when people who are on a basic award rate are balancing their budgets they find out that penalty rates are what they rely on to be able to make decisions that will impact on their status of living.


It is not wrong to say that, under the hospitality award, the accommodation award and fast food award, 54 per cent of current workers in those industries are women. Under the retail award, one that was particularly noted in the decision that was brought down, 55 per cent are women. Under the pharmacy award, one that we have talked a lot about in some of the discussions in a number of committees, 77 per cent of the workers who are impacted by the Fair Work Commission decision are women. Now we know that there is going to be an ongoing review of other award areas. One of the first that have been identified is the hair and beauty industry award. Eighty-seven per cent of the workers in that industry are women. So there is no doubt that a disproportionate impact of this decision will fall on workers who are women, and that should be acknowledged. In fact, the Fair Work decision has already acknowledged that this will have an impact on all workers.


My argument today is particularly about women workers, and that should be understood by the people who are supporting this decision. I am particularly concerned that this has not been an issue about which the Minister for Employment, who is also the Minister for Women, has been speaking. She supported the decision, as the leader of the government in this place has done, saying that it is a step in the right direction—backing up Senator Macdonald's comment to the Townsville Bulletin, which I am sure you are going to follow up now, Senator Brandis. This is a real impact on workers in our country that, particularly on the data that we have seen, disproportionally falls on women workers.


The Fair Work decision has been made. The government supports that. It is an independent commission—no-one argues with that. But what we say is that in this case we do not agree with this decision. We have indications that workers will be harmed. In fact, the Fair Work Commission has said that workers will be impacted by this decision. What they have not been able to do is say how they are going to mitigate this impact, and how they are going to work with workers to ensure that they will not suffer the kinds of consequences that these cuts will have. This is important and it will affect women.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-03-20,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:22):  I was going to begin my contribution to this debate by pointing out that the real authors and owners of the Sunday penalty rates decision are those opposite, because of course it was under their legislation, by their hand-picked commissioners, that this decision was made. But, once again, Senator Back has outdone me. I could not possibly match his elaborate metaphor, a simile, as Senator Moore pointed out, so I will not go there. But I do note for the record that the decision was made entirely under legislation authored by those opposite. It was made by people predominantly appointed by those opposite and particularly by the Leader of the Opposition.


I will focus on why the Labor Party has walked away from their support for the independent umpire, when it comes to setting wages. As Senator Moore said in her contribution, they respect the independent umpire, just not when it makes decisions like this, when it makes decisions they disagree with. It occurred to me that that was very similar to an argument that was made in the media last week by another person associated with this debate, the new head of the ACTU, Sally McManus. She said we should abide by the law unless of course we do not agree with the law. Laws should be abided by as long as we agree with them, but if we disagree with them, if we think they are unjust, we should not abide by them. That is the modern union movement. That is the modern Labor Party: 'We will abide by decisions of the independent umpire if we agree by them. We will abide by the law if we agree with it. But if we do not we will go and do our own thing.' Take that into account the next time you hear that they support the independent umpire.


I am looking forward to further contributions in this debate, because one thing I have not heard yet from those opposite is why they think a Sunday is more special than a Saturday. I agree, people who are working on a weekend should be paid more. That is a fair and reasonable thing, and this decision will preserve that. But what is special about a Sunday that differentiates it from a Saturday? Of course, the historical reason that Sundays and Saturdays were treated differently is because Sunday is the Sabbath. Many people of religious faith believe that it is not moral to work on the Sabbath and that it should be prevented, and if it cannot be prevented it should at least be penalised and discouraged, as penalty rates do. Surely, the modern Labor Party in 21st century, multicultural, multi-ethnic, multireligious Australia is not seriously saying that people who have no special religious observance on a Sunday should be penalised if they want to open their small business or if they want to employ someone? I look forward to hearing from them why a Sunday is so special compared to a Saturday.


The Labor Party are not opposed to cutting penalty rates full-stop; they are only opposed to penalty rates being cut when that is being done by the Fair Work Commission. If it is done by a union in negotiation with a business they could actually be quite happy about that. In fact, you will rarely hear them come here and talk about the union deals with big business that trade away penalty rates. As we have seen in the media today, and as Senator Brandis and Senator Cash pointed out in their answers to questions today, there are union negotiated EBAs which do not just cut Sunday penalty rates a little bit—do not just temper them a little bit or bring them into line with Saturday rates—but actually cut them quite radically. The KFC EBA reduces it from $29.16 an hour, which is what is required under the award, to only $21.19—that is an $8-an-hour cut. The McDonald's EBA similarly reduces it from $29.16 an hour to $21.08 an hour—a very significant cut.


I have not yet heard any of those opposite criticise the unions that negotiated those deals. Perhaps that says something, because a modern union leader cares much more about the number of members the union has and the amount of money it has then what its members are paid, because what really matters for a modern union leader is the influence that comes from having more members and more money. It gives you more votes in internal Labor Party forums. It gives you more money to spend on campaigns to ensure your mates are elected to federal parliament and to ensure that perhaps you yourself one day will leave the union and enter federal parliament. So they are willing to do deals with big business that cut workers pay in exchange for—sometimes, that we have heard, in the case of Clean Event and Chiquita Mushrooms—financial payments from those unions or, perhaps, in other cases, in other industries, cosy relationships with big businesses like Woolworths, Coles, McDonald's and KFC, who are very happy to have a cosy relationship with the union that helps facilitate union membership and encourages their employees to join unions in exchange for a favourable deal that allows them to pay those workers less. I do not know why a union that really had at heart the best interests of its members would agree to such a deal. The only reason it would do that is if there was a benefit to them as union officials rather than to their union members. That brings me very neatly to the reforms proposed by Senator Cash today. I commend them in the future to this chamber.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2017-03-20,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (15:27):  George Orwell would be very proud of that contribution from Senator James Paterson. It was an extraordinary distortion of the facts and the truth. Here we have a situation where, all of a sudden, it is the Labor Party's position, that it was the Labor Party's intention to do this. I say to Senator Paterson, Mr President, that he will have an opportunity to vote against these cuts when they come before the Senate. If he actually believes that we wanted the penalty rate cuts and those on the other side of the chamber did not want them, he will have an opportunity to vote against them, to oppose them. If he also says that employers and unions should not be able to jointly negotiate overall wages and salaries that pass the better-off-overall test, that pass the independent umpire, I would be very happy to see an amendment from senator Paterson that actually outlaws that. I would be happy to support an amendment enshrining penalty rates when the bill comes before the Senate. If he wants to attach an amendment to that bill to say that you cannot trade penalty rates in any form, absorb them into overall rates, annualise salaries or even-out those salaries over a period of time, I would be more than happy to support it. Let us take penalty rates completely out. If that is what he is saying to business, that we do not want the opportunity to be able to do that, that is fine. Let him say that. But let him actually say that in the form of an amendment, not by just mouthing it over there. Let him actually move an amendment. I would be happy to support that and I would encourage my party to support that 100 per cent. That would actually clean up some of that.


What he misses completely is that no-one in this place relies on penalty rates. The people who rely on penalty rates are some of the people who are doing it the toughest in our community. They are people who often are not full-time people. They are people on casual rates, people on part-time rates, people who in many instances want more work but are not given that opportunity. Instead, they have to rely on penalty rates to make ends meet. We are talking about people who the commission itself identified as suffering hardship from their decision. That is what was missing from that debate. When I heard Senator Paterson and Senator Back talk about these issues I noticed they missed the point. Senator Paterson says, 'Well, why is Sunday any different from Saturday?' Well, let us support a proposition where penalty rates are moved to the Sunday level. That would alleviate some of the hardship that is going to be applied to the people who rely on penalty rates. It is no hardship for me, and it is no hardship for the people on the other side of the chamber. We do not get paid penalty rates. We certainly do not rely on penalty rates and we do not need those rates to put food on the table, to send our kids on excursions, to pay the electricity and gas bill and to pay our rent—let alone a mortgage. People in those circumstances rarely have mortgages as well. This is the other Orwellian proposition that Senator Paterson made and that I will just touch on. Senator Paterson talked about how it was, in fact, the Labor Party's Fair Work Commission and how it was stacked with all our people. He then went on to criticise us for not supporting the independent commission's decision. Well, of course, he cannot have it both ways in that respect either. 


It took the Prime Minister three weeks of flipping and flopping around, wanting to work out where public opinion was going to land, before he would decide whether he wanted to say that, yes, he and his government supported the penalty rates cut, or, no, they did not. He wanted to hide behind the independent commission's decision. It took him three weeks to work it out. And remember that they never abide by independent tribunals' decisions, unless it suits them. When the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal handed down a decision they did not like, not only did they immediately overturn the decision but they also abolished the tribunal. That was their response to the independent tribunal: to abolish it.


Let us ask Professor Triggs how she gets treated as a statutory officer when some decisions come out which they do not like. They 'lose confidence' in the professor and they 'lose confidence' in the commission. We have seen the actions of some senators in Senate estimates in respect to that—absolutely appalling behaviour. This is a terrible decision by the commission and it needs to be overturned. (Time expired)

That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


(i) ticket scalping and the use of software to bypass computer security systems to purchase large numbers of tickets has a detrimental impact on genuine fans who often miss out or have to pay hugely inflated prices for events,


(ii) while there is a benefit in having a secondary market place for consumers to on-sell tickets when they have a legitimate reason to do so, many consumers are not aware that they are buying from a secondary market site as the business practices of many of those sites have the potential to mislead or deceive consumers in relation to their purchase, resulting in consumers purchasing tickets that are not genuine or at a vastly inflated price,


(iii) consumers are generally not able to rely on statutory consumer protections when they purchase tickets from secondary market sites,


(iv) in December 2016, the United States (USA) Congress passed the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act of 2016, which makes it illegal to use software to purchase tickets to popular events,


(v) the United Kingdom (UK) Government is also considering measures that would criminalise the misuse of 'bot' technology to unlawfully obtain tickets to events,


(vi) the UK's Consumer Rights Act requires that key details of tickets offered for resale should be given at the time of resale, including the face value of the ticket, seating area, as well as any restrictions that apply, but Australian consumers have no such protections,


(vii) the Senate Economics References Committee, in its report on ticket scalping in Australia tabled in the Senate in March 2014, identified the negative impact ticket scalping has on consumers, and


(viii) despite the findings of the Senate Economics References Committee, the Government has not made any substantive changes to address the issues identified in the report; and


(b) calls on the Government to introduce legislation to better protect customers from ticket scalpers, following the example of the USA, with their Better Online Ticket Sales Act 2016, and other measures under consideration by the UK Government.


I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator XENOPHON:
  This motion relates to the vexed issue of ticket scalping and the need for a new approach—a national approach—in respect of it. In respect of the amendment I have just moved from the floor, it is, in substance, substantially in the spirit of the former clause 2 of the amendment, but it does make reference to United Kingdom legislation. I do so after discussions—useful discussions—with the opposition. It was their approach that the motion be amended in those terms to make reference to the United Kingdom and to make reference to the need for legislation along the UK and the US lines. It is for those reasons that I move this amendment with such short notice, but it does not affect the substance of the motion because references made to the United Kingdom's consumer rights act in the substance of paragraph 1 of the motion, in particular 1(f). Essentially that is what this is about.

  The Australian Consumer Law already extends to purchasing and onselling tickets. In particular, the prohibition against misleading or deceptive conduct in the consumer guarantee provisions are relevant. There are also a number of state laws and regulations that cover this issue. The ACCC is aware of the issues and will continue to monitor them. Senator Xenophon's minority recommendation in the Senate Economics References Committee report that there ought be federal laws amending the Australian Consumer Law to outlaw ticket scalping was not supported as there was no basis for considering a regulatory response at that time.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-03-20,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (15:52):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, it is incumbent on me to bring to this chamber information about the persecution through prosecution of Christian groups in South-East Queensland. When this MPI was sent forth today, I am sure my colleagues wondered how in 2017 Australian Christians could possibly be persecuted. The persecution and prosecution is real; it is hurtful to freedom of religion and it is serious.


This is Lent. At this time many Christians reflect on the sacrifices that the Lord God and his only son, Jesus Christ, made in the lead-up to his prosecution and crucifixion under Pontius Pilate. It is a time for reflection and to recall the sacrifices we can make in our lives, to become aware of our spirituality and the suffering of others around us. The suffering and sacrifice of South-East Queensland's Christian community is profound. Recently, I met with Reverend Josh Williamson and Ryan Hemelaar. These people are missionaries. They provide Christian outreach throughout South-East Queensland. They evangelise within the guidelines and proper processes prescribed by Queensland's Peaceful Assembly Act. They feed the poor, comfort the dispossessed and shelter those in need with God's love and care.


It will shock our country to learn that these innocent and decent people are targeted by Queensland state governments of various political colours, which aim to stop them from peaceful assembly and then chase them out of town. They are persecuted—that is correct—and prosecuted for religious assembly; I will explain shortly how. At no other point has our nation's Christian community been under such grotesque attack—a vicious, targeted attack.


The Turnbull government's statement on so-called multiculturalism, as outlined on the front page of today's The Australian, still tried to band-aid over the reality that multiculturalism is a failed ideology that strikes at the heart of our proud national heritage. His statement must go further and acknowledge our nation's Christian heritage, a heritage embodied on our beautiful flag. It is now incumbent on this chamber to rally against those who would vilify our Christian community.


This is Australia; it is not Pakistan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia or some other despotic Islamic dictatorship. We must intervene in any way we can if we are to protect Christian dignity, protect the dignity of Australian government institutions, protect freedom of religion and protect Australians from conducting the most basic of services to this community.


This persecution story was recently told in The Courier Mailon 9 February 2017, where it was revealed how intense the harassment of the street preachers is. I am blessed enough to have a street preacher on my team here in Parliament House. He and his family have often worked long days in other jobs and then go forth at night to provide service and healing to the community until late at night. Street preachers, I am told, are hunted down and persecuted everywhere in Australia. One would think that this is in Saudi Arabia; however, it is South-East Queensland that I will pay particular attention to.


Street preachers, from what I have seen, assemble in spots like Brisbane's Queen Street Mall—maybe five to 10 preachers. Sometimes they are Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons; at other times they are a range of other denominations. They set up a little table, place the holy Scripture on it and talk to people who come by. Sometimes they may give a little talk, using a microphone. They talk about Jesus, just as in the same way we use the words of Jesus when we open with prayer in this chamber every day.


On occasions, they may provide literature about the healing, forgiveness and love of Christianity, and on how to obtain help if you are in need of support. I also see the work of Charlie Lin, New South Wales state MP, in pushing back against control-orientated Leftists removing the word 'mateship' in reference to the Kokoda Track as similar to the work of protecting Christians. To deny our national heritage and acknowledgement of important, historical events, such as the Kokoda Track, is no different to prosecuting Christians and campaigning to remove Christian symbols from our flag.


This debate would start to turn the tide against multicultural Marxism, if we were to pull it together. The persecution of street preachers takes many forms. Each street preacher in the information I will provide has applied for a permit under Queensland's Peaceful Assembly Act. They gather under the protection of the law and may not, by act of parliament, be moved on or harassed in the performance of that assembly, just like unions cannot be harassed if they gather, or just like Muslims cannot be—and certainly are not—harassed if they decide to take to the streets of Lakemba, Holland Park or Kerrabee during Friday prayers. Heaven forbid that a unionist or a Muslim in this country ever be brought to heel within the bounds of the law! Local governments, both Labor- and Liberal-orientated, and the Queensland state police, have harassed Christian preachers by issuing fines, illegal move-on notices and charges such as disobeying police orders and intimidation of a police officer.


In Queensland, an umbrella Christian organisation called Operation 513 provides logistical support for about 21 different denominations in the application of permits for street preaching. One of the preachers is Ryan Hemelaar, who is a most unassuming gentleman—polite, amenable and kind. He has been fined by Brisbane City Council for such things as handing out written material, using an amplifier and placing an A-frame sign with a bible verse on it. He has been fined for alleged obstruction; for unreasonably disturbing any person lawfully using a mall by simply having have friendly conversation with someone on a seat; for interrupting, disturbing or frustrating other mall users by simply having a friendly conversation with someone on a seat; for stocking or storing goods in a mall; and for setting up a free bible table. What a charge sheet! His fines have gone into the thousands of dollars—tens of thousands of dollars for speaking up.


Mr Luke Laine is the first of Brisbane City Council's officers who has started the process of targeting these Christian groups, including Mr Hemelaar. Mr Laine is on tape stating that he wanted to close these people down, as if the authorising of state religion was his sole purview. Closing down Christianity is the real aim. It is part of the cultural Marxist march. It is my view that Brisbane City Council and its officers have been loose with the truth when they claimed in The Courier Mail that the street preachers harass people walking by. What a load of lies to say they hurl abuse. Anyone who conducts street preaching knows that if you want to ensure that Christ's message gets through, you cannot go hard at people; we have to emulate the grace, dignity and respect of Christ himself. 


I am told that in most instances these fines were issued after Brisbane City Council officers stood around while Mr Hemelaar had a conversation with someone on a bench—a conversation on a bench! After the chat, Mr Hemelaar gave a card with a Christian message to that person and then the officer went up to the person, asked if Mr Hemelaar had given him anything, and took the card off him and issued a fine. Let that sink in for a minute. A street preacher is fined for doing something you or I could do: apply for a peaceful assembly permit, gather with friends, listen to the community and hear their concerns. But give them a loving message about the word of Christ or perhaps political literature that does not suit with the leftist view of the world, and Brisbane City Council spends ratepayers' money on not only fining these people but also challenging the fines in court. 


The Christian values of these people are targeted by the Brisbane City Council Liberal National Party. The Lord Mayor of Brisbane must urgently rescind these fines and allow these God-loving Christians to continue their outreach. If he does not, I can confirm here and now that One Nation will do everything possible to let the good people of Brisbane know this shameful behaviour at the next local government election. One Nation's march will go right to the centre of Brisbane without fear or favour.


My thoughts and concerns are also with the Reverend Josh Williamson. I notice no-one in the room jumped when I said the Reverend Josh Williamson. Can you believe that Reverend Williamson was charged, on the orders of the Palaszczuk government—Gestapo-like tactics—for disobeying a police order and intimidating a police officer? In being cross-examined by the prosecution, the barrister argued that using the title 'Reverend' when giving his name to the police was intimidation. Contemplate this: government resources are being used to prosecute street preachers for intimidating police officers with the word, 'Reverend'. This is a direct and astonishing assault on Christianity. Our world has gone mad. People wonder, with things like this happening, why One Nation is on the rise. 


Has the Queensland premier prosecuted anyone for the use of the word 'Imam'? Perhaps the word 'Rabbi' offends the extreme left who are now running Queensland? The left, peppered with hateful anti-Semites, will soon use this success in Queensland to turn on the Jewish community—I have no doubt. Does the word 'Father' offend the premier as well? Heaven forbid! Are people free to practise their religion in South-East Queensland under the Peaceful Assembly Act? 


The street preachers are always supportive of the police. One Nation are always supportive of the police. We do not believe that this is a police agenda. I am told that two parties are pushing the police: the first protagonist is the former Deputy Mayor of Logan, Councillor Russell Lutton, who, police told the preachers, was behind pushing the police of Logan to target the street preachers. What an astonishing revelation. You would think a councillor who represented Woodridge, the most socially disadvantaged community in our country, would be more focused on calling the police about break-ins, drug dealings and bashings in his community. Perhaps Councillor Lutton spends a bit too much time down at the TAB watching the dogs. 


My message is clear: One Nation rejects your targeting of street preachers and not the targeting of the violent criminals you seek to protect. Councillor Lutton, you are not a proper and fit person to hold office. Resign. It is the case that the Queensland government could have cut these prosecutions off. The Queensland government are the second protagonist. They could have protected the street preachers but they prefer not. The Palaszczuk government—a far scarier word than 'Reverend'—could have brought on legislation to specifically protect street preachers as defined in the meaning of peaceful assembly, not that it should have been needed. 


It is my view that the Palaszczuk government has contempt for the Christian community and for the poor that community feeds. The Palaszczuk government's hate is palpable. It is the same hate exhibited by the Logan and Brisbane City councils. Shame on these people; shame on their governments. Today, I extend the— 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Roberts, could you resume your seat for a moment. I refer you to standing order 193(3):


A senator shall not use offensive words against either House of Parliament or of a House of a state or territory parliament, or any member of such House, or against a judicial officer, and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly. 


Please reflect on your contributions in respect of members of the Queensland parliament. 




Senator ROBERTS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Today I extend a hand of friendship to the other street preachers who have been persecuted: Blake Cannon, Blessing Odugbesan, Maklin Hughes, John Stotschek, George Youssef, Allan Cameron, David Sansbury, Matthew Andersen, Rebekah Hemelaar, Michael Brimson, Desmond Nunns and Lee-Anne Nissen. We stand with you. One Nation will fight for you. 


We know that people have been slapped with thousands of dollars of fines. People have been intimidated, humiliated, harassed, targeted and, worse, persecuted, yet vicious sects with violent views and threats are left unpunished for far worse crimes. I am told by the preachers that they have spent over $15,000 in defending charges and fines. Costs have been awarded against the government in some preliminary cases, but the costs awarded do not cover all of the legal fees. The prosecution must stop. Imagine if these people were free to spend that money for its original intent: feeding and clothing the poor of South-East Queensland—the poor who have been abandoned by the Palaszczuk government.


Let's imagine this: under the Palaszczuk government, these preachers were actually violent union bosses. Perhaps they could have been heavy-handed thugs, violent criminals roaming work sites and handing out union membership forms to workers in public, perhaps on Labour day. Would the jackboots be sent in by the Premier then to stop the unionists? No. Would one of the Premier's prosecutors ask a unionist sitting in the dock, 'Is using your union title an intimidation of police officers?' No.


I will tell you what Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's minority Queensland government would do. As reported recently in The Australian, she has used the final parliamentary sitting week of last year to reverse a crackdown on unions, including lifting a requirement for union bosses to publish credit-card statements. Premier Palaszczuk has just given thieving union bosses the right to do as they wish with workers' fees. She has just encouraged the likes of Craig Thompson while prosecuting street preachers. If you are a corrupt, violent union boss, Palaszczuk wants to let you free. If you are a violent criminal of Logan, fear not; Councillor Lutton is too busy betting on the dogs to chase you down. But, if you are a street preacher in Queensland, you cannot even tell a police officer you are a reverend. The persecution of street preachers in South East Queensland must stop.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-03-20,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:08):  I want to begin by thanking Senator Roberts for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate and to me. Senator Roberts, I want to work with you. I want to agree with you, but you make it so hard with your speeches.


I want to start on the broad point of principle of what Senator Roberts has come to say, and that is that freedom of assembly and freedom of association should entail that people should have the right to express themselves in an orderly and sensible way within council ordinances and rules in a way that allows them to express faith or whatever else, be it Christianity or another issue. They could be preaching about religion or about an altruistic cause. People do and should have that right.


Beyond that, I think what Senator Roberts has been saying is that, in particular, we need to be careful and make sure that people have the space for religious freedom and have the space to express their religious views, and a public place in Brisbane is the type of place that should be allowed. Furthermore, I believe that what Senator Roberts has been saying is that he feels that the individual targeting of Christian street preachers has been excessive, has gone too far and that their rights and liberties have been impacted.


It is hard to speak too much to the specifics of the individual cases. I know there have been certain matters that have gone to court. I had a chance today to look at some of the court documents. As a point of principle, I think what Senator Roberts is saying is actually correct: we need to make sure there is the appropriate space for people to be able to express their views, express faith, and the permit system that exists around the PAA is an appropriate mechanism where you get the balance right between people being able to get up and express their own religious views in the same way as a trade union or organisation would while at the same time having to fall within certain guidelines about what you can and cannot do. People do also have the right to walk unhindered.


So on one level I agree with the principle of what Senator Roberts is saying. On the specifics—again, I cannot go to all the specifics—again, consider the language that is being used here. To use terms like 'cultural Marxism', to refer to it as 'gestapo', to throw around 'anti-Semitism' rather than trying to come here and have a practical, sensible debate about how we can look at reforming some of these laws to make sure that there is that religious freedom and freedom of association—frankly, I think the language just goes a little too far and becomes counterproductive to what is trying to be achieved.


If Senator Roberts's case is that council officers have gone too far and are not giving people enough freedom of association and that some of their tactics have been heavy handed, from the evidence I have seen and from the speech, I think he has a valid point. But to go and say that this is cultural Marxism, that it is gestapo-like tactics—and, by the way, pick a dictator. Go down the gestapo path or go down the Marxist path, but changing between the two is getting confusing for us lefties over here! But to bandy about those kinds of terms, to talk about this as a demonstration that Christianity has never been under more attack, I think, is just language that goes too far. I think it becomes counterproductive. I think the point that you want to make is a practical point.


I know that Senator Roberts and I are both big fans of multiculturalism and we're both big fans of multicultural Australia! I note that it was today that the government did come out with their multicultural statement. Senator Roberts in his speech highlighted multiculturalism as a failed ideology. I have to pull him up on that. The success of this nation since white settlement beyond the incredible 40,000 years of Indigenous heritage has been on our ability to embrace wave after wave of immigrants and migrants, not our ability to reject them. For us to be able to take the values, the languages, the cultures, the ideas from around the world and, insofar as those values, cultures and ideas do not conflict with our universal values here as a nation, to be able to embrace them is the success of the Australian story.


On this point of freedom and religious freedom, I did want to say this to Senator Roberts and to others. From the floor of the Australian Senate, as a proud Australian with Iranian heritage, today is, as I am sure all senators are aware, Persian New Year, so I say to all my Irani and non-Irani friends, including my fellow Australian senators: eide shoma mobarak. We can come back to my office and we can practise those words together, but eide shoma mobarak. With that, I cede the rest of my time to the Greens senator.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-03-20,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:14):  Eide shoma mobarak! From what I understand, Senator Roberts and One Nation have got us here in the chamber this afternoon to speak about a group called Operation 513. I am told they are in the habit of annoying people in the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane every Saturday night by yelling about a lot, specifically homosexuality. Understandably, it is pretty off-putting, so much so that they have been fined more than $10,000 by the Brisbane City Council, who say there have been complaints that include 'allegations of extreme harassment, with members of the group hurling abuse and insults at passers-by'.


I have spent a lot of today—since I said, 'Yes, I am happy to take part in this matter of public importance'—trying to figure out why this actually is a matter of public importance deserving of the time of the Senate. Why are we talking about a such a local topic in the federal parliament? I spent six years in local government, on Maribyrnong council. If you are concerned about this issue, and the actions of local government, take it up with your council officers, and take it up with your councillors. Why are we debating it here in the Senate today? Then I found that locals have described Operation 513 as a 'fundamentalist, Young-Earth creationist, oddly non-denominational bunch of kids who preach intolerance, anti-science, bigotry and hate speech'. Of course, then it fell into place: what better way to describe One Nation?


It is no coincidence that the group is homophobic, because it sums up the debate about marriage equality. We had an opinion poll come out today that showed that, even in the 12 most conservative electorates of the country, a majority of people want marriage equality. The majority of people in this country want all Australians to be able to marry the person they love. The majority of Australians want all Australians to be able to marry the person they want to spend the rest of their lives with. Then you have the evangelists—no, not the average, everyday churchgoers, because we know that not just the majority of Australians, and not just the majority of people in the 12 conservative electorates of government MPs, but the majority of Australian Christians support marriage equality. But there is a vocal minority who is making life hell for the rest of us. They are trying to loudly impose their antiquated views on anyone who will listen, and on many who will not. It is not surprising that people get fed up with that. It is not surprising that people see them as a public nuisance. They are public nuisances trying to loudly impose their views—views that are only held by a very small minority of Australians—on us.


And then we have the situation with Minister Dutton, who seems to believe that it is okay for business leaders to support him on things he believes in. But, when it comes to them supporting marriage equality, he goes gallivanting around the country yelling like a self-appointed prophet that only he is allowed to have an opinion. 


I was in Brisbane last week, and the people that I talked to had had enough. They do not want to be yelled at in the street. They do want to have commonsense, polite, respectful conversations. They are sick of a group of backward politicians stopping loving couples from marrying. They want to see us all 'get over it', and to allow our parliament to do its job—to have a free vote and legislate for marriage equality. They want marriage equality now. Those people I met in Brisbane last week are representative of the majority of Australians. They want us all to be able to come together respectfully and politely to recognise that this is a matter of love, it is a matter of equal rights, and it is a matter of having respect for everybody; and to allow for the differences that exist between people, and allow people to get married regardless of their gender identity, regardless of their sexuality, and to get on with the rest of their lives. 


We do not need to have bunches of intolerant people yelling at people on the streets of Brisbane, and we certainly do not need to have that debate then imported into this Senate, as One Nation have done today.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-03-20,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:19):  I thought this debate was about freedom of speech, not about so-called marriage equality. All I can say to the previous speaker, Senator Rice, is that, if she had voted the right way a couple of months ago, this would have been a done deal by now. It would be all over and done with. The plebiscite would have been held. The Australian people would have made their decision and advised parliament what it was all about, but the Greens stopped it. The Greens and the Labor Party stopped it, and yet they have the hide to come in here and complain about it. Senator Rice, if you had supported this last year when it came before this chamber, this issue would not be being discussed at the moment. We would have had the plebiscite. The Australian people would have spoken, and whatever they said would now be the law of the land. So do not talk to me about marriage equality. It would have been dealt with by now had it not been for the Labor Party and the Greens. 


Getting on to the subject of freedom of expression and freedom of speech, I walked in and heard Senator Rice using words like 'intolerant', 'hate speech', 'very small minority' and 'loudly imposing their views'. I thought, 'Hello! She is talking about the fake demonstration that was outside my office just last week.' An elected member of parliament, no less, and her paid staff were outside my office in Townsville with a few paid union organisers, yelling and carrying on in an intolerant way, interrupting people going about their normal course of life in Townsville, and rabbiting on about penalty rates—penalty rates which were determined not by me or the government but by the Fair Work Commission, a commission set up by the Australian Labor Party and Mr Bill Shorten, in particular, and asked by Mr Bill Shorten, when he was the minister, to look into this issue of penalty rates. They did that. I pay respect to this commission and I accept its decision, but it was a commission stacked with former union heavies, former union organisers and officials. That is who the commission was. Yet it has heard the evidence, come down and said that there should be some addressing of the penalty rates paid on Sunday. I suspect—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Sorry, Senator Macdonald, resume your seat. Senator Dastyari?




Senator Dastyari:
  I am well aware that we normally allow a fair bit of scope and free range in these debates, but—through you, Chair—I would ask the speaker to try to at least bring it back to the issue at hand. I appreciate that we normally sway a bit, but I think this is perhaps getting a bit too far.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Dastyari. Senator Macdonald, you may resume your contribution.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I always know when my speech is successful, because Senator Dastyari or one of his mates in the Labor Party will always try to interrupt me. I am pleased about that because it shows that what I am saying is true and it is actually having an impact.


We are talking about freedom of speech. Can I tell you that I, quite frankly, do not care if Ms O'Toole, the illegitimate—I might say—member for Herbert, spends her time demonstrating—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Dastyari, do you have a point of order?




Senator Dastyari:
  Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to quote the exact standing order, but my understanding is that calling a member elected in the other house illegitimate would extend—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, given your many years of experience here—I am not sure that a person can be an illegitimate member of parliament. Either you are a member of parliament or you are not. So I would ask that you withdraw your reference to 'illegitimate'.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I do so, Mr Acting Deputy President, but can I just explain. I will withdraw, as you ask. I am not referring to her personally. I am not suggesting what Senator Dastyari is suggesting I am saying about Ms O'Toole. Certainly that is not it. What I am saying is that she won the election by 37 votes, and, as the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has already clearly determined, there were more than 100 votes in doubt in that particular election.




Senator Chisholm:
  Why didn't you take it to court?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, hang on. Wait for it.




Senator Chisholm:
  You didn't, did you?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Wait for it, and I will tell you why. If you want to have this argument, let's go for it. Let's go for it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, resume your seat. Please, contributions must address the chair. Interruptions are disorderly, and I ask those on my left to desist.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will get back to the freedom-of-speech issue, but there is evidence before the Electoral Commission that there were incidents that happened that prevented anyone from knowing—for example, so many cases of double voting that the candidates and the political parties were not even made aware of until well after the time for taking action in the Court of Disputed Returns. But more about that on another occasion. My reference to 'illegitimate' was as a member of parliament for that seat. That is not the right result. I called it an illegitimate result. I was certainly making no personal reflection on Ms O'Toole.


But back to the freedom of speech: Mr Acting Deputy President, quite frankly, I do not care if Ms O'Toole and her paid staff members campaign outside my office. I believe in freedom of speech. I would have thought that perhaps that is not what she and her staff are being paid for. She, I would have thought, would have had some more important work to do in Townsville, trying to help the hundreds and even thousands of young unemployed in that city rather than conducting a fake demonstration outside my office. What adds insult to injury, I might say, is that they always have these fake demonstrations when they know I am not in the town, when I am out somewhere else in Queensland representing my electors.


But I like free speech. If they want to have a demonstration outside my office, that is fine. I have not seen any of this in Townsville, but, if the Palaszczuk government is going to set the police on to preachers in the south-east of the state, then perhaps the Palaszczuk government should just think about these illegal, unlawful demonstrations outside the front of my office. I repeat: I do not give a damn about it. Nobody took much notice of them. Those who were interfered with as they walked up the street simply laughed at them. It was the CPSU—would you believe, Mr Acting Deputy President?—complaining about the reduction of penalty rates on a Sunday. Tell me which member of the CPSU works on a Sunday.




Senator Gallagher:
  Quarantine staff.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Tell me which one?




Senator Gallagher:
  Quarantine staff.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Okay. There are not many of them. If they want to demonstrate, that is fine, but we need some consistency in Queensland. Perhaps we could ask Ms Palaszczuk: what is the difference between an unauthorised street rally in Townsville that just happened to be organised by the unions that keep her in business and these people trying to get across a message about their faith in the south-east of the state?


Australia is home to a diversity of faiths united by tolerance, mutual respect and a commitment to democratic traditions. I do not always agree with people who come and speak to me, try to speak to me or make public speeches about various parts of their faith or the religion they follow, but I will fight to death for them to be able to express their view, as long as they do not harass others who are going about their lawful activity. Where there is harassment—if that is the allegation—I agree that people are entitled to their right of movement, their right of going about their business, without impediment. But my understanding of the issue that Senator Roberts has brought before the Senate is that these are simply people of a faith who are standing on a street corner, standing in the mall, giving their view on their faith and trying to encourage people to think about their lives and their faith position, and that is fine by me. As long as they do not impede my progress, as long as they do not in any other way interfere with my freedom of movement, I have no objection to them.


In concluding, I ask the Palaszczuk government: tell me the difference between a demonstration in Townsville where people are impeded and a preacher or a group of preachers making a comment, an argument, a dissertation, on their faith in Brisbane. I think when we get down to trying to impede the free speech of people anywhere in my state of Queensland or anywhere else, we are approaching difficult and dangerous times. Accordingly, I really do think that the Queensland government, which is the subject of this particular debate today, should be consistent. You either stop everyone or you stop no-one. I go for stopping no-one. Providing they are not harassing anyone, people should be able to express themselves in whatever way they like and should not be impeded by police forces in Queensland apparently set off by the Queensland government. Ms Palaszczuk cannot have it both ways. It has to be either everyone stops or everyone is allowed to go. It should be that everyone is allowed to go within the reasons I have mentioned. I thank Senator Roberts for raising this important issue. It is the sort of important issue we need to discuss in this chamber.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-03-20,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:30):  It is not often I feel sorry for the LNP in this chamber, but when it comes to Senator Macdonald I actually do. We all know that the only reason Senator Macdonald was actually put back on the Senate ticket was that the LNP in Queensland were nervous about losing Herbert. The sad reality is that they put him back on the ticket—they did not want to put up with him but they put him back on the ticket because they were worried about the damage he would do—and they went on and lost Herbert anyway, and now they have to put up with him for another couple of years. So one really does have to feel sorry for the LNP having to put up with Senator Macdonald and the nonsense he goes on with in this chamber.


When it comes to the matter before us that was suggested by Senator Roberts, it speaks volumes that he was the only person from One Nation that actually spoke on this. They have since left the chamber. This is how important it was to them. When the news comes through that Senator Roberts has won the MPI we initially think of what damage he is going to do to the Barrier Reef and those that advocate for it. I know those supporters of the UN and the institutions it protects also get nervous because that is generally the target Senator Roberts wants to take. Today, he was off on a very different tangent, somehow trying to accuse the state government of interfering in a police matter. The reality is that the only government that interfered with the police in Queensland is the old Sir Joh government that he normally speaks so fondly of. That is what he is harking back to, and that is not something the current state government would be involved with. Obviously, his effort to conflate those two issues is just wrong. It is absolutely incorrect.


We also had Senator Macdonald go on and try to attack the current member for Herbert—who is doing an outstanding job standing up for her community—by trying to claim her election was illegitimate. What absolute nonsense! Any time that we see Senator Macdonald or those opposite trying to undermine her election to this parliament we will absolutely call them out on it. Those people who voted for her will also be disappointed in the efforts of the LNP. The member for Herbert won that election fair and square. The LNP did nothing whilst they were in government in Herbert and they suffered a consequence as a result. Ewen Jones was tossed out and now we have a hardworking member for Herbert who will absolutely stand up to this government every day of the week and is doing an outstanding job for the people of Townsville.


The way Senator Roberts spoke about this matter and indeed about the 513 group, he would have us think that they just go around extolling their virtues and talking about the work that they do. But actually look at some of the media reports of the work that these people have done when they have been charged with offences. I would point out this is a council that has made these complaints. This is from the Quest newspaper, a local newspaper in Brisbane, in which a council spokesperson said:


Complaints from the public and Queen Street Mall businesses include allegations of extreme harassment, with members of the group hurling abuse and insults at passers-by.


It does not quite sound as innocent as Senator Roberts has been making out.


This is not just something that has been happening in the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane. There are also reports of this happening on the Sunshine Coast and, indeed, on the Gold Coast as well. So there is a pattern of behaviour in South-East Queensland. This is another media report, going back a couple of years, from Sunshine Coast Daily:


The arrest of the men, street preachers with Operation 513, was a repeat of events last week when they were also charged with the same offence.


We also saw that in December 2015 a man was charged on the Gold Coast for contravening police directions to move on from the middle of Cavill Avenue in Surfer's Paradise during schoolies celebrations. This is a quote from a Gold Coast Bulletin article:


George Youssef, 33, was charged after police allege the man was ""vilifying"" homosexual people, causing anxiety and disrupting the trade of businesses on December 4 last year.


They also allege he told those who were intoxicated and celebrating the second week of schoolies they would ""go to hell"" for being drunk, Muslim, Buddhist and having sex outside wedlock.


These are the so-called innocent people Senator Roberts is seeking to defend here.


Yes, we understand freedom of speech, but we also need to put ourselves in the shoes of those police officers. As I mentioned in that story, we are talking about the second week of schoolies. This is a period when the Gold Coast police are large in number because they are dealing with an influx of people from all over the country to the Gold Coast to enjoy schoolies. They are under enormous pressure, dealing with that influx of people. Then you have this group in the mall, which is a real hub of activity when schoolies is on, sprouting this sort of stuff to young school leavers. Whilst Senator Roberts may be wishing to try to hamstring our police or blame the state government, this is something they have had to deal with. They have obviously had numerous instances of this with this group that they have been dealing with. The group has, so far, been refusing to acknowledge the police effort in this regard and have been thumbing their noses are them, and that is why it has gotten to the level it has. So, it is inconsistent of Senator Roberts to claim the innocence of these people when we look at the facts of these stories. 


The other thing we need to look at is the hypocrisy of One Nation when it comes to these issues. Let's look at the women's march in January when Senator Hanson said:


It’s good that they were out and about and doing a bit of walking because it looked like a few of them needed to get a bit of sun and do a bit of exercise.


Don’t these clowns have anything else better to do with their time other than to hold sad, anti-democracy protests?


When discussing a rally in support of penalty rates earlier in month, Senator Hanson again said: 


The real SHAME is these ratbag bullies couldn't think of anything original to shout.


So, if you align with One Nation's world view and you are having your say, you are okay, you are a champion of free speech. But, if you are exercising your speech on a matter that they do not agree with, you are sad, anti-democratic and a bully. There really is a lack of consistency in the argument from One Nation in this regard, and we will absolutely hold them to account in this chamber on that.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:38):  As a representative of the people of Tasmania and of this planet, I wish to provide some empirical evidence to this Senate; but, before I do, I note that Senator Malcolm Roberts has fled the chamber, despite bringing on this discussion as a matter of urgency, a matter of public opinion. Presumably, he is so embarrassed by his sad and sorry contribution that he has decided to go back into his burrow rather than listen to other contributions to this discussion. 


The empirical evidence that I wish to provide is about George Youssef, one of the so-called street preachers mentioned by Senator Roberts in his contribution. George Youssef has been charged by Queensland police. This is what the Queensland police have said about Mr Youssef. They said he was vilifying gay people. He was causing anxiety. He was disrupting the trade of businesses. This was on 4 December last year. Police have also said that he told those who were intoxicated and celebrating the second week of schoolies that they would 'go to hell for being drunk, for being Muslim, for being Buddhist and for having sex outside wedlock'. This is a guy who was standing there abusing schoolies and suggesting that they would go to hell for fornicating outside wedlock. The Australian language is a beautiful thing, and it adapts to grow alongside our community. That adaptation has given us a word for strange adults who lurk around schoolies' events. They are called 'toolies'. This toolie, Mr Youssef, according to police, was abusing young people with xenophobic, wowserish rubbish, and then he defied police when they told him to give it a rest. It sounds like he would fit in perfectly with One Nation. He sounds like a square peg in the square hole that is One Nation. I actually think he would make a fantastic candidate for One Nation in the upcoming Queensland election. In fact, it beggars belief that neither Senator Roberts nor Senator Hanson has approached Mr Youssef and begged him to run, because, as I said, it sounds like he would fit perfectly into the weird, whacky world of Senator Malcolm Roberts and Senator Pauline Hanson. It is absolutely fitting that Senator Roberts has come into this place, the Australian Senate, to defend a toolie who was shouting abuse at innocent passers-by. It is an absolutely neat embodiment of Senator Roberts's contribution to this country and to the political conversation in Australia. 


Like Mr Youssef, One Nation is a political clown car. It is colourful. It provides an amazing spectacle, especially as it produces a seemingly endless stream of loud idiots riding in the back seat, while the rest of country is left only to wonder how they could fit so many fools into one small red car. But, as we saw in Western Australia recently, the clown car has caught fire, and what an awful but fantastic spectacle it is to see—One Nation crashing and burning. It is an absolute delight for those of us who care about environmental sustainability and for those of us who care about respect and tolerance for people, no matter what their cultural, racial or religious background is. 


I want to put the strange case of Mr Youssef, the so-called street preacher, and the even stranger case of Senator Malcolm Roberts to one side and briefly talk about freedom of religion in this place. It has to be said that many people who appease One Nation and who are currently in the Liberal Party are the biggest threat to freedom of religion in Australia. They purport to stand up for freedom of speech and freedom of religion but, when you peel back the veneer, they are doing anything but that. One Nation wants to end Islamic immigration and basically make it impossible for people in Australia to practise the Islamic religion. Senator Roberts stood up today and called for an increase in racial profiling. One Nation wants to get rid of section 116 of the Australian Constitution, one of the few protections of freedom of religion that we have in this country. For Senator Roberts to come into this place and claim that he is defending freedom of religion when all he is doing, as he always does, is defending freedoms of people who are fruit loops is absolutely hypocritical. 




Senator Ludlam:
  First they came for the fruit loops.




Senator McKIM:
  As my colleague and friend said: first they came for the fruit loops. We have got news for Senator Roberts. We have got news for Senator Hanson. We have got news for all the people in the Liberal Party and the National Party who want to see a weakening of protections against racial hate speech in this country. The Australian Greens have listened to what multicultural Australia has said to us, what they have told us and what they have asked of us. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with people from the Muslim communities of Australia, the Jewish communities of Australia, the Chinese communities of Australia, the Greek communities of Australia, the Italian communities of Australia, the Indian communities of Australia and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities of Australia, and we will do as they have asked us to do. They asked us very clearly during the inquiries that the Greens attended and participated in with regard to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act: 'Do not water down protections against racial hate speech in this country, and particularly don't water them down now. When you have a racist in the White House, and when you have an upsurge in support for racist political parties in Western democracies around the world, do not weaken the protections against racial hate speech in Australia.'


We will stand shoulder to shoulder with all of those people—those Australians who asked us to stay strong—no matter what their cultural background. We will stay strong on section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. We will stay strong against racist political parties like One Nation. We will stay strong against allowing people to be hectored and vilified, no matter the basis for it. George Youseff was vilifying gay people, Muslims and Buddhists, and telling schoolies they are 'going to go to hell' simply for being drunk and having sex outside of wedlock.


It is very instructive that Senator Roberts is in here today defending that person, George Youseff, and, in effect, endorsing his comments. I reckon Senator Roberts ought to have a drink every now and again, chill out, loosen up, get with the program and understand the views of ordinary Australians, whom he claims to represent, but he has epically failed to do so since he was elected to this place.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:48):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This document should send shivers up people's spines about the way government programs have been implemented. But I must admit it does not surprise me or, I am sure, anybody who has been paying attention to the Centrelink robo-debt debacle that is currently going on. This document looks at a number of the program's Centrelink-related compliance measures which were announced in relevant budgets and implemented in 2012-13 through to 2015-16.


When you look at the department's findings, the government must have known about at least some of these findings about the failures of their department, because the departments have not been reporting properly. Then the government, basically, wildly go off on another 'let's grab money back from the most vulnerable members of our community' exercise, knowing full well that their past measures have not been working, knowing that they are not getting adequate reports, knowing that they have not been getting the savings from there and knowing that the department has not been monitoring and reporting back. The report says:


Monitoring and oversight arrangements in place between the Department of Human Services and the Department of Social Services for the compliance measures were not effective. Requirements set out under the Bilateral Management Arrangement between the two entities were not met. In addition, the Department of Social Services as the relevant policy entity did not take responsibility for monitoring the achievements of the measures. The Department of Human Services' monitoring of savings and expenses associated with compliance measures could be improved. In the Department of Human Services' advice to its Minister on implementation progress, the department used a methodology that did not provide reliable advice on the (gross fiscal balance) savings achieved from the measures.


The report also says that the advice on the underlying cash savings realised, including debt recovery for the majority of the compliance measures, are key outcomes expected from the measures. The department did not look at compliance cost measures and consider whether the benefits outweighed the cost of monitoring. Internal reporting on the progress of the measures has not provided a consistent and reliable indication of where the key performance outcomes, including expected savings and levels of activity, were on track nor were the key risks were being identified. You get the picture. This is a litany of failures from the department. Is anybody surprised, therefore, that we are getting the same sorts of failures coming through from Centrelink and the Department of Human Services when they are trying to apply their so-called auto-debt recovery process?


The conclusion of the report says that three measures have not been effectively implemented; two measures implemented were partially effective, with one measure achieving the expected savings but not the expected level of compliance activity and the other measure achieving the expected level of compliance activity but not the expected savings. Two measures of seven, they say, were effectively implemented. What was the minister's response to the comment that the savings were not achieved? It was: 'We do different calculations, and we reckon we saved heaps.' Who are you going to believe, the Auditor-General; the department, which has not even been reporting the savings; or the government, which says, 'Just trust us. We think it's okay. We've made the savings. It's all there.'? I am sorry, it is not all there. They have not made the savings. They cannot justify it, because the information simply has not been reported.


This agency has been running flawed programs for a significant period of time. That is evident from this report. Now, like Dracula in charge of the blood bank, they are in charge of the auto-debt recovery process that is sending people false debt notices. The litany of mistakes goes on and on. Of course, there is a Senate inquiry that will try to get to the bottom just what has happened and report on some of those processes. It is obvious from this report that there are big problems in Centrelink and in the Department of Human Services. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

That the Senate take note of the document.


I take note of document No. 26, the Australia State of the Environment 2016. In summary, the state of the environment report shows that we have a dark stain of government mismanagement of our environment. It shows that over a period of time we have had state and federal governments, but particularly this federal government, continue to put the interests of donors and big polluters ahead of the public good and responsible environmental protection.


The state of the environment report shows that the trend continues to go down. Our environment is what we depend upon—our air, our water and our biodiversity. We need to reverse these trends. We need to improve the state of the environment. This state of the environment report puts the information on the table and shows that the trends are still going badly. We are experiencing record heatwaves. With regard to global warming, the report summarises the fact that our carbon emissions are continuing to rise, the fact that Australia has got the highest level of carbon emissions per person of any OECD country, and the fact that we have experienced our hottest year on record in Australia, and yet, we still have proposals for incredibly polluting developments like the Adani coalmine. We are experiencing record heatwaves. We are experiencing bushfires. We are experiencing coastal erosion. We are experiencing the impact of wheat yields, for example, already decreasing because of global warming. And yet, the response of this government is to come into the House of Representatives and wave lumps of coal around to try and convince us that clean coal is a reality when everyone knows that clean coal just does not exist. The evidence, rather than the rhetoric, is presented there very plainly and simply in the state of the environment report.


Moving on to biodiversity, we have a disastrous situation of ongoing extinctions. The poor state and declining trend of Australia's biodiversity is noted as a particular concern. The number of species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the EPBC Act continues to rise. The state of the environment report notes that the number of species listed in the critically endangered category has increased by 31, and two species have been recorded as likely to be extinct. We know that this is happening all around the country. The list of nationally threatened species and ecological communities has increased, with the addition of 30 new ecological communities, 44 animal and five plant species listed as now being threatened. We have got land clearing continuing in Queensland. We have two more species reported as extinct: the Bramble Cay melomys and the Christmas Island Forest Skink.


What makes this very sad and what is very clear in the state of the environment report—which shows that the problem is not going away—is that we know in almost all of these instances what needs to happen. We know how to protect these species: it comes down to protecting habitat. It comes down to protecting species from feral animals. It comes down to doing things about invasive weed species and reducing the threats to these species. We know what to do. In the case of one of the species that has been declared critically endangered since this report came out, the Leadbeater's possums in Victoria's central highlands forests, we know what we need to do to protect the habitat of these possums and to send the trend the other way, to give the Leadbeater's possums a chance of survival. That is to stop the logging of their homes. Despite having this information, the state of the environment report shows a continuation of the trends that have been in place since these reports began to be produced. The bad news just keeps on coming, but instead of listening to that, instead of looking at it and instead of reading it and saying, 'It looks like we need to be changing the way we are doing things,' we have a government intent on continuing the pollution that causes global warming and on continuing the logging, the mining and the other extractive industries that are destroying the habitat. We have got a government that is intent on continuing to increase the amount of carbon pollution we are putting into our atmosphere.


The Greens have read of the state of the environment report, and we know that things need to change. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cabinet) (17:08):  On behalf of the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, I table a ministerial statement and a related document on the tabling of the agreement to amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement.




The statement read as follows—





Tabling of the Agreement to Amend Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)



It gives me great pleasure to table the Agreement to Amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement and the accompanying National Interest Analysis for Parliament’s consideration. 


This is our most comprehensive update to an FTA to date, and a demonstration of the Government’s commitment to ensuring our trade agenda is modern and agile. As the makeup of our economy and the needs of business change, so too must the rules that govern our international trade.


In June 2015, the Prime Ministers of Australia and Singapore announced the launch of the Singapore-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), an initiative to strengthen and deepen our two countries’ strategic, trade, economic, defence and people-to-people links. The SAFTA review is the key economic plank of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. It reflects Australia and Singapore’s unwavering commitment to the principles of free and open trade. 


The original SAFTA provided a strong platform for the expansion of our economic and trade relationship with Singapore – a 21st-century regional economy and a gateway to the rest of Asia.  SAFTA has seen Australia’s goods exports to Singapore grow to $5.5 billion in 2015-16, and services exports to $4.3 billion – our fourth-largest export market for services. 


The updated SAFTA will give Australian businesses a competitive edge in Singapore. It will provide new access for Australian service providers, particularly in education and professional services. Additional qualifications in law, medicine and allied health from a number of Australian universities will now be recognised in Singapore. Australian lawyers and financial service providers will enjoy improved access to Singapore’s legal and financial services markets. 


The SAFTA review will create new opportunities for businesses to bid for high-value government procurement contracts in Singapore, including in sectors such as road transport, construction and engineering. The updated agreement will improve mobility and lengths of stay for Australian business people and their spouses and dependents. It will include modern outcomes on telecommunications services and e-commerce, and harmonise trade rules in goods, services and investment, thereby reducing red tape for businesses.


The business community has resoundingly welcomed the breakthroughs we’ve been able to make in the SAFTA review. 


The Australian Services Roundtable said that ‘the Review brings about certainty for services firms in a range of areas and creates an economic relationship which will enhance trade opportunities for this important market’. 


The Law Council of Australia said the review demonstrates that SAFTA is a ‘useful, living agreement that can deliver enhanced market access outcomes for the Australian legal profession and their clients’. 


The Australian Chamber of Commerce observed that ‘Singapore is best placed to be a hub for businesses looking to expand into the broader South East Asian region and these changes make it easier for companies to do that’.


I would like to acknowledge the bipartisan support for this FTA review. 


I hereby table the Agreement to Amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement, with its National Interest Analysis and commend them to the House.

The speeches read as follows—



FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT BILL 2017


The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2017 is a Bill to amend the Farm Household Support Act 2014.


The Bill proposes to assist farmers in financial hardship by removing unnecessary waiting periods once they have been approved for payment of Farm Household Allowance. The Bill also resolves a technical anomaly in the definition of farm assets in the Farm Household Support Act whereby some types of assets used wholly or mainly for the purpose of a farm enterprise – such as water rights or shares in marketing co-operatives – are not assessed as farm assets.


The Farm Household Allowance Programme provides up to three years of income support paid at the same rate as Newstart Allowance, to farmers and their partners in hardship. Since its introduction in July 2014 over 7000 farmers have been granted access to the programme which allows them to access income support payments, case management services and improvement activity supplements. The safety net provided by this programme is essential to ensure the Government can appropriately support farmers in hardship.


The Government's general position is that conditions for receipt of Farm Household Allowance should be aligned with those for mainstream income support payments, unless there are good reasons for departure.


The programme settings recognise that farmers are often excluded from mainstream income support payments by the size of the assets they use in operating their farm, yet they cannot realise those assets for self-support without taking away some, or all of the income producing capacity of the farm enterprise.


Farm Household Allowance is therefore subject to a two-tiered asset test. The first, applied to non-farm assets, is the same as that applied to Newstart recipients. The second tier permits the farmer and their partner to hold up to $2.55 million in net farm assets.


The mutual obligation provisions for Farm Household Allowance also differ from those for Newstart Allowance, recognising that the aim is to provide income support for a limited time while the farm household seeks to move to a more sustainable financial position. To this end, recipients receive case management support and financial assistance to obtain advice or training to improve their situation. 


When the Farm Household Allowance Programme was introduced in 2014, the same Ordinary Waiting Period and Liquid Asset Waiting Period that apply for other Australian Government income support programmes were retained. These are generally applied to ensure that social welfare applicants use their own readily available resources before drawing on public monies, and have incentives to continue to seek work.


Experience has shown that the normal considerations around waiting periods are no longer appropriate for Farm Household Allowance. 


Farmers are an integral part of the farm business enterprise. If a farmer has qualified for Farm Household Allowance, this means they are experiencing hardship. Requiring this farmer, or their partner, as a Farm Household Allowance recipient, to wait additional time, notwithstanding they have been found eligible, could lead to additional hardship which risks a reduction in their capacity to operate the farm enterprise.


The Bill therefore proposes the removal of the requirements for recipients of Farm Household Allowance to serve an Ordinary Waiting Period or Liquid Assets Waiting Period. 


Farm Household Allowance is also time limited, so removing the standard waiting periods generate no costs to the Budget.


The Bill also seeks to clarify the legislative treatment of certain assets necessary for the operation of the farm enterprise. 


Under the Farm Household Support Act certain assets, which are necessary for the operation of the farm enterprise, are currently excluded from the definition of farm assets. Therefore they must be assessed as non-farm assets, and are subject to the lower tier one test that does not account for the illiquid nature of farm assets. Examples include water rights and shares in marketing cooperatives. 


This is contrary to the intent of the Farm Household Allowance Programme in respect of the assessment of assets, and this Bill therefore provides for the definition of farm assets to include water rights and shares in marketing cooperatives used or held substantially for the purposes of operating the farm enterprise. This change will apply to new customers of the Farm Household Allowance Programme. It will not affect existing customers who may have been assessed under the current Minister's Rules applying to these assets. 


The clarification of the treatment of assets will not change the maximum asset holding limits to be eligible for the Farm Household Allowance. It will therefore have minimal impact on the Budget.


In seeking to remove unnecessary waiting periods for farmers and their partners approved to receive Farm Household Allowance, and in clarifying the treatment of assets within the Farm Household Support Act, this Bill further demonstrates this Government's responsiveness to the needs of the farm community and rural and regional Australia as well as our willingness to streamline the assessment of Farm Household Allowance applications where appropriate and possible.


 


NATIONAL DISABILITY INSURANCE SCHEME SAVINGS FUND SPECIAL ACCOUNT BILL 2016


This Bill will establish a new ongoing special account that will assist the Commonwealth to meet future financial commitments to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The special account will be known as the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account and was announced in the 2016‑17 Budget by the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund measure.


The National Disability Insurance Scheme (known as the NDIS) is one of the largest social and economic policy reforms in Australian history. The NDIS supports Australians who are born with, or acquire, a permanent and significant disability before the age of 65 to lead a more independent and inclusive life. 


The NDIS provides this support by assisting people with disabilities to meet the costs associated with their conditions. Importantly, the scheme empowers people with disabilities to make their own decisions about how they are supported. 


NDIS trials are well underway across Australia. At the completion of the trials in June 2016, there were around 30,000 people with disability participating in the scheme. On 1 July 2016 the NDIS commenced its transition phase, beginning a large-scale, staggered and well-managed expansion that will see it fully rolled out in every state and territory, with the exception of Western Australia, by 30 June 2019. 


By 2019–20, the NDIS will be supporting around 460,000 Australians with disability. At that time, the NDIS will be injecting $22 billion each year into the Australian economy. 


The NDIS provides the support directly to each eligible person, rather than to a service provider to then deliver the required support. As a result, the NDIS will also change the landscape of the disability sector. New opportunities will be created by empowering people with disability. A new source of demand will be created within the wider economy for disability support services. As the scheme grows, it will create a national market for care and support based on empowerment, choice and control – a market that drives innovation and creates greater efficiencies and effectiveness.


The Productivity Commission concluded that, over time, the economic benefits of the NDIS will outweigh its costs and will add close to one per cent to GDP. The NDIS is not only good for people with disability, it is good for the Australian economy and it will drive jobs growth over the long term.


In 2019–20, the NDIS reaches 'full scheme' with $22 billion of funding. The Commonwealth's share of the total funding will be around $11.2 billion per year. At that time, eligible people with disability who are currently receiving support through Commonwealth and state disability programs will be receiving support through the NDIS. 


The Government is fully committed to properly, adequately and sustainably funding the NDIS. It is for these reasons that the Government is bringing forward the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account. The special account will give a clear line-of-sight of the funding set aside by Government for the NDIS.


It is critical that the Commonwealth manages its funding in a way that is transparent and quantifiable, and meets the Commonwealth's funding commitments to ensure the NDIS is fully funded.


The Government is 100 per cent committed to delivering and funding the NDIS in full. We have supported the NDIS from day one and this special account demonstrates that ongoing commitment.


In addition to this special account, the Commonwealth is redirecting existing disability-related spending and the DisabilityCare Australia Fund toward the cost of the NDIS. In 2019–20:


existing Commonwealth disability funding redirected to the NDIS is estimated to be $1.1 billion;


the Commonwealth share of the increase in the Medicare Levy through the DisabilityCare Australia Fund is estimated to be $3.9 billion; and


redirected funding, which is currently provided to the states for specialist disability services, is estimated to be $1.8 billion.


In total, the Commonwealth will direct $6.8 billion from these sources to the NDIS. Because of the failure of the previous Labor Government to specifically set aside funding for the NDIS, this will leave a funding shortfall of $4.4 billion from 2019–20 onwards, which this Government will meet.


While the Medicare levy is an important contribution to the NDIS, it only provides a portion of the Commonwealth's annual new contributions to the NDIS at full scheme. 


It falls to this Government to set aside the remainder, which equates to $4.4 billion funding shortfall in 2019-20, and growing to over $5 billion in future years.


This special account is the mechanism for securing that funding shortfall. It's proof of the responsible and sustainable way that this Government follows through on its NDIS promises.


The National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account, which will be created by this Bill, will be in the form of a special account. The special account will be administered by the Department of Social Services, with its funding sitting within the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This will ensure that savings deposited into the special account are not returned to the Consolidated Revenue Fund itself and effectively lost for NDIS purposes.


The special account will allow the Government, over future budgets, to identify savings from existing programmes and set aside those savings to assist in meeting the Commonwealth's future financial commitments to the NDIS. Effectively, the Government will, over successive years, put aside savings that are clearly identified, quantified and defined so that the annual funding gap from 2019–20 is met within existing funding.


By clearly identifying savings in the special account, it will provide an enduring response to the concerns raised by the disability sector in relation to how Government will fund the shortfall for the NDIS. The previous Government had identified savings to assist in meeting the funding requirements of the NDIS from 2019–20. However, those savings were not set aside to meet future NDIS costs and were effectively lost for NDIS purposes.


The special account provides a sustainable way to meet the funding gap from 2019‑20 onwards that does not require borrowings for the NDIS that would need to be paid back by future generations.


This Bill gives the Government the flexibility to identify savings from any portfolio, not just the Social Services portfolio. That approach will ensure that many areas of Government contribute to supporting people with disability. 


There will be an upper limit on the balance of the special account – it will only hold enough money to fund the future value of the Commonwealth's NDIS commitment. Over the next few years, savings can accumulate in the special account to meet future funding commitments. From 2019-20, when the NDIS reaches full scheme, if the balance of the special account becomes greater than required, the excess will be returned to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Further, a review of the special account will be conducted in 2026–27.


Identification of savings to be deposited into the special account will be a decision of Government. Those savings to be credited to the special account will be committed over a 10-year period. The quantum of individual savings will be consistent with the Budget Process Operational Rules. The Minister for Social Services will be the responsible Minister, with responsibility for the policy and management of the special account.


The Government will establish the special account with an opening balance of $343.7. million in 2016–17, from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and savings identified in the NationalDisability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund measure announced in the 2016-17 Budget. The Government will make further deposits into the special account over the coming financial years. 


In bringing this Bill forward to create the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account, the Government is providing a robust and enduring solution to meeting the Commonwealth's funding commitments for the NDIS.


The Government urges passage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016, as recommended by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee (the Committee) on 7 November 2016, following its inquiry into bill. In coming to this position, the Committee noted they were: 




of the view that this legislation presents a significant step toward ensuring that NDIS funding is both adequate and sustainable.



The Committee also noted, that in their view: 




concerns about where savings will be made, although important, do not reflect or address the purpose of the bill: namely, establishing a mechanism by which funding intended for the NDIS is secured to be available for that purpose, when and as needed.



TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (2017 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2017


Today, I introduce a bill to implement two Government measures.


Schedule 1 of this Bill makes minor technical amendments to the income tax law to ensure that two National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA) measures operate in accordance with their original policy intent.


These measures are the Tax Incentives for Early Stage Investors measure and the New Arrangements for Venture Capital Limited Partnerships measure. Together, they are designed to promote a culture of entrepreneurship by connecting start-up companies with investors who have both the requisite funds and business experience to assist entrepreneurs to build successful, innovative companies. 


These two measures, together with the minor technical amendments in Schedule 1, demonstrate the Government's commitment to encouraging and supporting innovative new businesses. 


The amendments will clarify the tax law to provide certainty for investors who are looking to invest in start-ups and certain venture capital arrangements through a single interposed trust and will ensure these investors are able to access the capital gains tax concessions provided by the Tax Incentives for Early Stage Investors and the New Arrangements for Venture Capital Limited Partnerships measures. 


Schedule 2 of the Bill amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2011 to streamline the process by which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission may share confidential information with the Australian Taxation Office for its use in the performance of its functions.


The amendment mirrors the existing arrangements in place for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to share information with the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. It will enable more timely collaboration between the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Taxation Office during investigations into illegal or high risk activities, for example, illegal phoenixing activity.


Full details of the two measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum. 


Debate adjourned.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:16):  I appreciate the opportunity to outline Labor's position on the government's Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. While Labor recognises well-regulated gambling has a place in Australian society and, indeed, that many Australians enjoy a responsible punt, the growth of illegal online gambling is of great concern to Labor. We are concerned because times have changed. The growth of digital technology, including smart phones, allows Australians to wager and gamble whenever and wherever they choose. We are in a digital age, an age of rapid change especially in relation to technology. Most of us have handheld devices—smart phones—that allow us to access a range of services, apps and information by simply swiping our screens. With this change in technology has come an increase in the number of offshore operators. We know that this has impacted on problem gamblers.


Labor believes that it is time to do more and to amend this act to prohibit these operators and stop the growth of illegal online gambling. Labor agrees that the government's Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill picks up on some of the concerns around the growth of illegal online gambling. It will also go some way to improving the protections for those who choose to wager within an online environment. The majority of people who bet do enjoy it and gamble in a responsible manner. However, Labor also knows that gambling our community can, in some cases, have devastating consequences—social, financial and emotional consequences. That is why we have always maintained a strong stance on ensuring appropriate harm minimisation measures are in place to protect and assist our community.


Labor broadly supports the bill's main focus, which sets out to bolster the enforcement of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. What Labor wants to ensure is that these new reforms will be about protecting people and about mitigating the effects of problem gambling more broadly. Currently, illegal offshore providers can target Australian gamblers even though they operate outside the country. Labor recognises that this practice has to stop. We know that this bill will go some way to stopping these operators in the responsible jurisdictions from trading in Australia illegally, but we are not naive: illegal offshore gambling operators will still try to operate in Australia and we should continue to look at innovative ways and means to stop this from happening.


We agree with the reform in this bill that seeks to prohibit click-to-call in-play betting services. We have seen concerns in past years about the links between gambling and sporting incidents and the impact of such links on match outcomes. We also know that this type of click-to-call betting is linked with problem gambling. Placing numerous bets in a short period of time does have the capacity to lead to problem gambling. Evidence to date suggests that young men are particularly vulnerable to this type of wagering and the addiction that can arise from it. From a perspective of harm minimisation, what is proposed is a sensible way forward and we support the prohibition of click-to-call in-play betting.


One area that Labor will continue to watch very closely is the in-play betting in licensed venues and how the government continues to tackle this into the future. To be clear, Labor does not support a proliferation of in-play terminals in venues. We do not support a shift from tethered terminals in venues to electronic mobile services. However, as this is the government's bill and we cannot be certain of how the government will deal with this form of on-premise betting into the future, we are concerned about what this means. Within the explanatory memorandum, a new definition of place-based betting services clarifies that electronic betting terminals can continue to be provided in places where the provider is licensed under a law of a state or territory to provide such services. Labor will be watching very carefully to see if any expansion of these services does occur and what the government response is if this does happen. We assume that the government will act if proliferation of mobile devices in licensed premises does occur.


We know that the O'Farrell review highlighted that Australia's consumer protection was weak and inconsistent. As I have stated, Labor is supportive of harm minimisation and strengthening consumer protection when it comes to problem gambling. We think this bill, however, could be improved in some aspects. We have already acknowledged the gambling can—and in some cases has already has already—have devastating social, financial and emotional consequences for Australians. Problem gambling can and has ruined lives. We know that improving protections for consumers is a good thing.


While we welcome the government's response to the O'Farrell review, which stated it will aim to agree on a consumer protection model within 12 months, we welcome the commitment by the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers in November last year to work together to develop a national consumer protection framework and we are supportive of the establishment of the national consumer protection framework, what we do not want to do is wait for another three years for this important work to be completed. So, while we welcome progress, our message for the government today is that they really need to get on with the work that is required, without delay.


With regard to credit betting: Labor knows that gambling in our community, as I have said, can have devastating impacts. So we are a little surprised that in this bill the government has not included any reform around the banning of credit betting, especially when we consider the coalition's policy on problem gambling, where it flagged the prohibition of credit betting back in 2013. And here we are: it is 2017.


For the past three or four years, the coalition has had a policy position on this banning of credit betting, and yet in its first tranche of reform it does not seem to deal with this very issue. That begs the question: why has the government not dealt with credit betting within the reform of this Interactive Gambling Act? This is particularly so, given that the minister has asserted that he has been very keen to ban this type of betting. To strengthen harm minimisation for problem gamblers, I want to indicate that Labor would certainly support the government taking that direction.


To continue with the theme of protection, I wish to speak on a matter of significant and widespread public concern that has gone hand in hand with the growth of online betting in Australia. Many Australians continue to have concerns around the promotion of betting odds and gambling advertising, especially during live sporting broadcasts. I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, that you understand exactly what I am referring to. There are existing safeguards to restrict gambling advertising and betting odds on television and radio in Australia. But it is apparent that they do not go far enough to address community concerns.


In early February 2017, Labor moved a second reading amendment designed to protect Australians, including children, and calling for action to ensure that live sporting broadcasts are free from intrusive gambling advertising and betting odds promotion. Now, that motion was narrowly defeated in the House and, despite voting against Labor's motion, the responsible government minister did put it on the public record that the coalition does also share some of these concerns. He said that the Turnbull government 'certainly acknowledged the concerns which many Australians have in relation to gambling advertising.' Further, the Minister for Communications, Minister Fifield, was quoted in a Radio Australia news story recently as saying in a statement:


… the Government was aware of community concern about the issue, but … ""Broadcasters have a responsibility under the co-regulatory framework to ensure that their advertising meets community expectations.""


What is telling is that some of the insightful and community-minded players are speaking out on this issue themselves. In the same Radio Australia news story that I just referred to, Damian McIver mentioned two concerns that high-profile AFL players have about the prevalence of gambling—particularly gambling advertisements. The Geelong defender Harry Taylor is actually quoted as saying:


I've got three kids at home and when my eldest can name a lot of the ads on TV, that is a bit of a worry.


Indeed. Taylor's comments follow comments from Western Bulldogs defender Easton Wood, who posted his views on Twitter in February this year, saying:


Gambling advertising is out of control and I think it needs to change …


…   …   …


The obvious issue here is the effect this advertising has on children every time they watch us pull on our boots.


I think that sums up the community concern in a very clear and simple sentence.


In an article on the same topic, The Age recently published an article by Jon Pierik, reporting that the AFL commissioner Kim Williams had expressed concern at the level and nature of gambling advertising during match broadcasts, and that he is understood to be putting together a paper about his concerns.


In support of our second reading amendment, my Labor colleagues in the other place made reference to research that was undertaken to explain further this community concern around advertising for gambling during live broadcasts of sport. This research, undertaken by Deakin University, points out a number of very concerning issues with regard to children and gambling advertising on television. I just want to spend a little time this evening going through the findings of the research, because it is another piece of evidence to support Labor's concerns around the possibility of legislation to improve outcomes for Australians with regard to advertising of gambling.


The research from Deakin found that over 90 per cent of children—90 per cent!—can recall having seen an advertisement for sports betting. Three-quarters of children aged eight to 16 years can recall the name of at least one sports-betting brand and approximately a quarter can recall four brands or more. This is absolutely amazing evidence to indicate the impact of advertising on the scale that we are seeing it right now in our country. Seventy-five per cent of children think that gambling is a normal or common part of sport. Parents also conveyed concerns, including that gambling advertising is so prevalent that it is changing the way their kids think about and talk about sport.


This is what the kids communicated to researchers about gambling advertising. I will use their own words, because they are highly instructive. A 15-year-old boy: 'I don't think they're good for kids. They're trying to make it cool. They put them during sport, when kids are watching.' Another boy, 13 years old: 'They shouldn't be allowed during sport, because lots of kids watch it. Ads pull you in—it's bad.' A 15-year-old boy: 'Ads for sports betting tell you to bet with them and make it look like you're going to win. They make it look positive and fun.' And a 10-year-old boy: 'The advertisement convinces you to bet. You can get your money back if you lose by eight points.' Out of the mouths of babes we are getting serious instruction on the need for some serious change with regard to this problem in our community. When we look at these findings, we can understand why parents are worried about their kids being subjected to gambling advertising during live sporting events.


Labor understands that Australians want to keep broadcasts of live sport and gambling as separate things. It is in everyone's interests to ensure that children do not associate betting and gambling as a normal part of watching sport on television. And yet these commercials continue to intrude upon our nation's love of sport, and they cause significant public concern.


Following the leadership of and the intervention by the Labor government in 2013 in this area, the broadcast industry responded to address public concerns and develop rules set to restrict gambling advertising in live sports broadcasting and the promotion of betting odds in particular. While the new code of practice limits the promotion of live odds in particular and restricts gambling ads, it does continue to allow two important elements: firstly, the promotion of betting odds half an hour before play and in the half hour after play by clearly identified gambling representatives; and, secondly, commercials relating to betting or gambling before play has commenced, during scheduled breaks, during unscheduled breaks and after play has concluded. That is to say that the code of practice allows significant windows of opportunity for gambling advertising around the edges of live sports broadcasts. 


The time has come for the government to change this reality. The broadcast industry and sporting codes need to accept that gambling advertising before and during live sports broadcasts is indeed contrary to community standards and they need to amend the broadcasting codes of practice accordingly. Current restrictions should be extended to ensure that there is no promotion of betting odds or gambling advertising at all in the 30 minutes before play and that there is no gambling advertising at all during scheduled breaks such as half-time or unscheduled breaks such as weather delays. It goes without saying that current exemptions for horseracing, harness racing and greyhound racing would continue to apply. The Melbourne Cup would not be affected, for example; that is to say that Labor does not propose to prohibit gambling advertising and betting-odds promotion around the broadcast of those forms of entertainment: horseracing, harness racing or greyhound racing. 


In calling on the government to work with industry on a transition plan to phase out gambling advertising and betting-odds promotion over time, Labor adopts a pragmatic approach. Labor is conscious of the need to address public interest considerations in a way that does not impose unnecessary financial and administrative burdens on providers of broadcasting services. We are not proposing an immediate blanket ban on gambling advertising or betting-odds promotion in broadcasting. In calling for a transitional approach over time and a targeted approach in respect of live sporting broadcasts, Labor affords industry the time and flexibility needed to alter current business practices and contractual arrangements. 


A consultative approach is part and parcel of Labor's approach. Our second reading amendment outlines and continues the conversation that was started with industry in 2013 by the Gillard government, and it supports a continuation of that consultative approach between government, broadcasters and sporting organisations to address community concerns. Labor's approach demonstrates an understanding of and a confidence in the co-regulatory system of broadcast regulation that was enshrined in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Under this system, industry has the opportunity to develop codes of practice to address matters of concern to the community and where a code of practice is not operating to provide appropriate community safeguards the government regulator, the ACMA, may step in and regulate by way of a program standard. 


I note that some sectors of the industry disagree that there is a problem with the current level of gambling advertising. In their media release just last week, Free TV stated that Labor's proposals were 'unwarranted' and that 'commercial broadcasters already have the most comprehensive, targeted set of restrictions on the promotion of betting services of any media platform in Australia today' and they declared that 'complaints about betting are low'. Commercial Radio Australia described Labor's proposal as 'unnecessary and counterproductive' and stated that 'any further restrictions cannot be justified'. But Labor regards it as appropriate that the industry has the opportunity to amend their codes of practice to address genuine community concern. On this I note that Labor's proposal does not dictate the terms, the timing or the mechanisms by which the broadcasting industry might phase out gambling and betting promotion during live sports broadcasts. 


Labor also regards the system of co-regulation as an effective mechanism for dealing with matters that the industry may find challenging to deal with. Labor understands that betting and gambling advertising represents a significant revenue stream to industry and that it may be challenging for industry to wean itself off such lucrative arrangements in the current media environment. On this matter, it is instructive to note the explanatory memorandum to the Broadcasting Services Act acknowledges: 


Areas such as … advertising, are matters of community concern which could conflict with a service provider’s responsibility to its shareholders to maximise profits. 


This part—that is, part 9 of the act—that empowers the ACMA to impose direct regulation by way of program standards code, where codes of practice have failed, aims to balance the costs and benefits of the community's regulatory needs with the profit based nature of commercial service providers. 


Labor's approach is transitional and targeted and therefore responds to public concern while acknowledging the pressures the broadcasting sector is under. Labor wants to work towards a genuine solution. That is why we are calling on the government and on industry to step up and progress these important consumer safeguards and address this significant issue of community concern. 


I move the second reading amendment on sheet 8048 standing in my name: 


At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate calls on the Government to work with the broadcasting industry and national sporting organisations on a transition plan to phase out the promotion of betting odds and commercials relating to betting or gambling before and during live sporting broadcasts, with a view to their prohibition"".


I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for time in the chamber to address this important community concern. I hope the government will be able to work to advance a response to those genuine concerns that are held by parents and sporting heroes alike. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2017-03-20,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (17:36):  I rise to speak on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. The bill contains proposed amendments to the Interactive Gambling Act, the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act and the regulations made under the Interactive Gambling Act. The bill contains a number of proposed amendments which seek to clarify legislation regarding illegal offshore gambling and seeks to strengthen the enforcement provisions under the Interactive Gambling Act.


The Interactive Gambling Act was introduced by the government following the findings of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technology's report into online gambling and the Productivity Commission report of 1999 into gambling industries and in response to concerns about the effects that online gambling has on Australians. The Productivity Commission report of 1999 found that problem gamblers comprise 15 per cent of regular, non-lottery gamblers and account for about $3.5 billion in expenditure annually. That is about one-third of the gambling industry's total market. They lose on average $12,000 per year, compared with just under $650 for other gamblers. That prevalence of problem gambling is related to the degree of accessibility of problem gambling.


Since the legislation was enacted, it has done little to prevent the spread of online gambling. The legislation is now 16 years old and has been outdated and outpaced by the rapid increase in online gambling and aggressive practices of the online gambling providers to entice customers. The proposed bill seeks to clarify that it is illegal for overseas gambling companies to offer gambling products to Australians unless they hold a licence issued by a state or territory. It will introduce a new civil penalty infringement notice regime to be administered by ACMA. The bill will also prohibit click-to-call in-play betting services by tightening the definition of a 'telephone betting service', with the effect that it will no longer be possible for a customer to place a bet during a sporting event without ever speaking to an operator. Instead, the bill would require dealings with customers to be entirely by way of spoken conversations between the customer and an operator.


The bill amends the complaint-handling process by providing that ACMA is responsible for all stages of the complaint-handling process, with the removal of current mandatory requirements for ACMA to refer matters to the AFP. It will also enable the minister to determine by way of legislative instrument for the purposes of the act whether a specific thing is or is not a sporting event. The bill will require ACMA to maintain a register of eligible, regulated interactive gambling services in an effort to raise awareness amongst customers about which services to avoid because of their exclusion from that register. It will introduce measures relating to illegal offshore gambling activity. These would allow ACMA to disclose information obtained through its powers under the IGA to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and to foreign regulators. The bill will enable ACMA to notify the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of information relating to names of directors or principals of offending gambling services so that their names are placed on the movement alert list.


Finally, the bill will remove the requirement for a report on contraventions of part 7A of the act to be prepared and tabled in parliament each calendar year. The explanatory memorandum advises that this information will now be included in ACMA's annual report, which will be tabled in parliament. However, the amendments proposed in the bill represent only the first stage of the government's process to implement the recommendations of the 2015 Review of Illegal Offshore Wagering, led by the Hon. Barry O'Farrell.


The Nick Xenophon Team supports the bill. I want to make that clear. However, we remain concerned that the bill does not go far enough to keep pace with the explosion of online gambling and, in particular, online sports betting. Online gambling has grown to the point that the industry now outpaces other forms of gambling. People bet online using smartphones, tablets and other digital devices. Online gambling at the touch of a button anytime, anywhere poses risks to those battling gambling addictions and those who are vulnerable to developing gambling addiction. In 2014 $2.4 billion dollars was spent on online gambling by Australians. This is double the amount of 10 years earlier. The 2015 O'Farrell review found that the number of active online wagering accounts in Australia grew from 200,000 in 2010 to 800,000 in 2014.


The minister has foreshadowed there will be further bills which will seek to put in place some protection for gamblers. The government announced in April 2016 that it would implement 18 of the 19 recommendations in the 2015 O'Farrell review in a three-stage process. Whilst this news is welcome to the Nick Xenophon Team, we believe the government has missed an opportunity to debate a more comprehensive and more effective bill now. This is why my colleague Senator Xenophon will be moving amendments that incorporate many aspects of his private senator's bill, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Sports Betting Reform) Bill 2015.


These amendments tackle many issues not addressed in the government's bill, including prohibitions on microbetting, prohibitions on offering credit and banning the broadcasting of sports betting ads during sports games and G-rated programs when children are watching. Importantly, these amendments also establish a National Self-Exclusion Register, which was recommended in the O'Farrell Review, as well as the establishment of an interactive gambling regulator.


The Nick Xenophon Team's position on gambling reform and curtailing predatory gambling is well known. We continue to push for reform in this area. I have seen firsthand the devastation that gambling addiction causes families though my work in Senator Xenophon's office and now in my own. Over many years I dealt with countless desperate constituents whose families have suffered emotionally and financially because of gambling addictions. It was the families' stories that propelled me to stand for the Senate as part of the Nick Xenophon Team.


In my first speech I spoke about the call that provided me with the impetus to drive change through policy as a senator. I had taken a call from a woman whose husband was addicted to online sports betting. She had just discovered they had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and in the coming weeks they would also lose their home. She was desperate and she did not know where else to go for help. I stayed on the phone with her while she cried. I would meet her and her husband in person soon after, and with Nick we worked to do what we could to help them try to rebuild their lives. This call was one of many I answered about the devastating effects of online gambling.


The impact of gambling addiction is far reaching. It has devastating effects responsible for the loss of livelihoods, family homes and inheritances and for the destruction of families. Some gambling addictions are so fierce and the consequences so great that for some the burden is too heavy and results in the tragic loss of life. The Nick Xenophon Team's resolve on tackling predatory gambling is unwavering. We are committed to Australian communities. As long as gambling companies continue to prey on Australians, we will continue to push for much-needed sensible gambling reform.


There is no doubt that the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 is a step in the right direction, and I commend the government for these measures. For too long the Interactive Gambling Act has been weak when it came to dealing with overseas online gambling organisations providing services within Australia. These organisations operated freely within our borders and caused immeasurable harm to Australian citizens. However, I remain concerned as to how the government will be able to enforce penalties against these companies, who may continue to disregard the measures in this bill and which operate in overseas jurisdictions.


The Nick Xenophon Team wants to see a requirement on internet service providers to block access to websites operated by those who continue to operate within Australian borders without permission to do so. During the committee stage of this debate, Senator Xenophon will be moving such an amendment to prevent access to illegal offshore operators. We believe this bill must go further to protect vulnerable Australian families from predatory gambling organisations. Senator Xenophon and I will be moving amendments to do just that. 


Specifically, I will move an amendment during the committee stage that restricts the government's proposed meaning of 'electronic equipment'. The Nick Xenophon Team is very concerned about the loophole in the legislation that, if allowed to remain as currently drafted, would allow in-play betting from venue-provided smart devices in retail place betting venues, pubs and clubs. Section 8BA of the proposed bill provides for venues to loan customers electronic equipment for gambling use. The Nick Xenophon Team is deeply concerned that this bill appears to allow for place-based electronic betting through the introduction or expansion of electronic devices such as tablets and smartphones which provide for in-play betting, and circumvent the need to deal with a person or use a fixed betting terminal.


The definition of 'electronic equipment' referred to in the bill includes 'an electronic apparatus' or 'electronic device'. The bill's explanatory memorandum provides no guidance or explanation as to what these terms mean. This definition currently includes venue kiosks but is not restricted to such services. During the Senate inquiry into the bill, submitters raised concerns that these terms allow for the expansion of the use of electronic devices, including tablets and smartphones with an in-play betting function, within licensed betting venues.


In response to our question on notice regarding concerns about continued availability of in-play betting, the department responded:


The 'place-based betting service' exemption in proposed Section 8BA is intended to permit betting services, including potentially in-play betting services, to be provided on electronic equipment (which may include easy betting terminals and/or tablets) made available to customers in places such as TABs, casinos and clubs.


The department admitted, when I questioned them, that they had not done any modelling on whether this provision would lead to an uptake in betting services in venues due to increased availability of these electronic devices. The Nick Xenophon Team is concerned that this provision will expand the opportunities for in-play betting without addressing any of the concerns highlighted in the inquiry that this may increase opportunities for gambling and create faster, more instantaneous betting options. 


If the government's aim is to reduce in-play betting, I fail to see how this bill helps. In-play betting is only supposed to be performed in person or over the phone. These measures will allow gambling operators to potentially expand their operations within licensed venues. This loophole goes against the intention of this bill.


I will be moving an amendment that narrows the definition and makes it clear that 'electronic equipment' will instead be defined as an 'electronic betting terminal' which is installed on a permanent or fixed basis at a place where gambling services are provided under supervision. It will be unable to connect to the internet and will be available for use only by customers using cash or a card issued by the provider. This definition will limit in-play betting to electronic betting terminals to ensure that gambling operators do not seek to expand their operations by allowing people to place in-play bets using tablets or smartphones provided by the venue at the bar. These terminals are permanent installations located in a specific area set aside for gambling and are unable to connect to the internet. This is the sort of protective measure we need.


In my opinion, the bill as it is currently drafted will increase the opportunities for in-play betting without addressing the very serious concern that this could increase opportunities for gambling. In-play betting is especially dangerous, as it gives a person an immediate opportunity to win their money back, which also heightens the potential for bigger losses. These are spur-of-the-moment decisions people make when they are swayed by emotions and possibly under the influence of alcohol.


If the government are going to introduce legislation on gambling reform, they must also consider the issue of harm minimisation. I fear that the current harm minimisation tactics used within bars and gambling venues are inadequate. During the Senate inquiry into this bill, I questioned the department as to whether they thought the current harm minimisation strategies were working. Their response was that harm minimisation was a matter for the states. But harm minimisation and problem gambling affects all Australians, and I want to see the federal government take more responsibility for this area and work more closely with the states to improve harm minimisation.


Given that this bill will see an increase in betting devices within licensed venues, it cannot be argued that the expansion of the gambling market would not result in harm. The Nick Xenophon Team will continue to hold the government to account and keep the pressure on to ensure that harm minimisation strategies are considered and implemented as we continue the fight against predatory gambling. Thank you.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-03-20,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (17:50):  I rise to speak on this issue which, no doubt, is of increasing community concern around Australia. Gambling is an industry that is growing rapidly in this country. We have seen growth in the number of local companies that are involved. We have seen international outfits come onto the scene that are active in this area. A number of speakers have talked about the offshore gambling companies as well, which is obviously a concern for legislators. With the offshore companies, it is very hard to track how much money local Australians are gambling through those companies, and then there are the associated parts of that in terms of how much tax those companies are paying if they are taking the money offshore. There is also the issue, for those offshore companies, of harm minimisation. Obviously, any regulation that we bring in from an Australian point of view does not apply to those offshore companies. That is a concern from a level playing field point of view.


In terms of the legislation that is before us, it goes some way towards tightening the restrictions around these organisations. Obviously, with the proliferation of these companies we have also seen an increase in promotion and advertising from betting companies. I think that what has come with that is increasing community concern around that advertising. I know that Senator O'Neill has foreshadowed that Labor will be moving an amendment, and that amendment says:


The Senate calls on the government to work with the broadcasting industry and national sporting organisations on a transition plan to phase out the promotion of betting odds and commercials relating to betting or gambling before and during live sporting broadcasts, with a view to their prohibition.


I think that is something that would be welcomed by the community.


I am sure many people across Australia feel this when they sit down to watch their favourite team play or their favourite sport on TV, particularly with young children. You get concerned about the focus on live gambling and the ability or the encouragement or giving people the option to gamble on sporting matches. I know myself, as someone who has been a long-term season ticket holder of the Broncos, that, when I first started going to games as a season ticket holder, which would be about 10 years ago now, you did not see or were not encouraged to partake in gambling. But now and increasingly you see the sponsors on the jerseys and you see the sponsors on the ground, and indeed the opportunity to gamble within the sporting stadium is increasingly being promoted. When you see the mix of people who attend those football matches and understand the mix that would be watching at home on TV as well, you understand that traditionally, from an Australian point of view, partaking of or viewing sporting activities has increasingly been a family affair, so I think that, when we look at the potential damage that gambling can cause, we always need to look at it from that point of view.


The other thing I have noticed—and through the committee process I have had the opportunity to ask questions of the companies involved in these outfits—is that increasingly people who gamble are doing it through the apps on their phone or online. A good example of that was on Boxing Day. I went to my local club with some friends to watch the Boxing Day test. We were sitting at the TAB inside the RSL club, and there were a lot of people gambling, but not many people were getting up and using the terminal at the club. Increasingly, people are using their phone to gamble and not using the machines.


When it comes to looking at harm minimisation and what that means, if I am sitting there at a club and just gambling on my phone, there is no way that anyone inside that club is actually going to know what I am doing. Obviously, you could have a number of mobile phone apps on your phone and use any one of those to gamble. I think that, when you look at the proliferation of the companies involved and the fact that you can open an account with any of them, we need to constantly look at ensuring that we have the best practice possible to ensure that the harm minimisation policies are effective in this regard.


When we had the opportunity to question some of the companies recently, they attempted to put the argument that the focus for that effort should go on the financial institutions, so they are the ones who should bear the responsibility for identifying problem gamblers and be the ones to report that or potentially put a freeze on that person's account. I do not think it is good enough on the part of the companies to effectively pass the buck to the financial institutions. There obviously needs to be a lot more pressure put on those companies as this issue continues to develop and the community and therefore governments and parliaments have to respond to that challenge.


In terms of the proposed Labor amendment, I think it is appropriate for us to signal that this is something that we would pursue in government as well. We are really sending a message to the industry—and that is the broader industry, those gambling companies but also those people who benefit in a financial sense from the advertising—so that they know that Labor are determined to act in this regard, and we will continue to pursue that both in opposition and potentially in government as well.


Just further to my point about the offshore operators, who obviously do not currently pay tax in Australia: in the 2015 review of the impact of illegal offshore wagering, stakeholders highlighted that the current mechanisms for enforcement within the existing framework were insufficient and that they were no longer competing on a level playing field. Again, through the committee process, this has been raised by a number of the companies. Despite the large number of complaints that have been raised since the Interactive Gambling Act was established in 2001, there have not been any prosecutions, so I think that, with any changes to the Interactive Gambling Act, we need to look at the enforcement as well to ensure that we are doing our utmost to hold those companies to account.


But at the heart of this bill is the creation of a legal framework that is suitable for the industry and, importantly, empowers the Australian Communications and Media Authority with enforcement powers and the relevant authority under the act by ensuring that the Australian Communications and Media Authority becomes an efficient regulator with powers to issue informal warnings, infringement notices, civil penalties and injunctions. That aspect of the bill is certainly welcomed by Labor and, I think, as we have seen through the evidence process in the committees, is much needed. In particular, I welcome the creation of an offence and a civil penalty for a person who provides a regulated interactive gambling service to a person in Australia who does not possess a relevant licence from the state or territory government. This is inherently simple in its intent. There is now a clear framework for ACMA to investigate and take action against unlicensed services.


Another tool for ACMA's enforcement is the use of a civil penalty regime to encourage and support improved compliance with the Interactive Gambling Act. This will ensure that ACMA will be able to properly investigate and respond to breaches of the new regulatory regime. Frequently, under the current framework, that was unable to occur, due to other agencies not regarding these breaches as a priority and acting on them. This includes provisions for ACMA to refer complaints to the Australian Federal Police if they believe it is warranted. We also welcome the amendments to notify international regulators about their licensees who have been found to have broken provisions of the IGA. Previously, the offshore locations of a number of companies has made it very difficult to enforce current provisions of the Interactive Gambling Act. However, providing ACMA with relevant powers to help build those relationships with foreign regulators is a good start and no doubt will provide a framework for ACMA to enforce these new provisions. Certainly, from the evidence that we had from the department they are determined to work with international bodies to ensure that they make progress in this respect to ensure that there is more stringent accountability on an international level to those offshore gambling companies from an Australian point of view.


In terms of the proliferation of gambling, it is something that is of concern to me. It is something I intend to continue to keep a close eye on. I have enjoyed the role I have played in the committee in the short time I have been on it. I think that it is obviously something that is a constant feature of parliament, whether it be looking at pokies or looking at interactive gambling. I think it is something that is moving very fast, particularly with the availability online these days and moving into an international phase. Therefore, it is something that governments will continue to deal with. I am pleased to support the Interactive Gambling Act and I am pleased to advocate for the amendment that Senator O'Neill moved. It is an issue that I will continue to deal with as a senator.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-03-20,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:01):  I rise to speak on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. This is a small step toward the goal of getting rid of the corrosive, corrupting influence of gambling in sport—a very small step. It clarifies the fact that wagering websites, services and products are illegal. It goes on to put some restrictions around in-play betting. It also strengthens the power of ACMA.


So it does some positive things, but there is also a huge catch. The government has decided through this legislation to include a special carve out for its big gambling mates who donate so handsomely to both of the major parties during election campaigns. The special exemption they have created would effectively allow online in-play sports betting from a tablet on the counter of every pub and club in Australia. Live in-play betting is hugely problematic. It is also known as in-the-run betting. It is an activity that makes gambling much more seductive. It is more likely for people involved in watching a game of footy to continue to bet, to double up, to chase their losses and ultimately to lose more than they would have otherwise lost. Because of this exemption there is going to be a massive expansion of in-play betting at a moment when the government is rightly saying, at least quietly, that we should be outlawing similar services provided online.


Why restrict in-play betting to services provided online and at the same time give this exemption that allows basically every pub and club in Australia to continue to do it? One has to ask oneself: why has the government decided to go down that path? The Tatts Group, whose subsidiary UBET is going to exploit this loophole, donated $139,000 to the two old parties, Labor and Liberal, in the last three years. So one has to ask oneself whether this is a loophole created by the government for its big gambling mates. We know, whether or not that is true, the perception that that might be true should be enough to give the government pause for thought. What we have is a problem with policy in this country being made on the back of big donations that come from big money interests. We Greens are going to be supporting amendments that close this outrageous little sweetheart deal for the Tatts Group and the big gambling mates of the old parties.


Despite the loophole, on balance I think the bill does deserve support. It does implement recommendations 18 and 19 of last year's O'Farrell Review of Illegal Offshore Wagering. The former New South Wales Premier's report made it crystal clear that online games and wagering are the fastest growing segments of the global gambling market. They are exploding in terms of market share. Products are being marketed largely to young men. They are causing a range of harms. We know and speak a lot about the harms associated with poker machines. We know and speak a lot about the harms associated with poker machines, and we are now learning in more detail about the harms that excessive gambling online causes to individuals, families and communities. Often these are young men who are isolated or living in regional communities, and they are losing big.


The Interactive Gambling Act is the main source of prohibition regulation that will attach to online gambling. We do acknowledge that it is a very difficult regulatory environment. This is a tough environment because you have a lot of this activity being conducted offshore. Whilst this act makes it illegal to offer online gambling products from offshore locations, we know that that prohibition is very difficult to enforce, so we are doing a balancing act between the prohibition and being able to enforce it. It is in everyone's interest to bring those offshore operators here onshore and to make sure that they are captured by the Australian regulatory environment. That is the balancing act.


Of course, the gambling lobby has a very powerful argument against what it calls over-regulation. It says the regulations are too restrictive and there is no incentive for operators to come here onshore. Surprise, surprise: big business does not like regulation that might restrict its profits. Ultimately, this is about finding the best way to reduce the huge harm that these predatory pushers of online gambling products do cause our communities. We just do not have the balance right at the moment. We have not got the balance right. You just need to sit down and watch a major sporting event with young kids to see what it is like. Every time you sit down with a kid to watch the footy, the cricket or the tennis, they are being bombard with odds, websites and famous faces pushing online gambling down their throats. The marketing of these products, as Senator Chisholm said previously, is relentless. It is having a significant impact on young kids and creating the problem gamblers of tomorrow. 


When I sat down with my kids to watch the cricket over the summer, as I occasionally do, I was dumbstruck by one freeze frame. There was a fielder sliding along the grass towards the boundary rope. The rope was clad with the URL of a major online gambling website. The fence behind the rope also displayed the same website. And then running across the bottom of the screen was a paid banner ad for—yes, you guess it—the same online gambling website. It has become absolutely relentless. This stuff is everywhere. You cannot escape it. There is an irony here when you see some young sportsman having to confess to having gambled illegally and consider that they are bathed in it. They are surrounded by it. They are wearing this stuff on their jumpers. The sponsors are everywhere. The ground is covered in it. TV is shoving this stuff down people's throats. Is it any wonder that some people make bad decisions? It is damaging the brand and integrity of many of the sporting codes that we love. It is so insidious now. Just listen to young kids talk about their favourite sporting code. They might talk about a game of AFL footy. In the old days they would be swapping footy cards. Now it is a discussion about what are the odds of Cyril Rioli kicking the next goal, or of David Warner making a tonne in the cricket. Their experience of the game is no longer an experience shaped around the game itself; it is an experience where gambling is enmeshed in the sport. For young people, the line between gambling and sport is not a clear one. They have become one and the same. These are very clever marketing tactics by the gambling industry. I am really concerned about what this will do to those young children in the future. Are we creating another generation of problem gamblers? 


So, of course we welcome any effort to try to curb the pernicious influence of online betting and gambling, but that does not mean the activity should be illegal. People should be able to gamble if they want to, but we need some restrictions around what is appropriate, and we absolutely need to ensure that there are restrictions around the way this stuff is marketed and promoted. It is why we are going to vote in favour of some of the amendments on the table that will close the loophole which I talked about earlier. I would like to think that we could also vote to support a bill like my Broadcasting Services Amendment (Advertising for Sports Betting) Bill 2013. What that bill would do is ban radio and TV licence holders from broadcasting any ads or information about sports betting or odds. If people want to gamble that is their right, but just don't shove it down our throats. Let a young child watch a sporting broadcast, without having to be bombarded with betting advertising. I do hope that there will be an appetite to return to that bill at some stage in the near future. 


I do, however, know that we will be facing an uphill battle if we are to get some restriction on sports advertising. The influence of the gambling lobby on the old parties, as I said, does not just extend to donations. There is now a revolving door between the gambling industry and political office. I want to say a few words here about the role that the Labor Party has played in ensuring that the gambling industry has the contacts and the networks it needs to be able to scuttle any legislation when it comes to restrictions on gambling. Senator Conroy could not wait to leave the Senate to join Responsible Wagering Australia. You would think that that was an organisation whose focus was on ensuring that people wager responsibly—no, how wrong you are. That Orwellian sounding title is the name of an organisation that represents the big gambling industry. It is not just Senator Conroy; it seems to be that the Right of the Labor Party has this revolving door between itself and the gambling industry. We saw this with former Senator Mark Arbib. He could not wait to leave the Senate so that he could become part of the Packer gambling empire. Indeed, the former National Secretary of the Labor Party Karl Bitar is another graduate of the Labor Right moving into the gambling industry. They are hired guns who are used by the industry because they have the contacts and networks necessary to be able to scuttle reform. They are working for an industry that preys on some of the most vulnerable people in the country. No wonder people have had a gutful of politics. When they see people in senior positions leave this place and, within the blink of an eye, stand up and start spruiking for an industry that they once had responsibility for regulating, it does more than just raise a few eyebrows. It means that people whose faith in their democratic institutions is already at an all-time low say, 'What is the point?' The time is long overdue for us to put a code of conduct in place that prevents that activity from taking place into the future. 


Let me go to some of the detail of what this bill does. As I said earlier, it clarifies that offshore wagering websites, services and products are made illegal. It clarifies that Australian operators can no longer operate click-to-call services like the ones they currently operate, which allow betters to place in-play bets over their mobile phones and tablets, without even needing to speak to an operator. These are important developments. It also strengthens the power of the Australian Communications and Media Authority and creates a civil penalty regime which targets, in particular, operators of offshore wagering websites and services. However, the government has failed in this bill to commit to one of the essential recommendations of the O'Farrell report, and that is that, until a national framework is established and operating, consideration of additional in-play betting products should be deferred and legislative steps taken to respect the original intent of the Interactive Gambling Act. In this bill the government have ignored that recommendation. Instead of considering additional in-play betting products only at the point at which legislative steps have been taken, they have decided to carve out in-play betting for what are euphemistically called 'place-based betting services', defined in clause 8B(a) as involving electronic equipment.


In other words, what the bill does is exempts the practice already engaged in by some clubs and pubs of offering tethered online electronic betting terminals. So you can do in-play betting—when the whole point of this is to restrict it—providing that you are in a pub or club and you are using one of their tethered online electronic betting terminals.


What this exemption would do is dramatically expand the scope of in-play betting. That is in direct contradiction to the O'Farrell recommendation. I will get to it in a moment, as to how that would happen. The Uniting Church, Responsible Wagering Australia and other Australian providers agree that this is a sweetheart deal which hands over, to operators like the Tatts Group, access to physical premises like pubs and clubs.


As I said earlier, former senator Stephen Conroy has become a spruiker for the gambling industry. Not even his factional clout and political connections could compete with the hundreds of thousands of dollars that are flowing into the ALP coffers from the gambling industry. On this occasion, it seemed that they were at odds—and I use that pun intentionally.


Experts warn that this sweetheart exemption could lead to pubs and clubs offering in-play sports betting via tethered tablets, which are more attractive than the large cumbersome machines that are in use.


Let us look at what Tatts Group's UBET said recently. They intend to offer a digital in-play sports betting solution that will allow punters to bet through a customised app on a tablet service. In other words, they are getting ready for in-play betting to occur through their tablets, and they are hoping that one day they will have a monopoly on in-play betting, through their customised app on their tablet devices.


There are some amendments to this legislation which would help close this little sweetheart loophole, and I am talking specifically about Senator Xenophon's amendments. We the Greens will be supporting those amendments. The amendments will tighten up the definition of 'placed-based betting service' to more accurately reflect the reality of current practice and prevent the expansion of in-play sports betting that I have just described. For those reasons, we will support them. They would also strengthen the principal act by introducing an interactive gambling regulator and a national self-exclusion register. We also support those amendments. The amendments would also strengthen the act by banning wagering services from offering credit, or microbetting; by allowing gamblers to set personal betting limits; and by strengthening regulatory powers. We support that amendment too.


There is one aspect of the circulated amendments that we do not support. That is the provision that would require the minister to regulate to require internet service providers to block access to illegal overseas gambling websites. We do not think that is an effective solution, and so we will not support that specific amendment.


I conclude by saying this bill does go some small way in the direction that we need to go, and it is just insane that this glaring loophole has been left open for a particular segment of the industry. If we do not address this issue, we are looking at creating another generation of problem gamblers. This is an industry that has shown itself as wanting to prey on some of the most vulnerable people in our community, and it is governments that have been complicit with the industry every step of the way. Regulation of the industry is absolutely critical, not just in terms of in-play betting but also in terms of the promotion, advertising and sponsorship of gambling products. If we do not deal with this issue now, we risk repeating the mistakes that we made when it comes to poker machines. We risk making the same mistakes within the online betting environment, and that is a cost that is far too high for our society to bear.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-03-20,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:20):  I oppose the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. It is paternalistic, nanny-state legislation based on the assumption that prohibition is an effective regulatory response to something of which the government disapproves. The intention of the bill it to make it impossible for Australians to bet on sporting matches while they are in play. There is already legislation that seeks to make this illegal, but it has some loopholes. This bill seeks to remove those loopholes.


Why does the government want to ban in-play gambling? Why should some forms of gambling be legal, even encouraged, while another form is prohibited? The justification we are given is that in-play gambling leads to match-fixing. There have been examples of that in the past. So there is an assumption that the only way to prevent such match-fixing is to ban in-play gambling. I am not discounting the fact that match-fixing or spot-fixing might sometimes be a problem. In recent years, we have seen examples of this in some sports, such as cricket and tennis, but this legislation is no solution. Banning live betting on the internet in this country will have no more impact on match-fixing than banning the production of pornography in Australia would have on the availability of porn. The internet just does not work that way. The only winners will be unregulated, untrustworthy offshore operations, and punters will have no protection if they get ripped off. And when those unregulated, untrustworthy offshore operations play host to punters engaged in match fixing or spot fixing, nobody in Australia will be able to follow the money trail. It will all be invisible.


The United Kingdom has taken a better approach. The UK's Gambling Commission is authorised to manage gambling licences and to monitor betting to ensure everything is run in a safe and efficient manner. They understand that banning betting will not stop dodgy practices. Instead, they concentrate on monitoring the integrity of sports betting and looking after the interests of punters. They can look for signs of match fixing, act on tip-offs and follow the money trail. If they find evidence of match fixing they can deal with the individuals at fault, including cancelling licences and launching prosecutions, while leaving all the innocent punters alone. So instead of collectively treating gamblers like naughty schoolchildren, they treat them individually as adults whose pastimes are a legitimate form of entertainment and whose interests are worth protecting. What a novel attitude.


Australia loves to ban things. This ban on live betting adds to the nanny state nonsense and it will not stop match fixing. It could also turn hundreds of Australians who have been betting online without harming anyone else into our latest class of criminals.


Also caught up in this bad legislation are hundreds of Australians who enjoy a flutter on online poker. Online poker is not a spectator sport. Nobody tries to fix a cricket match as part of an online poker game. There is no public interest in banning it as part of interactive gambling laws. I have an amendment to exempt online poker and blackjack from the bill. It is insane that they were ever caught up in it. But ultimately, I don't want the bill to pass. I believe individuals have a right to make decisions for themselves, no matter whether we would make the same decisions ourselves.


Finally, if the legislation passes, I would like to take this opportunity to give some advice to online poker players. Notwithstanding the risk of offshore hosts, screw the government: get yourself a VPN and an offshore account and carry on as you were. And I wish all of you the best of luck.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-03-20,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:25):  I support this bill, the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016, but I believe it ought to go much further because the issue of online gambling has become increasingly prevalent in Australia. It is impacting on many more people. We have seen an exponential increase in online gambling, in particular in sports betting. As my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore indicated, the 2015 O'Farrell review found that the number of active online wagering accounts grew from 200,000 to 800,000 between 2010 and 2014—that is for legal online accounts for legal sports betting agencies. That indicates to me that that there is a significant issue, and the bigger the boom in online gambling the bigger the bust for individuals who are caught up in it and who suffer from gambling addiction.


This bill will go some small way in dealing with the issues—it acknowledges the impact of in-play betting—as imperfect as it is, but there needs to be consideration of why this bill needs to go further. It needs to go further because it is not a case in Australia of enough is enough; it is a case of enough is much. We in this nation lose more in gambling per capita than any other nation in the world. It is a significant social problem, and it is being made worse by the biggest growth area—that is, sports betting.


In 2015, I was part of the launch of Financial Counselling Australia's report Duds, mugs and the A-list. That report looked at the impact of sports betting, particularly on young men around the country. It was published by an organisation that knows better than most what it means to be affected by gambling addiction, because Financial Counselling Australia represents financial counsellors who assist consumers in financial difficulty. They see, on the front line, at the coal face, the impact of gambling addiction. They have been seeing more and more people in recent years in relation to the effects of sports betting, and in-play betting was a significant driver in gambling addiction. In-play betting had a significant impact on young men chasing their losses, because they could gamble in play. It is a more addictive form of gambling. It is more pernicious and leads to greater problems.


That is why we need to support this bill, but I believe the way that this bill has been drafted by the government allows for a number of loopholes to allow some organisations to circumvent that. Reference was made by Senator Di Natale in respect of that. We must oppose that circumvention by strengthening the bill.


Financial Counselling Australia in its landmark report Duds, mugs and the A-list: the impact of uncontrolled sports betting said that urgent action is needed:


Betting on the pokies is relatively small fry in comparison – you can’t put $250,000 into slot machines in one sitting, but you can do that with sports betting with the click of a mouse. If this is the future of gambling, it is indeed frightening. Urgent action is needed.


As bad as things are with poker machines they can get much, much worse with online gambling. This is the new frontier for gambling expansion. We are already the worst in the world for per-capita gambling losses and, dare I say, gambling addiction per capita. This bill at least opens up the debate in relation to these issues.


I will address shortly, perhaps after the dinner break, a number of the measures in the bill. The bill needs to go further, but it is important that it be put into context about the seriousness of the problem we now fact in relation to this.



Sitting suspended from 
18:30 to 19:30





Senator XENOPHON:
  The issue of online gambling is one of critical importance. More and more Australians are falling prey to gambling addiction because of online gambling and because of sports betting. There is nothing like the pernicious advertising of sports betting; it is in your face at sporting games and during sporting broadcasts. That is why it is important that we also reform the issue of online gambling advertising for sports betting advertising. It does seem incongruous, it does seem like a loophole and it does seem unacceptable that there is one exemption to the situation where, in the ordinary course of events, the current ACMA rules say you cannot have gambling advertising during a G-rated time. There is one exemption to that and that exemption relates to sports broadcasts. 


If you are broadcasting a game, you can advertise gambling products during that game. I would have thought that is the one particular event watched by families and watched by young children that ought to be the subject of a ban not an exemption of a ban during G-rated times. It is very disturbing that eight-, 10- and 12-year-olds—according to the many parents I speak to with young children—tell their parents about the odds of a game. It is very concerning that gambling behaviour is normalised amongst children in that way. I do not want the kids of today to become the gambling addicts of tomorrow. This bill at least opens up a debate and at least tries to restrict the issue of in-play betting. As imperfect as this bill is, at least it means that we are actually beginning to grapple with this problem.


This is an issue that goes back many years. Back in 2001 I was a member of the Parliament of South Australian and I was here lobbying members of this chamber to have the interactive gambling bill passed by the Senate. It was touch and go. I remember seeing: the late Senator Brian Harradine; the One Nation senator, Senator Len Harris; the then communications minister, Senator Richard Alston; and the many others that I spoke to in the course of the week that I was in Canberra. I was doing my bit, along with supporting the Reverend Tim Costello, to ensure that the bill was passed. It was certainly an improvement on what we had before, which was not much at all. 


But, whilst that bill was passed 16 years ago, it may as well have been passed 160 years ago, because so much has happened in the online gambling space since that time. This bill, at least, is an update of sorts, but I think it is interesting to reflect that back in December 2011 the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform during the period of the Gillard government prepared its second report on interactive and online gambling and gambling advertising. Back then, it was clear that overseas gambling websites were a real problem that needed to be addressed. 


I referred in my additional comments to that report to one particular case of a constituent that had serious problems with Casino.com, a site hosted in Singapore but licensed in Gibraltar. It has an Australian flag in the background and lists of Australian winners and it takes bets in Australian currency. This individual, and of course I will do nothing to identify him—my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore worked on this particular case, advocating for him as a constituent—initially appeared to win thousands of dollars. He tried to withdraw it, but he could not withdraw it. He got free credit, $250, on condition that he play certain games, which he did not wish to play. Within about two months, he was up $90,000. He seemed to win the money very easily with the casino games he was playing, but then he started to lose. At one point he lost $50,000 in a day. He was given free gifts: an iPod; a laptop; an iPhone 4, back then; a free trip to anywhere in the world plus $5,000 spending money. He was a VIP customer. The website then made $90,000 of unauthorised transactions from his credit cards. He made official complaints to three banks which have now reversed the transaction, but his total still stood at $120,000. 


This case illustrates that the potential for harm with overseas sites is great, and the regulatory framework in some of these countries is grossly inadequate. Try writing to the regulator in Gibraltar, and good luck to you. I have, and you are lucky to get a response in any form of timeliness. I think that it indicates that we ought to be able to tackle these overseas sites. That is why I will be moving an amendment in relation to that.


We have heard from a Canadian based company called Netsweeper, which says that you can block these sites. You can take action in respect of these sites. They say there is a way to do so. I will refer to that in the context of this amendment when I move it, but there are arguments that should be counted. There is an argument that an offshore, unlicensed, online gambling company can simply change their domain, the URL, to avoid blocking from Australia, and so accept Australian customers. 


Netsweeper is one of many on the market that are dealing with these issues The Netsweeper policy server and technology crawls through the internet daily for online gambling keywords. If an unlicensed company attempts to change its URL to avoid blocking, then Netsweeper will simply crawl, locate and categorise the new URL and therefore block it. The argument given is one that I think Senator Leyonhjelm referred to when he actually advised people what to do, to use a VPN to avoid website blocking. What Netsweeper, and I believe others, would say is that the KYC documentation of online gambling firms states that any customer who attempts to make a deposit with an Australian credit card, e-wallet or bank wire service must be registered with an Australian IP address or the deposit will be voided. Furthermore, if a customer attempts to withdraw funds, then a copy of the player's passport and a utility bill must be provided. If this documentation does not correspond with the Australian IP, then the customer's account will be suspended and the funds will not be dispersed. The online gambling industry has numerous security measures in place to avoid fraud and bonus abuse, often focusing on ensuring country identity. So you can deal with that argument.


The other argument is that blocking gambling websites will inadvertently also block gambling websites that may be properly licensed in Australia or that may have no relationship to gambling at all. The websites of all gambling companies that are properly licenced in Australia would be added to a whitelist of allowed sites with a deployed Netsweeper filtering system—or, indeed, other filtering systems—and using artificial intelligence engines to ensure that non-gambling websites are not blocked, with a final human review element used if required. So we can attempt to do this. When you consider the level of harm caused by online gambling, particularly from these unlawful sites, it is worth giving it a go.


During the joint select committee inquiry back in 2011, evidence was given by the Australian Bankers Association. I remember asking questions of then CEO Steven Munchenberg, the outgoing head of the ABA, who essentially said, 'Yes, we can cooperate in relation to this in terms of the big banks to block those sites.' They were already blocking other sites for various purposes, such as terrorist related purposes. It can be done if there is political will to do so. Considering that hundreds of millions of dollars are being lost to these unlawful sites, that is something we should attempt to do with alacrity. We need to tackle that.


It is also worth referring to the issue of domestic online sports betting websites. Back in 2011 the University of Sydney Gambling Treatment Clinic—the GTC—gave evidence saying that only five per cent of their clients in the 2006-07 financial year were reporting problem gamblers with sports betting. Problem gamblers with sports betting represented 15 per cent to 20 per cent in 2010-11. That was five years ago. I suggest that figure is now much higher. There has been an exponential increase in the growth of sports betting. There are now greater opportunities to gamble—every mobile phone can be turned into a betting terminal—and there is now the ability to cause much more harm, much more quickly. That is why this bill is welcomed, but it needs to go much further.


It is also worth reflecting on the research of Associate Professor Samantha Thomas and Dr Charles Livingstone, who have done terrific work in relation to online betting. Associate Professor Thomas did work on this a number of years ago. She found that young men in particular felt ostracised and felt isolated from their peer group if they did not gamble, such was the pressure to be part of a gambling culture. That is something that is very concerning and it is something that can drive levels of gambling addiction. Associate Professor Thomas has also done work on the number of young children who can recognise a sports betting operator, and the figures are staggering. Something like half of the young children she spoke to could recognise at least one sports betting agency—or an even greater amount. I do not have the figures in front of me, but it is a very significant number of young people who recognise it. We are talking about children.


Associate Professor Thomas has also made the point that schemes like Mad Bookie offer sponsorship to community sports clubs, which I think is quite pernicious. They offer clubs cashback if members sign up and bet on their website, and clubs are promised a 25 per cent cash rebate from members' losses each month. That raises very serious ethical issues—that is, to draw in a local club, a community club, into these sorts of schemes and arrangements. She says that schemes like Mad Bookie promote risk taking because there is perceived reward, even with gambling losses. Associate Professor Thomas said that the concern is that we will have a generation of kids who will are naturally transitioning to betting because it is in that club environment that kids are exposed to. Associate Professor Thomas said, 'Given our research, and considering how much kids are absorbing, having gambling sponsorship at a community sports club would not be consistent with a health promotion environment for kids.' She says that sports betting is being normalised for young children. She says: 'Kids tell us that they see gambling ads everywhere; they cannot escape them. You can't watch a game of footy or go to a sporting event without seeing them. Signage can appear to be quite harmless, but when you talk to kids, it is those kinds of things they see regularly and it becomes a natural part of their environment.' That is something that is very disturbing.


In fact, it was a 2016 study co-authored by Associate Professor Thomas that found that 75 per cent of children aged eight to 16 years believed wagering was a normal or common part of sport, and could name at least one gambling brand. One-quarter of the children could recall four or more betting brands, and three in four children could recall at least one. Many could quote specific promotional offers and could talk in terms of cashback or refund promotions and bonus bets. This was in an article in QWeekend not so long ago.


I just would reflect on another issue based on a discussion that I had with Senator Hanson and her colleagues earlier this evening. They indicated that they will be seeking to move another amendment on those online betting services that offer you the chance to bet on the outcome of those megalotteries overseas. Lottoland.com is a prime example of that, but there are others. This is an important issue, and that sort of betting ought to be prohibited. I understand that Senator Hanson and her colleagues are looking at moving an amendment in relation to that. I absolutely commend her for doing so, if that is what she will be doing in expressing those concerns. I share those concerns. It is absolutely important that we grapple with this because this bill should be the beginning of a series of legislative measures to deal with the impact of sports betting and the impact it is having on young people in particular around the country. I know from the work I have done with my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore that our current regulatory frameworks are pathetic. Our current regulatory frameworks are woefully inadequate.


The Northern Territory regulator, in dealing with online betting, have let down so many people. They do not appear to be a regulator with any degree of rigour. They are not a regulator that can be respected. They are a regulator that have ignored serious issues in terms of problem gambling behaviour and breaches of codes, and have been completely or largely ineffective. That is why a national response, in the absence of a strong state or territory based response, is important. That is why I see this bill as a first step to many other steps that must be taken.


Too many young people and too many members of the community are being bitten by the gambling bug because of online gambling. Too many young men in particular are missing out on a deposit for a first home, buying their first car or planning that overseas trip because they have blown it on online gambling. It causes huge scars for them emotionally, as well as the financial scars it causes. That is why this legislation should be seen as the beginning of the debate and not the end of the debate for the reforms that we so sorely need in terms of online gambling in this country.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-03-20,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (19:45):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak about the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. To be frank, I am feeling tentative and uncertain. I am in two minds: is this yet another nanny state intrusion to control people's lives or is technology moving far more quickly than society's ability to adapt? Coming to the first question of whether is this yet another nanny state intrusion to control people's lives: at Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, we value individual freedom. Individual freedom is essential for responsibility, as our party leader has said for 20 years in politics. Individual freedom is very important for long-term personal security. Quite frankly, we could say—which is pervasive now; the ads are pervasive during sports broadcasts—why not let sports rip and why not let the gambling industry drag itself into destruction so that people could see the damage it is doing to our communities? But would that be fair?


On the other hand, the argument could be that the technology is moving much quicker than our society's ability to adapt. Sure, we could let people go through a lot of pain and eventually realise that gambling is an ill that needs to be treated very, very seriously and people would take responsibility for their own lives. But how many people would be able to come through that in a reasonable amount of time without continuing suicides? People rack up big losses. It is just a small number of people who rack up huge losses because of the compulsion and the addiction, but they have very big consequences on families.


There is plenty of gambling right now. It does not matter where one goes, one can see gambling available. It is easy. We can go to the trots, we can go to the horses, we could get the pokies, we can gamble with our mates or we can gamble on the dogs. We can gamble on any number of things, so there is plenty of gambling. Why do we need internet gambling? Do we need internet gambling? Another thing to consider is that internet gambling is essentially dirty profits going overseas. Companies that are taking money overseas are set up in the Northern Territory, with very little regulation. There is very little in the way of impediments to control them, to oversee the damage that they are doing and to the rein that in. There are very serious questions.


I would like to refer to a report of August 2015 from Financial Counselling Australia, which is entitled Duds, mugs and the A-list. Why do I refer to a Financial Counselling Australia report? Financial counsellors assist consumers in financial difficulty; they know about financial difficulty and people in financial difficulty. They provide information, support and advocacy to help consumers deal with their immediate financial situation and minimise the risk of future financial problems. The majority of financial counsellors work in community organisations, although some are employed by government. Their services are free, confidential and independent. So financial counsellors have extensive knowledge in a range of areas: consumer credit law, debt enforcement practices, the budgetary regime, industry hardship policies and government concession frameworks.


Around Australia, there are a number of financial counsellors who specialise in gambling financial counselling and helping people repair their lives after the damage. Financial counsellors are assisting an increasing number of clients, we are told, who have experienced staggering sports betting losses. People are losing their own money as well as money provided as credit by the sports betting companies. As a result, clients are losing their savings, homes, redundancies and superannuation payments, and they are losing their families. There is anecdotal evidence, according to Financial Counselling Australia, that some so-called accidental deaths—such as single vehicle accidents—may in fact be people who are escaping gambling debts.


Looking at some insights into the industry, sports betting companies actively encourage customers to bet using credit provided by the gambling companies. They are foreign companies who may not be able to, or may not want to, pay off on winnings. It seems amounts ranging from $200 to many tens of thousands of dollars are loaned. In some cases, the lure is initial free bets. They are free bets to get people hooked. It familiarises consumers with the game before inducing them to take further credit. These so-called free bets can be provided unethically and in a misleading fashion.


Whether a particular person is given credit or not, or has an existing credit limit increased, is based on an assessment of whether the company is likely to be repaid rather than whether the customer would experience undue hardship in making repayments. For example, some clients, to continue gambling, will take the money from household living expenses. The sports betting company knows that they will always come good with the money. Debt collection in the sports betting industry is swift and brutal. Customers can lose assets, such as the family home, in very short spaces of time. Debt collection charges and the fees for a bankruptcy trustee can significantly increase the amount owed.


According to Financial Counselling Australia:


We were also told by a former employee that sports betting companies swap customer account data, contrary to privacy legislation. When a gambler 'goes cold' and stops betting with one company, the company swaps lists with another company, which then entices the person to resume gambling. The recipient can receive a fully functioning account populated with their private financial data, plus some 'free money'—


It sounds like a Greens exercise here! They receive free money or credit to welcome them into the fold. Then we look at the pain this causes. Here are some cases studies; people losing huge amounts that they cannot afford.


Peter, for example, a 40-something male, received a redundancy payment of approximately $60,000. Sitting at home, with no risk, he became depressed. With no work, he became depressed. There was also a death in the family. Now, at that time Peter started gambling online with two different online sports betting companies, and lost his entire redundancy payout within just two months—two months! He also took out payday loans and pawned most of the household goods at this time. When he came to see a financial counsellor, his family had no money for food or to pay bills. He was not eligible for Newstart allowance as the retrenchment payout is counted as income. Peter appeared depressed and deeply affected. His family had no income and their savings were long gone. He has a wife and child.


Another financial counsellor saw Alex, who lost $90,000 in one week on sports betting. Alex had amassed a staggering $300,000 in debt due to sports betting, primarily over the past three years. And things have not changed in the last 1½ years. Richard opened an online betting account with a sports betting company at the start of the AFL season. As part of this new account he received inducements of $100 to $500 in free bets. Similar inducements were offered at other points in the AFL season. What we are seeing here are individuals, vulnerable—sometimes depressed, but highly vulnerable—and maybe suffering an addiction to gambling, preyed upon by company after company, many of them from overseas.


Richard, in this case, had some mental health difficulties and his parents helped him to sell his home and move back in with them so that they could assist him. He finally sold his house and the proceeds of the sale were sitting in his bank account. In the process of setting up the bank account, he linked the sports betting account to that bank account. He initially played with the 'free' money and learned how to play. Isn't that wonderful? Make it easy for them to learn how to play! A month later he bet $20,000 on a drawn game and lost close to $10,000. Two weeks on, he transferred $50,000 from his linked bank account to his sports betting account and wagered the whole amount on three games of that round. He won $35,000. Richard then placed the entire $85,000 in his sports betting account on the following week's games and lost it all. The following week he transferred the remaining $90,000, and that he lost quickly.


Each time it took just one click—one click!—to transfer funds from his bank account to his sports betting account. Just one click. Richard ended up losing the entire proceeds of his house sale in a few weeks, and his future changed course. In his mid 30s he had lost everything. His parents told how they cried for their son.


It is not just junior people. Max was a senior employee in a large finance company. You would think that if anyone could understand it would be Max. He was spending $2,000 per bet on weekend sporting games through online sports betting. He was sent incentives to entice him to gamble more, and his bets went up to $5,000 per bet. And this man was the employee of a large finance company. This pattern continued for a long time. One weekend, Max's gambling became erratic, and he bet $250,000—a quarter of a million dollars—on a single game and lost. He placed a second quarter-of-a-million-dollar bet that same weekend, losing the entire half a million dollars. In total, he had lost $670,000 to the sports betting company. The sports betting company then froze his account.


On the Monday morning Max told company management about his losses and that he had embezzled the money from them. He no longer had assets, he has filed for bankruptcy and is now in prison. The financial counsellor discovered that he had a further $200,000 of unsecured debt on credit cards, also spent on funding his sports betting.


Max reflects on how easy it was to gamble this large amount. There were no safeguards when his behaviour became erratic. He was amazed at the ease with which he could increase his bets without any questioning or intervention. We understand, though, that betting companies use complex algorithms to detect gambling patterns in real time. They would have picked up Max's atypical bets, but chose to accept them from someone vulnerable.


Some people are borrowing from payday lenders to fund their sports betting debts. Marco, for example, came to the financial counsellor with significant online payday lending debts due to funding his own online gambling. He had lost the money on online sports betting and indicated his surprise at the ease at which he was both able to gamble and to fund his gambling addiction through online payday lenders. He did not need to leave the house to set up any of this; he could do it from the comfort of his own house. The financial counsellor negotiated settlements with the payday lenders based on legislated consumer protections. But the man was already in trouble.


Jack is on a disability support pension. Jack and his mother had joint title on the home. Jack received a phone call from a sports-betting company representative, who offered three $1,000 free bets so that he could 'get a feel for the service'. He then got an email saying, 'I have set up your account. I have put the free bets in.' Another phone call informed him, 'Are you aware that our company offers credit and could put some dollars into your account?' He initially declined the offer of credit, but about two weeks later he discovered $10,000 in credit in his account. He used it.


One month later, two unsolicited credit limit increases were applied, upping his first limit to $30,000 and then to $40,000. Eight days after that, the limit on his betting company account was increased to $60,000 and later to $80,000. And Jack used the money and lost it. The betting company and its legal representatives then dodged a creditors' petition to bankrupt Jack. They also issued a warrant of possession for the house and demanded that he vacate the property within 14 days. The financial counsellor said that this was a frightening time for Jack and his mother. He said, 'They called me often and asked, ""What do we do now?""'


The trustee fees and bankruptcy came to $50,000 and the case was resolved out of court. The financial counsellor helped them stay in their house but their losses were still substantial. 


What about suicide and sports betting debts? Tim had huge debts from sports betting. He had embezzled funds from his employer to fund his addiction. At one point he attempted suicide. After Tim came out of hospital he found emails in his inbox inviting him to come to a big boxing match. He went to a financial counsellor, seeking assistance to deal with his debts. An employee of the sports betting company described his conversation with the court bailiff about the success of serving court orders on an indebted gambler. 


Another example is Pete, a young adult living at home. He used his parents credit card one weekend and lost a few thousand dollars through online sports betting. He knew his parents would find out when they checked their account. He committed suicide, leaving an explanatory note apologising and explaining his shame. The parents met with a financial counsellor to work out how they could repay the credit card debt. 


A gambling counsellor who was interviewed said that her agency asked every new gambling client two questions as part of the intake process: 'Have you ever thought of suicide?' Most say, 'Yes.' And, 'Have you ever actually attempted it?' One in 10—10 per cent—say, 'Yes'. A gambling counsellor said: 'The gamblers see no way out. One client told me, ""I just wanted to drive straight off that bridge so I wouldn't have to face up to what I've done.""' Most do not do it because things do get better with help, and families do not know because of the shame. 


I cannot finish without saying something about another big gambling exercise. A few weeks ago, I was listening to people across south-west Queensland and I got wind of a town by the name Dirranbandi while I was in Balonne Shire Council offices in the town of St George near Dirranbandi. They told me that there are 100 vacant houses in Dirranbandi, a once thriving community. I said, 'How many houses are in Dirranbandi?' They said, 'We estimate around 300.' One-third of the houses are vacant, and the school enrolments have dropped by 50 per cent in just five years. The reason? As a parliament, we are gambling with taxpayer funds on the Murray-Darling Basin water buyback, destroying southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. People down the road at Goondiwindi, who have operations in Queensland and in New South Wales, told me the devastation in Dirranbandi is not as bad as the devastation in Collarenebri. Collarenebri and two other towns—give me a minute to think of the names—have also been devastated by this taxpayer funded federal government initiative. 


We are also gambling with the sovereignty and the governance of this country. This country's Constitution depends on competitive federalism, and there is a very, very good reason for that. Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen highlighted this when he abandoned and abolished estate duties—death duties. And what happened? Because of that, and his pro-business stance, his balancing of the budget and his support for infrastructure, people from the south flocked to the Gold Coast and now we see the miracle that is the Gold Coast. When Queensland took funding from investors from the south and retirees from the south, southern governments also abolished death duties. That is why we must restore competitive federalism. 


We also see the federal government gambling with innovation, as they say. What a lovely word—a catchphrase; a buzzword. I was asking Senator Sinodinos a couple of weeks ago in Senate estimates about the hundreds of millions of dollars being flung around in one program after another. The really sad thing is that the highly paid federal public servants actually believe it is going to work. History shows—cursory examples are an iPhone, a computer or a car—that all significant inventions and improvements come from someone who has skin in the game, someone who depends on his idea working. We know that for every one invention that works there are sometimes thousands of inventors who have not succeeded but who have plucked up the courage to do something. We also know that of the one inventor who succeeds, sometimes, he or she might go through hundreds of iterations before they succeed. This is hardly a gamble and yet our federal government is not leading by example. It is gambling; it is gambling with taxpayer funds. 


I hope I have conveyed to you the misery that is being caused by unregulated gambling. I hope I have conveyed that I am torn, in some ways, because— (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-03-20,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (20:05):  I do not mind admitting that I was not intending to speak on this bill until I was in the position a little bit earlier that you are in now when a number of the contributions made by other senators discussed the impact of problem gambling. It caused me to have another look at the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. No matter how you might like to dress it up, this bill is not about dealing with problem gambling, save for perhaps one clause in relation to the call-to-bet or click-to-call procedures. 


This is really more about tax revenue for the government and they are dressing it up as purporting to solve a problem gambling issue because there are unregulated gambling operations that are taking bets from Australians. They can do it very easily, and they essentially pay no licence fees, turnover taxes or anything else that is attached to it. I am not standing in the way of that, but what I have listened to is people coming out with sob-story after sob-story about individuals who have been impacted by gambling. I will have a bet with anyone in this place that no-one is closer to the issue of problem gambling destroying individuals' lives than me, not because I have a problem with gambling but because someone very close to me does. I have seen millions of dollars disappear. I have seen families get destroyed. I have seen businesses get destroyed. I have seen people at the pits of despair as a result of gambling. And yet I do not blame the gambling operators; I blame the individuals for making those determinations themselves.


Having said that, there are things we can do, and this is where I am going to depart from the bill a little bit. There are things we can do and that we should be doing to ensure the integrity, the efficacy and the ethical conduct of gambling operators in this country. That is why I support this bill and I told the minister that. At least if you are dealing with a licensed and regulated gambling operator in this country, you can be sure that they are subject to Australian laws. You cannot guarantee you are going to be remunerated. If you are dealing with an overseas operator, you do not know about the transparency or accountability of it. Your money could be just disappearing into a black hole.


And yet there is a part of me that heard Senator Leyonhjelm's speech earlier and thought, 'We cannot be there to protect everyone from making dumb decisions themselves.' No matter how many times you have warnings from ASIC or one of the other regulators that you should not send money to unscrupulous cold callers in investments or any other form, people still do it. Then, when they lose their money, they come back and say the government should do something about it. I do not always subscribe to that. I think that ultimately people are making these decisions for themselves. Our job and the education system's job is to make sure that people are equipped to deal with the issues they are going to face in life, and that is something we have walked away from as the nanny state seeks to take away any risk from any individual.


But I do not think this legislation is going to be effective in stopping problem gambling or stopping people developing gambling habits that lead to catastrophic consequences in some areas. I wanted to speak a little bit from experience. One of the problems we have got with domestic operators is the fact that there are a lot of young people—14, 15 and 16—who have seen the odds on the screen about sports betting in particular and are lured to the websites. They input their details at a website and, although they do not have a verified account, they can go in and look at the odds on the next no-ball being bowled or who is going to kick the first goal and things like that. Children today are interested in that and go and register on it.


But imagine my surprise when I found out from some of my son's friends that, when they do this online, they suddenly get a phone call from their new friend 'Bill' or 'Bob' at one of the sporting agencies, asking them why they have not funded their account yet, never verifying that they are actually of legal age. They just ring up and say: 'Hello, John. Thanks for putting your name in. We noticed you haven't made a bet or sent any money through yet. It might be a good idea to.' The only reason I found out about this was that I was in the car when one of my son's friends took that phone call. I said, 'Who was that?' 'Oh, that was my mate at XYZ Betting agency.' You can imagine a couple of days later I rang XYZ Betting Agency, asked to speak to the general manager and told him that what they were doing was thoroughly unethical and inappropriate. I received assurances that that would not continue and they would amend their programs, but I would lay London to a brick that that same sort of marketing and online campaigning is happening at many of the regulated gambling firms in this country. It is not right. That is one way you can get it fixed.


The other aspect of regulated gambling, bet-takers and sports bookmakers was raised with me by a constituent just the other day. They said, 'The problem is they only want to deal with losers.' I can understand that: you want to make sure you are making a profit. But, if you are actually a successful punter and you ring XYZ Betting Agency, they look at your track record and they do not offer you the same odds. They say, 'No, we're not taking your money.' You no longer get the accelerated bet or the other benefits, perks and accoutrements that they advertise as a way of getting ahead. And we all see those ads on television. And so they are allowing losers to get the benefits because the chances are they are not going to win, but, if you are actually a winner, their business model says, no, you are no longer allowed to deal with them or you are going to deal on such unfavourable terms that it is unscrupulous. It is not even adhering to or providing the odds and the services that they market so readily.


The third aspect if you want to clean up problem gambling in particular in the sports arena but also in any regulated arena is to outlaw credit betting. People cannot borrow money through any regular financial agency, whether it be shares, a bank or anywhere else, without going through a plethora of checks. We say this all the time to the banking industry. You want to have a royal commission into banking because of lending practices, but you ought to look at the lending practices of some of these online gambling agencies. They do not care. 'Yeah, sure, we'll lend you $100. We'll lend you $1,000. We'll lend you $20,000, $30,000, $50,000'—until they send the bailiffs in because they know that, chances are, you are going to lose that. And so, if you said no, there is no longer credit betting for 'unsophisticated' punters, if you want to put it in the investment parlance, where people have to meet a minimum criteria where they are meant to be adult enough to look after themselves—if you said there is no more credit betting available to individuals that did not meet those criteria, you would limit the ability for individuals to get involved in gambling out of their financial depth.


This brings me to the fourth point. If you think gambling is becoming a compulsion and people are just chasing from one bet to the next to the next, the only thing that allows them to do that is either the instant transfer of money into the bookmaker's account or the ability to access credit from that bookmaker. If you have outlawed or prohibited the provision of credit to non-sophisticated or non-professional punters, however you want to describe them, and then say it is going to be a 72-hour waiting period or thereabout—48 hours or whatever you want—you are breaking that ability to cycle from one bet to another and continue to chase your losses. That is the same principle that is attached to how we deal with people who have gambling addictions, or addictions of any nature, in fact. You take away the ability for them to participate in that addictive behaviour, and you give them a chance to gather their thoughts and have a sleep on it. As our mothers always said, 'It will feel better in the morning.' Generally, it does feel better in the morning, after you have had a good night's sleep. You say, 'Okay, I have a problem. I have got to confront that. How am I going to deal with it?'


If we are serious about dealing with problem gambling in this country, and particularly online gambling, those are practical steps that perhaps this Senate and the government should consider. But the bill before us is not about problem gambling. It is about tax revenue and, in some ways, giving some level of confidence to the Australian people who want to gamble online that they are doing it with a 'reputable operator'. Once again, I put air quotes around 'reputable operator', because the problem with parts of this legislation is that ACMA is going to be providing a list of licensed bookmakers, or licensed or approved gambling service providers. I think that is fraught with danger, quite frankly. I am not sure that anyone is going to go to the ACMA website and say, 'Who can I place my Melbourne Cup bet with today?' What they will do is a Google search, and whoever has paid for the highest ranking on Google will probably get their business, if they have not already got an account. 


I think it opens up the government to a bit of a problem. What if one of those gambling operators does the wrong thing? Yes, they will be held to account for it, and other things, but will the government be blamed by the punter who will say, 'This is one of your approved service providers'? I wonder about the wisdom of that intervention. I do not think it is necessary. It probably will not do any harm, but, nonetheless, if you are thinking that is a way of stamping out the problems involved with sports betting, I think it is paying lip-service to it, quite frankly.


I do support the click-to-call provision, because there is clearly a loophole. The intention is that you cannot place in-play bets online, for the reason that you could do it very, very quickly as you did not have to speak with an operator, and it led people into what could be a cycle of addiction. This provision is designed to circumvent that, because the call comes from a robot which repeats the information that you have already put into your betting app, and the bet takes place in a very short space of time. If people want to bet in-play, I do think it is reasonable for them to be in a place of gambling frequency. If they are in their local TAB, or their local pub, watching a game on TV and they want to go and place a bet on it, I really do not see a problem with that. People who are in licensed premises should have the ability to do that. If individuals want to call up and place bets, it is another way of circumventing or delaying the instant gratification response of putting a bet on, getting an immediate result and then waiting for the next one. It is that intervention period, which I talked about earlier, and how that can help break the cycle of addiction.


In the end, I will support this legislation, but I do not want it to pretend to be something that it is not. That is why I have put on the record tonight my thoughts about how, if we want to tackle problem gambling, we have to start to approach it in a better way than, and in a different way from, this bill and what it is supposed to deal with or has been characterised as dealing with. Let us see how the amendments play out. I am not sure about which amendments, if any, I will be supporting. I do want to put on the record that I am absolutely mindful of the potentially catastrophic consequences of problem gambling and what it does to individuals and families, but I am also mindful that it is not our responsibility here to protect everyone from their own inanity and foolish behaviour, and that extends to not only the process of placing bets but who they can place bets with. This bill does not really deal with any of the substantive problem-gambling issues. I do believe it is a revenue bill, albeit one dressed up in some moral guidance.

Senator BURSTON
 (New South Wales) (20:19):  Different sectors of the community have differing opinions about the virtues of gambling. Regardless of your views on the topic, it is a reality and it is here to stay, for the foreseeable future at least.


Gamblers will tell you that there is nothing like the thrill of the win, and they downplay the losses, preferring to look forward to the next big win. Detractors will tell you that the act of gambling in any form is a sin and has no redeeming qualities, and neither do the gamblers who engage in it.


Whatever your opinion, we have to deal with what we have and manage the market so that those who engage in gambling are, in some cases, protected from themselves. We must also ensure that the organisations that enter the market conduct themselves in a manner that does as little harm to the gamblers as possible in the context of their interaction with them.


Traditionally, punters would go to the racetrack and place a bet with a bookie, or go to the TAB and bet on a horserace, a dog race or, more recently, some other sporting event. Now gambling has taken on a whole new complexion. If you want, you can bet on who kicks the first goal, who runs last, who is first to touch the ball and so on. We have grown to accept this myriad of options available to us, and gambling companies have grown with it.


Most of the types of gambling I just mentioned went into overdrive with the advent of online gambling. The combination of a gambler, an internet connection and an account with a gambling provider means you can bet on a football match in the USA, a horserace in Happy Valley in Hong Kong and a soccer match in the UK all from the comfort of your phone while you sit at home in downtown Newcastle.


Offshore companies that come to Australia to sell their services to punters generally register in the Northern Territory, paying $550,000 a year in licensing fees and taking approximately $8.6 billion from the community, while paying only $6.5 million in tax for the privilege. Their revenues go offshore and do not contribute to Australian society. The taxes stay in the Northern Territory, despite the revenue being gained from across Australia.


Add to this a new company from Gibraltar that allow punters to bet on the outcome of a lottery. They are registered in the Northern Territory, and their revenues are unknown at this stage, but all those revenues leave this country and put the livelihoods of 4½ thousand independent newsagents who rely on gambling revenues at risk. The company do not add value to the gambling process. They are truly parasites, who offset their risk by insuring against a punter having a win. There is no guarantee that they have the capacity if a punter should make a big win. There is no way of knowing if they will conduct themselves ethically in any situation they are not prepared to embrace.


One Nation's proposed amendment to the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 calls for the banning of this particular type of operator in the gambling industry that allows punters to bet on the outcome of other lotteries or events, but it does not have any impact on other foreign companies registered in the Northern Territory.


Be under no illusion: this is a multibillion-dollar industry. The foreign companies make an absolute fortune from operations all around the world. We are not against free enterprise, nor are we against entrepreneurs making an honest dollar. I emphasise the 'honest dollar' and leave it up to you to decide what that might be. We believe that the companies that allow punters to bet on the outcome of another company's lottery are not making an honest dollar. They do not add value and are parasites on the industry, which probably does not have a whole lot of saving graces to begin with. I commend One Nation's amendment, which Senator Hanson will be introducing, to the Senate.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (20:23):  I have been listening to some of the speeches here tonight, and gambling is a huge issue. Senator Bernardi commented on friends that he has seen involved in gambling and on the repercussions that it has had on them. I too have known people where gambling has affected them, so I am sure we have all been touched by it. But I also agree with Senator Bernardi that gambling is a part of life. I cannot see it being wiped out at all, and I do not believe that we should. People have to be responsible for their own actions, and I would not like to see us become a nanny state. I support this bill from the government, the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016, and I will be moving an amendment.


The gambling industry is flourishing, and we ask: where does the money go? There are a few international corporate bookmakers in Australia, and they rake in $8.6 billion from sports and racing betting, yet they only contribute back to the Northern Territory government $6.5 million in tax. Licences can be bought from the Northern Territory for $550,000 a licence per annum.


Another foreign entity that is working in Australia and buys a licence from the Northern Territory is called Lottoland. Lottoland, I have been told, have a contract with a Gibraltar company. They buy a licence for $550,000 in the Northern Territory, and what they offer Australians is the ability to bet on the outcome of megalotteries around the world. It is unknown what they rake in in their turnover, but the thing is that they do not pay tax. They pay no tax in this country whatsoever. Unlike the international corporate bookmakers, Lottoland pay no tax, but what must be also considered is: can they pay on a win if there is a win?


Lottoland is jeopardising the 4½ thousand newsagents who rely on lotteries. They contribute $1.4 billion across the nation in taxes that are paid and a further $150 million in GST. Lottoland, you might think, is a big organisation, employs people and brings a lot to the country, but it does not. It only employs six people. And yet I am sure we have seen, if not hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions of dollars leaving the country, tax free.


What we have to consider and what I will be moving today is an amendment. I am led to believe that Lottoland have been shut down in France and Italy, and the UK is now looking at shutting them down. The amendment that I will move here today to part of this bill is basically to put a stop to organisations like Lottoland that provide a service relating to betting on the outcome of a lottery. Hence, what we will be doing, if my colleagues in this place support my amendment, is to stop people like the organisation Lottoland—plus a couple of others who are possibly eyeing off coming over here to do the same—ripping off, as I said, hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars out of our economy. They do not pay tax, and there is no guarantee that they will be able to pay up if anyone does have a win. I hope that people will support this amendment, because, at the end of the day, we will be looking after Australian businesses who rely on lotteries for that extra little bit of cream, because that helps keep them profitable, and probably helping Australians who may not have been paid by these organisations that may be questionable. So I hope that I get support on this amendment.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (20:29):  Unless there are any other colleagues who want to contribute, I will close the debate on the second reading of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. I thank colleagues for their contributions and for the spirit in which they have been made. I know this is an area that is of concern to most colleagues.


As colleagues know, the government is committed to strengthening the regulatory enforcement of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and protecting Australian interests from illegal offshore gambling operators. This bill is the first stage of a three-stage process aimed at protecting Australia's wagering, racing and sporting industries, problem and at-risk gamblers, consumers and the integrity of Australian sport. I do not think anyone here pretends that we can stop 100 per cent of money going offshore, but the government is confident that the measures in this bill will have a significant disruptive impact on illegal offshore wagering. That is the aim of this legislation—to stop as much of the illegal offshore wagering activity as we can so that where wagering by Australians takes place it does so with properly licenced onshore operators with stronger consumer protections.


The legislative amendments will prohibit a person providing regulated interactive gambling services to Australians unless the person holds a licence under the law of an Australian state or territory. The bill will clarify the licensing requirements for interactive gambling services in Australia and will provide a simple-to-establish key criterion for enforcement agencies when investigating whether to take action against unlicensed services. This bill will introduce a civil penalty regime which will be enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. This amendment will allow for a quicker and more focused response as formal investigation or prosecution will not depend upon the priorities of other agencies. Civil remedies for the provision of prohibited or unlicensed interactive gambling services to Australians will carry a maximum penalty of $1.35 million per day for individuals and $6.75 million per day for organisations. The criminal provisions of the act will be maintained for more serious offences and now carry a maximum penalty of $900,000 per day for individuals and $4.5 billion per day for organisations. The reforms will enable the ACMA to notify the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of the names of directors or principals of offending gambling services so that they can be placed on the movement alert list and any travel to Australia can be disrupted.


These enforcement actions will be combined with a number of measures to build relationships with international regulators and raise awareness of Australian gambling laws and the risks associated with illegal gambling services. The bill will also, importantly, prohibit click-to-call in-play betting services. The government is committed to closing down these services, as they undermine the intent of the Interactive Gambling Act to limit the scope of problem gambling in Australia.


In addition to the bill and at the core of the government's response to the O'Farrell review is the development of a national consumer protection framework for online wagering in Australia. Can I take the opportunity of again thanking Mr O'Farrell for his work. This is indeed one of the largest reforms to the online wagering industry since the introduction of the Interactive Gambling Act in 2001. On 25 November last year Commonwealth, state and territory ministers gave in-principle agreement to key aspects of the national consumer protection framework. This includes a national self-exclusion register for online wagering, a voluntary opt-out pre-commitment scheme for online wagering and prohibition of lines of credit being offered by online wagering providers. This government will continue to work with the states and territories to develop the framework to ensure that there is a strong, robust set of national standards for online wagering that will provide greater protection for Australian consumers. The government will also be consulting with internet service and financial payment providers around disruption measures to further reduce illegal offshore gambling activity.


I would like to turn briefly to some of the issues that senators have raised in this debate so far, some of which will no doubt be the subject of amendments moved in the committee stage. Firstly, I will turn to Labor's second reading amendment that has been circulated. The government certainly does acknowledge that there is a level of community concern in relation to gambling advertising. This is something I have raised with the broadcasters. It is important for the broadcasters to ensure that their advertising is conducted in a way that reflects community standards. Indeed, this is the objective of the co-regulatory framework of codes of practice that is in place and which the government supports. I note that the opposition also supports the co-regulatory framework. Suffice to say in relation to Labor's second reading amendment, we do not agree with making policy by way of second reading amendments, so we will not be supporting that put forward by the opposition.


I will turn now to the Greens' amendments. The amendment in Senator Di Natale's name is in relation to gambling advertising. For similar reasons, the government will not be supporting Senator Di Natale's amendment. Senator Rhiannon's amendment was on expansion of gambling. The government will not be supporting Senator Rhiannon's amendment. It is not correct to allege that this bill will lead to an expansion of the Australian gambling market as the amendment suggests. The bill only preserves the status quo and clarifies the act; it does not enable activities that were not previously permitted. Far from leading to an expansion of the gambling market, the bill in fact achieves the opposite through its closing of the click-to-call in-play betting loophole. The government also rejects the slur in the second part of the amendment.


I will turn now to the NXT amendments. NXT colleagues have raised a number of issues in their contributions. I think it is fair to characterise many of the NXT amendments as foreshadowed as largely seeking to implement elements of the government's response to the O'Farrell review, which we are seeking to implement as part of the national consumer protection framework with the states and territories. The government believes that it is important that we work with the states and territories, as much of the regulation of wagering is in state and territory legislation. It is states and territories that license wagering operators, and it is state and territory regulators that are largely responsible for compliance and enforcement. The government is absolutely committed to implementing the national framework. There has already been a meeting of the Commonwealth with state and territory gaming ministers and in-principle agreement was reached to implement the elements of the framework. So, while the government agrees with much of the substance of the NXT amendments, we will not be supporting them, as we feel it is more appropriate to pursue those elements through the process that is already well underway with our state and territory counterparts. 


In terms of Senator Kakoschke-Moore's amendment in relation to place-based betting services, there has already been some concern expressed around the bill's clarification of in-play betting being permitted in licensed retail venues on electronic terminals. The bill that is before the Senate seeks to do nothing more than preserve the status quo. The Interactive Gambling Act was not intended to regulate activities in retail venues. It is about regulating the online space. In-play betting is currently permitted and takes place in retail venues on electronic betting terminals. In some venues, these are fixed terminals; in others, customers can load money onto a tablet. As I said, the bill seeks to do nothing more than preserve the status quo. It will not be permitted to offer in-play betting on personal devices—I should make that very clear. Nor will it be permitted to offer in-play betting by electronic means via a customer's online account. The establishments that we are talking about here are monitored by staff trained in the responsible service of gaming and alcohol. These establishments can only be accessed by adults. They do not permit intoxicated persons to remain on the premises. They have set opening and closing times and only accept cash payments. These elements provide a level of harm minimisation that would not be available in a private dwelling, using a personal device. 


The bill reflects an important distinction between equipment that is provided in a regulated environment, which is available to all customers, and gambling on personal devices used in the home or other private places which would not be subject to harm minimisation controls. As stated in our government response to the illegal offshore wagering review, we are not expanding the range of gambling products in Australia. The bill is simply clarifying the services that are currently permitted under Commonwealth, state and territory laws. Further, the Commonwealth's legislation only deals with devices on which in-play betting is permitted. Other than for the issue of in-play betting, the legislative framework and regulations for betting on in-venue devices is a matter for each state and territory. If there are concerns about portable devices, it is open to each state and territory to limit their use or prohibit them in retail venues, if they see fit. 


I turn now to Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment relating to online poker—a further matter which has been raised in the context of this bill. The government is aware that a number of Australians currently access online poker sites. Online poker is and always has been a prohibited service under the IGA. It has always been the intent of the IGA to prohibit this service being offered to Australians. That is why there are no Australian licensed operators of online poker, but because the law has been ambiguous overseas operators have been freely offering these services to Australians. With the law being clarified, it is evident that a number of these operators have begun withdrawing their services from Australians. Whilst I appreciate that this is not welcomed by those individuals who have been using these services, it is a fact that online poker has always been a prohibited service under the act. It is not something that this bill is enacting. Whether online poker should be legal in Australia or not is a separate debate. I indicate that the government has no plans to liberalise online poker, and in terms of this bill the government has merely sought to ensure that the original intent of the legislation is upheld. 


I should also acknowledge that One Nation have flagged an intention to move an amendment in relation to Lottoland. I thank One Nation for making contact during the second reading debate to indicate that they would be doing this. Let me just say at this point that, in relation to that foreshadowed amendment, the bill before us is intended to tackle illegal offshore wagering. Lottoland is, at present, neither illegal nor offshore. It is a licensed service in the Northern Territory. So it would be fair to say that that foreshadowed amendment is beyond the intended scope of this bill, but, as always, when colleagues put a proposition before us, we will always take on board what is put before us. But I think on this occasion, in the time available to us and given the scope of this bill, it is not possible for us to examine it and to support it in the context of this legislation. 


In conclusion, since the introduction of the bill in November last year, a number of major offshore gambling operators have ceased providing or indicated that they will withdraw their prohibited services as Australia will no longer be a grey market when it comes to gambling laws. This bill does send a clear message to overseas operators and regulators that Australia is serious about compliance with its online gambling laws. International experience has shown that illegal offshore betting cannot be eradicated in its entirety. However, a combination of clearer laws, an active regulator, stronger enforcement measures and awareness activities can significantly reduce illegal gambling activity. 


The bill has been developed in consultation with many stakeholders across the wagering, racing and sporting industries, academia, responsible gambling organisations, consumers and governments. I look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders to progress the National Consumer Protection Framework.


I should indicate that I will be working closely with my ministerial colleague Mr Tudge, who has put a tremendous effort into this area, and it is appropriate that I acknowledge that. There is more work to be done. As indicated, it is a three-stage process. I commend the bill to my colleagues.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:16):  I appreciate the opportunity to outline Labor's position on the government's Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. While Labor recognises well-regulated gambling has a place in Australian society and, indeed, that many Australians enjoy a responsible punt, the growth of illegal online gambling is of great concern to Labor. We are concerned because times have changed. The growth of digital technology, including smart phones, allows Australians to wager and gamble whenever and wherever they choose. We are in a digital age, an age of rapid change especially in relation to technology. Most of us have handheld devices—smart phones—that allow us to access a range of services, apps and information by simply swiping our screens. With this change in technology has come an increase in the number of offshore operators. We know that this has impacted on problem gamblers.


Labor believes that it is time to do more and to amend this act to prohibit these operators and stop the growth of illegal online gambling. Labor agrees that the government's Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill picks up on some of the concerns around the growth of illegal online gambling. It will also go some way to improving the protections for those who choose to wager within an online environment. The majority of people who bet do enjoy it and gamble in a responsible manner. However, Labor also knows that gambling our community can, in some cases, have devastating consequences—social, financial and emotional consequences. That is why we have always maintained a strong stance on ensuring appropriate harm minimisation measures are in place to protect and assist our community.


Labor broadly supports the bill's main focus, which sets out to bolster the enforcement of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. What Labor wants to ensure is that these new reforms will be about protecting people and about mitigating the effects of problem gambling more broadly. Currently, illegal offshore providers can target Australian gamblers even though they operate outside the country. Labor recognises that this practice has to stop. We know that this bill will go some way to stopping these operators in the responsible jurisdictions from trading in Australia illegally, but we are not naive: illegal offshore gambling operators will still try to operate in Australia and we should continue to look at innovative ways and means to stop this from happening.


We agree with the reform in this bill that seeks to prohibit click-to-call in-play betting services. We have seen concerns in past years about the links between gambling and sporting incidents and the impact of such links on match outcomes. We also know that this type of click-to-call betting is linked with problem gambling. Placing numerous bets in a short period of time does have the capacity to lead to problem gambling. Evidence to date suggests that young men are particularly vulnerable to this type of wagering and the addiction that can arise from it. From a perspective of harm minimisation, what is proposed is a sensible way forward and we support the prohibition of click-to-call in-play betting.


One area that Labor will continue to watch very closely is the in-play betting in licensed venues and how the government continues to tackle this into the future. To be clear, Labor does not support a proliferation of in-play terminals in venues. We do not support a shift from tethered terminals in venues to electronic mobile services. However, as this is the government's bill and we cannot be certain of how the government will deal with this form of on-premise betting into the future, we are concerned about what this means. Within the explanatory memorandum, a new definition of place-based betting services clarifies that electronic betting terminals can continue to be provided in places where the provider is licensed under a law of a state or territory to provide such services. Labor will be watching very carefully to see if any expansion of these services does occur and what the government response is if this does happen. We assume that the government will act if proliferation of mobile devices in licensed premises does occur.


We know that the O'Farrell review highlighted that Australia's consumer protection was weak and inconsistent. As I have stated, Labor is supportive of harm minimisation and strengthening consumer protection when it comes to problem gambling. We think this bill, however, could be improved in some aspects. We have already acknowledged the gambling can—and in some cases has already has already—have devastating social, financial and emotional consequences for Australians. Problem gambling can and has ruined lives. We know that improving protections for consumers is a good thing.


While we welcome the government's response to the O'Farrell review, which stated it will aim to agree on a consumer protection model within 12 months, we welcome the commitment by the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers in November last year to work together to develop a national consumer protection framework and we are supportive of the establishment of the national consumer protection framework, what we do not want to do is wait for another three years for this important work to be completed. So, while we welcome progress, our message for the government today is that they really need to get on with the work that is required, without delay.


With regard to credit betting: Labor knows that gambling in our community, as I have said, can have devastating impacts. So we are a little surprised that in this bill the government has not included any reform around the banning of credit betting, especially when we consider the coalition's policy on problem gambling, where it flagged the prohibition of credit betting back in 2013. And here we are: it is 2017.


For the past three or four years, the coalition has had a policy position on this banning of credit betting, and yet in its first tranche of reform it does not seem to deal with this very issue. That begs the question: why has the government not dealt with credit betting within the reform of this Interactive Gambling Act? This is particularly so, given that the minister has asserted that he has been very keen to ban this type of betting. To strengthen harm minimisation for problem gamblers, I want to indicate that Labor would certainly support the government taking that direction.


To continue with the theme of protection, I wish to speak on a matter of significant and widespread public concern that has gone hand in hand with the growth of online betting in Australia. Many Australians continue to have concerns around the promotion of betting odds and gambling advertising, especially during live sporting broadcasts. I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, that you understand exactly what I am referring to. There are existing safeguards to restrict gambling advertising and betting odds on television and radio in Australia. But it is apparent that they do not go far enough to address community concerns.


In early February 2017, Labor moved a second reading amendment designed to protect Australians, including children, and calling for action to ensure that live sporting broadcasts are free from intrusive gambling advertising and betting odds promotion. Now, that motion was narrowly defeated in the House and, despite voting against Labor's motion, the responsible government minister did put it on the public record that the coalition does also share some of these concerns. He said that the Turnbull government 'certainly acknowledged the concerns which many Australians have in relation to gambling advertising.' Further, the Minister for Communications, Minister Fifield, was quoted in a Radio Australia news story recently as saying in a statement:


… the Government was aware of community concern about the issue, but … ""Broadcasters have a responsibility under the co-regulatory framework to ensure that their advertising meets community expectations.""


What is telling is that some of the insightful and community-minded players are speaking out on this issue themselves. In the same Radio Australia news story that I just referred to, Damian McIver mentioned two concerns that high-profile AFL players have about the prevalence of gambling—particularly gambling advertisements. The Geelong defender Harry Taylor is actually quoted as saying:


I've got three kids at home and when my eldest can name a lot of the ads on TV, that is a bit of a worry.


Indeed. Taylor's comments follow comments from Western Bulldogs defender Easton Wood, who posted his views on Twitter in February this year, saying:


Gambling advertising is out of control and I think it needs to change …


…   …   …


The obvious issue here is the effect this advertising has on children every time they watch us pull on our boots.


I think that sums up the community concern in a very clear and simple sentence.


In an article on the same topic, The Age recently published an article by Jon Pierik, reporting that the AFL commissioner Kim Williams had expressed concern at the level and nature of gambling advertising during match broadcasts, and that he is understood to be putting together a paper about his concerns.


In support of our second reading amendment, my Labor colleagues in the other place made reference to research that was undertaken to explain further this community concern around advertising for gambling during live broadcasts of sport. This research, undertaken by Deakin University, points out a number of very concerning issues with regard to children and gambling advertising on television. I just want to spend a little time this evening going through the findings of the research, because it is another piece of evidence to support Labor's concerns around the possibility of legislation to improve outcomes for Australians with regard to advertising of gambling.


The research from Deakin found that over 90 per cent of children—90 per cent!—can recall having seen an advertisement for sports betting. Three-quarters of children aged eight to 16 years can recall the name of at least one sports-betting brand and approximately a quarter can recall four brands or more. This is absolutely amazing evidence to indicate the impact of advertising on the scale that we are seeing it right now in our country. Seventy-five per cent of children think that gambling is a normal or common part of sport. Parents also conveyed concerns, including that gambling advertising is so prevalent that it is changing the way their kids think about and talk about sport.


This is what the kids communicated to researchers about gambling advertising. I will use their own words, because they are highly instructive. A 15-year-old boy: 'I don't think they're good for kids. They're trying to make it cool. They put them during sport, when kids are watching.' Another boy, 13 years old: 'They shouldn't be allowed during sport, because lots of kids watch it. Ads pull you in—it's bad.' A 15-year-old boy: 'Ads for sports betting tell you to bet with them and make it look like you're going to win. They make it look positive and fun.' And a 10-year-old boy: 'The advertisement convinces you to bet. You can get your money back if you lose by eight points.' Out of the mouths of babes we are getting serious instruction on the need for some serious change with regard to this problem in our community. When we look at these findings, we can understand why parents are worried about their kids being subjected to gambling advertising during live sporting events.


Labor understands that Australians want to keep broadcasts of live sport and gambling as separate things. It is in everyone's interests to ensure that children do not associate betting and gambling as a normal part of watching sport on television. And yet these commercials continue to intrude upon our nation's love of sport, and they cause significant public concern.


Following the leadership of and the intervention by the Labor government in 2013 in this area, the broadcast industry responded to address public concerns and develop rules set to restrict gambling advertising in live sports broadcasting and the promotion of betting odds in particular. While the new code of practice limits the promotion of live odds in particular and restricts gambling ads, it does continue to allow two important elements: firstly, the promotion of betting odds half an hour before play and in the half hour after play by clearly identified gambling representatives; and, secondly, commercials relating to betting or gambling before play has commenced, during scheduled breaks, during unscheduled breaks and after play has concluded. That is to say that the code of practice allows significant windows of opportunity for gambling advertising around the edges of live sports broadcasts. 


The time has come for the government to change this reality. The broadcast industry and sporting codes need to accept that gambling advertising before and during live sports broadcasts is indeed contrary to community standards and they need to amend the broadcasting codes of practice accordingly. Current restrictions should be extended to ensure that there is no promotion of betting odds or gambling advertising at all in the 30 minutes before play and that there is no gambling advertising at all during scheduled breaks such as half-time or unscheduled breaks such as weather delays. It goes without saying that current exemptions for horseracing, harness racing and greyhound racing would continue to apply. The Melbourne Cup would not be affected, for example; that is to say that Labor does not propose to prohibit gambling advertising and betting-odds promotion around the broadcast of those forms of entertainment: horseracing, harness racing or greyhound racing. 


In calling on the government to work with industry on a transition plan to phase out gambling advertising and betting-odds promotion over time, Labor adopts a pragmatic approach. Labor is conscious of the need to address public interest considerations in a way that does not impose unnecessary financial and administrative burdens on providers of broadcasting services. We are not proposing an immediate blanket ban on gambling advertising or betting-odds promotion in broadcasting. In calling for a transitional approach over time and a targeted approach in respect of live sporting broadcasts, Labor affords industry the time and flexibility needed to alter current business practices and contractual arrangements. 


A consultative approach is part and parcel of Labor's approach. Our second reading amendment outlines and continues the conversation that was started with industry in 2013 by the Gillard government, and it supports a continuation of that consultative approach between government, broadcasters and sporting organisations to address community concerns. Labor's approach demonstrates an understanding of and a confidence in the co-regulatory system of broadcast regulation that was enshrined in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Under this system, industry has the opportunity to develop codes of practice to address matters of concern to the community and where a code of practice is not operating to provide appropriate community safeguards the government regulator, the ACMA, may step in and regulate by way of a program standard. 


I note that some sectors of the industry disagree that there is a problem with the current level of gambling advertising. In their media release just last week, Free TV stated that Labor's proposals were 'unwarranted' and that 'commercial broadcasters already have the most comprehensive, targeted set of restrictions on the promotion of betting services of any media platform in Australia today' and they declared that 'complaints about betting are low'. Commercial Radio Australia described Labor's proposal as 'unnecessary and counterproductive' and stated that 'any further restrictions cannot be justified'. But Labor regards it as appropriate that the industry has the opportunity to amend their codes of practice to address genuine community concern. On this I note that Labor's proposal does not dictate the terms, the timing or the mechanisms by which the broadcasting industry might phase out gambling and betting promotion during live sports broadcasts. 


Labor also regards the system of co-regulation as an effective mechanism for dealing with matters that the industry may find challenging to deal with. Labor understands that betting and gambling advertising represents a significant revenue stream to industry and that it may be challenging for industry to wean itself off such lucrative arrangements in the current media environment. On this matter, it is instructive to note the explanatory memorandum to the Broadcasting Services Act acknowledges: 


Areas such as … advertising, are matters of community concern which could conflict with a service provider’s responsibility to its shareholders to maximise profits. 


This part—that is, part 9 of the act—that empowers the ACMA to impose direct regulation by way of program standards code, where codes of practice have failed, aims to balance the costs and benefits of the community's regulatory needs with the profit based nature of commercial service providers. 


Labor's approach is transitional and targeted and therefore responds to public concern while acknowledging the pressures the broadcasting sector is under. Labor wants to work towards a genuine solution. That is why we are calling on the government and on industry to step up and progress these important consumer safeguards and address this significant issue of community concern. 


I move the second reading amendment on sheet 8048 standing in my name: 


At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate calls on the Government to work with the broadcasting industry and national sporting organisations on a transition plan to phase out the promotion of betting odds and commercials relating to betting or gambling before and during live sporting broadcasts, with a view to their prohibition"".


I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for time in the chamber to address this important community concern. I hope the government will be able to work to advance a response to those genuine concerns that are held by parents and sporting heroes alike.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2017-03-20,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (17:36):  I rise to speak on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. The bill contains proposed amendments to the Interactive Gambling Act, the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act and the regulations made under the Interactive Gambling Act. The bill contains a number of proposed amendments which seek to clarify legislation regarding illegal offshore gambling and seeks to strengthen the enforcement provisions under the Interactive Gambling Act.


The Interactive Gambling Act was introduced by the government following the findings of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technology's report into online gambling and the Productivity Commission report of 1999 into gambling industries and in response to concerns about the effects that online gambling has on Australians. The Productivity Commission report of 1999 found that problem gamblers comprise 15 per cent of regular, non-lottery gamblers and account for about $3.5 billion in expenditure annually. That is about one-third of the gambling industry's total market. They lose on average $12,000 per year, compared with just under $650 for other gamblers. That prevalence of problem gambling is related to the degree of accessibility of problem gambling.


Since the legislation was enacted, it has done little to prevent the spread of online gambling. The legislation is now 16 years old and has been outdated and outpaced by the rapid increase in online gambling and aggressive practices of the online gambling providers to entice customers. The proposed bill seeks to clarify that it is illegal for overseas gambling companies to offer gambling products to Australians unless they hold a licence issued by a state or territory. It will introduce a new civil penalty infringement notice regime to be administered by ACMA. The bill will also prohibit click-to-call in-play betting services by tightening the definition of a 'telephone betting service', with the effect that it will no longer be possible for a customer to place a bet during a sporting event without ever speaking to an operator. Instead, the bill would require dealings with customers to be entirely by way of spoken conversations between the customer and an operator.


The bill amends the complaint-handling process by providing that ACMA is responsible for all stages of the complaint-handling process, with the removal of current mandatory requirements for ACMA to refer matters to the AFP. It will also enable the minister to determine by way of legislative instrument for the purposes of the act whether a specific thing is or is not a sporting event. The bill will require ACMA to maintain a register of eligible, regulated interactive gambling services in an effort to raise awareness amongst customers about which services to avoid because of their exclusion from that register. It will introduce measures relating to illegal offshore gambling activity. These would allow ACMA to disclose information obtained through its powers under the IGA to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and to foreign regulators. The bill will enable ACMA to notify the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of information relating to names of directors or principals of offending gambling services so that their names are placed on the movement alert list.


Finally, the bill will remove the requirement for a report on contraventions of part 7A of the act to be prepared and tabled in parliament each calendar year. The explanatory memorandum advises that this information will now be included in ACMA's annual report, which will be tabled in parliament. However, the amendments proposed in the bill represent only the first stage of the government's process to implement the recommendations of the 2015 Review of Illegal Offshore Wagering, led by the Hon. Barry O'Farrell.


The Nick Xenophon Team supports the bill. I want to make that clear. However, we remain concerned that the bill does not go far enough to keep pace with the explosion of online gambling and, in particular, online sports betting. Online gambling has grown to the point that the industry now outpaces other forms of gambling. People bet online using smartphones, tablets and other digital devices. Online gambling at the touch of a button anytime, anywhere poses risks to those battling gambling addictions and those who are vulnerable to developing gambling addiction. In 2014 $2.4 billion dollars was spent on online gambling by Australians. This is double the amount of 10 years earlier. The 2015 O'Farrell review found that the number of active online wagering accounts in Australia grew from 200,000 in 2010 to 800,000 in 2014.


The minister has foreshadowed there will be further bills which will seek to put in place some protection for gamblers. The government announced in April 2016 that it would implement 18 of the 19 recommendations in the 2015 O'Farrell review in a three-stage process. Whilst this news is welcome to the Nick Xenophon Team, we believe the government has missed an opportunity to debate a more comprehensive and more effective bill now. This is why my colleague Senator Xenophon will be moving amendments that incorporate many aspects of his private senator's bill, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Sports Betting Reform) Bill 2015.


These amendments tackle many issues not addressed in the government's bill, including prohibitions on microbetting, prohibitions on offering credit and banning the broadcasting of sports betting ads during sports games and G-rated programs when children are watching. Importantly, these amendments also establish a National Self-Exclusion Register, which was recommended in the O'Farrell Review, as well as the establishment of an interactive gambling regulator.


The Nick Xenophon Team's position on gambling reform and curtailing predatory gambling is well known. We continue to push for reform in this area. I have seen firsthand the devastation that gambling addiction causes families though my work in Senator Xenophon's office and now in my own. Over many years I dealt with countless desperate constituents whose families have suffered emotionally and financially because of gambling addictions. It was the families' stories that propelled me to stand for the Senate as part of the Nick Xenophon Team.


In my first speech I spoke about the call that provided me with the impetus to drive change through policy as a senator. I had taken a call from a woman whose husband was addicted to online sports betting. She had just discovered they had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and in the coming weeks they would also lose their home. She was desperate and she did not know where else to go for help. I stayed on the phone with her while she cried. I would meet her and her husband in person soon after, and with Nick we worked to do what we could to help them try to rebuild their lives. This call was one of many I answered about the devastating effects of online gambling.


The impact of gambling addiction is far reaching. It has devastating effects responsible for the loss of livelihoods, family homes and inheritances and for the destruction of families. Some gambling addictions are so fierce and the consequences so great that for some the burden is too heavy and results in the tragic loss of life. The Nick Xenophon Team's resolve on tackling predatory gambling is unwavering. We are committed to Australian communities. As long as gambling companies continue to prey on Australians, we will continue to push for much-needed sensible gambling reform.


There is no doubt that the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 is a step in the right direction, and I commend the government for these measures. For too long the Interactive Gambling Act has been weak when it came to dealing with overseas online gambling organisations providing services within Australia. These organisations operated freely within our borders and caused immeasurable harm to Australian citizens. However, I remain concerned as to how the government will be able to enforce penalties against these companies, who may continue to disregard the measures in this bill and which operate in overseas jurisdictions.


The Nick Xenophon Team wants to see a requirement on internet service providers to block access to websites operated by those who continue to operate within Australian borders without permission to do so. During the committee stage of this debate, Senator Xenophon will be moving such an amendment to prevent access to illegal offshore operators. We believe this bill must go further to protect vulnerable Australian families from predatory gambling organisations. Senator Xenophon and I will be moving amendments to do just that. 


Specifically, I will move an amendment during the committee stage that restricts the government's proposed meaning of 'electronic equipment'. The Nick Xenophon Team is very concerned about the loophole in the legislation that, if allowed to remain as currently drafted, would allow in-play betting from venue-provided smart devices in retail place betting venues, pubs and clubs. Section 8BA of the proposed bill provides for venues to loan customers electronic equipment for gambling use. The Nick Xenophon Team is deeply concerned that this bill appears to allow for place-based electronic betting through the introduction or expansion of electronic devices such as tablets and smartphones which provide for in-play betting, and circumvent the need to deal with a person or use a fixed betting terminal.


The definition of 'electronic equipment' referred to in the bill includes 'an electronic apparatus' or 'electronic device'. The bill's explanatory memorandum provides no guidance or explanation as to what these terms mean. This definition currently includes venue kiosks but is not restricted to such services. During the Senate inquiry into the bill, submitters raised concerns that these terms allow for the expansion of the use of electronic devices, including tablets and smartphones with an in-play betting function, within licensed betting venues.


In response to our question on notice regarding concerns about continued availability of in-play betting, the department responded:


The 'place-based betting service' exemption in proposed Section 8BA is intended to permit betting services, including potentially in-play betting services, to be provided on electronic equipment (which may include easy betting terminals and/or tablets) made available to customers in places such as TABs, casinos and clubs.


The department admitted, when I questioned them, that they had not done any modelling on whether this provision would lead to an uptake in betting services in venues due to increased availability of these electronic devices. The Nick Xenophon Team is concerned that this provision will expand the opportunities for in-play betting without addressing any of the concerns highlighted in the inquiry that this may increase opportunities for gambling and create faster, more instantaneous betting options. 


If the government's aim is to reduce in-play betting, I fail to see how this bill helps. In-play betting is only supposed to be performed in person or over the phone. These measures will allow gambling operators to potentially expand their operations within licensed venues. This loophole goes against the intention of this bill.


I will be moving an amendment that narrows the definition and makes it clear that 'electronic equipment' will instead be defined as an 'electronic betting terminal' which is installed on a permanent or fixed basis at a place where gambling services are provided under supervision. It will be unable to connect to the internet and will be available for use only by customers using cash or a card issued by the provider. This definition will limit in-play betting to electronic betting terminals to ensure that gambling operators do not seek to expand their operations by allowing people to place in-play bets using tablets or smartphones provided by the venue at the bar. These terminals are permanent installations located in a specific area set aside for gambling and are unable to connect to the internet. This is the sort of protective measure we need.


In my opinion, the bill as it is currently drafted will increase the opportunities for in-play betting without addressing the very serious concern that this could increase opportunities for gambling. In-play betting is especially dangerous, as it gives a person an immediate opportunity to win their money back, which also heightens the potential for bigger losses. These are spur-of-the-moment decisions people make when they are swayed by emotions and possibly under the influence of alcohol.


If the government are going to introduce legislation on gambling reform, they must also consider the issue of harm minimisation. I fear that the current harm minimisation tactics used within bars and gambling venues are inadequate. During the Senate inquiry into this bill, I questioned the department as to whether they thought the current harm minimisation strategies were working. Their response was that harm minimisation was a matter for the states. But harm minimisation and problem gambling affects all Australians, and I want to see the federal government take more responsibility for this area and work more closely with the states to improve harm minimisation.


Given that this bill will see an increase in betting devices within licensed venues, it cannot be argued that the expansion of the gambling market would not result in harm. The Nick Xenophon Team will continue to hold the government to account and keep the pressure on to ensure that harm minimisation strategies are considered and implemented as we continue the fight against predatory gambling. Thank you.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-03-20,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (17:50):  I rise to speak on this issue which, no doubt, is of increasing community concern around Australia. Gambling is an industry that is growing rapidly in this country. We have seen growth in the number of local companies that are involved. We have seen international outfits come onto the scene that are active in this area. A number of speakers have talked about the offshore gambling companies as well, which is obviously a concern for legislators. With the offshore companies, it is very hard to track how much money local Australians are gambling through those companies, and then there are the associated parts of that in terms of how much tax those companies are paying if they are taking the money offshore. There is also the issue, for those offshore companies, of harm minimisation. Obviously, any regulation that we bring in from an Australian point of view does not apply to those offshore companies. That is a concern from a level playing field point of view.


In terms of the legislation that is before us, it goes some way towards tightening the restrictions around these organisations. Obviously, with the proliferation of these companies we have also seen an increase in promotion and advertising from betting companies. I think that what has come with that is increasing community concern around that advertising. I know that Senator O'Neill has foreshadowed that Labor will be moving an amendment, and that amendment says:


The Senate calls on the government to work with the broadcasting industry and national sporting organisations on a transition plan to phase out the promotion of betting odds and commercials relating to betting or gambling before and during live sporting broadcasts, with a view to their prohibition.


I think that is something that would be welcomed by the community.


I am sure many people across Australia feel this when they sit down to watch their favourite team play or their favourite sport on TV, particularly with young children. You get concerned about the focus on live gambling and the ability or the encouragement or giving people the option to gamble on sporting matches. I know myself, as someone who has been a long-term season ticket holder of the Broncos, that, when I first started going to games as a season ticket holder, which would be about 10 years ago now, you did not see or were not encouraged to partake in gambling. But now and increasingly you see the sponsors on the jerseys and you see the sponsors on the ground, and indeed the opportunity to gamble within the sporting stadium is increasingly being promoted. When you see the mix of people who attend those football matches and understand the mix that would be watching at home on TV as well, you understand that traditionally, from an Australian point of view, partaking of or viewing sporting activities has increasingly been a family affair, so I think that, when we look at the potential damage that gambling can cause, we always need to look at it from that point of view.


The other thing I have noticed—and through the committee process I have had the opportunity to ask questions of the companies involved in these outfits—is that increasingly people who gamble are doing it through the apps on their phone or online. A good example of that was on Boxing Day. I went to my local club with some friends to watch the Boxing Day test. We were sitting at the TAB inside the RSL club, and there were a lot of people gambling, but not many people were getting up and using the terminal at the club. Increasingly, people are using their phone to gamble and not using the machines.


When it comes to looking at harm minimisation and what that means, if I am sitting there at a club and just gambling on my phone, there is no way that anyone inside that club is actually going to know what I am doing. Obviously, you could have a number of mobile phone apps on your phone and use any one of those to gamble. I think that, when you look at the proliferation of the companies involved and the fact that you can open an account with any of them, we need to constantly look at ensuring that we have the best practice possible to ensure that the harm minimisation policies are effective in this regard.


When we had the opportunity to question some of the companies recently, they attempted to put the argument that the focus for that effort should go on the financial institutions, so they are the ones who should bear the responsibility for identifying problem gamblers and be the ones to report that or potentially put a freeze on that person's account. I do not think it is good enough on the part of the companies to effectively pass the buck to the financial institutions. There obviously needs to be a lot more pressure put on those companies as this issue continues to develop and the community and therefore governments and parliaments have to respond to that challenge.


In terms of the proposed Labor amendment, I think it is appropriate for us to signal that this is something that we would pursue in government as well. We are really sending a message to the industry—and that is the broader industry, those gambling companies but also those people who benefit in a financial sense from the advertising—so that they know that Labor are determined to act in this regard, and we will continue to pursue that both in opposition and potentially in government as well.


Just further to my point about the offshore operators, who obviously do not currently pay tax in Australia: in the 2015 review of the impact of illegal offshore wagering, stakeholders highlighted that the current mechanisms for enforcement within the existing framework were insufficient and that they were no longer competing on a level playing field. Again, through the committee process, this has been raised by a number of the companies. Despite the large number of complaints that have been raised since the Interactive Gambling Act was established in 2001, there have not been any prosecutions, so I think that, with any changes to the Interactive Gambling Act, we need to look at the enforcement as well to ensure that we are doing our utmost to hold those companies to account.


But at the heart of this bill is the creation of a legal framework that is suitable for the industry and, importantly, empowers the Australian Communications and Media Authority with enforcement powers and the relevant authority under the act by ensuring that the Australian Communications and Media Authority becomes an efficient regulator with powers to issue informal warnings, infringement notices, civil penalties and injunctions. That aspect of the bill is certainly welcomed by Labor and, I think, as we have seen through the evidence process in the committees, is much needed. In particular, I welcome the creation of an offence and a civil penalty for a person who provides a regulated interactive gambling service to a person in Australia who does not possess a relevant licence from the state or territory government. This is inherently simple in its intent. There is now a clear framework for ACMA to investigate and take action against unlicensed services.


Another tool for ACMA's enforcement is the use of a civil penalty regime to encourage and support improved compliance with the Interactive Gambling Act. This will ensure that ACMA will be able to properly investigate and respond to breaches of the new regulatory regime. Frequently, under the current framework, that was unable to occur, due to other agencies not regarding these breaches as a priority and acting on them. This includes provisions for ACMA to refer complaints to the Australian Federal Police if they believe it is warranted. We also welcome the amendments to notify international regulators about their licensees who have been found to have broken provisions of the IGA. Previously, the offshore locations of a number of companies has made it very difficult to enforce current provisions of the Interactive Gambling Act. However, providing ACMA with relevant powers to help build those relationships with foreign regulators is a good start and no doubt will provide a framework for ACMA to enforce these new provisions. Certainly, from the evidence that we had from the department they are determined to work with international bodies to ensure that they make progress in this respect to ensure that there is more stringent accountability on an international level to those offshore gambling companies from an Australian point of view.


In terms of the proliferation of gambling, it is something that is of concern to me. It is something I intend to continue to keep a close eye on. I have enjoyed the role I have played in the committee in the short time I have been on it. I think that it is obviously something that is a constant feature of parliament, whether it be looking at pokies or looking at interactive gambling. I think it is something that is moving very fast, particularly with the availability online these days and moving into an international phase. Therefore, it is something that governments will continue to deal with. I am pleased to support the Interactive Gambling Act and I am pleased to advocate for the amendment that Senator O'Neill moved. It is an issue that I will continue to deal with as a senator.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,2,speech
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-03-20,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:01):  I rise to speak on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. This is a small step toward the goal of getting rid of the corrosive, corrupting influence of gambling in sport—a very small step. It clarifies the fact that wagering websites, services and products are illegal. It goes on to put some restrictions around in-play betting. It also strengthens the power of ACMA.


So it does some positive things, but there is also a huge catch. The government has decided through this legislation to include a special carve out for its big gambling mates who donate so handsomely to both of the major parties during election campaigns. The special exemption they have created would effectively allow online in-play sports betting from a tablet on the counter of every pub and club in Australia. Live in-play betting is hugely problematic. It is also known as in-the-run betting. It is an activity that makes gambling much more seductive. It is more likely for people involved in watching a game of footy to continue to bet, to double up, to chase their losses and ultimately to lose more than they would have otherwise lost. Because of this exemption there is going to be a massive expansion of in-play betting at a moment when the government is rightly saying, at least quietly, that we should be outlawing similar services provided online.


Why restrict in-play betting to services provided online and at the same time give this exemption that allows basically every pub and club in Australia to continue to do it? One has to ask oneself: why has the government decided to go down that path? The Tatts Group, whose subsidiary UBET is going to exploit this loophole, donated $139,000 to the two old parties, Labor and Liberal, in the last three years. So one has to ask oneself whether this is a loophole created by the government for its big gambling mates. We know, whether or not that is true, the perception that that might be true should be enough to give the government pause for thought. What we have is a problem with policy in this country being made on the back of big donations that come from big money interests. We Greens are going to be supporting amendments that close this outrageous little sweetheart deal for the Tatts Group and the big gambling mates of the old parties.


Despite the loophole, on balance I think the bill does deserve support. It does implement recommendations 18 and 19 of last year's O'Farrell Review of Illegal Offshore Wagering. The former New South Wales Premier's report made it crystal clear that online games and wagering are the fastest growing segments of the global gambling market. They are exploding in terms of market share. Products are being marketed largely to young men. They are causing a range of harms. We know and speak a lot about the harms associated with poker machines. We know and speak a lot about the harms associated with poker machines, and we are now learning in more detail about the harms that excessive gambling online causes to individuals, families and communities. Often these are young men who are isolated or living in regional communities, and they are losing big.


The Interactive Gambling Act is the main source of prohibition regulation that will attach to online gambling. We do acknowledge that it is a very difficult regulatory environment. This is a tough environment because you have a lot of this activity being conducted offshore. Whilst this act makes it illegal to offer online gambling products from offshore locations, we know that that prohibition is very difficult to enforce, so we are doing a balancing act between the prohibition and being able to enforce it. It is in everyone's interest to bring those offshore operators here onshore and to make sure that they are captured by the Australian regulatory environment. That is the balancing act.


Of course, the gambling lobby has a very powerful argument against what it calls over-regulation. It says the regulations are too restrictive and there is no incentive for operators to come here onshore. Surprise, surprise: big business does not like regulation that might restrict its profits. Ultimately, this is about finding the best way to reduce the huge harm that these predatory pushers of online gambling products do cause our communities. We just do not have the balance right at the moment. We have not got the balance right. You just need to sit down and watch a major sporting event with young kids to see what it is like. Every time you sit down with a kid to watch the footy, the cricket or the tennis, they are being bombard with odds, websites and famous faces pushing online gambling down their throats. The marketing of these products, as Senator Chisholm said previously, is relentless. It is having a significant impact on young kids and creating the problem gamblers of tomorrow. 


When I sat down with my kids to watch the cricket over the summer, as I occasionally do, I was dumbstruck by one freeze frame. There was a fielder sliding along the grass towards the boundary rope. The rope was clad with the URL of a major online gambling website. The fence behind the rope also displayed the same website. And then running across the bottom of the screen was a paid banner ad for—yes, you guess it—the same online gambling website. It has become absolutely relentless. This stuff is everywhere. You cannot escape it. There is an irony here when you see some young sportsman having to confess to having gambled illegally and consider that they are bathed in it. They are surrounded by it. They are wearing this stuff on their jumpers. The sponsors are everywhere. The ground is covered in it. TV is shoving this stuff down people's throats. Is it any wonder that some people make bad decisions? It is damaging the brand and integrity of many of the sporting codes that we love. It is so insidious now. Just listen to young kids talk about their favourite sporting code. They might talk about a game of AFL footy. In the old days they would be swapping footy cards. Now it is a discussion about what are the odds of Cyril Rioli kicking the next goal, or of David Warner making a tonne in the cricket. Their experience of the game is no longer an experience shaped around the game itself; it is an experience where gambling is enmeshed in the sport. For young people, the line between gambling and sport is not a clear one. They have become one and the same. These are very clever marketing tactics by the gambling industry. I am really concerned about what this will do to those young children in the future. Are we creating another generation of problem gamblers? 


So, of course we welcome any effort to try to curb the pernicious influence of online betting and gambling, but that does not mean the activity should be illegal. People should be able to gamble if they want to, but we need some restrictions around what is appropriate, and we absolutely need to ensure that there are restrictions around the way this stuff is marketed and promoted. It is why we are going to vote in favour of some of the amendments on the table that will close the loophole which I talked about earlier. I would like to think that we could also vote to support a bill like my Broadcasting Services Amendment (Advertising for Sports Betting) Bill 2013. What that bill would do is ban radio and TV licence holders from broadcasting any ads or information about sports betting or odds. If people want to gamble that is their right, but just don't shove it down our throats. Let a young child watch a sporting broadcast, without having to be bombarded with betting advertising. I do hope that there will be an appetite to return to that bill at some stage in the near future. 


I do, however, know that we will be facing an uphill battle if we are to get some restriction on sports advertising. The influence of the gambling lobby on the old parties, as I said, does not just extend to donations. There is now a revolving door between the gambling industry and political office. I want to say a few words here about the role that the Labor Party has played in ensuring that the gambling industry has the contacts and the networks it needs to be able to scuttle any legislation when it comes to restrictions on gambling. Senator Conroy could not wait to leave the Senate to join Responsible Wagering Australia. You would think that that was an organisation whose focus was on ensuring that people wager responsibly—no, how wrong you are. That Orwellian sounding title is the name of an organisation that represents the big gambling industry. It is not just Senator Conroy; it seems to be that the Right of the Labor Party has this revolving door between itself and the gambling industry. We saw this with former Senator Mark Arbib. He could not wait to leave the Senate so that he could become part of the Packer gambling empire. Indeed, the former National Secretary of the Labor Party Karl Bitar is another graduate of the Labor Right moving into the gambling industry. They are hired guns who are used by the industry because they have the contacts and networks necessary to be able to scuttle reform. They are working for an industry that preys on some of the most vulnerable people in the country. No wonder people have had a gutful of politics. When they see people in senior positions leave this place and, within the blink of an eye, stand up and start spruiking for an industry that they once had responsibility for regulating, it does more than just raise a few eyebrows. It means that people whose faith in their democratic institutions is already at an all-time low say, 'What is the point?' The time is long overdue for us to put a code of conduct in place that prevents that activity from taking place into the future. 


Let me go to some of the detail of what this bill does. As I said earlier, it clarifies that offshore wagering websites, services and products are made illegal. It clarifies that Australian operators can no longer operate click-to-call services like the ones they currently operate, which allow betters to place in-play bets over their mobile phones and tablets, without even needing to speak to an operator. These are important developments. It also strengthens the power of the Australian Communications and Media Authority and creates a civil penalty regime which targets, in particular, operators of offshore wagering websites and services. However, the government has failed in this bill to commit to one of the essential recommendations of the O'Farrell report, and that is that, until a national framework is established and operating, consideration of additional in-play betting products should be deferred and legislative steps taken to respect the original intent of the Interactive Gambling Act. In this bill the government have ignored that recommendation. Instead of considering additional in-play betting products only at the point at which legislative steps have been taken, they have decided to carve out in-play betting for what are euphemistically called 'place-based betting services', defined in clause 8B(a) as involving electronic equipment.


In other words, what the bill does is exempts the practice already engaged in by some clubs and pubs of offering tethered online electronic betting terminals. So you can do in-play betting—when the whole point of this is to restrict it—providing that you are in a pub or club and you are using one of their tethered online electronic betting terminals.


What this exemption would do is dramatically expand the scope of in-play betting. That is in direct contradiction to the O'Farrell recommendation. I will get to it in a moment, as to how that would happen. The Uniting Church, Responsible Wagering Australia and other Australian providers agree that this is a sweetheart deal which hands over, to operators like the Tatts Group, access to physical premises like pubs and clubs.


As I said earlier, former senator Stephen Conroy has become a spruiker for the gambling industry. Not even his factional clout and political connections could compete with the hundreds of thousands of dollars that are flowing into the ALP coffers from the gambling industry. On this occasion, it seemed that they were at odds—and I use that pun intentionally.


Experts warn that this sweetheart exemption could lead to pubs and clubs offering in-play sports betting via tethered tablets, which are more attractive than the large cumbersome machines that are in use.


Let us look at what Tatts Group's UBET said recently. They intend to offer a digital in-play sports betting solution that will allow punters to bet through a customised app on a tablet service. In other words, they are getting ready for in-play betting to occur through their tablets, and they are hoping that one day they will have a monopoly on in-play betting, through their customised app on their tablet devices.


There are some amendments to this legislation which would help close this little sweetheart loophole, and I am talking specifically about Senator Xenophon's amendments. We the Greens will be supporting those amendments. The amendments will tighten up the definition of 'placed-based betting service' to more accurately reflect the reality of current practice and prevent the expansion of in-play sports betting that I have just described. For those reasons, we will support them. They would also strengthen the principal act by introducing an interactive gambling regulator and a national self-exclusion register. We also support those amendments. The amendments would also strengthen the act by banning wagering services from offering credit, or microbetting; by allowing gamblers to set personal betting limits; and by strengthening regulatory powers. We support that amendment too.


There is one aspect of the circulated amendments that we do not support. That is the provision that would require the minister to regulate to require internet service providers to block access to illegal overseas gambling websites. We do not think that is an effective solution, and so we will not support that specific amendment.


I conclude by saying this bill does go some small way in the direction that we need to go, and it is just insane that this glaring loophole has been left open for a particular segment of the industry. If we do not address this issue, we are looking at creating another generation of problem gamblers. This is an industry that has shown itself as wanting to prey on some of the most vulnerable people in our community, and it is governments that have been complicit with the industry every step of the way. Regulation of the industry is absolutely critical, not just in terms of in-play betting but also in terms of the promotion, advertising and sponsorship of gambling products. If we do not deal with this issue now, we risk repeating the mistakes that we made when it comes to poker machines. We risk making the same mistakes within the online betting environment, and that is a cost that is far too high for our society to bear.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-03-20,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:20):  I oppose the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. It is paternalistic, nanny-state legislation based on the assumption that prohibition is an effective regulatory response to something of which the government disapproves. The intention of the bill it to make it impossible for Australians to bet on sporting matches while they are in play. There is already legislation that seeks to make this illegal, but it has some loopholes. This bill seeks to remove those loopholes.


Why does the government want to ban in-play gambling? Why should some forms of gambling be legal, even encouraged, while another form is prohibited? The justification we are given is that in-play gambling leads to match-fixing. There have been examples of that in the past. So there is an assumption that the only way to prevent such match-fixing is to ban in-play gambling. I am not discounting the fact that match-fixing or spot-fixing might sometimes be a problem. In recent years, we have seen examples of this in some sports, such as cricket and tennis, but this legislation is no solution. Banning live betting on the internet in this country will have no more impact on match-fixing than banning the production of pornography in Australia would have on the availability of porn. The internet just does not work that way. The only winners will be unregulated, untrustworthy offshore operations, and punters will have no protection if they get ripped off. And when those unregulated, untrustworthy offshore operations play host to punters engaged in match fixing or spot fixing, nobody in Australia will be able to follow the money trail. It will all be invisible.


The United Kingdom has taken a better approach. The UK's Gambling Commission is authorised to manage gambling licences and to monitor betting to ensure everything is run in a safe and efficient manner. They understand that banning betting will not stop dodgy practices. Instead, they concentrate on monitoring the integrity of sports betting and looking after the interests of punters. They can look for signs of match fixing, act on tip-offs and follow the money trail. If they find evidence of match fixing they can deal with the individuals at fault, including cancelling licences and launching prosecutions, while leaving all the innocent punters alone. So instead of collectively treating gamblers like naughty schoolchildren, they treat them individually as adults whose pastimes are a legitimate form of entertainment and whose interests are worth protecting. What a novel attitude.


Australia loves to ban things. This ban on live betting adds to the nanny state nonsense and it will not stop match fixing. It could also turn hundreds of Australians who have been betting online without harming anyone else into our latest class of criminals.


Also caught up in this bad legislation are hundreds of Australians who enjoy a flutter on online poker. Online poker is not a spectator sport. Nobody tries to fix a cricket match as part of an online poker game. There is no public interest in banning it as part of interactive gambling laws. I have an amendment to exempt online poker and blackjack from the bill. It is insane that they were ever caught up in it. But ultimately, I don't want the bill to pass. I believe individuals have a right to make decisions for themselves, no matter whether we would make the same decisions ourselves.


Finally, if the legislation passes, I would like to take this opportunity to give some advice to online poker players. Notwithstanding the risk of offshore hosts, screw the government: get yourself a VPN and an offshore account and carry on as you were. And I wish all of you the best of luck.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-03-20,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:25):  I support this bill, the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016, but I believe it ought to go much further because the issue of online gambling has become increasingly prevalent in Australia. It is impacting on many more people. We have seen an exponential increase in online gambling, in particular in sports betting. As my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore indicated, the 2015 O'Farrell review found that the number of active online wagering accounts grew from 200,000 to 800,000 between 2010 and 2014—that is for legal online accounts for legal sports betting agencies. That indicates to me that that there is a significant issue, and the bigger the boom in online gambling the bigger the bust for individuals who are caught up in it and who suffer from gambling addiction.


This bill will go some small way in dealing with the issues—it acknowledges the impact of in-play betting—as imperfect as it is, but there needs to be consideration of why this bill needs to go further. It needs to go further because it is not a case in Australia of enough is enough; it is a case of enough is much. We in this nation lose more in gambling per capita than any other nation in the world. It is a significant social problem, and it is being made worse by the biggest growth area—that is, sports betting.


In 2015, I was part of the launch of Financial Counselling Australia's report Duds, mugs and the A-list. That report looked at the impact of sports betting, particularly on young men around the country. It was published by an organisation that knows better than most what it means to be affected by gambling addiction, because Financial Counselling Australia represents financial counsellors who assist consumers in financial difficulty. They see, on the front line, at the coal face, the impact of gambling addiction. They have been seeing more and more people in recent years in relation to the effects of sports betting, and in-play betting was a significant driver in gambling addiction. In-play betting had a significant impact on young men chasing their losses, because they could gamble in play. It is a more addictive form of gambling. It is more pernicious and leads to greater problems.


That is why we need to support this bill, but I believe the way that this bill has been drafted by the government allows for a number of loopholes to allow some organisations to circumvent that. Reference was made by Senator Di Natale in respect of that. We must oppose that circumvention by strengthening the bill.


Financial Counselling Australia in its landmark report Duds, mugs and the A-list: the impact of uncontrolled sports betting said that urgent action is needed:


Betting on the pokies is relatively small fry in comparison – you can’t put $250,000 into slot machines in one sitting, but you can do that with sports betting with the click of a mouse. If this is the future of gambling, it is indeed frightening. Urgent action is needed.


As bad as things are with poker machines they can get much, much worse with online gambling. This is the new frontier for gambling expansion. We are already the worst in the world for per-capita gambling losses and, dare I say, gambling addiction per capita. This bill at least opens up the debate in relation to these issues.


I will address shortly, perhaps after the dinner break, a number of the measures in the bill. The bill needs to go further, but it is important that it be put into context about the seriousness of the problem we now fact in relation to this.



Sitting suspended from 
18:30 to 19:30





Senator XENOPHON:
  The issue of online gambling is one of critical importance. More and more Australians are falling prey to gambling addiction because of online gambling and because of sports betting. There is nothing like the pernicious advertising of sports betting; it is in your face at sporting games and during sporting broadcasts. That is why it is important that we also reform the issue of online gambling advertising for sports betting advertising. It does seem incongruous, it does seem like a loophole and it does seem unacceptable that there is one exemption to the situation where, in the ordinary course of events, the current ACMA rules say you cannot have gambling advertising during a G-rated time. There is one exemption to that and that exemption relates to sports broadcasts. 


If you are broadcasting a game, you can advertise gambling products during that game. I would have thought that is the one particular event watched by families and watched by young children that ought to be the subject of a ban not an exemption of a ban during G-rated times. It is very disturbing that eight-, 10- and 12-year-olds—according to the many parents I speak to with young children—tell their parents about the odds of a game. It is very concerning that gambling behaviour is normalised amongst children in that way. I do not want the kids of today to become the gambling addicts of tomorrow. This bill at least opens up a debate and at least tries to restrict the issue of in-play betting. As imperfect as this bill is, at least it means that we are actually beginning to grapple with this problem.


This is an issue that goes back many years. Back in 2001 I was a member of the Parliament of South Australian and I was here lobbying members of this chamber to have the interactive gambling bill passed by the Senate. It was touch and go. I remember seeing: the late Senator Brian Harradine; the One Nation senator, Senator Len Harris; the then communications minister, Senator Richard Alston; and the many others that I spoke to in the course of the week that I was in Canberra. I was doing my bit, along with supporting the Reverend Tim Costello, to ensure that the bill was passed. It was certainly an improvement on what we had before, which was not much at all. 


But, whilst that bill was passed 16 years ago, it may as well have been passed 160 years ago, because so much has happened in the online gambling space since that time. This bill, at least, is an update of sorts, but I think it is interesting to reflect that back in December 2011 the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform during the period of the Gillard government prepared its second report on interactive and online gambling and gambling advertising. Back then, it was clear that overseas gambling websites were a real problem that needed to be addressed. 


I referred in my additional comments to that report to one particular case of a constituent that had serious problems with Casino.com, a site hosted in Singapore but licensed in Gibraltar. It has an Australian flag in the background and lists of Australian winners and it takes bets in Australian currency. This individual, and of course I will do nothing to identify him—my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore worked on this particular case, advocating for him as a constituent—initially appeared to win thousands of dollars. He tried to withdraw it, but he could not withdraw it. He got free credit, $250, on condition that he play certain games, which he did not wish to play. Within about two months, he was up $90,000. He seemed to win the money very easily with the casino games he was playing, but then he started to lose. At one point he lost $50,000 in a day. He was given free gifts: an iPod; a laptop; an iPhone 4, back then; a free trip to anywhere in the world plus $5,000 spending money. He was a VIP customer. The website then made $90,000 of unauthorised transactions from his credit cards. He made official complaints to three banks which have now reversed the transaction, but his total still stood at $120,000. 


This case illustrates that the potential for harm with overseas sites is great, and the regulatory framework in some of these countries is grossly inadequate. Try writing to the regulator in Gibraltar, and good luck to you. I have, and you are lucky to get a response in any form of timeliness. I think that it indicates that we ought to be able to tackle these overseas sites. That is why I will be moving an amendment in relation to that.


We have heard from a Canadian based company called Netsweeper, which says that you can block these sites. You can take action in respect of these sites. They say there is a way to do so. I will refer to that in the context of this amendment when I move it, but there are arguments that should be counted. There is an argument that an offshore, unlicensed, online gambling company can simply change their domain, the URL, to avoid blocking from Australia, and so accept Australian customers. 


Netsweeper is one of many on the market that are dealing with these issues The Netsweeper policy server and technology crawls through the internet daily for online gambling keywords. If an unlicensed company attempts to change its URL to avoid blocking, then Netsweeper will simply crawl, locate and categorise the new URL and therefore block it. The argument given is one that I think Senator Leyonhjelm referred to when he actually advised people what to do, to use a VPN to avoid website blocking. What Netsweeper, and I believe others, would say is that the KYC documentation of online gambling firms states that any customer who attempts to make a deposit with an Australian credit card, e-wallet or bank wire service must be registered with an Australian IP address or the deposit will be voided. Furthermore, if a customer attempts to withdraw funds, then a copy of the player's passport and a utility bill must be provided. If this documentation does not correspond with the Australian IP, then the customer's account will be suspended and the funds will not be dispersed. The online gambling industry has numerous security measures in place to avoid fraud and bonus abuse, often focusing on ensuring country identity. So you can deal with that argument.


The other argument is that blocking gambling websites will inadvertently also block gambling websites that may be properly licensed in Australia or that may have no relationship to gambling at all. The websites of all gambling companies that are properly licenced in Australia would be added to a whitelist of allowed sites with a deployed Netsweeper filtering system—or, indeed, other filtering systems—and using artificial intelligence engines to ensure that non-gambling websites are not blocked, with a final human review element used if required. So we can attempt to do this. When you consider the level of harm caused by online gambling, particularly from these unlawful sites, it is worth giving it a go.


During the joint select committee inquiry back in 2011, evidence was given by the Australian Bankers Association. I remember asking questions of then CEO Steven Munchenberg, the outgoing head of the ABA, who essentially said, 'Yes, we can cooperate in relation to this in terms of the big banks to block those sites.' They were already blocking other sites for various purposes, such as terrorist related purposes. It can be done if there is political will to do so. Considering that hundreds of millions of dollars are being lost to these unlawful sites, that is something we should attempt to do with alacrity. We need to tackle that.


It is also worth referring to the issue of domestic online sports betting websites. Back in 2011 the University of Sydney Gambling Treatment Clinic—the GTC—gave evidence saying that only five per cent of their clients in the 2006-07 financial year were reporting problem gamblers with sports betting. Problem gamblers with sports betting represented 15 per cent to 20 per cent in 2010-11. That was five years ago. I suggest that figure is now much higher. There has been an exponential increase in the growth of sports betting. There are now greater opportunities to gamble—every mobile phone can be turned into a betting terminal—and there is now the ability to cause much more harm, much more quickly. That is why this bill is welcomed, but it needs to go much further.


It is also worth reflecting on the research of Associate Professor Samantha Thomas and Dr Charles Livingstone, who have done terrific work in relation to online betting. Associate Professor Thomas did work on this a number of years ago. She found that young men in particular felt ostracised and felt isolated from their peer group if they did not gamble, such was the pressure to be part of a gambling culture. That is something that is very concerning and it is something that can drive levels of gambling addiction. Associate Professor Thomas has also done work on the number of young children who can recognise a sports betting operator, and the figures are staggering. Something like half of the young children she spoke to could recognise at least one sports betting agency—or an even greater amount. I do not have the figures in front of me, but it is a very significant number of young people who recognise it. We are talking about children.


Associate Professor Thomas has also made the point that schemes like Mad Bookie offer sponsorship to community sports clubs, which I think is quite pernicious. They offer clubs cashback if members sign up and bet on their website, and clubs are promised a 25 per cent cash rebate from members' losses each month. That raises very serious ethical issues—that is, to draw in a local club, a community club, into these sorts of schemes and arrangements. She says that schemes like Mad Bookie promote risk taking because there is perceived reward, even with gambling losses. Associate Professor Thomas said that the concern is that we will have a generation of kids who will are naturally transitioning to betting because it is in that club environment that kids are exposed to. Associate Professor Thomas said, 'Given our research, and considering how much kids are absorbing, having gambling sponsorship at a community sports club would not be consistent with a health promotion environment for kids.' She says that sports betting is being normalised for young children. She says: 'Kids tell us that they see gambling ads everywhere; they cannot escape them. You can't watch a game of footy or go to a sporting event without seeing them. Signage can appear to be quite harmless, but when you talk to kids, it is those kinds of things they see regularly and it becomes a natural part of their environment.' That is something that is very disturbing.


In fact, it was a 2016 study co-authored by Associate Professor Thomas that found that 75 per cent of children aged eight to 16 years believed wagering was a normal or common part of sport, and could name at least one gambling brand. One-quarter of the children could recall four or more betting brands, and three in four children could recall at least one. Many could quote specific promotional offers and could talk in terms of cashback or refund promotions and bonus bets. This was in an article in QWeekend not so long ago.


I just would reflect on another issue based on a discussion that I had with Senator Hanson and her colleagues earlier this evening. They indicated that they will be seeking to move another amendment on those online betting services that offer you the chance to bet on the outcome of those megalotteries overseas. Lottoland.com is a prime example of that, but there are others. This is an important issue, and that sort of betting ought to be prohibited. I understand that Senator Hanson and her colleagues are looking at moving an amendment in relation to that. I absolutely commend her for doing so, if that is what she will be doing in expressing those concerns. I share those concerns. It is absolutely important that we grapple with this because this bill should be the beginning of a series of legislative measures to deal with the impact of sports betting and the impact it is having on young people in particular around the country. I know from the work I have done with my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore that our current regulatory frameworks are pathetic. Our current regulatory frameworks are woefully inadequate.


The Northern Territory regulator, in dealing with online betting, have let down so many people. They do not appear to be a regulator with any degree of rigour. They are not a regulator that can be respected. They are a regulator that have ignored serious issues in terms of problem gambling behaviour and breaches of codes, and have been completely or largely ineffective. That is why a national response, in the absence of a strong state or territory based response, is important. That is why I see this bill as a first step to many other steps that must be taken.


Too many young people and too many members of the community are being bitten by the gambling bug because of online gambling. Too many young men in particular are missing out on a deposit for a first home, buying their first car or planning that overseas trip because they have blown it on online gambling. It causes huge scars for them emotionally, as well as the financial scars it causes. That is why this legislation should be seen as the beginning of the debate and not the end of the debate for the reforms that we so sorely need in terms of online gambling in this country.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-03-20,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (19:45):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak about the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. To be frank, I am feeling tentative and uncertain. I am in two minds: is this yet another nanny state intrusion to control people's lives or is technology moving far more quickly than society's ability to adapt? Coming to the first question of whether is this yet another nanny state intrusion to control people's lives: at Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, we value individual freedom. Individual freedom is essential for responsibility, as our party leader has said for 20 years in politics. Individual freedom is very important for long-term personal security. Quite frankly, we could say—which is pervasive now; the ads are pervasive during sports broadcasts—why not let sports rip and why not let the gambling industry drag itself into destruction so that people could see the damage it is doing to our communities? But would that be fair?


On the other hand, the argument could be that the technology is moving much quicker than our society's ability to adapt. Sure, we could let people go through a lot of pain and eventually realise that gambling is an ill that needs to be treated very, very seriously and people would take responsibility for their own lives. But how many people would be able to come through that in a reasonable amount of time without continuing suicides? People rack up big losses. It is just a small number of people who rack up huge losses because of the compulsion and the addiction, but they have very big consequences on families.


There is plenty of gambling right now. It does not matter where one goes, one can see gambling available. It is easy. We can go to the trots, we can go to the horses, we could get the pokies, we can gamble with our mates or we can gamble on the dogs. We can gamble on any number of things, so there is plenty of gambling. Why do we need internet gambling? Do we need internet gambling? Another thing to consider is that internet gambling is essentially dirty profits going overseas. Companies that are taking money overseas are set up in the Northern Territory, with very little regulation. There is very little in the way of impediments to control them, to oversee the damage that they are doing and to the rein that in. There are very serious questions.


I would like to refer to a report of August 2015 from Financial Counselling Australia, which is entitled Duds, mugs and the A-list. Why do I refer to a Financial Counselling Australia report? Financial counsellors assist consumers in financial difficulty; they know about financial difficulty and people in financial difficulty. They provide information, support and advocacy to help consumers deal with their immediate financial situation and minimise the risk of future financial problems. The majority of financial counsellors work in community organisations, although some are employed by government. Their services are free, confidential and independent. So financial counsellors have extensive knowledge in a range of areas: consumer credit law, debt enforcement practices, the budgetary regime, industry hardship policies and government concession frameworks.


Around Australia, there are a number of financial counsellors who specialise in gambling financial counselling and helping people repair their lives after the damage. Financial counsellors are assisting an increasing number of clients, we are told, who have experienced staggering sports betting losses. People are losing their own money as well as money provided as credit by the sports betting companies. As a result, clients are losing their savings, homes, redundancies and superannuation payments, and they are losing their families. There is anecdotal evidence, according to Financial Counselling Australia, that some so-called accidental deaths—such as single vehicle accidents—may in fact be people who are escaping gambling debts.


Looking at some insights into the industry, sports betting companies actively encourage customers to bet using credit provided by the gambling companies. They are foreign companies who may not be able to, or may not want to, pay off on winnings. It seems amounts ranging from $200 to many tens of thousands of dollars are loaned. In some cases, the lure is initial free bets. They are free bets to get people hooked. It familiarises consumers with the game before inducing them to take further credit. These so-called free bets can be provided unethically and in a misleading fashion.


Whether a particular person is given credit or not, or has an existing credit limit increased, is based on an assessment of whether the company is likely to be repaid rather than whether the customer would experience undue hardship in making repayments. For example, some clients, to continue gambling, will take the money from household living expenses. The sports betting company knows that they will always come good with the money. Debt collection in the sports betting industry is swift and brutal. Customers can lose assets, such as the family home, in very short spaces of time. Debt collection charges and the fees for a bankruptcy trustee can significantly increase the amount owed.


According to Financial Counselling Australia:


We were also told by a former employee that sports betting companies swap customer account data, contrary to privacy legislation. When a gambler 'goes cold' and stops betting with one company, the company swaps lists with another company, which then entices the person to resume gambling. The recipient can receive a fully functioning account populated with their private financial data, plus some 'free money'—


It sounds like a Greens exercise here! They receive free money or credit to welcome them into the fold. Then we look at the pain this causes. Here are some cases studies; people losing huge amounts that they cannot afford.


Peter, for example, a 40-something male, received a redundancy payment of approximately $60,000. Sitting at home, with no risk, he became depressed. With no work, he became depressed. There was also a death in the family. Now, at that time Peter started gambling online with two different online sports betting companies, and lost his entire redundancy payout within just two months—two months! He also took out payday loans and pawned most of the household goods at this time. When he came to see a financial counsellor, his family had no money for food or to pay bills. He was not eligible for Newstart allowance as the retrenchment payout is counted as income. Peter appeared depressed and deeply affected. His family had no income and their savings were long gone. He has a wife and child.


Another financial counsellor saw Alex, who lost $90,000 in one week on sports betting. Alex had amassed a staggering $300,000 in debt due to sports betting, primarily over the past three years. And things have not changed in the last 1½ years. Richard opened an online betting account with a sports betting company at the start of the AFL season. As part of this new account he received inducements of $100 to $500 in free bets. Similar inducements were offered at other points in the AFL season. What we are seeing here are individuals, vulnerable—sometimes depressed, but highly vulnerable—and maybe suffering an addiction to gambling, preyed upon by company after company, many of them from overseas.


Richard, in this case, had some mental health difficulties and his parents helped him to sell his home and move back in with them so that they could assist him. He finally sold his house and the proceeds of the sale were sitting in his bank account. In the process of setting up the bank account, he linked the sports betting account to that bank account. He initially played with the 'free' money and learned how to play. Isn't that wonderful? Make it easy for them to learn how to play! A month later he bet $20,000 on a drawn game and lost close to $10,000. Two weeks on, he transferred $50,000 from his linked bank account to his sports betting account and wagered the whole amount on three games of that round. He won $35,000. Richard then placed the entire $85,000 in his sports betting account on the following week's games and lost it all. The following week he transferred the remaining $90,000, and that he lost quickly.


Each time it took just one click—one click!—to transfer funds from his bank account to his sports betting account. Just one click. Richard ended up losing the entire proceeds of his house sale in a few weeks, and his future changed course. In his mid 30s he had lost everything. His parents told how they cried for their son.


It is not just junior people. Max was a senior employee in a large finance company. You would think that if anyone could understand it would be Max. He was spending $2,000 per bet on weekend sporting games through online sports betting. He was sent incentives to entice him to gamble more, and his bets went up to $5,000 per bet. And this man was the employee of a large finance company. This pattern continued for a long time. One weekend, Max's gambling became erratic, and he bet $250,000—a quarter of a million dollars—on a single game and lost. He placed a second quarter-of-a-million-dollar bet that same weekend, losing the entire half a million dollars. In total, he had lost $670,000 to the sports betting company. The sports betting company then froze his account.


On the Monday morning Max told company management about his losses and that he had embezzled the money from them. He no longer had assets, he has filed for bankruptcy and is now in prison. The financial counsellor discovered that he had a further $200,000 of unsecured debt on credit cards, also spent on funding his sports betting.


Max reflects on how easy it was to gamble this large amount. There were no safeguards when his behaviour became erratic. He was amazed at the ease with which he could increase his bets without any questioning or intervention. We understand, though, that betting companies use complex algorithms to detect gambling patterns in real time. They would have picked up Max's atypical bets, but chose to accept them from someone vulnerable.


Some people are borrowing from payday lenders to fund their sports betting debts. Marco, for example, came to the financial counsellor with significant online payday lending debts due to funding his own online gambling. He had lost the money on online sports betting and indicated his surprise at the ease at which he was both able to gamble and to fund his gambling addiction through online payday lenders. He did not need to leave the house to set up any of this; he could do it from the comfort of his own house. The financial counsellor negotiated settlements with the payday lenders based on legislated consumer protections. But the man was already in trouble.


Jack is on a disability support pension. Jack and his mother had joint title on the home. Jack received a phone call from a sports-betting company representative, who offered three $1,000 free bets so that he could 'get a feel for the service'. He then got an email saying, 'I have set up your account. I have put the free bets in.' Another phone call informed him, 'Are you aware that our company offers credit and could put some dollars into your account?' He initially declined the offer of credit, but about two weeks later he discovered $10,000 in credit in his account. He used it.


One month later, two unsolicited credit limit increases were applied, upping his first limit to $30,000 and then to $40,000. Eight days after that, the limit on his betting company account was increased to $60,000 and later to $80,000. And Jack used the money and lost it. The betting company and its legal representatives then dodged a creditors' petition to bankrupt Jack. They also issued a warrant of possession for the house and demanded that he vacate the property within 14 days. The financial counsellor said that this was a frightening time for Jack and his mother. He said, 'They called me often and asked, ""What do we do now?""'


The trustee fees and bankruptcy came to $50,000 and the case was resolved out of court. The financial counsellor helped them stay in their house but their losses were still substantial. 


What about suicide and sports betting debts? Tim had huge debts from sports betting. He had embezzled funds from his employer to fund his addiction. At one point he attempted suicide. After Tim came out of hospital he found emails in his inbox inviting him to come to a big boxing match. He went to a financial counsellor, seeking assistance to deal with his debts. An employee of the sports betting company described his conversation with the court bailiff about the success of serving court orders on an indebted gambler. 


Another example is Pete, a young adult living at home. He used his parents credit card one weekend and lost a few thousand dollars through online sports betting. He knew his parents would find out when they checked their account. He committed suicide, leaving an explanatory note apologising and explaining his shame. The parents met with a financial counsellor to work out how they could repay the credit card debt. 


A gambling counsellor who was interviewed said that her agency asked every new gambling client two questions as part of the intake process: 'Have you ever thought of suicide?' Most say, 'Yes.' And, 'Have you ever actually attempted it?' One in 10—10 per cent—say, 'Yes'. A gambling counsellor said: 'The gamblers see no way out. One client told me, ""I just wanted to drive straight off that bridge so I wouldn't have to face up to what I've done.""' Most do not do it because things do get better with help, and families do not know because of the shame. 


I cannot finish without saying something about another big gambling exercise. A few weeks ago, I was listening to people across south-west Queensland and I got wind of a town by the name Dirranbandi while I was in Balonne Shire Council offices in the town of St George near Dirranbandi. They told me that there are 100 vacant houses in Dirranbandi, a once thriving community. I said, 'How many houses are in Dirranbandi?' They said, 'We estimate around 300.' One-third of the houses are vacant, and the school enrolments have dropped by 50 per cent in just five years. The reason? As a parliament, we are gambling with taxpayer funds on the Murray-Darling Basin water buyback, destroying southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. People down the road at Goondiwindi, who have operations in Queensland and in New South Wales, told me the devastation in Dirranbandi is not as bad as the devastation in Collarenebri. Collarenebri and two other towns—give me a minute to think of the names—have also been devastated by this taxpayer funded federal government initiative. 


We are also gambling with the sovereignty and the governance of this country. This country's Constitution depends on competitive federalism, and there is a very, very good reason for that. Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen highlighted this when he abandoned and abolished estate duties—death duties. And what happened? Because of that, and his pro-business stance, his balancing of the budget and his support for infrastructure, people from the south flocked to the Gold Coast and now we see the miracle that is the Gold Coast. When Queensland took funding from investors from the south and retirees from the south, southern governments also abolished death duties. That is why we must restore competitive federalism. 


We also see the federal government gambling with innovation, as they say. What a lovely word—a catchphrase; a buzzword. I was asking Senator Sinodinos a couple of weeks ago in Senate estimates about the hundreds of millions of dollars being flung around in one program after another. The really sad thing is that the highly paid federal public servants actually believe it is going to work. History shows—cursory examples are an iPhone, a computer or a car—that all significant inventions and improvements come from someone who has skin in the game, someone who depends on his idea working. We know that for every one invention that works there are sometimes thousands of inventors who have not succeeded but who have plucked up the courage to do something. We also know that of the one inventor who succeeds, sometimes, he or she might go through hundreds of iterations before they succeed. This is hardly a gamble and yet our federal government is not leading by example. It is gambling; it is gambling with taxpayer funds. 


I hope I have conveyed to you the misery that is being caused by unregulated gambling. I hope I have conveyed that I am torn, in some ways, because— (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-03-20,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (20:05):  I do not mind admitting that I was not intending to speak on this bill until I was in the position a little bit earlier that you are in now when a number of the contributions made by other senators discussed the impact of problem gambling. It caused me to have another look at the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. No matter how you might like to dress it up, this bill is not about dealing with problem gambling, save for perhaps one clause in relation to the call-to-bet or click-to-call procedures. 


This is really more about tax revenue for the government and they are dressing it up as purporting to solve a problem gambling issue because there are unregulated gambling operations that are taking bets from Australians. They can do it very easily, and they essentially pay no licence fees, turnover taxes or anything else that is attached to it. I am not standing in the way of that, but what I have listened to is people coming out with sob-story after sob-story about individuals who have been impacted by gambling. I will have a bet with anyone in this place that no-one is closer to the issue of problem gambling destroying individuals' lives than me, not because I have a problem with gambling but because someone very close to me does. I have seen millions of dollars disappear. I have seen families get destroyed. I have seen businesses get destroyed. I have seen people at the pits of despair as a result of gambling. And yet I do not blame the gambling operators; I blame the individuals for making those determinations themselves.


Having said that, there are things we can do, and this is where I am going to depart from the bill a little bit. There are things we can do and that we should be doing to ensure the integrity, the efficacy and the ethical conduct of gambling operators in this country. That is why I support this bill and I told the minister that. At least if you are dealing with a licensed and regulated gambling operator in this country, you can be sure that they are subject to Australian laws. You cannot guarantee you are going to be remunerated. If you are dealing with an overseas operator, you do not know about the transparency or accountability of it. Your money could be just disappearing into a black hole.


And yet there is a part of me that heard Senator Leyonhjelm's speech earlier and thought, 'We cannot be there to protect everyone from making dumb decisions themselves.' No matter how many times you have warnings from ASIC or one of the other regulators that you should not send money to unscrupulous cold callers in investments or any other form, people still do it. Then, when they lose their money, they come back and say the government should do something about it. I do not always subscribe to that. I think that ultimately people are making these decisions for themselves. Our job and the education system's job is to make sure that people are equipped to deal with the issues they are going to face in life, and that is something we have walked away from as the nanny state seeks to take away any risk from any individual.


But I do not think this legislation is going to be effective in stopping problem gambling or stopping people developing gambling habits that lead to catastrophic consequences in some areas. I wanted to speak a little bit from experience. One of the problems we have got with domestic operators is the fact that there are a lot of young people—14, 15 and 16—who have seen the odds on the screen about sports betting in particular and are lured to the websites. They input their details at a website and, although they do not have a verified account, they can go in and look at the odds on the next no-ball being bowled or who is going to kick the first goal and things like that. Children today are interested in that and go and register on it.


But imagine my surprise when I found out from some of my son's friends that, when they do this online, they suddenly get a phone call from their new friend 'Bill' or 'Bob' at one of the sporting agencies, asking them why they have not funded their account yet, never verifying that they are actually of legal age. They just ring up and say: 'Hello, John. Thanks for putting your name in. We noticed you haven't made a bet or sent any money through yet. It might be a good idea to.' The only reason I found out about this was that I was in the car when one of my son's friends took that phone call. I said, 'Who was that?' 'Oh, that was my mate at XYZ Betting agency.' You can imagine a couple of days later I rang XYZ Betting Agency, asked to speak to the general manager and told him that what they were doing was thoroughly unethical and inappropriate. I received assurances that that would not continue and they would amend their programs, but I would lay London to a brick that that same sort of marketing and online campaigning is happening at many of the regulated gambling firms in this country. It is not right. That is one way you can get it fixed.


The other aspect of regulated gambling, bet-takers and sports bookmakers was raised with me by a constituent just the other day. They said, 'The problem is they only want to deal with losers.' I can understand that: you want to make sure you are making a profit. But, if you are actually a successful punter and you ring XYZ Betting Agency, they look at your track record and they do not offer you the same odds. They say, 'No, we're not taking your money.' You no longer get the accelerated bet or the other benefits, perks and accoutrements that they advertise as a way of getting ahead. And we all see those ads on television. And so they are allowing losers to get the benefits because the chances are they are not going to win, but, if you are actually a winner, their business model says, no, you are no longer allowed to deal with them or you are going to deal on such unfavourable terms that it is unscrupulous. It is not even adhering to or providing the odds and the services that they market so readily.


The third aspect if you want to clean up problem gambling in particular in the sports arena but also in any regulated arena is to outlaw credit betting. People cannot borrow money through any regular financial agency, whether it be shares, a bank or anywhere else, without going through a plethora of checks. We say this all the time to the banking industry. You want to have a royal commission into banking because of lending practices, but you ought to look at the lending practices of some of these online gambling agencies. They do not care. 'Yeah, sure, we'll lend you $100. We'll lend you $1,000. We'll lend you $20,000, $30,000, $50,000'—until they send the bailiffs in because they know that, chances are, you are going to lose that. And so, if you said no, there is no longer credit betting for 'unsophisticated' punters, if you want to put it in the investment parlance, where people have to meet a minimum criteria where they are meant to be adult enough to look after themselves—if you said there is no more credit betting available to individuals that did not meet those criteria, you would limit the ability for individuals to get involved in gambling out of their financial depth.


This brings me to the fourth point. If you think gambling is becoming a compulsion and people are just chasing from one bet to the next to the next, the only thing that allows them to do that is either the instant transfer of money into the bookmaker's account or the ability to access credit from that bookmaker. If you have outlawed or prohibited the provision of credit to non-sophisticated or non-professional punters, however you want to describe them, and then say it is going to be a 72-hour waiting period or thereabout—48 hours or whatever you want—you are breaking that ability to cycle from one bet to another and continue to chase your losses. That is the same principle that is attached to how we deal with people who have gambling addictions, or addictions of any nature, in fact. You take away the ability for them to participate in that addictive behaviour, and you give them a chance to gather their thoughts and have a sleep on it. As our mothers always said, 'It will feel better in the morning.' Generally, it does feel better in the morning, after you have had a good night's sleep. You say, 'Okay, I have a problem. I have got to confront that. How am I going to deal with it?'


If we are serious about dealing with problem gambling in this country, and particularly online gambling, those are practical steps that perhaps this Senate and the government should consider. But the bill before us is not about problem gambling. It is about tax revenue and, in some ways, giving some level of confidence to the Australian people who want to gamble online that they are doing it with a 'reputable operator'. Once again, I put air quotes around 'reputable operator', because the problem with parts of this legislation is that ACMA is going to be providing a list of licensed bookmakers, or licensed or approved gambling service providers. I think that is fraught with danger, quite frankly. I am not sure that anyone is going to go to the ACMA website and say, 'Who can I place my Melbourne Cup bet with today?' What they will do is a Google search, and whoever has paid for the highest ranking on Google will probably get their business, if they have not already got an account. 


I think it opens up the government to a bit of a problem. What if one of those gambling operators does the wrong thing? Yes, they will be held to account for it, and other things, but will the government be blamed by the punter who will say, 'This is one of your approved service providers'? I wonder about the wisdom of that intervention. I do not think it is necessary. It probably will not do any harm, but, nonetheless, if you are thinking that is a way of stamping out the problems involved with sports betting, I think it is paying lip-service to it, quite frankly.


I do support the click-to-call provision, because there is clearly a loophole. The intention is that you cannot place in-play bets online, for the reason that you could do it very, very quickly as you did not have to speak with an operator, and it led people into what could be a cycle of addiction. This provision is designed to circumvent that, because the call comes from a robot which repeats the information that you have already put into your betting app, and the bet takes place in a very short space of time. If people want to bet in-play, I do think it is reasonable for them to be in a place of gambling frequency. If they are in their local TAB, or their local pub, watching a game on TV and they want to go and place a bet on it, I really do not see a problem with that. People who are in licensed premises should have the ability to do that. If individuals want to call up and place bets, it is another way of circumventing or delaying the instant gratification response of putting a bet on, getting an immediate result and then waiting for the next one. It is that intervention period, which I talked about earlier, and how that can help break the cycle of addiction.


In the end, I will support this legislation, but I do not want it to pretend to be something that it is not. That is why I have put on the record tonight my thoughts about how, if we want to tackle problem gambling, we have to start to approach it in a better way than, and in a different way from, this bill and what it is supposed to deal with or has been characterised as dealing with. Let us see how the amendments play out. I am not sure about which amendments, if any, I will be supporting. I do want to put on the record that I am absolutely mindful of the potentially catastrophic consequences of problem gambling and what it does to individuals and families, but I am also mindful that it is not our responsibility here to protect everyone from their own inanity and foolish behaviour, and that extends to not only the process of placing bets but who they can place bets with. This bill does not really deal with any of the substantive problem-gambling issues. I do believe it is a revenue bill, albeit one dressed up in some moral guidance.

"Burston, Sen Brian",PHON,2017-03-20,"



Senator BURSTON
 (New South Wales) (20:19):  Different sectors of the community have differing opinions about the virtues of gambling. Regardless of your views on the topic, it is a reality and it is here to stay, for the foreseeable future at least.


Gamblers will tell you that there is nothing like the thrill of the win, and they downplay the losses, preferring to look forward to the next big win. Detractors will tell you that the act of gambling in any form is a sin and has no redeeming qualities, and neither do the gamblers who engage in it.


Whatever your opinion, we have to deal with what we have and manage the market so that those who engage in gambling are, in some cases, protected from themselves. We must also ensure that the organisations that enter the market conduct themselves in a manner that does as little harm to the gamblers as possible in the context of their interaction with them.


Traditionally, punters would go to the racetrack and place a bet with a bookie, or go to the TAB and bet on a horserace, a dog race or, more recently, some other sporting event. Now gambling has taken on a whole new complexion. If you want, you can bet on who kicks the first goal, who runs last, who is first to touch the ball and so on. We have grown to accept this myriad of options available to us, and gambling companies have grown with it.


Most of the types of gambling I just mentioned went into overdrive with the advent of online gambling. The combination of a gambler, an internet connection and an account with a gambling provider means you can bet on a football match in the USA, a horserace in Happy Valley in Hong Kong and a soccer match in the UK all from the comfort of your phone while you sit at home in downtown Newcastle.


Offshore companies that come to Australia to sell their services to punters generally register in the Northern Territory, paying $550,000 a year in licensing fees and taking approximately $8.6 billion from the community, while paying only $6.5 million in tax for the privilege. Their revenues go offshore and do not contribute to Australian society. The taxes stay in the Northern Territory, despite the revenue being gained from across Australia.


Add to this a new company from Gibraltar that allow punters to bet on the outcome of a lottery. They are registered in the Northern Territory, and their revenues are unknown at this stage, but all those revenues leave this country and put the livelihoods of 4½ thousand independent newsagents who rely on gambling revenues at risk. The company do not add value to the gambling process. They are truly parasites, who offset their risk by insuring against a punter having a win. There is no guarantee that they have the capacity if a punter should make a big win. There is no way of knowing if they will conduct themselves ethically in any situation they are not prepared to embrace.


One Nation's proposed amendment to the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 calls for the banning of this particular type of operator in the gambling industry that allows punters to bet on the outcome of other lotteries or events, but it does not have any impact on other foreign companies registered in the Northern Territory.


Be under no illusion: this is a multibillion-dollar industry. The foreign companies make an absolute fortune from operations all around the world. We are not against free enterprise, nor are we against entrepreneurs making an honest dollar. I emphasise the 'honest dollar' and leave it up to you to decide what that might be. We believe that the companies that allow punters to bet on the outcome of another company's lottery are not making an honest dollar. They do not add value and are parasites on the industry, which probably does not have a whole lot of saving graces to begin with. I commend One Nation's amendment, which Senator Hanson will be introducing, to the Senate.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-03-20,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (20:23):  I have been listening to some of the speeches here tonight, and gambling is a huge issue. Senator Bernardi commented on friends that he has seen involved in gambling and on the repercussions that it has had on them. I too have known people where gambling has affected them, so I am sure we have all been touched by it. But I also agree with Senator Bernardi that gambling is a part of life. I cannot see it being wiped out at all, and I do not believe that we should. People have to be responsible for their own actions, and I would not like to see us become a nanny state. I support this bill from the government, the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016, and I will be moving an amendment.


The gambling industry is flourishing, and we ask: where does the money go? There are a few international corporate bookmakers in Australia, and they rake in $8.6 billion from sports and racing betting, yet they only contribute back to the Northern Territory government $6.5 million in tax. Licences can be bought from the Northern Territory for $550,000 a licence per annum.


Another foreign entity that is working in Australia and buys a licence from the Northern Territory is called Lottoland. Lottoland, I have been told, have a contract with a Gibraltar company. They buy a licence for $550,000 in the Northern Territory, and what they offer Australians is the ability to bet on the outcome of megalotteries around the world. It is unknown what they rake in in their turnover, but the thing is that they do not pay tax. They pay no tax in this country whatsoever. Unlike the international corporate bookmakers, Lottoland pay no tax, but what must be also considered is: can they pay on a win if there is a win?


Lottoland is jeopardising the 4½ thousand newsagents who rely on lotteries. They contribute $1.4 billion across the nation in taxes that are paid and a further $150 million in GST. Lottoland, you might think, is a big organisation, employs people and brings a lot to the country, but it does not. It only employs six people. And yet I am sure we have seen, if not hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions of dollars leaving the country, tax free.


What we have to consider and what I will be moving today is an amendment. I am led to believe that Lottoland have been shut down in France and Italy, and the UK is now looking at shutting them down. The amendment that I will move here today to part of this bill is basically to put a stop to organisations like Lottoland that provide a service relating to betting on the outcome of a lottery. Hence, what we will be doing, if my colleagues in this place support my amendment, is to stop people like the organisation Lottoland—plus a couple of others who are possibly eyeing off coming over here to do the same—ripping off, as I said, hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars out of our economy. They do not pay tax, and there is no guarantee that they will be able to pay up if anyone does have a win. I hope that people will support this amendment, because, at the end of the day, we will be looking after Australian businesses who rely on lotteries for that extra little bit of cream, because that helps keep them profitable, and probably helping Australians who may not have been paid by these organisations that may be questionable. So I hope that I get support on this amendment.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (20:29):  Unless there are any other colleagues who want to contribute, I will close the debate on the second reading of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. I thank colleagues for their contributions and for the spirit in which they have been made. I know this is an area that is of concern to most colleagues.


As colleagues know, the government is committed to strengthening the regulatory enforcement of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and protecting Australian interests from illegal offshore gambling operators. This bill is the first stage of a three-stage process aimed at protecting Australia's wagering, racing and sporting industries, problem and at-risk gamblers, consumers and the integrity of Australian sport. I do not think anyone here pretends that we can stop 100 per cent of money going offshore, but the government is confident that the measures in this bill will have a significant disruptive impact on illegal offshore wagering. That is the aim of this legislation—to stop as much of the illegal offshore wagering activity as we can so that where wagering by Australians takes place it does so with properly licenced onshore operators with stronger consumer protections.


The legislative amendments will prohibit a person providing regulated interactive gambling services to Australians unless the person holds a licence under the law of an Australian state or territory. The bill will clarify the licensing requirements for interactive gambling services in Australia and will provide a simple-to-establish key criterion for enforcement agencies when investigating whether to take action against unlicensed services. This bill will introduce a civil penalty regime which will be enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. This amendment will allow for a quicker and more focused response as formal investigation or prosecution will not depend upon the priorities of other agencies. Civil remedies for the provision of prohibited or unlicensed interactive gambling services to Australians will carry a maximum penalty of $1.35 million per day for individuals and $6.75 million per day for organisations. The criminal provisions of the act will be maintained for more serious offences and now carry a maximum penalty of $900,000 per day for individuals and $4.5 billion per day for organisations. The reforms will enable the ACMA to notify the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of the names of directors or principals of offending gambling services so that they can be placed on the movement alert list and any travel to Australia can be disrupted.


These enforcement actions will be combined with a number of measures to build relationships with international regulators and raise awareness of Australian gambling laws and the risks associated with illegal gambling services. The bill will also, importantly, prohibit click-to-call in-play betting services. The government is committed to closing down these services, as they undermine the intent of the Interactive Gambling Act to limit the scope of problem gambling in Australia.


In addition to the bill and at the core of the government's response to the O'Farrell review is the development of a national consumer protection framework for online wagering in Australia. Can I take the opportunity of again thanking Mr O'Farrell for his work. This is indeed one of the largest reforms to the online wagering industry since the introduction of the Interactive Gambling Act in 2001. On 25 November last year Commonwealth, state and territory ministers gave in-principle agreement to key aspects of the national consumer protection framework. This includes a national self-exclusion register for online wagering, a voluntary opt-out pre-commitment scheme for online wagering and prohibition of lines of credit being offered by online wagering providers. This government will continue to work with the states and territories to develop the framework to ensure that there is a strong, robust set of national standards for online wagering that will provide greater protection for Australian consumers. The government will also be consulting with internet service and financial payment providers around disruption measures to further reduce illegal offshore gambling activity.


I would like to turn briefly to some of the issues that senators have raised in this debate so far, some of which will no doubt be the subject of amendments moved in the committee stage. Firstly, I will turn to Labor's second reading amendment that has been circulated. The government certainly does acknowledge that there is a level of community concern in relation to gambling advertising. This is something I have raised with the broadcasters. It is important for the broadcasters to ensure that their advertising is conducted in a way that reflects community standards. Indeed, this is the objective of the co-regulatory framework of codes of practice that is in place and which the government supports. I note that the opposition also supports the co-regulatory framework. Suffice to say in relation to Labor's second reading amendment, we do not agree with making policy by way of second reading amendments, so we will not be supporting that put forward by the opposition.


I will turn now to the Greens' amendments. The amendment in Senator Di Natale's name is in relation to gambling advertising. For similar reasons, the government will not be supporting Senator Di Natale's amendment. Senator Rhiannon's amendment was on expansion of gambling. The government will not be supporting Senator Rhiannon's amendment. It is not correct to allege that this bill will lead to an expansion of the Australian gambling market as the amendment suggests. The bill only preserves the status quo and clarifies the act; it does not enable activities that were not previously permitted. Far from leading to an expansion of the gambling market, the bill in fact achieves the opposite through its closing of the click-to-call in-play betting loophole. The government also rejects the slur in the second part of the amendment.


I will turn now to the NXT amendments. NXT colleagues have raised a number of issues in their contributions. I think it is fair to characterise many of the NXT amendments as foreshadowed as largely seeking to implement elements of the government's response to the O'Farrell review, which we are seeking to implement as part of the national consumer protection framework with the states and territories. The government believes that it is important that we work with the states and territories, as much of the regulation of wagering is in state and territory legislation. It is states and territories that license wagering operators, and it is state and territory regulators that are largely responsible for compliance and enforcement. The government is absolutely committed to implementing the national framework. There has already been a meeting of the Commonwealth with state and territory gaming ministers and in-principle agreement was reached to implement the elements of the framework. So, while the government agrees with much of the substance of the NXT amendments, we will not be supporting them, as we feel it is more appropriate to pursue those elements through the process that is already well underway with our state and territory counterparts. 


In terms of Senator Kakoschke-Moore's amendment in relation to place-based betting services, there has already been some concern expressed around the bill's clarification of in-play betting being permitted in licensed retail venues on electronic terminals. The bill that is before the Senate seeks to do nothing more than preserve the status quo. The Interactive Gambling Act was not intended to regulate activities in retail venues. It is about regulating the online space. In-play betting is currently permitted and takes place in retail venues on electronic betting terminals. In some venues, these are fixed terminals; in others, customers can load money onto a tablet. As I said, the bill seeks to do nothing more than preserve the status quo. It will not be permitted to offer in-play betting on personal devices—I should make that very clear. Nor will it be permitted to offer in-play betting by electronic means via a customer's online account. The establishments that we are talking about here are monitored by staff trained in the responsible service of gaming and alcohol. These establishments can only be accessed by adults. They do not permit intoxicated persons to remain on the premises. They have set opening and closing times and only accept cash payments. These elements provide a level of harm minimisation that would not be available in a private dwelling, using a personal device. 


The bill reflects an important distinction between equipment that is provided in a regulated environment, which is available to all customers, and gambling on personal devices used in the home or other private places which would not be subject to harm minimisation controls. As stated in our government response to the illegal offshore wagering review, we are not expanding the range of gambling products in Australia. The bill is simply clarifying the services that are currently permitted under Commonwealth, state and territory laws. Further, the Commonwealth's legislation only deals with devices on which in-play betting is permitted. Other than for the issue of in-play betting, the legislative framework and regulations for betting on in-venue devices is a matter for each state and territory. If there are concerns about portable devices, it is open to each state and territory to limit their use or prohibit them in retail venues, if they see fit. 


I turn now to Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment relating to online poker—a further matter which has been raised in the context of this bill. The government is aware that a number of Australians currently access online poker sites. Online poker is and always has been a prohibited service under the IGA. It has always been the intent of the IGA to prohibit this service being offered to Australians. That is why there are no Australian licensed operators of online poker, but because the law has been ambiguous overseas operators have been freely offering these services to Australians. With the law being clarified, it is evident that a number of these operators have begun withdrawing their services from Australians. Whilst I appreciate that this is not welcomed by those individuals who have been using these services, it is a fact that online poker has always been a prohibited service under the act. It is not something that this bill is enacting. Whether online poker should be legal in Australia or not is a separate debate. I indicate that the government has no plans to liberalise online poker, and in terms of this bill the government has merely sought to ensure that the original intent of the legislation is upheld. 


I should also acknowledge that One Nation have flagged an intention to move an amendment in relation to Lottoland. I thank One Nation for making contact during the second reading debate to indicate that they would be doing this. Let me just say at this point that, in relation to that foreshadowed amendment, the bill before us is intended to tackle illegal offshore wagering. Lottoland is, at present, neither illegal nor offshore. It is a licensed service in the Northern Territory. So it would be fair to say that that foreshadowed amendment is beyond the intended scope of this bill, but, as always, when colleagues put a proposition before us, we will always take on board what is put before us. But I think on this occasion, in the time available to us and given the scope of this bill, it is not possible for us to examine it and to support it in the context of this legislation. 


In conclusion, since the introduction of the bill in November last year, a number of major offshore gambling operators have ceased providing or indicated that they will withdraw their prohibited services as Australia will no longer be a grey market when it comes to gambling laws. This bill does send a clear message to overseas operators and regulators that Australia is serious about compliance with its online gambling laws. International experience has shown that illegal offshore betting cannot be eradicated in its entirety. However, a combination of clearer laws, an active regulator, stronger enforcement measures and awareness activities can significantly reduce illegal gambling activity. 


The bill has been developed in consultation with many stakeholders across the wagering, racing and sporting industries, academia, responsible gambling organisations, consumers and governments. I look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders to progress the National Consumer Protection Framework.


I should indicate that I will be working closely with my ministerial colleague Mr Tudge, who has put a tremendous effort into this area, and it is appropriate that I acknowledge that. There is more work to be done. As indicated, it is a three-stage process. I commend the bill to my colleagues.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator O'Neill be agreed to.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:57):  I have a number of questions for the minister before amendments are dealt with. I make reference, perhaps as a reference point, to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's report on this bill. The minister's second reading speech on the bill explained:


The review—


the O'Farrell review, as it is known, into the Interactive Gambling Act—


found that the amount of money being spent on illegal wagering services could be as high as $400 million annually with a further $100 million in lost taxation revenue and product fees.


There does not seem to be any firm view on the amount of money actually lost. Some figures you hear are $500 million and other figures go much higher than that. Does the Commonwealth have the ability to be more specific about these figures? For instance, if it obtained the cooperation of banks in terms of other mechanisms of measuring the amount that goes offshore—because presumably most of these transactions are occurring using credit cards and other discernible transactions—surely there ought to be some way of measuring more accurately the extent of the problem of these illegal offshore gambling sites.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (20:58):  You have indicated the sorts of ranges that are spoken of when talking about these dollar amounts. Obviously, there is always a capacity for greater specificity in these things, but you raise some potential avenues for that.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:59):  At least you did not talk about programmatic specificity!



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Dastyari is familiar with who I am referring to. Has the government considered measures to more accurately measure the amount of money that goes to illegal wagering services? For instance, has the government inquired of the banks or financial institutions to determine by virtue of the merchant numbers for these illegal, overseas, online gambling operations, to determine the amount lost in that way? Has an effort been made? Has anyone in the Commonwealth, whether it be ACMA or the AFP, gone to the banks to say, 'Please cooperate with us. Here are the merchant numbers of Casino.com and Lottoland.com'—well, presumably Lottoland.com operates under a licence from the Northern Territory—'and those that are clearly unauthorised illegal transactions under the Interactive Gambling Act 2001'?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:00):  Obviously, we are looking to reduce illegal activity and thereby reduce whatever the dollar figure may be. I can indicate to you that the Commonwealth is looking at commissioning further research to quantify it.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:01):  The Interactive Gambling Act has been in force since 2001. I remember it well, having lobbied for its passage all those years ago as a state member of parliament, walking up and down the corridors talking to crossbenchers and to Senator Alston as the minister. Are you saying that, in the 16 years this bill has been enforced, including its prohibition of illegal, overseas online gambling operations, there has been no attempt to determine with some degree of specificity and some degree of rigor the amount of money actually lost to these online sites? If so, why not? If the government is planning to do it now, what actual measures will it take to do so? For instance, will it require cooperation from the banks and financial institutions to determine this once and for all?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:02):  The O'Farrell review reflects the best available information at that time. As I have indicated, we are looking at commissioning further research, but, obviously, our objective and purpose with this legislation is to drive down that number, whatever it may be.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:02):  I am not trying to be difficult on this; I just think it is important the people of Australia know what the extent is of the offshore, illegal sites problem. The government says it is considering further research. Reference was made to it in the O'Farrell review, and I was fortunate enough to sit down with Mr O'Farrell as part of that review and give him my views and that was fed into the report, but it does not seem to be the case that there are any measures to deal with this. My colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore refers to page 150 of the O'Farrell review which says:


Commonwealth, State and Territory governments should recommit to Gambling Research Australia to ensure that research funds are directed towards maximising the information available to policy makers, academics, the community and industry about the nature, prevalence and impact of gambling across Australia.


That is a very broad recommendation, but what concrete, practical, rigorous measures is the government proposing to determine the level of offshore gambling?


There is an estimate of $500 million. For all we know, it could be $1 billion. It could be $200 million or any figure that you could pluck out of thin air. Surely, if it is expected that the vast majority of these transactions occur with credit cards or can be discernible and traceable through banks and financial institutions and credit card providers, then surely we should—I am just trying to understand if the government is prepared to commit to going down that path. Presumably there might be some people using bitcoins. We can probably guess or estimate how many people would be using bitcoins, but I imagine it would be a very small part of it. I think it is not unreasonable to ask, after 16 years of the operation of this act, to understand where that figure of $400 million comes from. What rigor would be employed to determine once and for all, with some degree of specificity, how much is actually being lost to these offshore sites?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:05):  The first point to make is that this is not a measurement bill. This is a bill about acting on the problem, which it does. The O'Farrell review indicated that losses are between the range of $64 million and $400 million. I have already indicated that the Commonwealth will be looking to commission further research. Senator Xenophon, your propositions as to how to help achieve the most accurate figure are, of course, ones that are very welcome.

Can I just go to a point raised in 1.4 of the Senate committee's report in terms of this bill: 


… there is uncertainty around the legality of services under the IGA and enforcement has been minimal, with no prosecutions since the legislation was enacted in 2001 'despite a considerable number of complaints made by Australians in relation to illegal online gambling services'.


That is something that the Hon. Alan Tudge, a minister in the other place, made reference to in the Hansard on 10 November 2016. Can the minister advise how many complaints have been made since the inception of the act? And can he advise that there have not been any prosecutions under the Interactive Gambling Act at all after 16 years of operation?

I know laws come into effect when laws come into effect, but are you saying that for matters that occurred prior to the passage of this bill, the royal assent of this bill, the existing penalty provisions are extant? Or does it mean that it is not retrospective in the sense that the offence is still there, but there is a different penalty regime that applies at the time you make the complaint? I am just trying to understand how that would work. I do not want to labour the point any more than this, but it is important to make that clear for the constituents that we have that approach us about these problems.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:11):  I am a bit rusty on my criminal procedure—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Back
):  This is not evident up to this point, Senator Xenophon, but it might become so.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Yes. I think I did criminal procedure in 1981. Minister Tudge, in his contribution in the House of Representatives, said on 10 November 2016:


Criminal prosecution is considered likely to be unsuccessful or ineffective due to the competing priorities of the Australian Federal Police, uncertainty around the legality of services under the—


IGA—


evidence requirements and the offshore location of gambling operators.


That was in the context of why there had not been any prosecutions for those offshore gambling operators.


Minister, given the track record of zero prosecutions since 2001, how can we be confident that what is proposed here will actually lead to prosecutions? Given the occasions that I and my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore have made complaints to ACMA and to the AFP, they just seem to be either gathering dust or not a priority for them even though we have instances where people have been devastated financially. We have heard from the Financial Counselling Australia report that I referred to, that Senator Roberts very articulately referred to, about the devastating effects on people's lives as a result of the enormous losses they have sustained. What assurances do we have that we are not going to be revisiting this bill in 16 years time, when I am long gone from this place, when the minister may still be here as the grey eminence of the Senate—




Senator Fifield:
  I am grey already!




Senator XENOPHON:
  Or greyer eminence of the Senate, to tell us that—




Senator Dastyari:
  Papa Smurf!

  Senator Dastyari said 'Papa Smurf', which is very unkind to smurfs. Can the minister advise us: how can we be assured that this is not just another piece of legislation that will sit there and be pretty much ineffective?

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:14):  But how different is that from the existing test? Is the minister saying that the evidentiary requirements are somehow lessened or somehow eased? There seems to be a big issue here about the willingness of ACMA, and particularly the AFP, to tackle these issues because they have other priorities. They deal with many, many other issues. I am not being critical of the AFP per se, but it seems that this has not been a priority for them, particularly when you consider that lives have been ruined because of these offshore illegal sites. Of course, they have been by the legal sites as well, but it is the illegal sites that we are looking at now.

In ACMA, we would have an active regulator. I think it is well known to colleagues that the AFP has competing priorities. The fact that there is an active regulator focused on this and with the greater ease of the application of civil penalties the government is confident that this will be a framework that will work.

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE

A couple of weeks ago, a bill introduced by my colleague Senator Xenophon, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Sports Betting Reform) Bill 2015, was the subject of a public hearing in Melbourne. Evidence during that committee by Tabcorp showed that they are in fact rolling out land-based electronic betting terminals to spring and autumn racing carnivals and that those terminals, in fact, already exist in some sports stadiums across Australia.


The Nick Xenophon Team has some serious concerns in relation to these terminals. I understand it is separate to the bill being considered here to a certain degree; but given the harm that we know is caused by online sports betting and online gambling, can you advise whether or not the government is looking at incorporating the consideration of harm minimisation measures relating to land-based gambling as part of the national consumer protection framework that is currently under discussion?

If there is an actual flood of complaints, given the number of people who are hurt by these illegal offshore gambling sites, will the government undertake to make sure that these matters are dealt with and that complaints are not abandoned by virtue of a lack of resources on the part of ACMA?

  Okay, you cannot tell me what is the budget. Do you know what is in the budget? In relation to these matters, if you are looking at fining an offshore gambling operation—if it is Malta, Gibraltar, somewhere in the Caribbean or wherever they may be; I am not sure of this Uzbekistan is big on online gambling, and I apologise to the Uzbekistan if they are not—does the government say that they have the ability to pursue those companies and to obtain any monetary penalties from them given that they are based overseas? What undertakings will the government be able to obtain from those countries where these online gambling operations are based?


In some cases they may have an office in a place like the United Kingdom or a European country, but they are based in another jurisdiction. Trying to obtain a prosecution fine from these companies that have all sorts of complex and labyrinthine arrangements—has that been factored into the sorts of resources that ACMA will use? And is it expected that ACMA will prosecute these companies that may have operations in Gibraltar but a head office in London? How will it actually work?

  Well, there are many countries in the world. There will probably be the need to go through what the individual relationships are between Australia and each jurisdiction. I should also mention that we do have—as you know, Senator—as part of this legislation the capacity to notify the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of people who may be directors in these foreign countries, to place them on an alert list. There are also other disruptive measures. The amendments also extend the ambit of enforcement to affiliates and agents. Someone illegal operators engage a network of Australian-based agents and affiliates to recruit customers, so there is a greater capacity to deal with these individuals.


But you are right: the fact that some activities take place in foreign countries where there might not necessarily be those sorts of relationships with other agencies can prove to be an issue. But Australia is always working on ensuring that we have those good relationships where we can with partner agencies overseas.

Does the government concede that it would be easy to circumvent the proposed ban on in-play betting by the exemptions that the government itself has, in effect, facilitated in this bill?

 (South Australia) (21:26):  Minister, in response to one of our questions on notice during the Senate committee's inquiry into this bill, concerning availability of in-play betting—those questions that we asked in relation to those concerns about the availability of in-play betting—the department responded:


The 'place-based betting service' exemption in proposed section 8BA is intended to permit betting services, including potentially in-play betting services, to be provided on electronic equipment (which may include easy betting terminals and/or tablets) made available to customers in places such as TABs, casinos and clubs.


Will the government undertake to conduct modelling or any other monitoring or review of whether this provision leads to an uptake in betting activity and problem gambling behaviour due to the increased availability of these electronic devices in TABs, casinos and clubs?

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:27):  Chair, I think that you and the minister may be pleased to know that this is my final line of questioning before I seek to move amendments on the running sheet!


The minister made reference in his closing remarks on the bill that there is going to be a national consumer protection framework in respect of online gambling. There were many recommendations made in the O'Farrell review and the minister is no doubt aware of Financial Counselling Australia's recommendations in relation to dealing with these issues. I know that Senator Roberts did outline a number of cases from that report that were quite horrendous stories of people who had lost life savings, who had been devastated financially and who had their lives ruined by sports betting. And this was legal sports betting.


In terms of the framework, the processes and the time line for this to be dealt with, could the minister elaborate on when that will take place? Will it be a case of Commonwealth legislation or will it be a case of state-based template legislation with other Commonwealth legislation? I think the concern is that the O'Farrell review did do some genuinely good work—I think it should have gone further, but it did do some good work to deal with these issues—you have had the report of Financial Counselling Australia and you are aware of the previous reports that the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform did back in the time of the Gillard government. What does the minister say will be the progress of that national consumer protection framework that so many in the community are so anxious to be progressed and implemented?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:29):  There is a meeting of gaming ministers on 31 March in Melbourne—I think it is—and the aim is to reach agreement at that meeting on a national framework. It will then be for the Commonwealth and the states and territories to finalise the details of that for a final decision later in the year. The time frame will depend on the implementation model that is chosen, so I cannot give you a definitive date at this time, but I can tell you that the intention and the objective is to reach agreement on 31 March on the national framework. The implementation and what legislation may be required and in which parliaments are matters to be determined.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:30):  Do I take it from those comments that this is going to be done by state? Will it be state legislation or Commonwealth legislation? I am not sure whether it will be a combination of state and Commonwealth legislation. If it is going to be a combination of state and Commonwealth legislation, does the government concede that it clearly has the constitutional power, using corporations power, external affairs powers or banking and telecommunications powers to regulate this at a Commonwealth level, effectively, rather than what could be a lowest common denominator with the approach that we are now seeing?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:31):  This is very much being approached as a cooperative and collective endeavour between the Commonwealth, states and territories, who are working together. As I say, 31 March is when gaming ministers meet, and the aim is to reach agreement on the national framework. I cannot pre-empt what the model will be and which legislative avenues will be pursued in which parliaments. Let me reassure you that Minister Tudge, who will be at that meeting, is extremely focused from the Commonwealth's point of view, as am I, in bringing this framework to fruition.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:32):  Does that mean that if one jurisdiction—for instance, the Northern Territory, which makes a bit of money out of this; it seems to be the main place where online bookmakers are licensed because of a very, very—I will not say liberal—laissez-faire licensing regime and very low tax rates so it is a magnet for these overseas online illegal bookmakers—says, 'No, we don't want to go ahead with this', that is the end of the matter? I am concerned that the many good recommendations in the O'Farrell review can easily be stymied if just one jurisdiction that says: 'We do not want to go down this path. We are not prepared to cop it.' Is it the case that just one state or territory can effectively veto the consumer protection framework reform process?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:33):  Let me cite something that might give you cause for optimism. That is the communique of ministers who met on 25 November last year where state and territory ministers met for the first time to discuss their responses to the review of illegal offshore wagering. Ministers did commit, in principle, to bringing a national consumer protection framework into being. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,25,1,speech

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:34):  The communique makes reference to a national consumer protection framework but did it say what the substance or content of that national consumer framework would be? You could call it a national consumer framework but it could have very little of substance or teeth. Was there a commitment, for instance, to implement, at the very least, the recommendations of the O'Farrell review?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:35):  There was. As I said before, when gaming ministers meet on 31 March the objective is to reach agreement on a national framework. The implementation of that, the model that will give effect to it, is something that will need to be worked through.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:35):  For instance, recommendation 6 of the O'Farrell review at page 154 states: 


Operators should be required to apply additional consumer protections where ‘credit’ or deferred settlement betting is available.


It does not say what those additional measures are. This is one example. Could the minister comment on that? Recommendation 7 states: 


Links between online wagering operators and payday and other lenders should be discouraged.


'Discouraged' does not sound like a legislative enforcement, so I query that as well. Recommendation 4 states: 


A national self-exclusion register that applies across all online operators should be developed, either by an expansion of the Northern Territory register or through a new national system. The costs associated with such a register should be borne by online operators. 


With recommendation 4, through you Chairman, I think many would consider the Northern Territory register largely ineffective. 'Developing a self-exclusion register' does not mean it will be implemented. I am worried that the wording of the O'Farrell review, whilst well intended, is quite vague. If it is only going as far as that, it could be that we get recommendations to discourage something but that it does not actually have any legislative teeth to do some good in terms of reducing consumer harm.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:37):  The Commonwealth and the state ministers have actually gone further than the O'Farrell review recommendation in relation to the prohibition of lines of credit being offered. The prohibition of lines of credit being offered by online wagering providers is in the communique of 25 November 2016. The communique also commits to a national self-exclusion register for online wagering and goes to the discouraging of links between online wagering operators and payday lenders.

That is certainly something that is happening. Let me point out that, during the October 2016 consultation period, Treasury consulted with 10 external stakeholders, including the Australian Bankers' Association, MasterCard, Visa and the Australian Payments Clearing Association as well as government agencies.

 (7) Schedule 1, item 139, page 34 (line 18), at the end of subsection 64D(1), add:


; (j) section 61GA.


These amendments are being moved separately. My colleagues in the Senate will note that I have a number of amendments moved that mirror in many respects the legislation I previously moved in this place as a private senator's bill that my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore has co-sponsored. These amendments relate to the provision of credit. They relate to the banning of the provision of credit. The reason I am moving them separately is that, in the context of the debate in the House of Representatives, the Hon. Julie Collins when addressing the amendments moved by my colleague the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie MP, said:


In my speech in the second reading debate I indicated that Labor does support a ban on credit betting—or lines of credit, as the minister referred to them. I have indicated that if the Nick Xenophon Team were to move that part of these amendments in the other place then we would look to supporting them.


So that is why I have moved them. I think the ALP, the opposition, is not minded to support other amendments. We can debate that later. But, in terms of these amendments in respect of credit betting, there seems to be an indication from the opposition and, I hope, others, including my colleagues the Australian Greens, with whom we have done a lot of work together on online gambling. In fact, with One Nation back in 2001 I remember sitting in the offices of Senator Len Harris and talking to him about those issues. I think I asked Senator Hanson questions when she went to the South Australian Press Club. She may not remember my very forgettable question—what was she going to do on online gambling—but that opened a dialogue which led to a very helpful outcome, at least, to put this on the agenda.


This amendments means that credit should not be provided by wagering services, and 'credit' is defined in 11A of the amendment as:


(a) payment of a debt owed by one person to another is deferred; or


(b) one person incurs a deferred debt to another.


Credit betting is banned. In many jurisdictions in respect of poker machines, the rationale is quite simple: if you give someone credit while they are chasing their losses, that can feed gambling addiction, and that is something that ought to be prohibited. It is a basic and fundamental consumer protection measure. It is a basic and fundamental measure to tackle gambling addiction, and that is why this amendment has been moved—and I am grateful for the indication of support from the opposition, the Australian Labor Party, in relation to this. I believe we need to go much further, but this is a good start, because banning credit betting will go some way towards preventing those operators from offering credit betting, which can fuel gambling addiction. 


I was involved in a matter in Victoria where I had to appear pro bono as a lawyer several years ago for a person who did credit betting. The betting agency involved eventually did the right thing. The person had lost their home, and they were declared bankrupt, as I recollect. We ended up getting the bankruptcy reversed and the person's home returned, including stamp duty being paid. But that was driven by credit betting. There were real questions there about the capacity of that person to make those bets, and that was why we were able to reverse that transaction, that very traumatic set of circumstances. I still get Christmas cards all these years later from the mother of the person involved, who lives in Melbourne. This is a live issue. It is a big issue, and I would urge all my colleagues to support this.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:57):  I have a number of questions for the minister before amendments are dealt with. I make reference, perhaps as a reference point, to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's report on this bill. The minister's second reading speech on the bill explained:


The review—


the O'Farrell review, as it is known, into the Interactive Gambling Act—


found that the amount of money being spent on illegal wagering services could be as high as $400 million annually with a further $100 million in lost taxation revenue and product fees.


There does not seem to be any firm view on the amount of money actually lost. Some figures you hear are $500 million and other figures go much higher than that. Does the Commonwealth have the ability to be more specific about these figures? For instance, if it obtained the cooperation of banks in terms of other mechanisms of measuring the amount that goes offshore—because presumably most of these transactions are occurring using credit cards and other discernible transactions—surely there ought to be some way of measuring more accurately the extent of the problem of these illegal offshore gambling sites.

Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Dastyari is familiar with who I am referring to. Has the government considered measures to more accurately measure the amount of money that goes to illegal wagering services? For instance, has the government inquired of the banks or financial institutions to determine by virtue of the merchant numbers for these illegal, overseas, online gambling operations, to determine the amount lost in that way? Has an effort been made? Has anyone in the Commonwealth, whether it be ACMA or the AFP, gone to the banks to say, 'Please cooperate with us. Here are the merchant numbers of Casino.com and Lottoland.com'—well, presumably Lottoland.com operates under a licence from the Northern Territory—'and those that are clearly unauthorised illegal transactions under the Interactive Gambling Act 2001'?

Are you saying that, in the 16 years this bill has been enforced, including its prohibition of illegal, overseas online gambling operations, there has been no attempt to determine with some degree of specificity and some degree of rigor the amount of money actually lost to these online sites? If so, why not? If the government is planning to do it now, what actual measures will it take to do so?

Reference was made to it in the O'Farrell review, and I was fortunate enough to sit down with Mr O'Farrell as part of that review and give him my views and that was fed into the report, but it does not seem to be the case that there are any measures to deal with this. My colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore refers to page 150 of the O'Farrell review which says:


Commonwealth, State and Territory governments should recommit to Gambling Research Australia to ensure that research funds are directed towards maximising the information available to policy makers, academics, the community and industry about the nature, prevalence and impact of gambling across Australia.


That is a very broad recommendation, but what concrete, practical, rigorous measures is the government proposing to determine the level of offshore gambling?


There is an estimate of $500 million. For all we know, it could be $1 billion. It could be $200 million or any figure that you could pluck out of thin air. Surely, if it is expected that the vast majority of these transactions occur with credit cards or can be discernible and traceable through banks and financial institutions and credit card providers, then surely we should—I am just trying to understand if the government is prepared to commit to going down that path. Presumably there might be some people using bitcoins. We can probably guess or estimate how many people would be using bitcoins, but I imagine it would be a very small part of it. I think it is not unreasonable to ask, after 16 years of the operation of this act, to understand where that figure of $400 million comes from. What rigor would be employed to determine once and for all, with some degree of specificity, how much is actually being lost to these offshore sites?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:05):  The first point to make is that this is not a measurement bill. This is a bill about acting on the problem, which it does. The O'Farrell review indicated that losses are between the range of $64 million and $400 million. I have already indicated that the Commonwealth will be looking to commission further research. Senator Xenophon, your propositions as to how to help achieve the most accurate figure are, of course, ones that are very welcome.

Can I just go to a point raised in 1.4 of the Senate committee's report in terms of this bill: 


… there is uncertainty around the legality of services under the IGA and enforcement has been minimal, with no prosecutions since the legislation was enacted in 2001 'despite a considerable number of complaints made by Australians in relation to illegal online gambling services'.


That is something that the Hon. Alan Tudge, a minister in the other place, made reference to in the Hansard on 10 November 2016. Can the minister advise how many complaints have been made since the inception of the act? And can he advise that there have not been any prosecutions under the Interactive Gambling Act at all after 16 years of operation?

I know laws come into effect when laws come into effect, but are you saying that for matters that occurred prior to the passage of this bill, the royal assent of this bill, the existing penalty provisions are extant? Or does it mean that it is not retrospective in the sense that the offence is still there, but there is a different penalty regime that applies at the time you make the complaint? I am just trying to understand how that would work. I do not want to labour the point any more than this, but it is important to make that clear for the constituents that we have that approach us about these problems.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:11):  I am a bit rusty on my criminal procedure—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Back
):  This is not evident up to this point, Senator Xenophon, but it might become so.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Yes. I think I did criminal procedure in 1981. Minister Tudge, in his contribution in the House of Representatives, said on 10 November 2016:


Criminal prosecution is considered likely to be unsuccessful or ineffective due to the competing priorities of the Australian Federal Police, uncertainty around the legality of services under the—


IGA—


evidence requirements and the offshore location of gambling operators.


That was in the context of why there had not been any prosecutions for those offshore gambling operators.


Minister, given the track record of zero prosecutions since 2001, how can we be confident that what is proposed here will actually lead to prosecutions? Given the occasions that I and my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore have made complaints to ACMA and to the AFP, they just seem to be either gathering dust or not a priority for them even though we have instances where people have been devastated financially. We have heard from the Financial Counselling Australia report that I referred to, that Senator Roberts very articulately referred to, about the devastating effects on people's lives as a result of the enormous losses they have sustained. What assurances do we have that we are not going to be revisiting this bill in 16 years time, when I am long gone from this place, when the minister may still be here as the grey eminence of the Senate—




Senator Fifield:
  I am grey already!




Senator XENOPHON:
  Or greyer eminence of the Senate, to tell us that—




Senator Dastyari:
  Papa Smurf!




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Dastyari said 'Papa Smurf', which is very unkind to smurfs. Can the minister advise us: how can we be assured that this is not just another piece of legislation that will sit there and be pretty much ineffective?

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2017-03-20,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:14):  This legislation introduces a simple test—that is, an operator is illegal if they are not licensed in an Australian state or territory.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:14):  But how different is that from the existing test? Is the minister saying that the evidentiary requirements are somehow lessened or somehow eased? There seems to be a big issue here about the willingness of ACMA, and particularly the AFP, to tackle these issues because they have other priorities. They deal with many, many other issues. I am not being critical of the AFP per se, but it seems that this has not been a priority for them, particularly when you consider that lives have been ruined because of these offshore illegal sites. Of course, they have been by the legal sites as well, but it is the illegal sites that we are looking at now.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:15):  The evidentiary requirements for civil prosecutions are lower. In ACMA, we would have an active regulator. I think it is well known to colleagues that the AFP has competing priorities. The fact that there is an active regulator focused on this and with the greater ease of the application of civil penalties the government is confident that this will be a framework that will work.

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (21:16):  We understand that the bill currently before the Senate deals with online and, in particular, offshore gaming. A couple of weeks ago, a bill introduced by my colleague Senator Xenophon, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Sports Betting Reform) Bill 2015, was the subject of a public hearing in Melbourne. Evidence during that committee by Tabcorp showed that they are in fact rolling out land-based electronic betting terminals to spring and autumn racing carnivals and that those terminals, in fact, already exist in some sports stadiums across Australia.


The Nick Xenophon Team has some serious concerns in relation to these terminals. I understand it is separate to the bill being considered here to a certain degree; but given the harm that we know is caused by online sports betting and online gambling, can you advise whether or not the government is looking at incorporating the consideration of harm minimisation measures relating to land-based gambling as part of the national consumer protection framework that is currently under discussion?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2,speech

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (21:18):  Given that the harms caused by gambling, whether pokies or online gambling, are largely the same—in that there are devastating consequences for a person's finances, possibly for their marriage and for their ability to pay their mortgage—and that the government is in active consideration of a national consumer protection framework, why then aren't land-based betting services and harm minimisation techniques applicable to those services currently under consideration?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:18):  The harm minimisation framework being worked on with the states and territories relates to online, not land-based, services. These place-based elements are matters that fall under state and territory jurisdiction, but the framework is focused on online. That is the reason.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:19):  I will just go back to the issue of the new burden of proof. It will be a balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt, and it will be dealt with by ACMA. Given that there could well be a flood of complaints if it seems that there is more of a prospect that there will be action taken, what additional resources are being provided to ACMA to deal with what could be a significant number of complaints? If there is an actual flood of complaints, given the number of people who are hurt by these illegal offshore gambling sites, will the government undertake to make sure that these matters are dealt with and that complaints are not abandoned by virtue of a lack of resources on the part of ACMA?

Senator Fifield:
  I cannot tell you what is in the budget is what it means.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Okay, you cannot tell me what is the budget. Do you know what is in the budget? In relation to these matters, if you are looking at fining an offshore gambling operation—if it is Malta, Gibraltar, somewhere in the Caribbean or wherever they may be; I am not sure of this Uzbekistan is big on online gambling, and I apologise to the Uzbekistan if they are not—does the government say that they have the ability to pursue those companies and to obtain any monetary penalties from them given that they are based overseas? What undertakings will the government be able to obtain from those countries where these online gambling operations are based?


In some cases they may have an office in a place like the United Kingdom or a European country, but they are based in another jurisdiction. Trying to obtain a prosecution fine from these companies that have all sorts of complex and labyrinthine arrangements—has that been factored into the sorts of resources that ACMA will use? And is it expected that ACMA will prosecute these companies that may have operations in Gibraltar but a head office in London? How will it actually work? Or will they target any other operations they have in other countries—and I am talking about the illegal operations at this stage?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:22):  There are relationships between Australian agencies and counterpart agencies in overseas jurisdictions.




Senator Xenophon:
  Not all, though!




Senator FIFIELD:
  Well, there are many countries in the world. There will probably be the need to go through what the individual relationships are between Australia and each jurisdiction. I should also mention that we do have—as you know, Senator—as part of this legislation the capacity to notify the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of people who may be directors in these foreign countries, to place them on an alert list. There are also other disruptive measures. The amendments also extend the ambit of enforcement to affiliates and agents. Someone illegal operators engage a network of Australian-based agents and affiliates to recruit customers, so there is a greater capacity to deal with these individuals.


But you are right: the fact that some activities take place in foreign countries where there might not necessarily be those sorts of relationships with other agencies can prove to be an issue. But Australia is always working on ensuring that we have those good relationships where we can with partner agencies overseas.

The 'place-based betting service' exemption in proposed section 8BA is intended to permit betting services, including potentially in-play betting services, to be provided on electronic equipment (which may include easy betting terminals and/or tablets) made available to customers in places such as TABs, casinos and clubs.


Will the government undertake to conduct modelling or any other monitoring or review of whether this provision leads to an uptake in betting activity and problem gambling behaviour due to the increased availability of these electronic devices in TABs, casinos and clubs?

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:27):  Chair, I think that you and the minister may be pleased to know that this is my final line of questioning before I seek to move amendments on the running sheet!


The minister made reference in his closing remarks on the bill that there is going to be a national consumer protection framework in respect of online gambling. There were many recommendations made in the O'Farrell review and the minister is no doubt aware of Financial Counselling Australia's recommendations in relation to dealing with these issues. I know that Senator Roberts did outline a number of cases from that report that were quite horrendous stories of people who had lost life savings, who had been devastated financially and who had their lives ruined by sports betting. And this was legal sports betting.


In terms of the framework, the processes and the time line for this to be dealt with, could the minister elaborate on when that will take place? Will it be a case of Commonwealth legislation or will it be a case of state-based template legislation with other Commonwealth legislation? I think the concern is that the O'Farrell review did do some genuinely good work—I think it should have gone further, but it did do some good work to deal with these issues—you have had the report of Financial Counselling Australia and you are aware of the previous reports that the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform did back in the time of the Gillard government. What does the minister say will be the progress of that national consumer protection framework that so many in the community are so anxious to be progressed and implemented?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:29):  There is a meeting of gaming ministers on 31 March in Melbourne—I think it is—and the aim is to reach agreement at that meeting on a national framework. It will then be for the Commonwealth and the states and territories to finalise the details of that for a final decision later in the year. The time frame will depend on the implementation model that is chosen, so I cannot give you a definitive date at this time, but I can tell you that the intention and the objective is to reach agreement on 31 March on the national framework. The implementation and what legislation may be required and in which parliaments are matters to be determined.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:30):  Do I take it from those comments that this is going to be done by state? Will it be state legislation or Commonwealth legislation? I am not sure whether it will be a combination of state and Commonwealth legislation. If it is going to be a combination of state and Commonwealth legislation, does the government concede that it clearly has the constitutional power, using corporations power, external affairs powers or banking and telecommunications powers to regulate this at a Commonwealth level, effectively, rather than what could be a lowest common denominator with the approach that we are now seeing?

As I say, 31 March is when gaming ministers meet, and the aim is to reach agreement on the national framework. I cannot pre-empt what the model will be and which legislative avenues will be pursued in which parliaments. Let me reassure you that Minister Tudge, who will be at that meeting, is extremely focused from the Commonwealth's point of view, as am I, in bringing this framework to fruition.

I am concerned that the many good recommendations in the O'Farrell review can easily be stymied if just one jurisdiction that says: 'We do not want to go down this path. We are not prepared to cop it.' Is it the case that just one state or territory can effectively veto the consumer protection framework reform process?

That is the communique of ministers who met on 25 November last year where state and territory ministers met for the first time to discuss their responses to the review of illegal offshore wagering.

It does not say what those additional measures are. This is one example. Could the minister comment on that? Recommendation 7 states: 


Links between online wagering operators and payday and other lenders should be discouraged.


'Discouraged' does not sound like a legislative enforcement, so I query that as well. Recommendation 4 states: 


A national self-exclusion register that applies across all online operators should be developed, either by an expansion of the Northern Territory register or through a new national system. The costs associated with such a register should be borne by online operators. 


With recommendation 4, through you Chairman, I think many would consider the Northern Territory register largely ineffective. 'Developing a self-exclusion register' does not mean it will be implemented. I am worried that the wording of the O'Farrell review, whilst well intended, is quite vague. If it is only going as far as that, it could be that we get recommendations to discourage something but that it does not actually have any legislative teeth to do some good in terms of reducing consumer harm.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (21:37):  The Commonwealth and the state ministers have actually gone further than the O'Farrell review recommendation in relation to the prohibition of lines of credit being offered. The prohibition of lines of credit being offered by online wagering providers is in the communique of 25 November 2016. The communique also commits to a national self-exclusion register for online wagering and goes to the discouraging of links between online wagering operators and payday lenders.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:38):  Recommendation 11 says that the national policy framework should include consistent, enforceable rules about advertising of online gambling. Recommendation 12 says the national policy framework should ensure that advertising of online services using social digital media platforms is subject to similar regulatory controls as other media. Does that mean that there will actually be prohibitions in relation to that? There is a certain vagueness there. Has the ministerial council determined something more stringent than what was recommended in the O'Farrell review?

 (South Australia) (21:39):  Recommendation 18 says that Treasury and other relevant agencies should work with banks and credit card providers to identify potential payment-blocking strategies to disrupt illegal offshore wagering. Additionally, the recommendation from the 2012 DBCDE review of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 relating to safe harbour provisions should be adopted to support these efforts. Has Treasury undertaken any work to date with banks and credit card providers to identify potential payment-blocking strategies? That is something recommended in the O'Farrell review.

The Commonwealth Treasury is indeed leading the implementation of the response to recommendation 18 of the O'Farrell review, which, as you pointed out, committed to consult with banks and credit card providers to assess the potential options and practicality of payment-blocking strategies to address illegal offshore wagering. That is certainly something that is happening. Let me point out that, during the October 2016 consultation period, Treasury consulted with 10 external stakeholders, including the Australian Bankers' Association, MasterCard, Visa and the Australian Payments Clearing Association as well as government agencies.

These amendments are being moved separately. My colleagues in the Senate will note that I have a number of amendments moved that mirror in many respects the legislation I previously moved in this place as a private senator's bill that my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore has co-sponsored. These amendments relate to the provision of credit. They relate to the banning of the provision of credit. The reason I am moving them separately is that, in the context of the debate in the House of Representatives, the Hon. Julie Collins when addressing the amendments moved by my colleague the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie MP, said:


In my speech in the second reading debate I indicated that Labor does support a ban on credit betting—or lines of credit, as the minister referred to them. I have indicated that if the Nick Xenophon Team were to move that part of these amendments in the other place then we would look to supporting them.


So that is why I have moved them. I think the ALP, the opposition, is not minded to support other amendments. We can debate that later. But, in terms of these amendments in respect of credit betting, there seems to be an indication from the opposition and, I hope, others, including my colleagues the Australian Greens, with whom we have done a lot of work together on online gambling. In fact, with One Nation back in 2001 I remember sitting in the offices of Senator Len Harris and talking to him about those issues. I think I asked Senator Hanson questions when she went to the South Australian Press Club. She may not remember my very forgettable question—what was she going to do on online gambling—but that opened a dialogue which led to a very helpful outcome, at least, to put this on the agenda.


This amendments means that credit should not be provided by wagering services, and 'credit' is defined in 11A of the amendment as:


(a) payment of a debt owed by one person to another is deferred; or


(b) one person incurs a deferred debt to another.


Credit betting is banned. In many jurisdictions in respect of poker machines, the rationale is quite simple: if you give someone credit while they are chasing their losses, that can feed gambling addiction, and that is something that ought to be prohibited. It is a basic and fundamental consumer protection measure. It is a basic and fundamental measure to tackle gambling addiction, and that is why this amendment has been moved—and I am grateful for the indication of support from the opposition, the Australian Labor Party, in relation to this. I believe we need to go much further, but this is a good start, because banning credit betting will go some way towards preventing those operators from offering credit betting, which can fuel gambling addiction. 


I was involved in a matter in Victoria where I had to appear pro bono as a lawyer several years ago for a person who did credit betting. The betting agency involved eventually did the right thing. The person had lost their home, and they were declared bankrupt, as I recollect. We ended up getting the bankruptcy reversed and the person's home returned, including stamp duty being paid. But that was driven by credit betting. There were real questions there about the capacity of that person to make those bets, and that was why we were able to reverse that transaction, that very traumatic set of circumstances. I still get Christmas cards all these years later from the mother of the person involved, who lives in Melbourne. This is a live issue. It is a big issue, and I would urge all my colleagues to support this.

Fewer people will go broke, fewer people will go bankrupt and fewer people will lose their homes. Credit betting should not be allowed under any circumstances.

It is rapacious conduct on the part of gambling operators to offer credit betting, particularly to people who have no prospect of paying it back unless they end up selling their assets. I would urge the government to reconsider its position. I know that my colleague Senator O'Neill wishes to contribute to the debate.

Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (21:56):  I rise tonight to make a contribution about a remarkable Tasmanian who, sadly, passed away the weekend before last. The Tasmanian I am talking about is Dr John Morris AO, MBE, who also happens to be the father of one of my closest friends. The Launceston Examiner newspaper, in a tribute to Dr Morris, recently described him as 'Launceston's champion of medical research'. Tasmanians, particularly those from the Launceston district, would know very well why he earned that moniker. Our very own President of the Senate, through his extensive involvement in matters of medical research, particularly in the north-west, knows about Dr Morris's involvement in the Clifford Craig medical research foundation and trust as the founding chairman of the foundation.


The foundation was established in 1992 and since its inception has provided in excess of $4 million of funding to over 100 medical research projects. Read through the list of amazing research achievements of the foundation. It is a testament to Dr Morris's contribution to medical research not just in my own community of Tasmania but nationally. As a Tasmanian, it makes me proud to go through some of the things on that list.


To begin with, there was the breakthrough research to control hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heart abnormality that is inherited by one in 500 people and is the cause of sudden death in many young people. There was also the kidney research which is now recognised as world's best practice. The Glaucoma Inheritance Study in Tasmania was voted the world's best eye research at the European Glaucoma Society congress in Paris. Finally, the research into iron deficiency anaemia, or IDA, in pregnant women by Dr Al Khalafallah and Dr Amanda Dennis is being taken up internationally and now forms part of the British guidelines for treatment. These are just a few very brief examples of the work undertaken by this foundation of which Dr Morris was the founding chair—and a proud contribution to medical research from the great state of Tasmania.


I have it on very good authority that Dr Morris was absolutely certain that we could have a first-rate medical research organisation, and it would be feasible to have it in a major regional teaching hospital—that is, outside of one of our capitals, where medical services are often in abundance. With our regionally dispersed population in Tasmania, this was especially critical. Indeed, its regional location has been informative with regard to the types of work the foundation has supported, namely the medical and health issues facing Australians living in regional and remote areas. The establishment of this foundation and the amazing and, indeed, life improving, if not lifesaving work it has undertaken is just one element of the contributions that Dr John Morris made with his life.


Dr Morris fits into that category that so few people do: a real contributor. He was a contributor to the community; someone working for the public good. It was true public service. As I have said, the list of achievements only begins with the Clifford Craig Foundation. In his 70 years of true public service, Dr Morris's work traversed a great variety of areas. At the extremely young age of 20, the then Mr Morris was a demonstrator in zoology at the University of Tasmania. He later served in a number of roles in a number of medical and related bodies in the state and across the country. He served as the president of the Medical Council of Tasmania and as chairman of the National Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee. He was also a visiting physician to the Launceston General Hospital for 40 years. He was the chairman of the Department of Medicine at LGH and chairman of the LGH Historical Committee. Twice he was the state chairman of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians—not once, but twice. He was also the president of the Tasmanian Branch of the Australian Medical Association.


In the field of education, again demonstrating his firm commitment to improving the lives of others, he served as the chairman of the Oakburn College Council. He was also the founding chairman of the Scotch Oakburn College Council—




Senator Bushby:
  A good school!




Senator DUNIAM:
  A very good school, Senator Bushby, indeed. He was also the president of the Association of Independent Schools of Tasmania.


 Dr Morris was also heavily involved—just to demonstrate the varied roles he occupied over this period of public service—as the joint founder of the Launceston Lifelink, which has operated a telephone counselling service in Tasmania for many years. It was later to become known as Lifelink Samaritans. This entity has been a great service to the Tasmanian community, providing support to many Tasmanians in their times of need over a great many years. As a committed Christian, Dr Morris also served as a member of the Anglican synod in the Diocese of Tasmania.


Finally, looking at his long list of achievements, Dr Morris was also the president of the Royal Society of Tasmania, an organisation dedicated to the advancement of knowledge historical, scientific and technological. Additionally, Dr Morris was published with two books and he was also published in many medical and historical journals. One interesting fact I learned in doing my research on Dr Morris, this great Tasmanian, that not many people would know, is that Dr Morris described the taxonomy of a pseudoscorpion native to the Cataract Gorge in the Launceston area and which was named for him by the British Museum.


Dr Morris's efforts span a long period of time and a great many areas, but they were recognised during his life. He was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List of 1985 for services to medicine and to the community. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on Australia Day 2001 for services to medicine, particularly as a consultant physician, and to the community through education, medical research and social welfare organisations.


Dr Morris was a loving father and a committed Christian, observing his faith in every element of his life. As the father of five children, a committed husband and a community leader it is clear that he personified the Christian value of service to others. I am proud of the fact that our state delivers strongly in the area of research and innovation in many fields, though it is often not reported. Dr Morris's work is a feature in our state's proud history and his legacy is one we must remember. Dr Morris's son, Don, will be known to many in this place. On behalf of the Tasmanian contingent here in the federal parliament—my colleagues Liberal, Labor and Green, and including you, Mr President—I would like to extend condolences to Don and his family at the passing of his father, this remarkable Tasmanian, who has left such a tremendous legacy in the community and in his profession.
