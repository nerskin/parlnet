Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (09:02):  Can I on this last day of sittings for 2013 acknowledge that it is the last day of the parliament sitting when the Clerk will be in his current position. We look forward to commenting on his long service later on in the day.


I rise to close the debate on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. I would like to thank all the members for their contributions to the debate. The recent HSU scandals, as well as the slush funds in the Transport Workers Union; the Australian Workers Union; the National Union of Workers; the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union; the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association; the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union; and the Electrical Trades Union shows us that a stronger compliance regime and a more effective regulator, as introduced by this bill, are absolutely essential.


Many registered organisations control assets worth millions of dollars. They are effectively dealing with cash flow and investments similar to those of large businesses. Consequently, members of unions, employer associations and the community want and deserve to have confidence that their registered organisations are being properly regulated and will be subject to swift action in the event of any wrongdoing.


This bill establishes the independent Registered Organisations Commission and provides it with robust investigative and information gathering powers. It enables the commission to educate and provide advice to registered organisations and their members.


The bill also introduces stronger reporting and disclosure requirements for organisations and their officers, significantly higher civil penalties as well as a number of criminal penalties. These penalties are in line with those facing companies and directors under the Corporations Act. The government firmly believes that there should be alignment between the maximum penalties levied against a company director who misuses shareholder funds and the boss of a registered organisation who misuses members' money.


Labor has failed to explain why the principle 'same crime, same time' should not apply in this instance. Confusingly, most Labor members who have spoken on the debate have stated that the amendments brought in by the Labor Party in 2012 went far enough, before going on to take task with four issues: that the disclosure requirements for officers of registered organisations are too invasive and go further than the Corporations Act; that the disclosure requirements for officers of registered organisations include the reporting of family members' income and assets; that the disclosure requirements for officers of registered organisations capture the whole governing body and need to be reported to the entire membership; and that there is no discretion on the training for officers.


Members opposite would be interested to learn that all of these requirements were contained in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill circulated earlier this year by the authority of the then minister, the member for Maribyrnong. To assist those opposite let me quote the member for Maribyrnong in introducing that bill. He said:


This bill will require the rules of registered organisations to provide for the disclosure of remuneration, including board fees, of the five highest paid officials of the organisation as well as the two highest paid in each branch, to the members of the organisation. Determining the five highest paid officials will be based upon monetary remuneration rather than non-cash benefits. However, where an official's remuneration is required to be disclosed, that disclosure will require non-cash benefits paid to the official to be identified.


He went on to say:


Under the amendments proposed by the government—


Meaning the then government—


registered organisations will be required to amend their rules to provide for the disclosure of transactions between the organisation and related parties, which may include the family members of officials.


He said further:


To improve financial literacy within registered organisations, the rules of organisations will require each officer whose duties relate to the financial management of the organisation or the branch as the case may be to undertake approved training relating to the officials' financial management obligations. 


So that it assists the members opposite, I would like to table an outline of those provisions of the previous government's legislation and how they are dealt with in the current bill that has been prepared. The government recognises the concerns that have been expressed by stakeholders about these requirements, which will come into effect on 1 January next year, courtesy of the member for Maribyrnong's bill, and will actively consider how to clean up his mess.


Importantly, the Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment, in a report tabled on 2 December this year, made a number of recommendations in this regard that the government will actively consider. We welcome the opposition's expression of concerns about the member for Maribyrnong's drafting but suggest that those concerns should have been raised in the Labor caucus when the member for Maribyrnong sought to rush the bill through the parliament.


Opposition members have suggested that the new penalties will mean that they will have difficulty persuading people to take on official responsibilities. The government does not agree. Let me be very clear: the only people who have anything to worry about are dodgy union bosses or dodgy employer association bosses who do the wrong thing. The government believes that enhanced reporting and disclosure requirements will not do the job if they are not consistently and strongly enforced and the penalties for wrongdoing are not high enough to act as a deterrent.


The need for increased penalties has been recently noted in the comments by Federal Court Justice Anthony North, who is reported to have said that he was unhappy at the relatively small penalties on offer, particularly in relation to the cost of court proceedings. He said, 'The penalties are rather beneficially low; beneficial to wrongdoers.' Officers who are operating within the law, which is the overwhelming majority of them will continue to take on official responsibilities. The overwhelming number of officers who are already doing the right thing should be comforted in knowing that unlawful behaviour will be effectively dealt with, thus ensuring ongoing confidence in registered organisations as a whole.


Before concluding, I will point out once again that the coalition's policy has been supported by union bosses such as Paul Howes and Chris Brown as well as former ACTU secretaries Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson. Labor today will vote against this bill and against providing greater accountability and transparency to registered organisations. Instead of backing union members and those who do the right thing, the Labor Party will be backing dodgy union bosses who break the law and betray the trust of members. The government firmly believes that the bill sets the high standard that is essential for the governance and regulation of registered organisations and that passage of this legislation will be beneficial to registered organisations, their members and the Australian community. I thank all members for their participation in the debate. I table the schedules from the bill introduced by the member for Maribyrnong.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-12-12,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:28):  I rise today to speak strongly against the government's desperate and misguided actions to return to the former Australian Building and Construction Commission, the ABCC, set up by the former Howard Liberal government in 2005, via the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013.


I should declare up-front that, whilst I do not work in the building industry I have three brothers who all work in the building industry. One brother actually worked on the construction of Parliament House, when the big flag fell over 25 years ago. People may remember; I am sure the Clerk would remember. I know he is only a fresh young face here in Parliament House but he might remember when the flagpole fell over. My brother's company works in cranes. They were actually working down at the Canberra casino at that time, so he came to fix the flagpole that fell over. Another one of my brothers, my younger brother—all three of my brothers work in the construction industry—had a crane collapse right beside him while he was working at Twin Towns. The kibble on the crane injured his back significantly when the crane collapsed. But the most traumatic part of that accident was that two of his friends who were standing right beside him were killed. He was literally only inches away from being killed. So I have seen the building industry via the prism of my siblings and what they have and are experiencing, because all three of them still work in the industry.


Much of the bill before the chamber today largely replicates the former ABCC legislation, which was then amended by the Rudd-Gillard government through the Fair Work (Building Industry) Act. I am particularly outraged by this piece of legislation. It is tough enough when we have legislation that we just voted on, before this current piece of legislation, that took away a pay rise for people in the aged-care industry. We have seen a pay rise snatched away from the childcare workers and now we have an extra imposition on the building industry.


This legislation is wrong for so many reasons. It certainly introduced an element of retrospectivity into this area of law. Retrospectivity is never a good idea, especially from a government where so many of the promises from the now Prime Minister were that there would be no surprises and no excuses. To suddenly reach back into the past with this legislation is very disappointing. Retrospectivity should never be embraced in legislation.


The coalition government's claim is that their bill is strengthening the powers of the ABCC, but in fact it is restricting business certainty. It is creating a lot of uncertainty for small businesses that work in the building industry. It is actually imposing extra red tape from a government that said they were going to abolish red tape. They are not only bringing in future red tape but imposing red tape on past decisions, which is the very worst sort of legislation. They are proposing some sort of watchdog, but it is really just an attack dog on unions, not dissimilar to those attack dogs we saw down on the waterfront under the MUA dispute years ago. The reason it is particularly offensive is that, even when the people involved in employment in the building area have reached agreement and signed on to an agreement, now the government of today proposes to reach back. This is the very enemy of contract law, as all lawyers would know. And these changes are actually a waste of taxpayers' money, because of this extra red tape.


The changes will result in the ABCC using public funds to engage lawyers to continue litigation where the parties have already reached certainty and have an agreement. This is just a simple regurgitation of failed Howard government policies. This is yet another example of the Abbott government living in the past.


Looking at the brochure sent to my home by my opponent during the election—his 'Real Solutions' booklet—included in the visuals the words 'this is an experienced team'. I remember the photograph. I think I even saw it on a few billboards—'this is an experienced team'. They even were generous enough to put the member for Wentworth in the photograph so that there was a token Liberal in this hard-nosed team that was supposed to be experienced. As it turned out, what we have seen in the last 100 days, sadly, is the stumblings of amateurs.


Australia as a nation must look to the future. We need to be concerned about the future of jobs, the future of economic growth, especially in an environment where the dollar is high and puts pressure on our export industries and manufacturing, particularly, as we have seen with the disaster announced yesterday of Holden committing to leave the country. It was obviously not helped by the $500 million slashed from the automotive industry, as proposed by one of those members of the 'Real Solutions' team, the former member for Indi.


I have heard a bit of comment about mandates. I would have thought that, if your shadow automotive minister is the person who represents your policy in the automotive industry and they are the only Liberal shadow who is not elected, surely that suggests you have no authority to implement that policy. That would have been my suggestion.


The government understand political tactics but I do not think they understand the needs of Australian people, and they certainly do not know how to consult with building workers and how to consult with the people who actually turn up at the workplace every day.


Sadly, the coalition has a history of removing the rights from workers in this country, particularly in the building industry. I remember Ark Tribe—I think the member for Makin, being a South Australian, would be more familiar with the situation—




Mr Zappia:
  In 2008.




Mr PERRETT:
  It was 2008. I remember reading information about it. The reversal of the onus of proof is something that any government should always be very wary of. The Magna Carta has been around for a while. We have this long history of looking after rights, so to reverse the onus of proof in such an area should be done very carefully. There is an argument that coercive powers, such as Ark Tribe experienced, have no place in a free society. This government is now extending the ABCC's ability to interrogate workers, causing stress and unnecessary worries for innocent people.


Throughout the federal election campaign, the coalition government, I think, unnecessarily tried to make political mileage out of fatalities. I remember hearing comments, even in parliament, about the deaths that occurred when the insulation program was rolled out around Australia. A total of 1.2 million homes were insulated, but sadly there were some dodgy employers with bad work practices. Look at the mileage that has been made out of those fatalities, despite the 1.2 million homes that were insulated and all of the benefits to those households, both environmentally and for their wallets.


But let us have a look at the building industry. I was speaking to a friend of mine, Andrew Ramsay, from the CFMEU in Queensland. He said—




Mr Tudge:
  Is he a good friend?




Mr PERRETT:
  He is a good friend. He worked on my campaign in 2007.




Mr Tudge:
  I bet he did. How much money did he give you?




Mr PERRETT:
  No money.




Mr Tudge:
  What about the CFMEU?




Mr PERRETT:
  The CFMEU has made contributions to my election campaigns, and I think that they did in 2007.




Mr Tudge:
  How much?




Mr PERRETT:
  It is all on the public record. I do not think that there is any problem with having a connection with workers. I have always seen the Labor Party as being the political wing of the trade union movement. I am not afraid of workers. Unions have a great history of contributing to the good of this nation. That is my belief.


It is interesting to compare. A judicial inquiry was announced into these work related deaths—the insulation deaths. But, since the last fatality of the home insulation scheme, 31 Queenslanders have died in construction related accidents on the job. That is, to put it in context: 31 Queenslanders have died and five of those were electrocuted. There is a comparison. Since the judicial inquiry was announced, there have been 31 deaths. That it is to put it in context. Construction work can be very dangerous work. Construction work is challenging, especially in high-rise buildings, where there can be all sorts of complications.


This bill before the House includes provisions on prohibiting unlawful picket lines and allows anyone to get an injunction to prevent such a picket line happening. This government is clearly pushing to almost outlaw unionism in the construction industry. It is seen to be a bad thing for a union to make a contribution to a political party. That was the suggestion that came from the member opposite. The reality is, Australian workers need unions to fight for their rights and to look after their health and safety. We all know that when an employer tries to make money they will cut back on health and safety, and that makes it dangerous for workers. It is disgraceful to have union officials and members dragged off to the courts, fined and threatened with jail for taking part in union activities that have been a part of the fabric of this nation since the 1890s—since the shearers' strike that we had in Barcaldine in the 1890s that saw the formation of the Labor Party. Why would those opposite be scared of people banding together and speaking up for their rights?


The merits of the ABCC are based on flawed and ridiculous modelling. Its proposed powers are scary, particularly the unfettered coercive powers, the secretive interviews and imprisonment for those who do not cooperate. This is a star chamber that Oliver Cromwell would blanche at. These proposed powers are extreme, unnecessary and undemocratic and they compromise civil liberties.


Let us have a look at the record under Labor. Under the Fair Work Act, after the ABCC went, productivity went up in the building industry. Let us look at the Liberal legislation. After the ABCC was introduced in 2005, building industry fatalities jumped 95 per cent between 2006 and 2008. They had a budget of $35 million, including up to $500,000 a year for the salary of the commissioner. They brought cases against the CFMEU and other unions resulting in over $5 million in fines and millions more in court costs. That was good for lawyers, obviously. As a lawyer, I have no problem with lawyers getting paid, but the reality is that someone will always pay for it when lawyers are involved. The ABCC legislation was condemned eight times by the International Labour Organization for bias and for breaching conventions that Australia has signed. We saw when the judgment in the Ark Tribe case was handed down that they were completely embarrassed due to them not exercising their coercive powers correctly. They were found to have unlawfully interviewed 203 people.


That is why the Gillard and Rudd governments removed the majority of the ABCC's powers. We had the Fair Work Australia model, which is a much fairer system in the workplace. And what did we see? We saw industrial disputes go down. We even saw fatalities go down. I know that we should not refer to fatalities only, but that is a fact. And productivity rose.


Under the Howard government's ABCC, there was no right to silence and the commission possessed national security style powers to prevent a witness from revealing even to his wife or her husband that he or she had been interrogated by the commission. That is crazy stuff from George Orwell's 1984, not modern, progressive Australia. Now the coalition want to reinstate these secretive state police powers. They have not put a logical, coherent, empirical argument as to how this will boost productivity. This government, as we saw from the legislation that we just voted on, cannot be trusted when it comes to looking after workers and workers' rights.


What the construction industry needs is investment. It needs apprenticeships and jobs for Australian residents and citizens. They need to be schooled in health and safety. We do not need another government body determined to undermine industry standards, safety and working conditions such that the rogue and the cowboy will lower the standards and make it harder for those good employers—those good builders who do the right thing—to pay their workers and look after their health and safety. No-one wins the race to the bottom, and the biggest losers will always be the workers.


The government has not put a case that this will improve productivity. There is little evidence that this bill will work. Rather, it is about amplifying false statements about productivity. I ask those opposite to come out to a building site. I can arrange for them to come on site and talk to my family and see what really goes on in the construction industry. (Time expired)

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2013-12-12,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (10:43):  Clearly, this bill has caused concern in the union movement and for the union movement's political arm, the Labor Party. That is not surprising, because it promises to bring back to the building and construction industry two concepts that unions like the CFMEU do not like one bit, and they are productivity and accountability. They hate such terms because they are effectively the opposite of the objectives of the unions in the construction industry. On 7 September, the Australian people went to the polling booths in full knowledge that the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission was part of the policies of a coalition government. It was not being hidden; it was right out there. And now it is happening. This is of course not about Work Choices; this is about productivity and accountability on the building sites of Australia.


There is no greater example of the need for this bill and the reintroduction of the ABCC than the CFMEU's illegal action against construction company Grocon in Melbourne in 2012. If anyone were to say the ABCC and these powers were not now required I would direct them to recent history. Having had the chance to do the right thing, and comply with the law, the CFMEU chose to be militant and contemptuous of the law. In their dispute in Victoria the CFMEU now face the potential of multimillion-dollar fines and legal costs for contempt of court. Grocon has asked the court to impose a $1.5 million fine plus another $400,000 in legal costs after the CFMEU did plead guilty to a third round of contempt charges. Collectively the penalties could amount to more than $7 million because the court has been asked to impose fines of $5 million for other contempt charges resulting from the reckless and illegal blockades that brought Melbourne to a standstill. That recklessness was not only reckless and arrogant in its disregard for the law and court orders but also because the penalties of $7 million will come not out of the pockets of the union's leaders, who somehow thought themselves above the law, but from the members' dues—it is their money.


This is where this country has found itself. A militant union operating beyond the law, determined to destroy productivity, demonstrates exactly why the ABCC needs to be restored. The Labor Party cannot control the CFMEU but that union, drunk with its own sense of importance and power, stood defiantly against the rule of law. Yes, it is true the CFMEU could not be controlled by their political wing, but it is in fact the other way around: from the speakers list, clearly the CFMEU control the Labor Party, no doubt offering the stick and carrot to those opposite—threatening preselections and campaign contributions if the union's servants do not do as the union says.


The CFMEU is of course a repeat offender—and, when judgment is passed upon them, the costs will probably reflect their history of disregard for the law and the national interest of productivity. In Perth the same sort of disregard for getting on with the job was well known. For many years the CFMEU was led by Kevin Reynolds. Apart from getting his wife installed in state parliament as a Labor MLC, there were many deals done across building sites in Perth. A most interesting deal was where Reynolds acquired a luxury apartment in the Raffles Tower in expensive Applecross. The apartment overlooks the Canning River, and I think that the full cost of such an apartment would exceed the means of all but the most highly paid—or perhaps the well-connected, in this case.


In 2007 the Weekend Australian reported that the CFMEU in WA was greatly looking forward to a Rudd victory. The Weekend Australian found that figures showed an extraordinary halt to the union's rogue strikes—including 'blue flu', where hundreds of workers called in sick at once—after the ABCC used its powers to hit unionists with individual writs that could result in fines of up to $28,600 each.


It was a testament to the success of the ABCC that in Western Australia days lost to industrial action in the construction industry fell from 71 days per 1,000 workers in the December quarter of 2004 to just nine in the same quarter of late 2006. In fact, across 2006 there had been 45.2 days lost per 1,000 workers compared with 725 days in 2005.


In 2003 the Cole royal commission found lawlessness widespread in the construction industry. The commission heard that 10 Western Australian construction companies had handed over a combined total of $397,935.48 to the CFMEU in Western Australia for 'casual' union tickets for non-union workers. The commission also found widespread disregard for right-of-entry rules on building sites.


Perhaps in the case of WA and Victoria, the siphoning off of funds generated through 'peace accords'—some may call it blackmailing—of some builders has allowed massive war chests to be accumulated. These funds serve to inoculate the CFMEU against compliance with the law. In the case of Victoria's CFMEU it has been suggested that some $50-plus million has been accumulated in union coffers.


The question now becomes: what does this bill mean for Australians? The ABCC is to be re-established, armed with the powers it previously held to compel the attendance and production of documents. It is also good to see that new limits are imposed on unlawful industrial action and unlawful picketing, backed up by tougher penalties. There is no doubt that the need to restore these arrangements comes because of the absolute need to address what happened with a number of high-profile disputes in the construction industry, most prominently the Grocon event. It is little wonder that the ABCC needs to be brought back given the contempt the CFMEU showed for the courts in that issue.


The bill includes expansions of prohibitions on coercion and discrimination, with reverse-onus provisions to make it easier to prove breaches. A new Building Code will be issued, imposing further obligations on building industry contractors and other participants in the industry as conditions of obtaining work on Commonwealth funded projects.


Being from Western Australia I am also keen on new provisions, not present under the previous ABCC legislation, such as the expanded definition of 'building work' to include the transportation or supply of goods to building sites, including offshore resources platforms. This change will ensure that large resource construction projects, onshore and offshore, cannot be indirectly disrupted through coordinated go-slows on the supply of materials to those projects.


Of course, we are not talking about low pay or conditions at all. The CFMEU WA pattern-bargaining sees tradesmen getting about $140,000 per year, a labourer about $120,000 per year; four weeks leave a year and an additional 10 days of personal leave as well. Furthermore, there are 26 paid rostered days off per year. The working week is a 36-hour week but when overtime kicks in it is paid at double-time, because the usual site hours are around 50 hours a week. There is also very generous income protection that sees employers paying well in excess of $100,000 per year in policy premiums. Beyond their eight weeks paid leave a year, a great imposition on employers is the union training levy of $27 per week per EBA employee. From all reports there is very little training but significant collection of money, with one subcontractor having paid $70,000 in the last 12 months.


I understand that the construction sector has been willing to pay premium wages and conditions in the past, so long as productivity was delivered, but the CFMEU has failed to deliver for many years. Those commercial builders who sign the union EBA suffer a major cost disadvantage compared with those who do not. I emphasise that base wage rates are similar between the union and non-union sectors, but the excessive union allowances, 26 RDOs and insurances are a major difference between the two sectors. Productivity is also higher in the non-union sector.


The industry works on the general rule of thumb that labour costs represent around 50 per cent of total construction for a commercial project, so high labour costs are a major consideration for clients, including the public sector and the private sector. Rents therefore will reflect the costs of construction, and uncompetitive and unproductive union sites will result in higher costs for consumers. Extra costs in WA also include the union-imposed requirement for non-working job stewards on about $150,000 per year, for subcontractors to have safety officers that are paid in excess of $100,000 per year, and for the engagement of union EBA subcontractors only. It therefore revolves around making builders pay for the nepotism and jobs for the mates—or, more accurately, paid positions for the mates of union bosses. All these extra costs, these uncompetitive and unproductive practices, are being supported and applauded by those opposite. This is not the old mantra of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work; rather, this is about fleecing builders and therefore consumers without regard.


The bill provides for the establishment of the ABCC, headed by the commissioner. The commissioner's functions include monitoring and promoting appropriate standards of conduct by participants; investigating suspected contraventions of relevant building laws; instituting or intervening in legal processes; and providing assistance, advice and representation to building industry participants where appropriate. The commission will also have inspectors who can enter premises where they believe breaches of building laws are occurring or likely to occur, or where there are records or documents relevant to compliance purposes on the premises. While on the premises, the inspectors can inspect work, conduct interviews and require the production of records. The bill also restores the 'coercive powers' formerly held by the ABCC. These powers are designed to be 'a key tool for breaking down the historical and unacceptable culture of silence' in the construction sector. The ABCC's exercise of these coercive powers will be overseen by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.


Chapter 5 of the bill contains prohibitions on organising or engaging in 'unlawful industrial action' and 'unlawful picketing'. To be covered by the bill, these prohibited forms of action must be taken by, or in a way that affects, a 'constitutionally covered entity'—that is, a corporation, the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority, a body incorporated in the ACT or the Northern Territory, or a federally registered union or employer organisation. An unlawful picket is action that has the purpose of preventing or restricting a person from accessing or leaving a building site or ancillary site; that directly prevents or restricts a person from accessing or leaving a building site or an ancillary site; or that would reasonably be expected to intimidate a person accessing or leaving a building site or an ancillary site.


The penalties for unlawful industrial action are increased under the bill to $34,000 for individuals and $170,000 for corporate entities. The same penalties apply for unlawful picketing. The government states that these increased penalties are needed to 'act as a deterrent to unlawful behaviour' and 'blatant disregard for court orders'. With the exception of protected industrial action, it is also unlawful to take action to coerce another person to agree or not agree to make, vary or terminate a building enterprise agreement.


In conclusion, I would like to further reinforce the need for this bill to pass. I have talked about the high-profile incidents that make this bill and the re-establishment of the ABCC critical for a return to productivity and competitiveness that the CFMEU is the enemy of. However, to further make this point, I would like to also speak about something of an icon for shoppers in Perth. I speak of the direct factory outlet and discount centre known as Harbour Town. In the construction of Harbour Town some 10 years ago, it was well known in the industry that anyone bringing equipment or furnishings on to the site had to pay to get in. There were particular costs for each item. Apparently, to be allowed by the CFMEU to bring carpet on site was worth a carton of full-strength beer, to be handed in at the gate. And this was not the 1970s; it was not long ago.


To quote a 2009 Federal Court decision against the CFMEU, Justice Gilmour said:


It is of particular concern that the CFMEU, Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan have, as I have found on a prima facie basis, hidden behind spurious concerns as to the health and safety of employees to advance, as I infer, their own unspecified industrial aims. It is the very behaviour which the Commonwealth Parliament has made clear should be eradicated from the building industry in this country. It is conduct that directly undermines the main object of the BCII Act (s 3(1)) which is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole.


The point is that unions such as the CFMEU have been and are responsible for massively increased costs, inefficiencies and the reduction of productivity. Like so many organisations, they have a reckless disregard for the need for businesses to be competitive and efficient. They see any project as a chance to fill the coffers for the union leadership and they just do not get that they are driving businesses overseas through excessive costs.


The ABCC needs to be returned with all these powers to help return accountability, efficiency and productivity to the industry. The CFMEU and construction unions had the chance to be part of the Australian team under their political arm but instead they chose to fleece builders and undermine the economy. Rather than let them carry on, the time to act is now. It is time to restore the ABCC and get the construction industry back to a lawful and effective industry in this country. Whether it is the CFMEU or their Labor Party, those on the other side of politics find that eventually you run out of other people's money to spend. The well is not bottomless, and Australians expect this reckless waste and self-interest to stop. I therefore commend this bill to the House.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2013-12-12,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (10:58):  I rise to oppose the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013. And I oppose it because not a single extra building worker will get home safely because of this bill; not a single extra building worker will avoid losing their entitlements from collapsing companies because of this bill. What will happen is that the 5,000 building workers in my seat of Charlton and nearly one million Australia-wide will lose their fundamental rights. Sadly, this bill is not aimed at productivity, it is not aimed at strengthening the economy; it is aimed at destroying the basic rights of Australian workers, and it is built on a tower of sand. Every single economic fact that I will present in my speech demonstrated that the industry is in good shape, productivity is strong, industrial disputation is down and safety is increasing.


We do not need this bill. This bill is aimed purely at attacking workers and destroying trade unions. It is typical of the Orwellian approach of the new government to title it the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill. Let's look at the industry first. The construction industry is a viable sector of the economy. It has grown strongly over recent years and, with average growth of around 2.9 per cent, it has outgrown other sectors of the economy. It contributes over $100 billion dollars to annual GDP and employs around 900,000 people, which constitutes 7½ per cent of the total workforce. The percentage is even higher in my electorate of Charlton where 8.3 per cent of workers are employed in the construction industry. This represents almost 5,000 workers in my electorate who will be adversely affected by this legislation.


While the government allege that the introduction of this bill will improve productivity, there is no credible evidence to substantiate this claim. It is based on flawed and discredited analysis. Yet again, dodgy research is driving their approach. They have attempted to justify the return of the ABCC by referring to a recent report by consulting firm Independent Economics, a firm formerly known as Econtech. What they will not tell you is that this firm has a long history of churning out report after report which attacks workers and their unions whilst supposedly demonstrating a path to improved productivity. The member for Sturt failed to disclose when he introduced this bill that this consulting firm once had the rare distinction of producing modelling so inaccurate that the former Federal Court judge Murray Wilcox slammed the work as deeply flawed and recommended that it ought to be totally disregarded. This is the factual base that the government rest their justification for this bill on.


But attacking workers does nothing to improve productivity. Productivity improves where workers are guaranteed safe and fair working conditions. This bill, which will reintroduce the ABCC, was never about productivity, nor was it about taming an industry that is out of control. This is a robust industry. There are bad actors on both sides of the industrial landscape in this industry, that is without doubt. But there is no evidence to suggest that disputation in this industry has materially increased in the period since the ABCC was abolished or that the disputation in the construction industry is at historically high levels. Under Labor's Fair Work model, industrial disputation remains comparatively low. So why is it then necessary to make these changes? The truth is that it is not necessary. It is ideologically driven, just like Work Choices was. It was only ever about attacking unions and workers' rights.


Let us look at the origins of this bill. In the second reading speech, the Minister for Workplace Relations, who introduced the original ABCC in 2005, directly referred to unions no fewer than nine times and stated that they were specifically targeted to address union activity. The previous speaker, who is one of the Western Australian members, was very obvious in saying that this bill is designed to attack the CFMEU in particular. To be honest, at least they are not hiding their true colours in their speeches. This bill is now, as it was then, an attack on unions. It is a deliberate and orchestrated attempt to destroy the unions that represent the construction industry. But they have not stopped there. They have extended the definition of 'building work' to include offshore construction and the transport and supply of goods to building sites. This means that these new measures will apply to workers in the maritime industry and the transport industry and could extend to the manufacturing industry. This is another case of this government attacking workers' rights, not just in the construction industry but in every other industry they can get their hands on. This is truly a 'back to the future' time.


The construction workers that I have met in my electorate are hardworking Australians, just like every other worker. They have families and mortgages, and they expect—as they should—a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Most importantly, they expect to return home safely from work. Every worker is entitled to a safe workplace free of injury. I have met families who have been affected by workplace safety incidents and by workplace deaths. It is a tragedy. Even one worker dying at a workplace is one too many. This bill, sadly, does not improve safety—it undermines safety. As I have said before, every worker is entitled to a safe workplace. Unfortunately, this was not happening in the industry when the ABCC operated. From the time the ABCC was introduced, the rate of workplace fatalities increased every year until Labor was elected. Their model organisation for industrial harmony and for improving the construction industry occurred at the same time as fatalities in the industry increased year on year. I am proud to say that, under Labor's Fair Work model, fatalities in the building and construction industry have declined. According to the ABS, last year the construction industry saw a fatality rate of 1.93 deaths per 100,000 workers. This is the lowest fatality rate in history. This is very much lower than under the former coalition government, where it peaked at 2.95 deaths per 100,000 workers. The fatalities in the construction industry were fully a third higher under the last coalition government than they were last year. Under Labor, workplace injuries also declined.


Let us consider productivity for a second, because the government have included 'improving productivity' in the title of bill. Labour productivity in the construction industry under the Labor government was double that of the last three years of the Howard government. I know speakers on the other side will be tempted to compare the labour productivity in the unionised sector with that of the non-unionised parts of the construction sector. Any comparisons are facile because the unionised sector covers high-rise commercial construction, and they are trying to compare it to low-rise commercial construction in the outer suburbs, which is a completely different form of construction. The productivity story is very similar in the economy as a whole. I am proud that economy-wide labour productivity rose over one per cent last year and 3.9 per cent over the past two years. This is the highest in a decade, and our average productivity growth in the last five years has been twice that of the OECD average. On any available measure, labour productivity under Labor's Fair Work model in the construction industry and in the broader economy is much stronger than when the coalition is in government. On industrial disputation, the rate of industrial disputes in the construction industry is, on average, one fifth of the rate we saw under the previous government.


So we have higher productivity and we have fewer fatalities, and we have numbers of industrial disputes running at 20 per cent of those we saw under the coalition government. Yet their solution to this supposed problem is to crack down on workers' rights. I would submit that this is incredibly unfair and shows what the coalition is really about. The government remains wilfully ignorant of all the evidence that the current building industry regulation arrangements are working well. Labor has always supported a strong building industry regulator and a strong set of compliance arrangements for the building industry. Labor will not tolerate corruption, extortion or criminal behaviour in any industry, not just the construction industry.


There is no evidence to suggest that the monitoring of compliance in relation to building laws has failed or is not occurring under the current provisions. The current Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate has considerable powers to obtain information and documentation and have questions answered without compromising procedural and substantive fairness. The inspectorate is undertaking more investigations, concluding more investigations, getting matters to court faster and recovering more money for workers in the industry than the ABCC ever did. The inspectorate has secured over $2 million in unpaid wages and entitlements for more than 1,500 workers. Those are the sorts of breaches that the ABCC was never focused on. Those opposite do not care about nonpayment of employee entitlements, nonpayment of employee superannuation and nonpayment of workers compensation premiums. Most importantly, in an industry where there is, on average, one fatality per week, they do not care about compliance with occupational health and safety standards.


It is the government's responsibility to create a sound and workable industrial landscape in this country. To achieve this you have to have employers, workers and their representatives working together in a spirit of cooperation. Labor got this right with the Fair Work Act. In this country workers have safeguards to protect their rights, employers have safeguards to protect their interests and representatives are acknowledged as having a legitimate role in Australia's industrial relations system.


I want to go to the extreme nature of the proposed powers for the ABCC. The proposed powers are extreme and unnecessary and they compromise civil liberties. They include unfettered coercive powers, secretive interviews and imprisonment for those who do not cooperate. People interviewed have no right to silence and are denied the right to be represented by a lawyer of their choice. This bill abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination—something that has, until now, been enshrined in the common law.


In terms of the level of judicial oversight into investigatory powers, ASIO's investigatory powers into terrorist activities are subject to more checks and balances than the ABCC ever was. If this legislation passes, alleged terrorists will be entitled to a higher level of judicial protection than unionists are entitled to. Let me pause on that for just a sec. If this bill goes through parliament, terrorists and alleged terrorists will have more rights under our laws than unionists will. That is disgraceful, and it demonstrates yet again that this bill is not about promoting productivity, improving competitiveness, reducing disputation and increasing safety; it is about taking rights away from workers and saying to workers, 'You should have fewer rights than people alleged to be terrorists.'


Prime Minister Abbott refers to his workplace policies as returning 'the industrial relations pendulum back to the sensible centre'. Interestingly, there is very little emphasis in this bill on tackling what I believe are some of the most serious issues in the industry, including nonpayment of employee entitlements, nonpayment of employee superannuation, nonpayment of workers compensation premiums, the use of phoenix companies to avoid these obligations or avoid paying tax, and compliance with occupational health and safety standards—in an industry with, on average, one fatality per week. These are the real issues confronting the construction industry. I have seen workers affected by companies shutting up shop one day and refusing to pay entitlements, and then starting again the next day with a slightly different name. It is even affecting members of my family, where all they have done is gone to work and worked hard, and at the end of the day they have lost their entitlements because of shonky contractors. This bill does nothing to protect those workers. All it does is attack them. 


There are other areas of concern with this bill—for example, in relation to taking protected industrial action over issues of safety. An employee, when taking industrial action over safety issues, is required to prove their concerns about workplace health and safety only in relation to their personal safety. It is unclear whether or not this means that workers can only take action when their own personal safety is jeopardised and they are restricted from taking action over the safety of their colleagues. Let's pause on that for a second. Under this bill, it is unclear whether or not, if I am working next-door to another construction worker and I see his safety imperilled, I can take action to protect that worker. I would submit that that is a most unfair set of conditions.


Reversing the onus of proof is also part of this bill—a part that the previous speaker was proud of. It is a disgraceful state of affairs that the complainant bears the burden of proof. This undermines the tradition of 'innocent until proven guilty', which is the bedrock of Western legal traditions. That, combined with the loss of the right of silence, means that this bill is taking us very far away from those traditions. I would submit that this is nowhere near the 'sensible centre' the member for Warringah long promised us. The truth is that the ABCC is not a watchdog; it is an attack dog. It is an attack dog aimed at attacking workers' rights. It has been condemned by the International Labour Organization.


It is crucial that we oppose this bill because it attacks workers' rights, it attacks the rights of workers to organise, it will not improve safety and it will not improve productivity. It will not mean that a single worker in this country will have a better chance of being safe. The fact is that productivity in the construction industry is much higher now than it was with the ABCC under the previous Liberal government. Industrial disputation is one-fifth of where it was under the previous Liberal government. The industry is growing. It is strong. It was safe in Labor's hands. It has been jeopardised by the coalition because all they care about is attacking workers' rights.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2013-12-12,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (11:13):  This bill seeks to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission—an institution that was dismantled under the previous government for no other reason than to appease their mates in the union movement, and to shore up the power base of the former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, despite the obvious and valuable contribution that the ABCC was making to the construction industry and to the economy.


It is important to understand how and why the ABCC first came to be. I will go through its history. In 2001 the then Minister for Workplace Relations, the current Prime Minister, commissioned the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry to better understand the facts. What was revealed was really quite shocking. The royal commission report found that construction projects in Australia were hotbeds of intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence. The commission concluded that inappropriate behaviour was 'behaviour that infringes the Workplace Relations Act 1996, a person's right of choice or other conduct which departs from recognised norms of civility and behaviour'.


As a result of this in-depth and detailed report, the Australian Building and Construction Commission was established to stamp out this kind of behaviour. The results spoke for themselves. The ABCC had an immediate and positive impact. That is not simply the anecdotal evidence; it was evidenced by the 2013 Independent Economics report, which found that building and construction industry productivity grew by more than nine per cent, consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually, and that fewer working days were lost through industrial action.


Despite these positive results the previous government kowtowed to the unions and implemented their agenda to get rid of the ABCC. As was the case with the rest of its economic agenda, the previous government simply implemented the demands of the militant unions, which allowed them to dictate to management exactly what they should be doing on sites—to allow unions control of worksites. It is important to point out at this stage that unions do play a valuable role in our economy—but they are not the entire economy, which is something that those on the other side of the House seem to forget at times. The removal of the ABCC joins a long list of economically reckless, antibusiness policies introduced by the previous government, including policies like the carbon tax, the mining tax and other changes to regulatory policy.


Restoring the ABCC will achieve a couple of things. First, the ABCC will create a strong cop on the beat that will increase penalties for unlawful behaviour. These increased penalties are important in ensuring that any future fines are not simply seen as 'part of the job'. In order for fines to be successful in their deterrence they must hurt.


The coalition government understands and appreciates the importance of the construction industry. It is, after all, the construction industry that helps build our nation. We would not have some of the world's most picturesque and famous landmarks without the hard-working men and women of the construction industry—those who turn up to work day-in and day-out who simply want to do their job, and do it well. Let me make it crystal clear that this bill does not target those people. In fact, this bill will assist those people who want to do the right thing, by protecting them from industrial bullying and other corrupt behaviour. This bill does, however, target those who try to use intimidation, extortion and coercion—and the government makes no apology for that. It is very simple. Do not break the law and do not participate in illegal activity, and the ABCC will be of no relevance to you. 


This bill will also reinstate civil remedies in the case of coercion and discrimination—for example, the CFMEU's printing of posters labelling non-members as scabs, and calling on them to be 'run out of the industry' simply for not joining the union. Freedom of association needs to work both ways. These actions were in open defiance of the Fair Work Act and the Supreme Court orders. Similarly, in Werribee at the City West plant we saw more deplorable behaviour. Death threats and physical intimidation occurred there on a daily basis.


The bill will bring the ABCC into line with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink and Medicare in providing coercive powers of interrogation when it is deemed reasonable to do so. This is an important point, as in the past there have been people who have been hesitant to provide evidence, fearful that they would pay a very high price—fearful of retribution. This new power for the ABCC will mean that that will no longer be the case.


There are a number of people who are quite prepared to behave in an illegal manner in order to try to achieve their aims. I found it astonishing, a couple of weeks ago, when I was speaking on a TV program with Tony Sheldon, the head of the Transport Workers Union, that he admitted that he 'did the right thing' in reference to actions against Qantas that the Federal Court deemed to be illegal. This reminds me of a quote by Theodore Roosevelt when he said:


No man is above the law and no man is below it: nor do we ask any man's permission when we ask him to obey it.


Yet, for some reason in this country there is a subsection of the community that feels that they are above the law. There are a few bad eggs in the union movement that act in a militant fashion, conduct illegal industrial disputes, break the law and make no apology for it. This sort of attitude is also prevalent in the construction industry. It was most visible during the Myer Emporium debacle, where CFMEU members illegally closed down part of the city, blocking people who simply wanted to go to work.


Finally, the bill will, for the first time, take into account the importance of the supply chain in the construction industry to ensure that threats of refusal of supply will not befoul the industry. It reminds me of a story told to me by a constituent. This builder told me that he received a phone call from a union representative, who made it clear that if he did not advertise in the union's magazine his concrete would not be turning up the next day. It is this kind of extortion that the ABCC will stamp out of the industry. The only people who will lose from this legislation are those who will no longer be able to use force and thuggery to achieve their objectives.


Those opposite have used some pretty savage language in this debate—words like 'archaic', 'extreme', 'severe'. Let me say this: the only things that I find archaic, extreme and severe are the actions of militant unions that use threats of violence in the workplace. Not one member from the opposition side has condemned the actions I have outlined in my speech or any of the other many examples cited in this debate. I think that that says a lot about the standards that they accept. It shows a culture of acceptance, a culture of cover up, when it comes to crimes within the union movement.


Over the past few years we have witnessed many allegations of corruption within the union movement and we have heard about scandal after scandal. Yet the default response from those opposite is to sweep it under the carpet to avoid any potential political fall-out. Whether it is former Labor Minister Eddie Obeid, former President of the Labor Party Michael Williamson or former Labor MP Craig Thomson, union corruption, like corporate corruption, should be exposed, dealt with and punished accordingly—how else can we restore confidence. That is why this bill is so important; it will expose criminals in the industry and it will bring them to justice.


In conclusion I would like to say that the ABCC is required—to protect those in the building and construction industry, to protect workers from unlawful protest and intimidation, and to protect the industry as a whole so that we can build our future together.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-12-12,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:23):  The Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 is nothing more than a continuation of a decade-long obsession by the coalition to attack and destroy workers and worker organisations in this country. It is an attack that started in 2001, when the Cole royal commission was commissioned by none other than the current Prime Minister. That in turn led to the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, under the premise that the industry needed to be cleaned up. What we got was an organisation whose focus was almost exclusively on the workers within the Australian building and construction industry. It had scant regard for the builders and construction companies themselves—their illegal practices were entirely ignored by those opposite and the commission they established.


When Labor came to office it changed the rules in a way that brought balance and fairness to the management of improper behaviour and practices right across the board. We did that through the introduction of Fair Work legislation and the Fair Work Building and Construction Agency. We did that because we understood and accepted that some action needed to be taken. But we were not prepared to go to the extreme measures that the previous government had used. The Fair Work Building and Construction Agency, established by Labor, has sufficient powers to look into, prosecute if necessary and carry out whatever investigations are required in order to ensure that the industry operates in accordance with the standards that we would all expect. But it does so without denying anyone their natural rights—unlike this legislation.


This legislation not only seeks to re-establish the ABCC but also includes and re-includes coercive powers that will compel ordinary Australians to be subjected to secret interviews, be denied legal representation of their choice, and be threatened with imprisonment it they refuse to cooperate. The bill also extends the reach of the ABCC into picketing, offshore construction and the transport and supply of goods to building sites. It not only reinstates the Howard government's earlier legislation but goes much further. The legislation also extends the ABCC's jurisdiction to offshore places—to as far as Australia's exclusive economic zone or waters above the continental shelf—and, more significantly, it will encompass the transport and supply of goods to building sites, including to resource platforms.


Whilst the government's rhetoric is about fairness and the middle ground, the details of this legislation prove otherwise. Earlier this morning, in the first item on the agenda of business of this House—the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013—we saw another attempt to attack workers and their organisations in this country. I think it is fair to say that Australians believe in a fair go, in treating people fairly, and in treating people in the way they themselves would like to be treated. In fact, Australia has a proud record of being one of the founding nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On Tuesday we celebrated International Human Rights Day, and I heard members opposite speaking of the importance of protecting those rights and the decency that comes from them.


This legislation contravenes not only the conventions contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but everything we have ever stood for and fought for in this country for over a century. I ask members opposite: would you agree to being subjected to the laws enshrined in this bill? I very much doubt that. Of course, the truth is that members opposite do not work in the building and construction industry—they probably never have and probably never will. I will also be interested to see whether this legislation is referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Human Rights and, if so, how that committee responds. I would also be very interested to know whether the government sought advice as to whether this legislation complies with Australia's human rights obligations contained under any international convention to which Australia is a signatory. If so, will the minister table any legal response that it received.


The truth is that the Fair Work Building and Construction Agency already has sufficient powers to deal with any unlawful activities within the industry. I noted the comments of the member for Cowan earlier on, when he was referring to the current Grocon dispute in Victoria. He alluded to the penalties that are likely to be imposed on the parties to that dispute. If the laws are already there and being applied, why would you need to change them? I thought he actually argued the case for leaving things the way they are right now. In fact, there are a range of industrial and criminal laws already available to authorities to control any unlawful activities, and those laws are available to the authorities if any alleged unlawful activities occur. By its very description, if an activity is illegal or unlawful, it means that we have laws which are being breached. So the obvious question is not why we should be introducing new laws but why are we not enforcing the current laws? It is because the agencies in question need to be better resourced.


The government knows that this proposal is extreme, and that is why it only applies to one sector of society. If it were to apply to every sector of society, the government knows that the Australian people would not cop it, and that there would be outrage over it. By vilifying and targeting one sector, and one sector alone, and turning the rest of the community against that sector, the government believes that, by stealth, it can get away with it. It is interesting, in fact unique, that these laws are limited to a specific industry and that they propose coercive powers.


It is a flawed comparison when the minister and other members of this place stand up and say that the ATO, ASIC and the ACCC have similar powers. Firstly, whether it is ASIC, the ATO, the ACCC, or others in respect of their powers they are not confined to one single sector of society. They apply to all Australians in a non-discriminatory way. Secondly, those powers do not prevent the attendance of legal counsel of choice at any of the interviews that those authorities conduct. Thirdly, in his second reading speech the minister referred to the information gathering powers of the ABCC being similar to those of other government agencies. He does not, however, refer to the coercive powers of the ABCC inspectors which are entirely separate to the information gathering powers he refers to.


In a genuine attempt to bring some real balance to this issue the previous Labor government commissioned the Wilcox inquiry which, in turn, led to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. The Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate was then created to regulate the building and construction industry. That bill brought some balance and some fairness to the process, as I have previously stated. The point I want to make is that that legislation was passed in April 2012, just around 18 months ago. The agency came into effect about one year ago. We have not even had a year of it in operation to properly assess and evaluate its performance, and now the government comes in and says that it wants to change it again. Clearly, this government is driven by ideology and nothing else because, if the government were legitimate and serious about wanting to improve the situation, at the very least it would wait a reasonable amount of time, assess what has happened in the last 12 months, maybe even longer, and then make a judgement call as to whether further amendments would be required.


The fact is that the Fair Work Building and Construction Division is undertaking more investigations, concluding investigations, getting matters to court faster and recovering more money for workers in industry than the ABCC, which existed between 2005 and 2012. Over $2 million in unpaid wages and entitlements for more than 1,500 workers has been secured by Fair Work Building and Construction. These were the sorts of breaches that the ABCC was never, ever focused on. Importantly, labour productivity has increased over the last 10 quarters and, on average, is almost three times higher under Fair Work than under Work Choices.


Building workers have been and continue to be critical in the building of our country. They do work that many others would never, ever do. They work in extreme weather conditions such as outdoors on freezing cold mornings and on building sites in the hot sun in the middle of summer. They often face risks that, again, no other person in this country faces. As was previously pointed out, the member for Moreton, when he spoke on this matter, highlighted the number of serious accidents and even deaths that occur within the industry.


Building workers are entitled to stand up for their rights and for fair and safe working conditions without being persecuted, as was Ark Tribe in Adelaide, in 2008, for attending a stop work meeting called in relation to safety concerns at a building site. Ark Tribe was not a union leader, he was just a worker on the site who understood that there were some serious safety concerns and wanted to bring them to the attention of the authorities and the building company. For that he was dragged before the ABCC and taken to court. Ultimately the court found in his favour.


If the government seriously believes that there is a problem with the construction sector, why does it simply not extend the powers of Fair Work Building and Construction? Why does it need to go to the extreme steps that it is taking and reintroduce the ABCC with the kinds of powers that no other agency in this country has and no-one who generally believes in fairness would ever agree to? The government wants to reintroduce this legislation because, as I said from the very outset, this is a government that is intent on attacking workers in this country, wherever they may be, and intent on destroying the unions that support those workers. We are seeing it through this legislation, and we are seeing it through other legislation which indirectly does exactly the same thing. This legislation is, in my view, not only unnecessary and uncalled for but is also un-Australian.


The member for Gorton, as the opposition spokesman on industrial matters, has introduced some amendments to this legislation. The amendments are, I believe, more than appropriate and ought to be supported by this House. I support the amendments moved by the member for Gorton, and I believe that this House should seriously ask the question: is this the kind of legislation we want for this country, and is it legislation that members opposite would be prepared to live under if it applied to them?

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-12-12,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:28):  I rise today to speak strongly against the government's desperate and misguided actions to return to the former Australian Building and Construction Commission, the ABCC, set up by the former Howard Liberal government in 2005, via the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013.


I should declare up-front that, whilst I do not work in the building industry I have three brothers who all work in the building industry. One brother actually worked on the construction of Parliament House, when the big flag fell over 25 years ago. People may remember; I am sure the Clerk would remember. I know he is only a fresh young face here in Parliament House but he might remember when the flagpole fell over. My brother's company works in cranes. They were actually working down at the Canberra casino at that time, so he came to fix the flagpole that fell over. Another one of my brothers, my younger brother—all three of my brothers work in the construction industry—had a crane collapse right beside him while he was working at Twin Towns. The kibble on the crane injured his back significantly when the crane collapsed. But the most traumatic part of that accident was that two of his friends who were standing right beside him were killed. He was literally only inches away from being killed. So I have seen the building industry via the prism of my siblings and what they have and are experiencing, because all three of them still work in the industry.


Much of the bill before the chamber today largely replicates the former ABCC legislation, which was then amended by the Rudd-Gillard government through the Fair Work (Building Industry) Act. I am particularly outraged by this piece of legislation. It is tough enough when we have legislation that we just voted on, before this current piece of legislation, that took away a pay rise for people in the aged-care industry. We have seen a pay rise snatched away from the childcare workers and now we have an extra imposition on the building industry.


This legislation is wrong for so many reasons. It certainly introduced an element of retrospectivity into this area of law. Retrospectivity is never a good idea, especially from a government where so many of the promises from the now Prime Minister were that there would be no surprises and no excuses. To suddenly reach back into the past with this legislation is very disappointing. Retrospectivity should never be embraced in legislation.


The coalition government's claim is that their bill is strengthening the powers of the ABCC, but in fact it is restricting business certainty. It is creating a lot of uncertainty for small businesses that work in the building industry. It is actually imposing extra red tape from a government that said they were going to abolish red tape. They are not only bringing in future red tape but imposing red tape on past decisions, which is the very worst sort of legislation. They are proposing some sort of watchdog, but it is really just an attack dog on unions, not dissimilar to those attack dogs we saw down on the waterfront under the MUA dispute years ago. The reason it is particularly offensive is that, even when the people involved in employment in the building area have reached agreement and signed on to an agreement, now the government of today proposes to reach back. This is the very enemy of contract law, as all lawyers would know. And these changes are actually a waste of taxpayers' money, because of this extra red tape.


The changes will result in the ABCC using public funds to engage lawyers to continue litigation where the parties have already reached certainty and have an agreement. This is just a simple regurgitation of failed Howard government policies. This is yet another example of the Abbott government living in the past.


Looking at the brochure sent to my home by my opponent during the election—his 'Real Solutions' booklet—included in the visuals the words 'this is an experienced team'. I remember the photograph. I think I even saw it on a few billboards—'this is an experienced team'. They even were generous enough to put the member for Wentworth in the photograph so that there was a token Liberal in this hard-nosed team that was supposed to be experienced. As it turned out, what we have seen in the last 100 days, sadly, is the stumblings of amateurs.


Australia as a nation must look to the future. We need to be concerned about the future of jobs, the future of economic growth, especially in an environment where the dollar is high and puts pressure on our export industries and manufacturing, particularly, as we have seen with the disaster announced yesterday of Holden committing to leave the country. It was obviously not helped by the $500 million slashed from the automotive industry, as proposed by one of those members of the 'Real Solutions' team, the former member for Indi.


I have heard a bit of comment about mandates. I would have thought that, if your shadow automotive minister is the person who represents your policy in the automotive industry and they are the only Liberal shadow who is not elected, surely that suggests you have no authority to implement that policy. That would have been my suggestion.


The government understand political tactics but I do not think they understand the needs of Australian people, and they certainly do not know how to consult with building workers and how to consult with the people who actually turn up at the workplace every day.


Sadly, the coalition has a history of removing the rights from workers in this country, particularly in the building industry. I remember Ark Tribe—I think the member for Makin, being a South Australian, would be more familiar with the situation—




Mr Zappia:
  In 2008.




Mr PERRETT:
  It was 2008. I remember reading information about it. The reversal of the onus of proof is something that any government should always be very wary of. The Magna Carta has been around for a while. We have this long history of looking after rights, so to reverse the onus of proof in such an area should be done very carefully. There is an argument that coercive powers, such as Ark Tribe experienced, have no place in a free society. This government is now extending the ABCC's ability to interrogate workers, causing stress and unnecessary worries for innocent people.


Throughout the federal election campaign, the coalition government, I think, unnecessarily tried to make political mileage out of fatalities. I remember hearing comments, even in parliament, about the deaths that occurred when the insulation program was rolled out around Australia. A total of 1.2 million homes were insulated, but sadly there were some dodgy employers with bad work practices. Look at the mileage that has been made out of those fatalities, despite the 1.2 million homes that were insulated and all of the benefits to those households, both environmentally and for their wallets.


But let us have a look at the building industry. I was speaking to a friend of mine, Andrew Ramsay, from the CFMEU in Queensland. He said—




Mr Tudge:
  Is he a good friend?




Mr PERRETT:
  He is a good friend. He worked on my campaign in 2007.




Mr Tudge:
  I bet he did. How much money did he give you?




Mr PERRETT:
  No money.




Mr Tudge:
  What about the CFMEU?




Mr PERRETT:
  The CFMEU has made contributions to my election campaigns, and I think that they did in 2007.




Mr Tudge:
  How much?




Mr PERRETT:
  It is all on the public record. I do not think that there is any problem with having a connection with workers. I have always seen the Labor Party as being the political wing of the trade union movement. I am not afraid of workers. Unions have a great history of contributing to the good of this nation. That is my belief.


It is interesting to compare. A judicial inquiry was announced into these work related deaths—the insulation deaths. But, since the last fatality of the home insulation scheme, 31 Queenslanders have died in construction related accidents on the job. That is, to put it in context: 31 Queenslanders have died and five of those were electrocuted. There is a comparison. Since the judicial inquiry was announced, there have been 31 deaths. That it is to put it in context. Construction work can be very dangerous work. Construction work is challenging, especially in high-rise buildings, where there can be all sorts of complications.


This bill before the House includes provisions on prohibiting unlawful picket lines and allows anyone to get an injunction to prevent such a picket line happening. This government is clearly pushing to almost outlaw unionism in the construction industry. It is seen to be a bad thing for a union to make a contribution to a political party. That was the suggestion that came from the member opposite. The reality is, Australian workers need unions to fight for their rights and to look after their health and safety. We all know that when an employer tries to make money they will cut back on health and safety, and that makes it dangerous for workers. It is disgraceful to have union officials and members dragged off to the courts, fined and threatened with jail for taking part in union activities that have been a part of the fabric of this nation since the 1890s—since the shearers' strike that we had in Barcaldine in the 1890s that saw the formation of the Labor Party. Why would those opposite be scared of people banding together and speaking up for their rights?


The merits of the ABCC are based on flawed and ridiculous modelling. Its proposed powers are scary, particularly the unfettered coercive powers, the secretive interviews and imprisonment for those who do not cooperate. This is a star chamber that Oliver Cromwell would blanche at. These proposed powers are extreme, unnecessary and undemocratic and they compromise civil liberties.


Let us have a look at the record under Labor. Under the Fair Work Act, after the ABCC went, productivity went up in the building industry. Let us look at the Liberal legislation. After the ABCC was introduced in 2005, building industry fatalities jumped 95 per cent between 2006 and 2008. They had a budget of $35 million, including up to $500,000 a year for the salary of the commissioner. They brought cases against the CFMEU and other unions resulting in over $5 million in fines and millions more in court costs. That was good for lawyers, obviously. As a lawyer, I have no problem with lawyers getting paid, but the reality is that someone will always pay for it when lawyers are involved. The ABCC legislation was condemned eight times by the International Labour Organization for bias and for breaching conventions that Australia has signed. We saw when the judgment in the Ark Tribe case was handed down that they were completely embarrassed due to them not exercising their coercive powers correctly. They were found to have unlawfully interviewed 203 people.


That is why the Gillard and Rudd governments removed the majority of the ABCC's powers. We had the Fair Work Australia model, which is a much fairer system in the workplace. And what did we see? We saw industrial disputes go down. We even saw fatalities go down. I know that we should not refer to fatalities only, but that is a fact. And productivity rose.


Under the Howard government's ABCC, there was no right to silence and the commission possessed national security style powers to prevent a witness from revealing even to his wife or her husband that he or she had been interrogated by the commission. That is crazy stuff from George Orwell's 1984, not modern, progressive Australia. Now the coalition want to reinstate these secretive state police powers. They have not put a logical, coherent, empirical argument as to how this will boost productivity. This government, as we saw from the legislation that we just voted on, cannot be trusted when it comes to looking after workers and workers' rights.


What the construction industry needs is investment. It needs apprenticeships and jobs for Australian residents and citizens. They need to be schooled in health and safety. We do not need another government body determined to undermine industry standards, safety and working conditions such that the rogue and the cowboy will lower the standards and make it harder for those good employers—those good builders who do the right thing—to pay their workers and look after their health and safety. No-one wins the race to the bottom, and the biggest losers will always be the workers.


The government has not put a case that this will improve productivity. There is little evidence that this bill will work. Rather, it is about amplifying false statements about productivity. I ask those opposite to come out to a building site. I can arrange for them to come on site and talk to my family and see what really goes on in the construction industry. (Time expired)

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2013-12-12,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (10:43):  Clearly, this bill has caused concern in the union movement and for the union movement's political arm, the Labor Party. That is not surprising, because it promises to bring back to the building and construction industry two concepts that unions like the CFMEU do not like one bit, and they are productivity and accountability. They hate such terms because they are effectively the opposite of the objectives of the unions in the construction industry. On 7 September, the Australian people went to the polling booths in full knowledge that the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission was part of the policies of a coalition government. It was not being hidden; it was right out there. And now it is happening. This is of course not about Work Choices; this is about productivity and accountability on the building sites of Australia.


There is no greater example of the need for this bill and the reintroduction of the ABCC than the CFMEU's illegal action against construction company Grocon in Melbourne in 2012. If anyone were to say the ABCC and these powers were not now required I would direct them to recent history. Having had the chance to do the right thing, and comply with the law, the CFMEU chose to be militant and contemptuous of the law. In their dispute in Victoria the CFMEU now face the potential of multimillion-dollar fines and legal costs for contempt of court. Grocon has asked the court to impose a $1.5 million fine plus another $400,000 in legal costs after the CFMEU did plead guilty to a third round of contempt charges. Collectively the penalties could amount to more than $7 million because the court has been asked to impose fines of $5 million for other contempt charges resulting from the reckless and illegal blockades that brought Melbourne to a standstill. That recklessness was not only reckless and arrogant in its disregard for the law and court orders but also because the penalties of $7 million will come not out of the pockets of the union's leaders, who somehow thought themselves above the law, but from the members' dues—it is their money.


This is where this country has found itself. A militant union operating beyond the law, determined to destroy productivity, demonstrates exactly why the ABCC needs to be restored. The Labor Party cannot control the CFMEU but that union, drunk with its own sense of importance and power, stood defiantly against the rule of law. Yes, it is true the CFMEU could not be controlled by their political wing, but it is in fact the other way around: from the speakers list, clearly the CFMEU control the Labor Party, no doubt offering the stick and carrot to those opposite—threatening preselections and campaign contributions if the union's servants do not do as the union says.


The CFMEU is of course a repeat offender—and, when judgment is passed upon them, the costs will probably reflect their history of disregard for the law and the national interest of productivity. In Perth the same sort of disregard for getting on with the job was well known. For many years the CFMEU was led by Kevin Reynolds. Apart from getting his wife installed in state parliament as a Labor MLC, there were many deals done across building sites in Perth. A most interesting deal was where Reynolds acquired a luxury apartment in the Raffles Tower in expensive Applecross. The apartment overlooks the Canning River, and I think that the full cost of such an apartment would exceed the means of all but the most highly paid—or perhaps the well-connected, in this case.


In 2007 the Weekend Australian reported that the CFMEU in WA was greatly looking forward to a Rudd victory. The Weekend Australian found that figures showed an extraordinary halt to the union's rogue strikes—including 'blue flu', where hundreds of workers called in sick at once—after the ABCC used its powers to hit unionists with individual writs that could result in fines of up to $28,600 each.


It was a testament to the success of the ABCC that in Western Australia days lost to industrial action in the construction industry fell from 71 days per 1,000 workers in the December quarter of 2004 to just nine in the same quarter of late 2006. In fact, across 2006 there had been 45.2 days lost per 1,000 workers compared with 725 days in 2005.


In 2003 the Cole royal commission found lawlessness widespread in the construction industry. The commission heard that 10 Western Australian construction companies had handed over a combined total of $397,935.48 to the CFMEU in Western Australia for 'casual' union tickets for non-union workers. The commission also found widespread disregard for right-of-entry rules on building sites.


Perhaps in the case of WA and Victoria, the siphoning off of funds generated through 'peace accords'—some may call it blackmailing—of some builders has allowed massive war chests to be accumulated. These funds serve to inoculate the CFMEU against compliance with the law. In the case of Victoria's CFMEU it has been suggested that some $50-plus million has been accumulated in union coffers.


The question now becomes: what does this bill mean for Australians? The ABCC is to be re-established, armed with the powers it previously held to compel the attendance and production of documents. It is also good to see that new limits are imposed on unlawful industrial action and unlawful picketing, backed up by tougher penalties. There is no doubt that the need to restore these arrangements comes because of the absolute need to address what happened with a number of high-profile disputes in the construction industry, most prominently the Grocon event. It is little wonder that the ABCC needs to be brought back given the contempt the CFMEU showed for the courts in that issue.


The bill includes expansions of prohibitions on coercion and discrimination, with reverse-onus provisions to make it easier to prove breaches. A new Building Code will be issued, imposing further obligations on building industry contractors and other participants in the industry as conditions of obtaining work on Commonwealth funded projects.


Being from Western Australia I am also keen on new provisions, not present under the previous ABCC legislation, such as the expanded definition of 'building work' to include the transportation or supply of goods to building sites, including offshore resources platforms. This change will ensure that large resource construction projects, onshore and offshore, cannot be indirectly disrupted through coordinated go-slows on the supply of materials to those projects.


Of course, we are not talking about low pay or conditions at all. The CFMEU WA pattern-bargaining sees tradesmen getting about $140,000 per year, a labourer about $120,000 per year; four weeks leave a year and an additional 10 days of personal leave as well. Furthermore, there are 26 paid rostered days off per year. The working week is a 36-hour week but when overtime kicks in it is paid at double-time, because the usual site hours are around 50 hours a week. There is also very generous income protection that sees employers paying well in excess of $100,000 per year in policy premiums. Beyond their eight weeks paid leave a year, a great imposition on employers is the union training levy of $27 per week per EBA employee. From all reports there is very little training but significant collection of money, with one subcontractor having paid $70,000 in the last 12 months.


I understand that the construction sector has been willing to pay premium wages and conditions in the past, so long as productivity was delivered, but the CFMEU has failed to deliver for many years. Those commercial builders who sign the union EBA suffer a major cost disadvantage compared with those who do not. I emphasise that base wage rates are similar between the union and non-union sectors, but the excessive union allowances, 26 RDOs and insurances are a major difference between the two sectors. Productivity is also higher in the non-union sector.


The industry works on the general rule of thumb that labour costs represent around 50 per cent of total construction for a commercial project, so high labour costs are a major consideration for clients, including the public sector and the private sector. Rents therefore will reflect the costs of construction, and uncompetitive and unproductive union sites will result in higher costs for consumers. Extra costs in WA also include the union-imposed requirement for non-working job stewards on about $150,000 per year, for subcontractors to have safety officers that are paid in excess of $100,000 per year, and for the engagement of union EBA subcontractors only. It therefore revolves around making builders pay for the nepotism and jobs for the mates—or, more accurately, paid positions for the mates of union bosses. All these extra costs, these uncompetitive and unproductive practices, are being supported and applauded by those opposite. This is not the old mantra of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work; rather, this is about fleecing builders and therefore consumers without regard.


The bill provides for the establishment of the ABCC, headed by the commissioner. The commissioner's functions include monitoring and promoting appropriate standards of conduct by participants; investigating suspected contraventions of relevant building laws; instituting or intervening in legal processes; and providing assistance, advice and representation to building industry participants where appropriate. The commission will also have inspectors who can enter premises where they believe breaches of building laws are occurring or likely to occur, or where there are records or documents relevant to compliance purposes on the premises. While on the premises, the inspectors can inspect work, conduct interviews and require the production of records. The bill also restores the 'coercive powers' formerly held by the ABCC. These powers are designed to be 'a key tool for breaking down the historical and unacceptable culture of silence' in the construction sector. The ABCC's exercise of these coercive powers will be overseen by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.


Chapter 5 of the bill contains prohibitions on organising or engaging in 'unlawful industrial action' and 'unlawful picketing'. To be covered by the bill, these prohibited forms of action must be taken by, or in a way that affects, a 'constitutionally covered entity'—that is, a corporation, the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority, a body incorporated in the ACT or the Northern Territory, or a federally registered union or employer organisation. An unlawful picket is action that has the purpose of preventing or restricting a person from accessing or leaving a building site or ancillary site; that directly prevents or restricts a person from accessing or leaving a building site or an ancillary site; or that would reasonably be expected to intimidate a person accessing or leaving a building site or an ancillary site.


The penalties for unlawful industrial action are increased under the bill to $34,000 for individuals and $170,000 for corporate entities. The same penalties apply for unlawful picketing. The government states that these increased penalties are needed to 'act as a deterrent to unlawful behaviour' and 'blatant disregard for court orders'. With the exception of protected industrial action, it is also unlawful to take action to coerce another person to agree or not agree to make, vary or terminate a building enterprise agreement.


In conclusion, I would like to further reinforce the need for this bill to pass. I have talked about the high-profile incidents that make this bill and the re-establishment of the ABCC critical for a return to productivity and competitiveness that the CFMEU is the enemy of. However, to further make this point, I would like to also speak about something of an icon for shoppers in Perth. I speak of the direct factory outlet and discount centre known as Harbour Town. In the construction of Harbour Town some 10 years ago, it was well known in the industry that anyone bringing equipment or furnishings on to the site had to pay to get in. There were particular costs for each item. Apparently, to be allowed by the CFMEU to bring carpet on site was worth a carton of full-strength beer, to be handed in at the gate. And this was not the 1970s; it was not long ago.


To quote a 2009 Federal Court decision against the CFMEU, Justice Gilmour said:


It is of particular concern that the CFMEU, Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan have, as I have found on a prima facie basis, hidden behind spurious concerns as to the health and safety of employees to advance, as I infer, their own unspecified industrial aims. It is the very behaviour which the Commonwealth Parliament has made clear should be eradicated from the building industry in this country. It is conduct that directly undermines the main object of the BCII Act (s 3(1)) which is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole.


The point is that unions such as the CFMEU have been and are responsible for massively increased costs, inefficiencies and the reduction of productivity. Like so many organisations, they have a reckless disregard for the need for businesses to be competitive and efficient. They see any project as a chance to fill the coffers for the union leadership and they just do not get that they are driving businesses overseas through excessive costs.


The ABCC needs to be returned with all these powers to help return accountability, efficiency and productivity to the industry. The CFMEU and construction unions had the chance to be part of the Australian team under their political arm but instead they chose to fleece builders and undermine the economy. Rather than let them carry on, the time to act is now. It is time to restore the ABCC and get the construction industry back to a lawful and effective industry in this country. Whether it is the CFMEU or their Labor Party, those on the other side of politics find that eventually you run out of other people's money to spend. The well is not bottomless, and Australians expect this reckless waste and self-interest to stop. I therefore commend this bill to the House.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2013-12-12,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (10:58):  I rise to oppose the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013. And I oppose it because not a single extra building worker will get home safely because of this bill; not a single extra building worker will avoid losing their entitlements from collapsing companies because of this bill. What will happen is that the 5,000 building workers in my seat of Charlton and nearly one million Australia-wide will lose their fundamental rights. Sadly, this bill is not aimed at productivity, it is not aimed at strengthening the economy; it is aimed at destroying the basic rights of Australian workers, and it is built on a tower of sand. Every single economic fact that I will present in my speech demonstrated that the industry is in good shape, productivity is strong, industrial disputation is down and safety is increasing.


We do not need this bill. This bill is aimed purely at attacking workers and destroying trade unions. It is typical of the Orwellian approach of the new government to title it the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill. Let's look at the industry first. The construction industry is a viable sector of the economy. It has grown strongly over recent years and, with average growth of around 2.9 per cent, it has outgrown other sectors of the economy. It contributes over $100 billion dollars to annual GDP and employs around 900,000 people, which constitutes 7½ per cent of the total workforce. The percentage is even higher in my electorate of Charlton where 8.3 per cent of workers are employed in the construction industry. This represents almost 5,000 workers in my electorate who will be adversely affected by this legislation.


While the government allege that the introduction of this bill will improve productivity, there is no credible evidence to substantiate this claim. It is based on flawed and discredited analysis. Yet again, dodgy research is driving their approach. They have attempted to justify the return of the ABCC by referring to a recent report by consulting firm Independent Economics, a firm formerly known as Econtech. What they will not tell you is that this firm has a long history of churning out report after report which attacks workers and their unions whilst supposedly demonstrating a path to improved productivity. The member for Sturt failed to disclose when he introduced this bill that this consulting firm once had the rare distinction of producing modelling so inaccurate that the former Federal Court judge Murray Wilcox slammed the work as deeply flawed and recommended that it ought to be totally disregarded. This is the factual base that the government rest their justification for this bill on.


But attacking workers does nothing to improve productivity. Productivity improves where workers are guaranteed safe and fair working conditions. This bill, which will reintroduce the ABCC, was never about productivity, nor was it about taming an industry that is out of control. This is a robust industry. There are bad actors on both sides of the industrial landscape in this industry, that is without doubt. But there is no evidence to suggest that disputation in this industry has materially increased in the period since the ABCC was abolished or that the disputation in the construction industry is at historically high levels. Under Labor's Fair Work model, industrial disputation remains comparatively low. So why is it then necessary to make these changes? The truth is that it is not necessary. It is ideologically driven, just like Work Choices was. It was only ever about attacking unions and workers' rights.


Let us look at the origins of this bill. In the second reading speech, the Minister for Workplace Relations, who introduced the original ABCC in 2005, directly referred to unions no fewer than nine times and stated that they were specifically targeted to address union activity. The previous speaker, who is one of the Western Australian members, was very obvious in saying that this bill is designed to attack the CFMEU in particular. To be honest, at least they are not hiding their true colours in their speeches. This bill is now, as it was then, an attack on unions. It is a deliberate and orchestrated attempt to destroy the unions that represent the construction industry. But they have not stopped there. They have extended the definition of 'building work' to include offshore construction and the transport and supply of goods to building sites. This means that these new measures will apply to workers in the maritime industry and the transport industry and could extend to the manufacturing industry. This is another case of this government attacking workers' rights, not just in the construction industry but in every other industry they can get their hands on. This is truly a 'back to the future' time.


The construction workers that I have met in my electorate are hardworking Australians, just like every other worker. They have families and mortgages, and they expect—as they should—a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Most importantly, they expect to return home safely from work. Every worker is entitled to a safe workplace free of injury. I have met families who have been affected by workplace safety incidents and by workplace deaths. It is a tragedy. Even one worker dying at a workplace is one too many. This bill, sadly, does not improve safety—it undermines safety. As I have said before, every worker is entitled to a safe workplace. Unfortunately, this was not happening in the industry when the ABCC operated. From the time the ABCC was introduced, the rate of workplace fatalities increased every year until Labor was elected. Their model organisation for industrial harmony and for improving the construction industry occurred at the same time as fatalities in the industry increased year on year. I am proud to say that, under Labor's Fair Work model, fatalities in the building and construction industry have declined. According to the ABS, last year the construction industry saw a fatality rate of 1.93 deaths per 100,000 workers. This is the lowest fatality rate in history. This is very much lower than under the former coalition government, where it peaked at 2.95 deaths per 100,000 workers. The fatalities in the construction industry were fully a third higher under the last coalition government than they were last year. Under Labor, workplace injuries also declined.


Let us consider productivity for a second, because the government have included 'improving productivity' in the title of bill. Labour productivity in the construction industry under the Labor government was double that of the last three years of the Howard government. I know speakers on the other side will be tempted to compare the labour productivity in the unionised sector with that of the non-unionised parts of the construction sector. Any comparisons are facile because the unionised sector covers high-rise commercial construction, and they are trying to compare it to low-rise commercial construction in the outer suburbs, which is a completely different form of construction. The productivity story is very similar in the economy as a whole. I am proud that economy-wide labour productivity rose over one per cent last year and 3.9 per cent over the past two years. This is the highest in a decade, and our average productivity growth in the last five years has been twice that of the OECD average. On any available measure, labour productivity under Labor's Fair Work model in the construction industry and in the broader economy is much stronger than when the coalition is in government. On industrial disputation, the rate of industrial disputes in the construction industry is, on average, one fifth of the rate we saw under the previous government.


So we have higher productivity and we have fewer fatalities, and we have numbers of industrial disputes running at 20 per cent of those we saw under the coalition government. Yet their solution to this supposed problem is to crack down on workers' rights. I would submit that this is incredibly unfair and shows what the coalition is really about. The government remains wilfully ignorant of all the evidence that the current building industry regulation arrangements are working well. Labor has always supported a strong building industry regulator and a strong set of compliance arrangements for the building industry. Labor will not tolerate corruption, extortion or criminal behaviour in any industry, not just the construction industry.


There is no evidence to suggest that the monitoring of compliance in relation to building laws has failed or is not occurring under the current provisions. The current Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate has considerable powers to obtain information and documentation and have questions answered without compromising procedural and substantive fairness. The inspectorate is undertaking more investigations, concluding more investigations, getting matters to court faster and recovering more money for workers in the industry than the ABCC ever did. The inspectorate has secured over $2 million in unpaid wages and entitlements for more than 1,500 workers. Those are the sorts of breaches that the ABCC was never focused on. Those opposite do not care about nonpayment of employee entitlements, nonpayment of employee superannuation and nonpayment of workers compensation premiums. Most importantly, in an industry where there is, on average, one fatality per week, they do not care about compliance with occupational health and safety standards.


It is the government's responsibility to create a sound and workable industrial landscape in this country. To achieve this you have to have employers, workers and their representatives working together in a spirit of cooperation. Labor got this right with the Fair Work Act. In this country workers have safeguards to protect their rights, employers have safeguards to protect their interests and representatives are acknowledged as having a legitimate role in Australia's industrial relations system.


I want to go to the extreme nature of the proposed powers for the ABCC. The proposed powers are extreme and unnecessary and they compromise civil liberties. They include unfettered coercive powers, secretive interviews and imprisonment for those who do not cooperate. People interviewed have no right to silence and are denied the right to be represented by a lawyer of their choice. This bill abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination—something that has, until now, been enshrined in the common law.


In terms of the level of judicial oversight into investigatory powers, ASIO's investigatory powers into terrorist activities are subject to more checks and balances than the ABCC ever was. If this legislation passes, alleged terrorists will be entitled to a higher level of judicial protection than unionists are entitled to. Let me pause on that for just a sec. If this bill goes through parliament, terrorists and alleged terrorists will have more rights under our laws than unionists will. That is disgraceful, and it demonstrates yet again that this bill is not about promoting productivity, improving competitiveness, reducing disputation and increasing safety; it is about taking rights away from workers and saying to workers, 'You should have fewer rights than people alleged to be terrorists.'


Prime Minister Abbott refers to his workplace policies as returning 'the industrial relations pendulum back to the sensible centre'. Interestingly, there is very little emphasis in this bill on tackling what I believe are some of the most serious issues in the industry, including nonpayment of employee entitlements, nonpayment of employee superannuation, nonpayment of workers compensation premiums, the use of phoenix companies to avoid these obligations or avoid paying tax, and compliance with occupational health and safety standards—in an industry with, on average, one fatality per week. These are the real issues confronting the construction industry. I have seen workers affected by companies shutting up shop one day and refusing to pay entitlements, and then starting again the next day with a slightly different name. It is even affecting members of my family, where all they have done is gone to work and worked hard, and at the end of the day they have lost their entitlements because of shonky contractors. This bill does nothing to protect those workers. All it does is attack them. 


There are other areas of concern with this bill—for example, in relation to taking protected industrial action over issues of safety. An employee, when taking industrial action over safety issues, is required to prove their concerns about workplace health and safety only in relation to their personal safety. It is unclear whether or not this means that workers can only take action when their own personal safety is jeopardised and they are restricted from taking action over the safety of their colleagues. Let's pause on that for a second. Under this bill, it is unclear whether or not, if I am working next-door to another construction worker and I see his safety imperilled, I can take action to protect that worker. I would submit that that is a most unfair set of conditions.


Reversing the onus of proof is also part of this bill—a part that the previous speaker was proud of. It is a disgraceful state of affairs that the complainant bears the burden of proof. This undermines the tradition of 'innocent until proven guilty', which is the bedrock of Western legal traditions. That, combined with the loss of the right of silence, means that this bill is taking us very far away from those traditions. I would submit that this is nowhere near the 'sensible centre' the member for Warringah long promised us. The truth is that the ABCC is not a watchdog; it is an attack dog. It is an attack dog aimed at attacking workers' rights. It has been condemned by the International Labour Organization.


It is crucial that we oppose this bill because it attacks workers' rights, it attacks the rights of workers to organise, it will not improve safety and it will not improve productivity. It will not mean that a single worker in this country will have a better chance of being safe. The fact is that productivity in the construction industry is much higher now than it was with the ABCC under the previous Liberal government. Industrial disputation is one-fifth of where it was under the previous Liberal government. The industry is growing. It is strong. It was safe in Labor's hands. It has been jeopardised by the coalition because all they care about is attacking workers' rights.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2013-12-12,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (11:13):  This bill seeks to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission—an institution that was dismantled under the previous government for no other reason than to appease their mates in the union movement, and to shore up the power base of the former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, despite the obvious and valuable contribution that the ABCC was making to the construction industry and to the economy.


It is important to understand how and why the ABCC first came to be. I will go through its history. In 2001 the then Minister for Workplace Relations, the current Prime Minister, commissioned the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry to better understand the facts. What was revealed was really quite shocking. The royal commission report found that construction projects in Australia were hotbeds of intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence. The commission concluded that inappropriate behaviour was 'behaviour that infringes the Workplace Relations Act 1996, a person's right of choice or other conduct which departs from recognised norms of civility and behaviour'.


As a result of this in-depth and detailed report, the Australian Building and Construction Commission was established to stamp out this kind of behaviour. The results spoke for themselves. The ABCC had an immediate and positive impact. That is not simply the anecdotal evidence; it was evidenced by the 2013 Independent Economics report, which found that building and construction industry productivity grew by more than nine per cent, consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually, and that fewer working days were lost through industrial action.


Despite these positive results the previous government kowtowed to the unions and implemented their agenda to get rid of the ABCC. As was the case with the rest of its economic agenda, the previous government simply implemented the demands of the militant unions, which allowed them to dictate to management exactly what they should be doing on sites—to allow unions control of worksites. It is important to point out at this stage that unions do play a valuable role in our economy—but they are not the entire economy, which is something that those on the other side of the House seem to forget at times. The removal of the ABCC joins a long list of economically reckless, antibusiness policies introduced by the previous government, including policies like the carbon tax, the mining tax and other changes to regulatory policy.


Restoring the ABCC will achieve a couple of things. First, the ABCC will create a strong cop on the beat that will increase penalties for unlawful behaviour. These increased penalties are important in ensuring that any future fines are not simply seen as 'part of the job'. In order for fines to be successful in their deterrence they must hurt.


The coalition government understands and appreciates the importance of the construction industry. It is, after all, the construction industry that helps build our nation. We would not have some of the world's most picturesque and famous landmarks without the hard-working men and women of the construction industry—those who turn up to work day-in and day-out who simply want to do their job, and do it well. Let me make it crystal clear that this bill does not target those people. In fact, this bill will assist those people who want to do the right thing, by protecting them from industrial bullying and other corrupt behaviour. This bill does, however, target those who try to use intimidation, extortion and coercion—and the government makes no apology for that. It is very simple. Do not break the law and do not participate in illegal activity, and the ABCC will be of no relevance to you. 


This bill will also reinstate civil remedies in the case of coercion and discrimination—for example, the CFMEU's printing of posters labelling non-members as scabs, and calling on them to be 'run out of the industry' simply for not joining the union. Freedom of association needs to work both ways. These actions were in open defiance of the Fair Work Act and the Supreme Court orders. Similarly, in Werribee at the City West plant we saw more deplorable behaviour. Death threats and physical intimidation occurred there on a daily basis.


The bill will bring the ABCC into line with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink and Medicare in providing coercive powers of interrogation when it is deemed reasonable to do so. This is an important point, as in the past there have been people who have been hesitant to provide evidence, fearful that they would pay a very high price—fearful of retribution. This new power for the ABCC will mean that that will no longer be the case.


There are a number of people who are quite prepared to behave in an illegal manner in order to try to achieve their aims. I found it astonishing, a couple of weeks ago, when I was speaking on a TV program with Tony Sheldon, the head of the Transport Workers Union, that he admitted that he 'did the right thing' in reference to actions against Qantas that the Federal Court deemed to be illegal. This reminds me of a quote by Theodore Roosevelt when he said:


No man is above the law and no man is below it: nor do we ask any man's permission when we ask him to obey it.


Yet, for some reason in this country there is a subsection of the community that feels that they are above the law. There are a few bad eggs in the union movement that act in a militant fashion, conduct illegal industrial disputes, break the law and make no apology for it. This sort of attitude is also prevalent in the construction industry. It was most visible during the Myer Emporium debacle, where CFMEU members illegally closed down part of the city, blocking people who simply wanted to go to work.


Finally, the bill will, for the first time, take into account the importance of the supply chain in the construction industry to ensure that threats of refusal of supply will not befoul the industry. It reminds me of a story told to me by a constituent. This builder told me that he received a phone call from a union representative, who made it clear that if he did not advertise in the union's magazine his concrete would not be turning up the next day. It is this kind of extortion that the ABCC will stamp out of the industry. The only people who will lose from this legislation are those who will no longer be able to use force and thuggery to achieve their objectives.


Those opposite have used some pretty savage language in this debate—words like 'archaic', 'extreme', 'severe'. Let me say this: the only things that I find archaic, extreme and severe are the actions of militant unions that use threats of violence in the workplace. Not one member from the opposition side has condemned the actions I have outlined in my speech or any of the other many examples cited in this debate. I think that that says a lot about the standards that they accept. It shows a culture of acceptance, a culture of cover up, when it comes to crimes within the union movement.


Over the past few years we have witnessed many allegations of corruption within the union movement and we have heard about scandal after scandal. Yet the default response from those opposite is to sweep it under the carpet to avoid any potential political fall-out. Whether it is former Labor Minister Eddie Obeid, former President of the Labor Party Michael Williamson or former Labor MP Craig Thomson, union corruption, like corporate corruption, should be exposed, dealt with and punished accordingly—how else can we restore confidence. That is why this bill is so important; it will expose criminals in the industry and it will bring them to justice.


In conclusion I would like to say that the ABCC is required—to protect those in the building and construction industry, to protect workers from unlawful protest and intimidation, and to protect the industry as a whole so that we can build our future together.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-12-12,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:23):  The Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 is nothing more than a continuation of a decade-long obsession by the coalition to attack and destroy workers and worker organisations in this country. It is an attack that started in 2001, when the Cole royal commission was commissioned by none other than the current Prime Minister. That in turn led to the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, under the premise that the industry needed to be cleaned up. What we got was an organisation whose focus was almost exclusively on the workers within the Australian building and construction industry. It had scant regard for the builders and construction companies themselves—their illegal practices were entirely ignored by those opposite and the commission they established.


When Labor came to office it changed the rules in a way that brought balance and fairness to the management of improper behaviour and practices right across the board. We did that through the introduction of Fair Work legislation and the Fair Work Building and Construction Agency. We did that because we understood and accepted that some action needed to be taken. But we were not prepared to go to the extreme measures that the previous government had used. The Fair Work Building and Construction Agency, established by Labor, has sufficient powers to look into, prosecute if necessary and carry out whatever investigations are required in order to ensure that the industry operates in accordance with the standards that we would all expect. But it does so without denying anyone their natural rights—unlike this legislation.


This legislation not only seeks to re-establish the ABCC but also includes and re-includes coercive powers that will compel ordinary Australians to be subjected to secret interviews, be denied legal representation of their choice, and be threatened with imprisonment it they refuse to cooperate. The bill also extends the reach of the ABCC into picketing, offshore construction and the transport and supply of goods to building sites. It not only reinstates the Howard government's earlier legislation but goes much further. The legislation also extends the ABCC's jurisdiction to offshore places—to as far as Australia's exclusive economic zone or waters above the continental shelf—and, more significantly, it will encompass the transport and supply of goods to building sites, including to resource platforms.


Whilst the government's rhetoric is about fairness and the middle ground, the details of this legislation prove otherwise. Earlier this morning, in the first item on the agenda of business of this House—the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013—we saw another attempt to attack workers and their organisations in this country. I think it is fair to say that Australians believe in a fair go, in treating people fairly, and in treating people in the way they themselves would like to be treated. In fact, Australia has a proud record of being one of the founding nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On Tuesday we celebrated International Human Rights Day, and I heard members opposite speaking of the importance of protecting those rights and the decency that comes from them.


This legislation contravenes not only the conventions contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but everything we have ever stood for and fought for in this country for over a century. I ask members opposite: would you agree to being subjected to the laws enshrined in this bill? I very much doubt that. Of course, the truth is that members opposite do not work in the building and construction industry—they probably never have and probably never will. I will also be interested to see whether this legislation is referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Human Rights and, if so, how that committee responds. I would also be very interested to know whether the government sought advice as to whether this legislation complies with Australia's human rights obligations contained under any international convention to which Australia is a signatory. If so, will the minister table any legal response that it received.


The truth is that the Fair Work Building and Construction Agency already has sufficient powers to deal with any unlawful activities within the industry. I noted the comments of the member for Cowan earlier on, when he was referring to the current Grocon dispute in Victoria. He alluded to the penalties that are likely to be imposed on the parties to that dispute. If the laws are already there and being applied, why would you need to change them? I thought he actually argued the case for leaving things the way they are right now. In fact, there are a range of industrial and criminal laws already available to authorities to control any unlawful activities, and those laws are available to the authorities if any alleged unlawful activities occur. By its very description, if an activity is illegal or unlawful, it means that we have laws which are being breached. So the obvious question is not why we should be introducing new laws but why are we not enforcing the current laws? It is because the agencies in question need to be better resourced.


The government knows that this proposal is extreme, and that is why it only applies to one sector of society. If it were to apply to every sector of society, the government knows that the Australian people would not cop it, and that there would be outrage over it. By vilifying and targeting one sector, and one sector alone, and turning the rest of the community against that sector, the government believes that, by stealth, it can get away with it. It is interesting, in fact unique, that these laws are limited to a specific industry and that they propose coercive powers.


It is a flawed comparison when the minister and other members of this place stand up and say that the ATO, ASIC and the ACCC have similar powers. Firstly, whether it is ASIC, the ATO, the ACCC, or others in respect of their powers they are not confined to one single sector of society. They apply to all Australians in a non-discriminatory way. Secondly, those powers do not prevent the attendance of legal counsel of choice at any of the interviews that those authorities conduct. Thirdly, in his second reading speech the minister referred to the information gathering powers of the ABCC being similar to those of other government agencies. He does not, however, refer to the coercive powers of the ABCC inspectors which are entirely separate to the information gathering powers he refers to.


In a genuine attempt to bring some real balance to this issue the previous Labor government commissioned the Wilcox inquiry which, in turn, led to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011. The Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate was then created to regulate the building and construction industry. That bill brought some balance and some fairness to the process, as I have previously stated. The point I want to make is that that legislation was passed in April 2012, just around 18 months ago. The agency came into effect about one year ago. We have not even had a year of it in operation to properly assess and evaluate its performance, and now the government comes in and says that it wants to change it again. Clearly, this government is driven by ideology and nothing else because, if the government were legitimate and serious about wanting to improve the situation, at the very least it would wait a reasonable amount of time, assess what has happened in the last 12 months, maybe even longer, and then make a judgement call as to whether further amendments would be required.


The fact is that the Fair Work Building and Construction Division is undertaking more investigations, concluding investigations, getting matters to court faster and recovering more money for workers in industry than the ABCC, which existed between 2005 and 2012. Over $2 million in unpaid wages and entitlements for more than 1,500 workers has been secured by Fair Work Building and Construction. These were the sorts of breaches that the ABCC was never, ever focused on. Importantly, labour productivity has increased over the last 10 quarters and, on average, is almost three times higher under Fair Work than under Work Choices.


Building workers have been and continue to be critical in the building of our country. They do work that many others would never, ever do. They work in extreme weather conditions such as outdoors on freezing cold mornings and on building sites in the hot sun in the middle of summer. They often face risks that, again, no other person in this country faces. As was previously pointed out, the member for Moreton, when he spoke on this matter, highlighted the number of serious accidents and even deaths that occur within the industry.


Building workers are entitled to stand up for their rights and for fair and safe working conditions without being persecuted, as was Ark Tribe in Adelaide, in 2008, for attending a stop work meeting called in relation to safety concerns at a building site. Ark Tribe was not a union leader, he was just a worker on the site who understood that there were some serious safety concerns and wanted to bring them to the attention of the authorities and the building company. For that he was dragged before the ABCC and taken to court. Ultimately the court found in his favour.


If the government seriously believes that there is a problem with the construction sector, why does it simply not extend the powers of Fair Work Building and Construction? Why does it need to go to the extreme steps that it is taking and reintroduce the ABCC with the kinds of powers that no other agency in this country has and no-one who generally believes in fairness would ever agree to? The government wants to reintroduce this legislation because, as I said from the very outset, this is a government that is intent on attacking workers in this country, wherever they may be, and intent on destroying the unions that support those workers. We are seeing it through this legislation, and we are seeing it through other legislation which indirectly does exactly the same thing. This legislation is, in my view, not only unnecessary and uncalled for but is also un-Australian.


The member for Gorton, as the opposition spokesman on industrial matters, has introduced some amendments to this legislation. The amendments are, I believe, more than appropriate and ought to be supported by this House. I support the amendments moved by the member for Gorton, and I believe that this House should seriously ask the question: is this the kind of legislation we want for this country, and is it legislation that members opposite would be prepared to live under if it applied to them?

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2013-12-12,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (11:41):  by leave—I am pleased to report to the House that the recent successful conclusion of the free trade agreement between Australia and the Republic of Korea will both restore our country's competitive position and open a raft of new growth opportunities for our country. Korea represents both our third largest goods export market and our fourth largest trading partner. I had the privilege of substantially concluding negotiations last week with my Korean counterpart, trade minister Yun, on the sidelines of the successful World Trade Organisation ministerial conference in Bali.


Negotiations on the agreement commenced back in 2009, and as a government we were fully aware of the imperative of finalising them as soon as possible. Every day of delay was another day Australia was at a competitive disadvantage against the likes of the United States, the European Union and ASEAN countries. These major competitors are all enjoying preferential market access on account of the free trade agreements they already have secured with Korea. The playing field will be levelled through the finalisation of this free trade agreement.


I can assure the House that this is a world-class agreement: it is both comprehensive and of a very high quality. It will result in the elimination of over 99 per cent of the tariffs that our exporters currently face across key areas, including agriculture, resources, energy and manufactured goods. We have also negotiated significant new market openings in services and investment in areas such as financial, accounting and legal services as well as telecommunications, education, audiovisual production, engineering, health, aged care and environmental services.


This is a very strong and liberating agreement for agriculture. For instance: tariffs of 304 per cent will be eliminated on chipping potatoes; the 40 per cent tariff on beef will be eliminated over 15 years, not 18 years, because we pushed for the same deal as the United States enjoy; the 22½ per cent tariff on lamb and sheep meat will go; the tariff on dairy products ranging from 36 per cent to 176 per cent will be eliminated; the three per cent tariff on sugar, in a market currently worth nearly $500 million to Australia, will be eliminated as soon as the FTA comes into effect; tariffs on wheat, seafood items, wine, chocolate, beer, a range of horticulture, pharmaceuticals, canned fruit—and the list goes on—will all go; and tariffs of up to eight per cent on a range of resources products—including crude petroleum, natural gas and coal—will also be eliminated over time.


This is a very good agreement also for our manufacturers. While acknowledging the challenges faced by our car manufacturers, the FTA will result in the elimination of Korea's eight per cent tariff on our automotive parts and accessories.


Korea is Australia's third largest market for automotive components exports. It is our largest export market for gearboxes ($122 million last year) and second largest for car engines ($50 million, again, last year).


Independent modelling shows both the opportunities for our country of finalising this free trade agreement and also the costs associated if we had not. It shows that agricultural exports to Korea will be 73 per cent higher after 15 years and manufacturing by 53 per cent as a result of this free trade agreement; and overall exports will be 25 per cent higher. It will provide an annual boost to our economy in the order of $650 million. Without this agreement, agricultural exports alone to Korea would have declined by 29 per cent by 2030 and overall exports would be five per cent lower.


The conclusion of negotiations has been warmly welcomed by a broad cross section of Australian industry. Some examples include:


The National Farmers Federation, Queensland Cattle Producers, the Business Council of Australia, the Cattle Council of Australia, Grain Growers, CPA Australia, ACCI, AiG, the Australian Food and Grocery Council, the Winemakers Federation of Australia, Queensland Sugar, Canegrowers, AusVeg, the Minerals Council of Australia, Australian Services Roundtable and the Law Council of Australia. This list goes on.


This agreement will include an investor-state dispute settlement provision. ISDS provisions are certainly nothing new. In fact, they are already contained in four free trade agreements that we currently have with other countries and 21 other investment agreements that Australia is a party to. The previous government, for instance, included such provisions in two free trade agreements that it signed. They are designed to create confidence for investors, both Australian and Korean. Importantly, the provisions also provide key safeguards which preserve Australia's ability to govern in the public interest in areas such as public health and the environment.


I acknowledge the constructive work of my predecessor Craig Emerson. Unfortunately for Australia, this ISDS became a major stumbling block with Korea under the previous government on account of pressure exerted by elements of the union movement, which is ideologically opposed to free trade. This government has placed strong priority on backing our nation's strengths, the things we do as well as any and better than most.


Pursuing an ambitious free trade and investment agenda gives these strengths—agriculture, mining and resources, education, health, tourism and events management and the services that have developed around them, including high-level manufacturing—the best possible chance to thrive and grow. It is also an emphatic signal to the world that Australia is indeed open for business.


I present the following document: Australia-Korea Free Trade Agreement—Ministerial Statement, 12 December 2013, and seek leave to move a motion to allow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to speak for a period not exceeding seven minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr ROBB:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Ms Plibersek (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) speaking for a period not exceeding seven minutes.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (11:48):  I thank the Minister for Trade for his statement and welcome progress in negotiations for a free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea as outlined by the minister. Labor has long recognised that reducing barriers to trade can boost economic growth, create more competitive industries and give consumers access to a wider range of goods and services at a lower price.


As noted by the minister, negotiations on a bilateral agreement with the Republic of Korea were initiated by the former Labor government in 2009. I thank him for his acknowledgement of the work of the former trade minister, Craig Emerson. Labor in government identified the opportunities and challenges of the Asian century, and the initiation of negotiations with Korea was a manifestation of our outward-looking policy framework. 


The Republic of Korea is a great friend of Australia. I was very happy to meet with the ambassador this morning. Korea is Australia's third largest export market, and a free trade agreement presents significant opportunities for Australian exporters and for Australian workers. We unambiguously welcome the opportunities this agreement delivers for our exporters in both goods and services, including key agricultural sectors. We also note the challenges it presents for a number of our industry sectors, including textiles, clothing and footwear, steel, and the automotive sector. In light of the decision by Holden to cease its manufacturing operations in Australia by 2017, the impact of tariff reductions on our automotive sector will need to be carefully assessed.


The minister noted the government's decision to include an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in the agreement. Labor has grave reservations about this decision. It is disappointing the minister did not outline the so-called safeguards in the proposed ISDS provisions of the Korean FTA. Instead of attacking the opposition and the union movement, the minister should recognise the genuine concern in this parliament and in the broader community about the impact of investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms. He should also acknowledge that debate on the desirability of investor-state dispute settlement provisions in bilateral trade agreements is also a feature of debate in Korea about the provisions in the free trade agreement. It is a feature of debate in Korean domestic politics, too.


If the minister genuinely believes that it is in the national interest to give foreign companies standing to take action against the Australian government, standing that is not available to Australian companies, he needs to explain why. If he genuinely believes it is in the national interest to constrain the ability of future governments to make laws for the benefit of Australians, he needs to explain why. Also, if he genuinely believes that it is beyond the wit of a government to negotiate bilateral trade agreements without an investor-state dispute settlement, he needs to explain why the Howard government managed such a negotiation with the United States and why the Labor government managed such a negotiation with Malaysia.


Notwithstanding the potential benefits of trade liberalisation, the outcome of any individual negotiation should be assessed against the national interest and our interests should never be traded away. For that reason, Labor urges the minister to release the full text of the negotiated agreement, including the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, so that the parliament and the Australian community can assess its potential benefits and, if applicable, its detriments.


Labor responded to last week's announcement of the proposed free trade agreement with Korea by urging the government to release the full text of the agreement. The government, unfortunately, has rejected that request. Indeed, while the trade minister was away I also asked the foreign minister if she would release the full text of the agreement. She also refused. This week Labor successfully moved in the Senate a motion to order the release of the full free trade agreement before signing. The government has sought to resist this order. I urge the minister to reconsider his decision to deny Australians the opportunity to read the agreement for themselves.


Debate on trade should not be allowed to descend into the political tubthumping that we saw inside the government over the proposed foreign acquisition of GrainCorp. A mature debate can only occur if the minister is prepared to treat the parliament and the community with respect. Last Thursday the Prime Minister told the House that the minister had—and I quote:


… successfully concluded negotiations for a free trade agreement between Australia and the Republic of Korea.


Today the minister said that he had 'substantially' concluded negotiations. It is important the government explain what, if any, stumbling blocks remain, including whether they relate to negotiations over the form of the investor-state dispute settlement he has agreed to include in the agreement.


It is disappointing that the minister has outlined only in the broadest terms key facts about this free trade agreement, drawn from a fact sheet that had already been released by the department last week. I believe we deserve more than that on something as important as this to our future—a key trading agreement with a key trading partner. Labor recognises the importance of our trading relationships with the world. They underpin our economy and they underpin our current and future prosperity. Labor looks forward to examining the full terms of the proposed agreement and will assess it carefully to ensure it is genuinely in the national interest.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Minister for Communications) (11:55):  by leave—The National Broadband Network is the nation's largest and most costly infrastructure project. Regrettably, it is also the most misunderstood and misrepresented. That is because for the four years of its life under Labor, the NBN has been shrouded in a web of spin, obfuscation and exaggeration. Forecasts have been set, missed, set again, missed again, set a third time, and missed a third time. Beguiling promises have been offered but not delivered.


This is not a question of fibre versus copper. The key issue is only how far fibre optics are pushed out into the network and whether they must reach into every home and every business or whether existing copper infrastructure can be used for the last few hundred metres and in so doing save much time, inconvenience and many billions of dollars. The NBN project needs, more than anything, an end to spin.


After I became Minister for Communications, I wrote to the employees of NBN Co. telling them that this government expects to receive the unvarnished truth, not what they think we want to hear. Forecasts, business plans and practices need to be informed by sober reality. NBN Co.'s people must be free to express their views and perform their work without worrying whether they are contradicting a minister's press release.




1. Background to the strategic review



On 3 October the government asked NBN Co. to undertake a strategic review of this vitally important project. In a nutshell we posed three questions:


Where is the project now?


How much will it cost and how long will it take to complete under Labor's specifications?


And what are our options for completing it sooner and at less cost?


NBN Co. delivered a draft report on 2 December and its final report today. We are releasing the final document presented by NBN Co. in full, subject only to certain redactions sought by the company to protect its interests in current and prospective legal and commercial agreements. 


The strategic review confirms what many Australians suspected, but what both of my predecessors as communications minister shamefully concealed from the public. 


The rollout is two years behind after three years and will not finish until the mid-2020s.


Costs are so high that they will add $43 per month to a typical household's broadband bill.


And NBN Co. faces a daunting internal transformation under its new leadership.


Critically, this report is not reverse engineered to justify or rationalise government policy, whether set out in a speech, conjured up by press release or sketched on the back of a drink coaster.


I emphasise this point because the facts so methodically presented in the review make it plain that the NBN is in a worse state than Australians have been told.


We were told by Labor that the case for a fibre-to-the-premises NBN was so potent there was no need for a cost-benefit analysis.


We were assured this costly project could be built without any increase in broadband charges. 


And we were repeatedly told that the rollout was on schedule and within budget.


Even just prior to the 7 September election, long after it was clear to most observers that the rollout was missing every goal, the member for Grayndler continued to assert that 5½ million households and businesses would get the NBN by 2016. Yet the former minister knew that that was untrue, as demonstrated by the draft 2013 NBN Co. corporate plan that he had received and, according to a leaked minute published in The Australian, presented to cabinet in July. 


Turning this project around is a formidable challenge, but we are determined to complete the project as quickly as we can, at the lowest possible cost to taxpayers, and affordably for consumers. And we are equally determined that in the rollout of the NBN, the many Australians without adequate fixed line broadband today, particularly in regional areas, receive top priority.




2. Progress 
and
 prospects of the current rollout



I will start by outlining the strategic review's findings regarding the previous government's NBN policy. Because the situation at NBN Co. is far worse than parliament and the public were led to believe, worse even than the most trenchant critics of the NBN imagined.




Rollout 
s
chedule



Construction of the network has fallen further and further behind schedule. At the end of September the NBN's fibre, satellite and wireless networks passed 384,000 homes and businesses.


That is barely three per cent of the 13 million premises NBN Co. must reach to finish the job.


It is only 45 per cent of the forecast for September in NBN Co.'s latest corporate plan.


And it is over a million premises behind Julia Gillard's rollout announcement in December 2010.


Because of construction delays, the strategic review estimates Labor's NBN will not be completed until 2024. That is 3½ years later than stated in the corporate plan, six years later than claimed in Labor's original fibre-to-the-premises plan in 2009, and 11 years later than promised by Kevin Rudd in 2007.




Service 
d
elays



The brownfield rollout—which is connecting homes and businesses in established areas—is in even worse shape. At the end of September 227,000 premises were 'passed' with fibre, which, in the language of the telecommunications sector, normally means the occupant can order a service and receive it within a few days.


But 74,000 were 'service class zero', a term unique to the NBN Co., which indicates that they cannot foreseeably obtain any service. These are mostly businesses and multidwelling premises such as apartment blocks. A further 104,000 were 'service class one', which indicates fibre has not yet been run from the street into the household or business. This can take six months or more, based on current experience. So the bottom line is that the occupants of fewer than one in four established premises 'passed' by fibre can order a service and expect to get it in a reasonable and predictable time span.




Costs and r
evenues



The cost of constructing the NBN to Labor's plans has also blown out. The strategic review estimates completing it requires peak funding of $73 billion—another $29 billion or 65 per cent beyond the cost forecast by the current corporate plan.


Unit costs for part of the network are twice as much as forecast, while NBN Co. is burdened by what the review frankly admits are excessive corporate overheads ramped up in anticipation of a level of construction and customer activity that never materialised.


The revenue assumptions made under Labor are also extremely optimistic, and entirely at odds with industry experience here or abroad. NBN Co. and its advisers found revenues between now and 2021 have been overstated by $13 billion compared to the midpoint of two more realistic revenue scenarios presented—one plausibly optimistic, and one plausibly pessimistic.




Retail prices



The exact impact of Labor's NBN on the price Australians pay for broadband depends on investment returns and retail service provider margins. But if NBN Co.'s goal is to earn the 7.1 per cent return promised by the previous government, and RSP margins remain unchanged in dollar terms, Labor's NBN will drive up retail prices by between 50 and 80 per cent. That means a $43 per month increase in the broadband bill paid by a typical Australian household. And that, of course, is perfectly obvious. If you seek to receive a particular internal rate of return and your project costs dramatically more to build, the price you have to charge your customers is going to be equally dramatically higher.


As I have noted previously, the most shocking aspect of the NBN is Labor's arrogant disregard for the devastating effect of price rises driven by their policy on the take-up of broadband among low-income households. Those opposite may not care, but the strategic review confirms the gravity of the problem.


To summarise, the cold hard facts about Labor's NBN are profoundly at odds with the fanciful tales and wishful thinking of those opposite. And it is important to note that achieving even these projections of higher costs and slower construction schedules requires a very significant improvement indeed in NBN Co.'s productivity and efficiency from the current levels. In the absence of such an improvement, outcomes would be materially worse.




3. Alternative 
o
ptions for the NBN



The second broad set of questions the finance minister and I assigned the strategic review involved exploring alternatives to the existing NBN, which as we have seen will cost billions more and take years longer to complete than was ever admitted to the public. The strategic review's baseline scenario is its revised outlook for the NBN proposed by Labor. Beyond this it considers five additional scenarios:


The second is a radical redesign of the all-fibre-to-the-premises NBN. This cuts one year and $9 billion off the peak funding, but at $64 billion it is no bargain.


The review examines three intermediate scenarios, which make increasing use of existing network infrastructure to cut costs to more reasonable levels.


The sixth and final scenario is an NBN utilising a optimised multitechnology-mix, or MTM, model. This optimises the rollout by choosing the most economically efficient technology in each locality according to its housing stock, existing infrastructure and user demand.


The scenario recommended by the NBN Co. is the last: the MTM model. But none of the scenarios can escape the irresponsible and wasteful current and future expenses locked in on Labor's watch. The NBN Co. strategic review team estimates the burden of these inescapable costs at $15 billion or more.




The MTM rollout



Under an MTM model 26 per cent of the premises in the fixed line footprint will receive very fast broadband over fibre to the premises. Another 44 per cent are served with fibre to the node, building or distribution point, while the last 30 per cent are served via upgraded HFC—the cable rolled out for pay TV in our capital cities in the late 1990s. HFC networks are capable of delivering hundreds of megabits per second today, just like fibre, but under Labor's plan Telstra and Optus were to be paid billions of dollars to switch them off.


The MTM scenario is the least expensive modelled scenario, requiring peak funding of $41 billion. This would still be the biggest and most expensive infrastructure project in our history and the largest single national broadband project in the world. Regrettably it will be many billions of dollars more expensive than it would have been had the MTM approach been taken from the outset. Labor has wasted billions which we can never recover.


An MTM network can be substantially completed by 2019—when 91 per cent of premises in the fixed line footprint will have access to download rates of 50 megabits per second or more, and between 65 and 75 per cent will have 100 megabits per second or more—and entirely finished by 2020.




Coalition Election Commitments



This means the coalition's goal of completing the NBN in the next six years—set out in our April policy, released long before we knew the truth about the damaged project we would inherit from Labor—can be achieved.


Disappointingly that is not the case for the objective we also expressed of delivering nationwide access to 25 megabits per second by 2016. The rollout is drastically further behind schedule than we expected in April. NBN Co.'s latest estimate of the established premises it will reach with fibre by June 2014 is only 357,000—772,000 fewer than claimed by Labor at the time of the election. And NBN Co. is in a far worse condition, its contractor relationships more damaged and its capacity to change course and assimilate new technologies more debilitated and diminished than even we allowed for.


A policy based on the strategic review's MTM scenario can, however, deliver very fast broadband to twice as many premises by 2016 as were ever going to receive it under Labor. Let me make this pledge on behalf of the government: we will work assiduously with NBN Co. to do everything we can to surpass the forecasts in the strategic review. Likewise, we remain determined to ensure our NBN connects those Australians, with the worst broadband in priority, unlike the NBN managed by our predecessors.




Broadband Quality



Upgrading from download rates of five megabits per second to 25 or 50 megabits per second would be welcomed by any internet user but, for those with limited or no access to adequate fixed broadband at all, it is transformational. Shortly we will publish the first ever analysis of broadband availability in Australia. It will confirm areas encompassing about 1½ million premises have little or no broadband. Many are in regional areas. All are victims of the lack of investment in fixed line communications by private carriers over the past six years, which is yet another damaging by-product of the gap between Labor's rhetoric and execution on broadband.


The critics of the coalition's approach to broadband have claimed that the coalition has not paid attention to the need for remediation of the existing copper plant that would be used in the hybrid model proposed by the company. As honourable members will see when studying this report, that matter has been taken most carefully into account by the authors of the report and very conservative assumptions have been taken about the level of proactive remediation of the copper network, an approach which is much more conservative than that adopted by comparable carriers.


Honourable members opposite have also argued that the endgame is fibre to the premises and that, in asserting that, therefore we should build fibre to the premises now rather than upgrade later. Even accepting the assumption that fibre to the premises is the endgame—and for reasons set out in the report you will see that there is a big question mark over that—as the report demonstrates, if the upgrade was only five years after the investment in fibre to the node it would still be a considerably wiser and more prudent economic decision. So the proposition of some honourable members that we should build fibre to the premises immediately, bluntly, fails to take into account the time value of money and the importance of flexibility and optionality in terms of emerging technologies.




Return on Investment



The review's preferred scenario saves $32 billion compared to business as usual under Labor. While that is the sort of number the Rudd and Gillard governments tossed around with abandon, it is a saving that makes a difference. It allows the network to earn a return roughly equal to the Commonwealth bond rate and ensures prices do not rise in real terms. This strategic review points the way to a new corporate plan, but it is not yet the new corporate plan. More work is required to set the NBN on a responsible and affordable course.


An important step in the reform of the NBN, announced today, is the appointment of a new chief executive officer, Mr Bill Morrow, currently the chief executive of Vodafone Australia. Mr Morrow is a very experienced telecom engineer and chief executive who has managed and, indeed, constructed telecom networks in America, Asia and Europe.




4. Cost Benefit Analysis and Review of Regulation



Part of the work that follows is a cost-benefit analysis of the economic and social returns from broadband and a review of the long-term regulation of the NBN Co. which will also inform the new corporate plan. The government is today announcing an experienced and distinguished panel to carry out that inquiry, which will report by June: it will be chaired by Dr Michael Vertigan AC, who will be joined by Ms Alison Deans, Dr Henry Ergas and Mr Tony Shaw.




5. Conclusion



I congratulate and thank the team at NBN Co. and its advisers who prepared the strategic review, which is the most thorough and objective analysis of the National Broadband Network ever provided to Australians—a highly professional piece of work prepared in a very tight time frame. The internal NBN Co. team was led by its Head of Strategy and Transformation, JB Rousselot, and ably supported by Tim Ebbeck and many others. The company's outside advisers were the Boston Consulting Group, who focused on the alternative models and the revenue model, Korda Mentha, who focused on the real costs and real time frames of the existing corporate plan model under Labor, and Deloitte, who coordinated this whole exercise. Valuable insights came from international experts, including Mike Galvin from Openreach in the UK and Mark Ratcliffe from Chorus in New Zealand. Finally, I want to thank the NBN Board and most of all its Executive Chairman, Dr Ziggy Switkowski.


Despite the delays and disappointments, the concept of a national broadband network remains popular. Australians want universal access to high-quality broadband and so does the government. But because of the misguided way the previous government embarked on this project as much as $15 billion has been unnecessarily spent to achieve this goal. And those dollars cannot be recovered. To date the NBN has been the most wasteful infrastructure project in our history.


But we are where we are. Let me assure the House that, under this government, we can complete this project as we promised—sooner, at less cost to taxpayers and more affordably for consumers. Our first step in that mission is to end the spin and wishful thinking and embrace reality. This is the beginning of the era of truth on broadband, the beginning of an era when we will have facts to work with, objective analysis instead of political spin. This is the welcome-to-the-real-world moment for the NBN.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (12:16):  Well might the minister say, 'Welcome to the real world.' We say, 'Welcome to the world of broken promises.' Today is a day that the government will rue for a very long time. Today the Abbott government is breaking one of the biggest and most important promises that it made in the last election campaign. This government has been in office for barely three months—a little over 90 days—and yet it is breaking promises left, right and centre: first on debt, then on boats, two weeks ago on education and now on the NBN. This is a betrayal, a broken promise that will hang like an albatross around this minister's neck. It is an unforgivable broken promise and this government will be punished by the electorate for it. Remember the press conference with Sonny Bill Williams in April of this year? A press conference with the virtual Sonny Bill, the now minister and the now Prime Minister at which the Prime Minister uttered these immortal words: 'Under the coalition by 2016 there will be minimum download speeds of 25 megabits,'—not anymore. And these: 'We will deliver a minimum 25 megabits by the end of our first term.' Today they are breaking that promise.


Before the election they promised: 'No excuses.' Today we get a tawdry list of excuses from this minister. Before the election they said: 'No surprises.' Today we get the worst of all surprises from this government. Remember the words of the Prime Minister when he said, 'I do not intend on making promises I won't keep.'? He has broken a whopper today. It was one of the biggest and most important promises that the government made—and the minister, from the look on his face, knows it—to the Australian people at the last election. What it means is that you cannot believe anything that this government says—not on debt, not on boats, not on education, not on the NBN. Nothing they say is worth two bob.


Here is the truth. I seek leave to table the NBN Co.'s assessment of the coalition's broadband policy prepared during the caretaker period.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  Is leave granted?




Mr Turnbull:
  No.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Leave is not granted.




Mr CLARE:
  The minister for transparency has just told us exactly what we need to know. This was never about getting us all the information; this was always a stitch up. If he was ever interested in the truth he would be prepared to allow us to table this document now.




Mr Turnbull:
  Deputy Speaker, a point of order: the honourable member has accused the authors of the NBN Co. report of authoring a stitch up. The member has accused Korda Mentha, Deloitte, Boston Consulting Group of a stitch up and he should withdraw.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  That is not a point of order.




Mr CLARE:
  I am holding the real strategic review of the coalition's dodgy second-rate NBN plan. It is the unadulterated, unamended, uncensored version of the coalition's plan. It was written before the minister sacked the experts at the NBN and put his mates in charge. It is the report that the minister does not want the people of Australia to see. It is the secret advice that was given to the minister in his first weeks in the job but he never released until today.


The minister says that this is an old report: it is dated Friday, 20 September. It is a 154-page document, very detailed, and, funnily enough, it does not say what the minister just said. It paints a very different picture. It is a scathing document, scathing of the coalition's plan. First, it says building the NBN in two stages is the wrong approach and is 'not recommended'. It says it would cost more and take longer. Second, it says the coalition's election promise that all Australians will have access to speeds of 25 megabits by 2016 is 'unlikely to happen'. Now we know why they said that.




Mr Husic:
  Out of his own mouth!




Mr CLARE:
  Out of the minister's own mouth, indeed. Third, it says the coalition's plan will result in lower revenues of up to 30 per cent, which will impact on the ability of NBN Co. to raise debt. Fourth, it says no-one knows how much it will cost to fix Telstra's old copper network so it can be used for the NBN—not Telstra, not the government and not NBN Co. Fifth, it also says that the cost of maintaining the copper network is estimated between $600 million and $900 million per year. That is between $6 billion and $9 billion over the next decade just to maintain the old copper network. Sixth, it says the coalition's promise of minimum speeds of 50 megabits per second by 2019 cannot be guaranteed using copper. Seventh, it says the coalition's slower speeds would compromise the provision of tele-health, distance education and other business applications.


So, all up, what does this report say? It says the coalition's plan is a dud. It was a dud in April and it is more than a dud now. It is a litany of betrayal by this government, which promised one thing before the election and which is now, after having perpetrated a deceit on the Australian people, breaking its promise today. What we know in this document and what has been proven by what the minister has said today is that the NBN will now take longer to build than promised before the election; it will make less money; and it will not meet the needs of business or families. In the end, we are going to have to come back and finish the job.


The minister has said a lot about costs in his speech, and we should not be surprised. Remember: the capital cost of building the NBN has been outlined in the NBN Co.'s corporate plans. In the corporate plan 2012-15 it was $37.4 billion. In the corporate plan 2013-16, leaked to the Australian Financial Review, it was $37.4 billion. In version 13 of the corporate plan, which was prepared by NBN Co., given to the board on 20 September and is sitting on the minister’s desk right now but not released, it is $37.4 billion. All of these accounts have been ticked off not just by the company but also by the board—including two members of the board who were there in September and have been there for all of these corporate plans—and have been audited and verified by the Australian National Audit Office, by Ernst and Young and by KPMG. So these costs are verified in government, Finance, Treasury as well as these other organisations, and now, suddenly, it has all changed. Suddenly, the experts have been sacked. People have been brought back in and we have got a different answer.


Some people might be surprised that all of this information is now out of date, but I am not. For the last few weeks, I have been warning the Australian public that this would happen. I did it again on the doors today, and I have been proven correct today. You only have to look at what Brad Orgill said in a column that he wrote for the Financial Review a few weeks ago to know why this is the case. This is what Mr Orgill said:


Selective data, conservative assumptions and extrapolations out to 2021 could be formulated to argue why the NBN might have comprehensively blown out its costs and not achieved its objective. It would be a continuation of the Coalition's attacks from opposition on NBN management and the board including threatening a Royal Commission of Inquiry.


In other words, change the assumptions and you get a different result. You do not have to think hard to see how this has been done. Mike Quigley, the former CEO that the minister likes so much, said this last week: 


Rates to build the fibre network based on the existing design and architecture were rising. But those rate increases would not have produced a cost increase because we had identified and validated, network and design changes that would have offset those increases.


He goes on:


Which is why I find it incomprehensible to hear the suggestion that the increases in LN/DN rates should be built into the forward projections and cost reductions that have already been identified, should not be.


Here is the killer:


Unless, of course, your objective is to try to confirm a pre-conceived position.


The minister in his contribution talked a little bit about copper and the work that has been done in the strategic review to cost that copper. The fact is that, in this report, there is no detail about the exact amount that it would cost to fix and then to maintain the copper network. Three weeks ago the minister said at a CommsDay conference:


We want hand on heart true, realistic and achievable options prudently costed and scoped on which we can make weighty decisions.


My argument to the parliament today is that this report does not do this. It fails to provide this information. It fails to provide the exact information we need on how much it will cost to fix and then to maintain the old copper network. It gives estimates. It gives international comparisons. It gives, as the minister has just said, conservative assumptions. It does not reveal them and does not provide us with the information we need.


This report, which the minister will not let me table in parliament, does. It tells us that the cost of maintaining the old copper network could be between $600 million and $900 million a year. So it is between $6 billion and $10 billion to maintain the old copper network over the next decade. My argument to the parliament is: would that money not be better invested in building a fibre network than keeping the old copper network going?


The most important thing today, the most important thing in the report and the most important thing in the contribution that the minister has made today is the admission that he is breaking a promise to the Australian people. This is not the only broken promise that he has made today, but it is worth remembering that it is still on the Liberal Party's website. It might not be now; it was when I came down to the parliament. This is from the Liberal Party's website:


Download speeds of between 25 and 100 megabits per second by the end of 2016 and 50 to 100 megabits per second by 2019.




Mr Husic:
  Not anymore.




Mr CLARE:
  Not anymore. But, as I said, it is not the only broken promise here. The minister has also said that he is going to pare back the number of houses that are going to get fibre to the node. In the policy that he put out before the election, he said that 8,968,000 people will get fibre to the node—you know this is true; 71 per cent of the population, now, gone. All the rest of those people are going to have to rely on the HFC network. The minister said that he is going to fill the gaps there. But will it be an open access network? And who is going to pay to connect the coax from the pole to people's houses? Is it you? Is it NBN Co.? Is it the people who live in those houses? And, if they do, well, who is going to pay that extra money? The minister has promised that this would be a faster, cheaper NBN. What we are getting here is a slower, potentially more expensive NBN—slower because internet speeds will be slower under this model than they would be under ours, slower because this minister has just broken a promise to deliver it by 2016 and, potentially, dearer because people in the bush are going to pay more than people in the city.


This is the biggest and most important infrastructure project in Australia. Remember: we sit on the edge of what will be the biggest middle class that the world has ever seen. Our challenge in this parliament is to make the most of it. We often call this the Asian century; it is also a digital century. The wealthiest countries in the decades ahead will be the smartest countries, the countries with the best educated workforces, with the best access to information and with the infrastructure to drive that. That is why the NBN is so important. It is the engine that drives jobs, creates companies, builds productivity, increases trade and makes us a stronger economy and a fairer country. It will help to build the Australia of our imagination.


Now, because the NBN is so important, it is important that it be done right, and that means using fibre, not copper which we are going to have to come back and replace down the track. The minister keeps telling us what the old, decaying economies of Europe are doing. That might be right; they might be investing in maintaining their copper. But we are not part of Europe. We are part of Asia, the dynamic and growing Asian region, and this region is investing in fibre. Japan, South Korea and Singapore are all investing in fibre to the premises. So is New Zealand and so should we; otherwise, we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage. We will be left behind with a second-class, second-rate national broadband network and, we learned today, one that will not be delivered on time. Of all days to learn this, it is the day after finding out that Holden is shutting its doors, when we should be thinking ahead, thinking about the future, thinking about where we invest to make sure we have a strategic advantage and can compete in the Asian century to set ourselves up for the future. This government is not doing that.


I have said this before but it is worth saying again. When Robert Menzies was in opposition in 1949, he was one of the biggest critics of the Snowy Hydro scheme. He criticised it up hill and down dale. Two months before the 1949 election, Menzies refused to attend the launch of the Snowy Hydro scheme; but, when he became Prime Minister, he changed his mind. He supported it, he funded it and he built it. At the opening of, I think it was, the Tumut dam project in the fifties, he said:


In a period in which we in Australia are still, I think, handicapped by parochialism, by a slight distrust of big ideas, of big people or of big enterprises … this scheme is teaching us and everybody in Australia to think in a big way, to be thankful for big things, to be proud of big enterprises and … to be thankful for big men.


Menzies was a big man, but there are not too many 'big men' on that side of the parliament, just broken promises, one after the other—debt, boats, education and now the NBN.


We have a Prime Minister who does not understand how important the NBN is, how important this infrastructure is. He has described it as 'essentially a video entertainment system'. In TheWashington Post only a few weeks ago, he called it 'wacko'. But he has also described himself as 'the infrastructure Prime Minister'. If you are going to be 'the infrastructure Prime Minister of Australia', then you need to build the infrastructure of the 21st century, the infrastructure that Australia needs—and guess what? That is what this is. That is what the NBN is. It is quintessentially the infrastructure of the 21st century, and you cannot be 'the infrastructure minister' or 'the infrastructure Prime Minister' unless you are investing in building the biggest and most important infrastructure project in Australia.


Today, Paul Keating is visiting Parliament House for only the third time since he retired. Paul Keating, like Menzies, knew the importance of the big calls in government and getting the big calls right. It was his decisions that set Australia up for a staggering 20 years or more of uninterrupted economic growth. In large part, Paul Keating built modern Australia. He built the Australia that we are living in today. The big decision we need to make today is whether we are going to build the infrastructure that we need for the next century or just for the next few years. Our responsibility is to govern not just for this generation but for the ones that follow. The pace of change and the challenges ahead demand it, and there is no better example of this than the National Broadband Network. Menzies knew it, Keating knew it and we know it, but this government obviously does not. Today they have made a very big mistake. They have betrayed the trust that was put in them by the Australian people, and for that you can be sure they will be judged very harshly.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (12:35):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill seeks to redress implementation concerns with legislation introduced by the previous government. As part of the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the former government announced that from 1 April 2014, the government's contribution to an individual's private health insurance rebate would be capped and effectively reduced over time as a proportion of the premium.


The previous government's legislation caps the Australian government rebate by setting a base premium for every type of insurance product on the market, and then indexes the rebate payable for every type of private health insurance product subgroup by the lesser of the increase in the CPI or the increase in the commercial premium for each product subgroup.


It was the third measure introduced by the previous government to reduce rebates available to people with private health insurance, but it also introduced additional complexity.


Industry has expressed concern that the planned administration of the base premium act at a product level was unduly complicated, difficult and costly to implement and would be difficult for consumers to understand. Industry has advised that there are over 34,000 policies on the market and the burden placed on private health insurers to comply with the application of a unique rebate for each policy type is estimated to be more than $15 million in implementation costs alone.


The Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 simplifies current implementation arrangements for indexing the government's contribution to the rebate by amending the Private Health Insurance Act 2007to create a single adjustment factor under a legislative instrument. The rebate will be adjusted uniformly across all insurance policies each 1 April by a factor to be determined in accordance with the Private Health Insurance (Incentives) Rules made under section 333-20 of the Private Health Insurance Act 2007. The adjustment factor will be a ratio representing the proportion of the increase in the CPI compared to the average private health insurance premium increase. The adjustment will apply to premiums that are paid or payable in the 12 months starting on that 1 April.


This arrangement will be easier for consumers to understand and for insurers to implement.


Industry has advised that this bill will result in administrative savings of around 80 per cent below the costs to implement the previous Labor government's base premium act.


The bill is also making a minor amendment to the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to clarify that a restricted access group can include one or more classes of people as defined within the Private Health Insurance (Registration) Rules.


Debate adjourned.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (13:45):  Today the High Court has ruled on the validity of the Marriage Equality (Same Sex) Act 2013, an act of the Legislative Assembly of the ACT. It held that the territory was unable to make such laws. It found that section 51(xxi) of the Constitution gives the federal parliament power to pass a law providing for same-sex marriage. We can presume that the government or the Prime Minister brought the appeal to the High Court on the presumption that it is proper that this parliament should consider such laws.


In February last year I brought a private member's bill before this parliament which would have provided for marriage equality. The bill did not succeed, and the reason it did not succeed is that members of the coalition were not given a conscience vote on the issue.


I believe that on this issue members of this place are lagging behind public opinion. I believe we are different but equal and we should not be differently equal before the laws of this place. I call on members opposite and I call on the government to allow its members to have a conscience vote on this issue when a bill is next brought before us.

 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:00):  As the House would know, along with the Leader of the Opposition I had the honour of travelling to South Africa to represent our country at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela. I have to say that it had, as is fitting, the air of a celebration much more than the air of a funeral. While we were sorry to see him leave us, we were thrilled that he had had such a long life full of such splendid example. Nelson Mandela was not only the father of modern South Africa but also one of the giants of the 20th century. He taught the world how to forgive and he taught the leaders of Africa how to leave office peacefully. These are very substantial lessons indeed. 


As President Barack Obama said in his splendid panegyric, what seems obvious and inevitable to us now seemed impossible when Nelson Mandela began his long campaign. To us, a democratic, multiracial South Africa seems the natural order of things but in the mid-1960s it must have seemed an impossible dream. But it was achieved because one man had the guts, the decency and the idealism to fix on this and to see it through to the very end. Whatever the hardship, whatever the risk, whatever the difficulty, he was determined to see it through.


All the people of modern South Africa, all the people of Africa and indeed all of us everywhere are the better off for his life. He was a man in form—he was a person who achieved extraordinary things although he was always at pains to point out he was just an ordinary man. The lesson that we take from his life is that we can all do extraordinary things if we have the courage to dream, if we strive constantly to be not just what we want to be but to be always our best selves. He will be missed, not just by the people of South Africa but by the people of Australia too.

Nelson Mandela was arguably one of the world's greatest figures of our time. It is true what many have said this week in Johannesburg, that we will never see his like again.


In troubled times in South Africa Nelson Mandela stood tall. He led his nation out of an incredibly difficult time; not with a violent struggle but with peace, compassion and the force of moral leadership. It is impossible to imagine what 27 years in prison would do to one's spirit, but in the case Nelson Mandela it steeled his resolve. He suffered so his people could be free. Nelson Mandela was a symbol to the rest of the world. He achieved perhaps more than any other world leader in his pursuit of peace, acceptance and justice. His example to all of us is as powerful today as it was 20 years ago when he was released from prison. The slow struggle for reconciliation does not end with Mandela's passing, not for South Africa and not for any of us. Let us renew our resolve for reconciliation. Let us think of Nelson Mandela in hard times and forge on with his strength in our hearts. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, his country and all of those who look to him and hope for a better world.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:06):  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because this is a very serious subject. As I have said before and will say again, these are sad times for everyone associated with Holden—the workers, the families of the workers and the communities where the major Holden installations are based.


As members on both sides of the chamber would know, governments of both persuasions have offered very considerable support to the motor industry over the years and certainly this government stood ready and stands ready to continue to offer very significant support to the motor industry. The difficulty is that, as the local MD of Holden, Mike Devereux, made clear on radio today, Holden's difficulties have been building up over many, many years. The truth is, as the Holden spokesman said publicly yesterday, 'It would be wrong to simply attribute their departure—

The SPEAKER:  The question was concerning the closure of Holden. I call the Prime Minister.




Mr ABBOTT:
  As the spokesman for Holden said yesterday, 'It would be wrong to simply attribute it'—that is to say, this impending closure—'to action or inaction on the part of the government.' So there we have it: 'It would be simply wrong to attribute it to action or inaction on the part of the government.' I am not seeking to play the blame game here, I am not seeking to play politics here and I think it would raise the reputation of the Leader of the Opposition if he did likewise. I had several meetings with the motor industry as Leader of the Opposition, including with Mr Devereux, and since the election there have been regular meetings between the Minister for Industry and the Holden company.

 (Wide Bay—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (14:21):  I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his keen interest in the economic development of his area and indeed all parts of Victoria and, for that matter, all other Australian states. The coalition is getting on with the business of providing the economic infrastructure that is so important to building a strong economy and a strong nation.


In the member's home state of Victoria there have already been a number of significant announcements about major new road projects. The East-West Link to which the Commonwealth has committed to provide $1.5 billion will certainly make a big difference to traffic flows in central Melbourne. That is an important project that is illustrative of the work that we intend to do to help make our economic infrastructure able to support stronger economies, jobs growth and additional community infrastructure right across the state.


In South Australia, we have also made announcements in relation to the north-south road and our commitment to improve that corridor and make a real difference to Adelaide and its capability to service growing industry. They are part of a comprehensive national plan. We intend to make further announcements about our commitments to economic infrastructure over the days and months ahead to build a strong national road and transport network that can deliver the very best possible results for our nation.


The coalition has also announced $342 million worth of projects under our community development grants program. That includes 86 projects worth $53 million in Victoria and a further 19 projects worth $26 million in South Australia. Those sorts of projects will help local communities to get some of the important economic and social infrastructure that they need to be strong even when their communities suffer setbacks, and particularly setbacks associated the closures of important industries.


The question asked about the impediments that there are to delivering this kind of important economic infrastructure, and they are obvious. There are impediments like the mining tax and the carbon tax, taxes that we are trying to get rid of because they hold back industry in this country but taxes that the Labor Party seem to want to entrench in our economy. Labor seems to have lost track of the fact that if you want to have a strong economy it has to have strong economic infrastructure to support it. It needs the taxes that impede industry removed. It is time that Labor got out of the way and let us deliver on this important economic reform.

I do appreciate the diligence with which he works for the industries in his area of North Queensland in particular. It is the diligence which is shared by members on all sides of this House. All of us want to ensure that the industries in our electorates and the workers who we know and respect have the best possible future. We all accept that, and I certainly would not, for a second, attack the sincerity, the goodwill, the fair mindedness and the decency of the member for Kennedy. Nor do I attack the fair mindedness and the decency—and the good intentions, at least—of everyone in this House.


But I do have to say to the member for Kennedy that for a long time now on both sides of politics we have accepted a floating dollar, and the member for Kennedy is right that a floating dollar went down in the middle of the 1990s. A floating dollar has gone up in more recent times to a level that did make it extremely difficult for many of our manufacturers to compete. But I am pleased to say that what goes up can come down, and the floating dollar is now down to about 90c, a level which makes it much easier for our manufacturers and for our exporters. I support the floating dollar just as, it seems, the member for Kennedy supported the floating dollar, at least when it was low in the mid-1990s. Just as well that the Reserve Bank has been, in effect, recapitalised to the tune of $8 billion because that enables the Reserve Bank to intervene prudently and appropriately in the market to try to ensure that the Australian dollar is at the best possible level.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:53):  by leave—I move:


That the House censures the Prime Minister for doing nothing as Holden leaves Australia after 65 years and for failing to save Australian workers from job losses and in particular for:


(1) failing to do everything he could to keep Holden in Australia;


(2) failing to sit down, face to face, with Holden and work through what was needed to support Holden jobs;


(3) persisting with a $500 million cut to Australia's automotive industry even after receiving Holden's business case that would have saved Holden jobs;


(4) setting up a Productivity Commission inquiry with a reporting date in 2014 after the South Australian election when Holden needed immediate answers and immediate assistance;


(5) failing to lead a Government united in supporting Holden and protecting Australian manufacturing jobs;


(6) allowing his Ministers to encourage Holden to leave Australia;


(7) failing to have any strategy and any plan to support Holden workers who have lost their job two weeks before Christmas; and 


(8) having no plan for Australian jobs, other than a plan to cut wages.


I believe it is crucial for this parliament, today, on the last day that the parliament is sitting, to censure the Prime Minister for not having a plan to save the Australian automotive industry. We have been told by the government that this is not a day of doom and gloom. Only a person who is not working at Holden or in the car components industry could adopt such a pollyanna, head-in-the-sky attitude.


Labor, the opposition, believe that we can have a car industry in this Australia. We believe that it is up to a government to assist to maintain manufacturing jobs in this country. One reason for censuring this Prime Minister is that, unlike Labor, unlike many Australians, the Prime Minister has made a decision by his inaction to not have a car industry in Australia. Today we asked if the Prime Minister even met with the leadership of Holden to talk about this issue—whether he had had not three meetings, not two meetings, but even a single meeting. But, when it comes to car manufacturing, we get no support for Australian car workers. We are having a censure motion today because this government and this Prime Minister are doing nothing to save the car industry. They have decided that competing with the rest of the world is too hard for Australia. They have a 'little Australia' mentality which says that we cannot manufacture cars in this country.


Most of all, we seek to censure the Prime Minister because he promised before the election that the car industry would be better off under Liberal. What he never said—what is in the fine print—is that the only reason he could say the car industry would be better off under the coalition is that there would be no car industry under the coalition and therefore he would never have to prove his case.


There are things which this government could have done. The cynical defence of the government about the Holden news, their case, essentially comes down to this: we are a First World country, and it is hard to make cars in a First World country. We have a global market and a high dollar; therefore it is just all too hard! This parliament should reject this shoulder-shrugging, responsibility-self-absolving government and their dereliction—they say, 'It is too hard to help.' The managing director of Holden made it clear in June. He said, 'If the incoming government, the coalition, were to keep the same policies as Labor, then we could do business.' Of course, what he did not count on is that the coalition never intended to do business.


Why is it that other First World countries can support their car industry more generously than we already do—and that is still too much for this government? In Germany: First World wages. Don’t blame the workers for the wages. In the United States: First World wages. Those governments support their car industry. In Australia we would not have to pay the sorts of subsidies they pay in Germany and the United States. But I can tell you one thing that you will get when you vote for Labor at the ballot box in three years. At least we will stand by manufacturing workers when you vote Labor. We understand the cost. We do not accept that life is too hard. We do not accept that things just happen—that life is not always beer and skittles. We do not accept that, as some in the government do—even those representing motor-car-making electorates. We will never give up on your voters, even if you will not defend them. The government have failed to do everything they can.


The government would have you believe it is just too hard in the modern world to make cars in Australia—it is just too hard. Is it too hard to have a meeting with Holden? I think not. Is it too hard to try and keep to your basic promises on the car industry? I think not. And is it too hard, even, to back up your industry minister? Let me make it clear: we are not censuring Ian Macfarlane. He might not have won the debate, but, from the very judicious leaking and backgrounding from his team of colleagues, at least we know he put up half a fight to defend the car industry.


Not only has this mob opposite failed to do enough, not only has the Prime Minister has been missing in action when it comes to saving hundreds of thousands of jobs—




Mr Hockey:
  Hundreds of thousands?




Mr SHORTEN:
  My advice to the Treasurer is this: stay silent and leave some of us in doubt as to your capacity. Do not speak and convince us. 


There are 3,000 direct jobs at Holden. I do not know if the Treasurer has ever lifted the bonnet of a motor car, but if he had he would have seen that there are a lot of working parts, and they get made by component companies. Components are not all made by robots. They are not all made in Third World countries. They are made in Dandenong, in Bayswater and in South Australia. They are even made in Corangamite.


What we have is a government that has failed to do what it should have done. The Prime Minister cannot ring; he cannot talk to Holden. Those opposite do not even know how many people work in the industry. They cannot back their industry minister. They are certainly happy to background against the industry minister. They cannot even do what the Germans and the Americans do. This is world news: the Germans and the Americans, who subsidise their industries to levels that Labor would not recommend, at least back their industry.


Let me tell you why this Prime Minister should be censured. Holden has been here since 1948. It was a Labor Prime Minister, on 29 November, who waved hello to the first Holden motor car. It will be a Liberal Prime Minister who waves goodbye to the last Holden. Holden has been a good company to Australia.



Honourable members interjecting—

Mr SHORTEN:
  Holden have been a good company to this country. They deserve better than the schoolyard baiting and taunting of the Treasurer of Australia. On Wednesday we saw the Treasurer of Australia, puffed up and proud, saying, 'We're not going to be played in a game of bluff by Holden.' He was right. He was not up to playing a game of poker with them. Joe Hockey called their bluff and now he has thousands of jobs around his neck.


His failure and that of the Prime Minister to keep Holden will be a defining moment of this government. The brand of Holden used to mean motor cars; now it means coalition job cuts. Let us not, in all of this process, blame the workers. We have seen sinister anti-worker attacks by some opposite, creeping from under the rocks. I acknowledge that the Prime Minister said, 'We don't blame the workers.' It is a shame, Prime Minister, that the members behind you are saying, 'They're paid too much.' In what could only be a brain snap a certain Liberal powerbroker backbencher from New South Wales—the member for Mitchell—tweeted that Holden workers are paid three times too much. They say that a tweet and its twit are soon separated. They certainly are! The member for Mitchell said that Holden workers are paid three times what they should be paid. The base rate of a Holden worker is $48,000. What a marvellous industrial relations prescription we have running on the back bench!


Let's not blame the workers. Let us acknowledge that this government has not done what it should have done for these jobs. Let us acknowledge also that there will be a real cost—I do not mean an electoral cost—in terms of thousands of jobs. There are 2,900 direct employees of Holden but how many component workers are supplying that Holden factory—making every part of that motor car? Treasurer, there are thousands more. That you do not know means that you should hang your head in shame.


Let's look at this marvellous saving that these economic rationalists opposite are talking about. They have said: 'We've outsmarted Holden. We're not going to give them $120 million. We're too smart; we're the coalition.' How much extra will those on the other side of the chamber pay in unemployment benefits and forgone taxes? 


I know that most members opposite, at the human level, if they have had a family member who has lost a job would appreciate this point. Perhaps a couple over there would not but most of them would. They would appreciate the pressure on families. I have seen it when people have lost their jobs and I am sure some opposite have, too. Wait until mum and dad come home and they see the decision by Holden. The kids will be asking, 'What does this mean for our jobs?' Mum and dad will say, 'We've got a government that's too spineless to stand up for us, who won't find the money; but, do you know what?—we'll have to pay more taxes to pay for the retraining.' I love it! 


Out in Senator-Abetz-land, he is saying, 'It'll be all right for those Holden workers. They can go to work in a uranium mine that has not yet started in the middle of the South Australian desert at Olympic Dam.' 




Mr Joyce:
  That's somebody's job.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Fantastic! There goes the 'Minister for GrainCorp, chirping in again. He says, 'That'll do.' If you are an assembly-line worker who has spent 20 years at Elizabeth do you reckon you are ready to be retrained? They are skilled people— 



Mr Joyce interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  The redder and the louder you get, the argument does not get better, Sunshine.


This is not helping the workers. The government have told us this is an inevitability. They have said, 'Everyone knew this was going to happen. This has been a sure thing.' As we know, the Prime Minister says, 'Things happen in life.' If this has been such a foregone conclusion for so long, why don't they have a plan B, today? Where are all their bright ideas? I know they can scrap the carbon tax and the mining tax; how about helping workers get retrained?


This is why we censure the Prime Minister. Before the election, never in my wildest imagination would I have suspected that there would be such a cowardly performance by the government in surrendering manufacturing. There is an attitude from those opposite who say that modern First World countries do not make things anymore. Well, they are wrong.


I am happy to attend, with the Prime Minister, a meeting with the workers at Elizabeth. Let's go and talk with them. Let's go and talk to Holden workers together—you and me and the workers. We can talk. You can tell them all of your facts. You can tell them all your fine words. You can quote Christopher Pyne saying that today is not a day of doom and gloom. What I will say to the workers, the small businesses, the apprentices and the families of all these people who are displaced, is that if Labor had been in government we would not have let this happen.


We do not give up on manufacturing. We do not think that 'manufacturing' is a dirty word. Why on earth would this government say, of all things, 'it's too hard'? The real concern I have is not just the Holden workforce and the component workforce but what will happen with Toyota next. Look at this group opposite! All of you are the people who have decided we will no longer make cars in Australia. You have managed in three months to get rid of what it took Australia 65 years to build up. You are the wreckers of the car industry, you are the destroyers of jobs. Never could I have imagined before the last election, when recommending to people that they voted for us, that the problem was that if you got Tony Abbott you would lose a car industry. Even I would have thought that was an exaggeration.


But what we discovered yesterday and today is an administration sufficiently cynical that they fundamentally believe that they can sell a message to the Australian people that the world is too hard to compete in, that we cannot manufacture in Australia any more, that, if you pay people First World wages, somehow we cannot manufacture. This mob opposite have surrendered on Holden and the car industry—and let us not even list all the other jobs that have gone. You have been a busy government in three months. Electrolux, Simplot, CSIRO, Caterpillar, Peabody—you have a rollcall of jobs. But you will never ever shrug the shame: Holden has gone on your watch, and the car industry is in deep distress on your watch. This Prime Minister should be censured for giving up on Australian manufacturing jobs.



The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?




Mr Brendan O'Connor:
  I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (15:09):  I absolutely accept that the Leader of the Opposition is upset, disappointed, frustrated and angry. We are all upset to see Holden go. But there is one side of this parliament which is trying to help the motor industry, and there is another side which is playing politics. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that outrage is all very well for a union leader but it is not good enough for an alternative Prime Minister of this country. The Leader of the Opposition says that this would not have happened under Labor. But it did. Under Labor Prime Minister Gillard committed $275 billion to Holden and said Holden's future was secured for 10 years. It was not secured and the money did not work.


I say to the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite that we have tried throwing money at the motor industry but it just does not work. What we need to do if we are going to help the motor industry and the other manufacturing industries of this country is get the fundamentals right. We need to get taxes down, we need to get regulation down and we need to ensure that the great workers of Australia are unshackled and are able to be not just amongst the best paid workers in the world but amongst the most productive workers in the world. And that is what will happen under this government.


I hate to disturb the Leader of the Opposition with the facts, but the facts are that since the start of 2008 a manufacturing job has been lost every 19 minutes. That is what happened when members opposite were in power. That is what happened when members opposite were throwing $275 million at Holden—to no avail. What we need to do is approach this problem in a calm, considered and constructive way—and that is exactly what this government is doing. We started our campaign to help the motor industry by abolishing Labor's $1.8 billion fringe benefits tax hit on them. We are continuing our campaign to help the motor industry by abolishing the carbon tax, which adds $400 to the cost of every car produced in Australia, which damages domestic manufacturing and disadvantages it compared to foreign imports.


So there is one side which is doing what it can to help, and there is another side which is simply playing politics with this issue. Frankly, the Leader of the Opposition should be bigger than that. Until three months ago the Leader of the Opposition was a senior minister in a government which could not save Mitsubishi, which could not save Ford and which did not save Holden—even though they said they had saved Holden and even though they had spent $275 million extra trying to do it. Members opposite were completely shameless. I refer the House to a letter from the member for Wakefield, Mr Champion:


I have secured guaranteed support for Holden … ensuring production until 2022.


Why is it our job to save Holden when he said it was already saved, and when he invested $275 million which simply did not do the job?


I accept that this is a difficult time for manufacturing. I accept that this is a particularly devastating time for people employed by Holden—as it was earlier in the year for people employed by Ford. But I have faith in those workers, I have faith in our country and I have faith in the employers of this country. I am confident that, when the right policies are put in place, there will be jobs for those workers—because they are good people and they have a future in a strong and successful manufacturing economy.


The difficulty the Leader of the Opposition has is that he is arguing a case which not even Holden itself is arguing. He is arguing that, somehow, the problems of Holden in Australia are absolutely unique, and he is arguing that the problems of Holden are somehow uniquely caused by this government, a government that has been in place for less than three months. It is nothing to do with the government that was in place for six years and did not save Mitsubishi and did not save Ford and did not save Holden. It is all the fault of this government. I commend Mike Devereux for pointing out that Holden, in this country, has been hit by a perfect storm—high costs, high dollar and small markets. It has been hit by a perfect storm and, of course, Holden worldwide is in the middle of a restructure. I have faith in the workers of this country. I have faith in the companies of this country. I refuse to accept, as members opposite accept, as the Leader of the Opposition does, that the only way the workers of this country can be competitive and successful is with a massive ongoing government subsidy. I think the workers and the businesses of this country are better than that.


We will do what we can to ensure that the workers of this country, the businesses of this country, have a strong, profitable, viable and competitive future. We will do what we can to ensure that Holden and Ford workers, when they are no longer with those companies in 2016 and 2017, get the best possible economy in which to move. We will do our best to ensure that they are moving from one job to another job, that they are moving from a good job to a better job, that they are moving from a business that required subsidy to a business that does not require subsidy.



Mr Perrett interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Moreton.




Mr ABBOTT:
  That is what we will do, and we will make available the kind of funding—



Mr Perrett interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Moreton is warned.




Mr ABBOTT:
  which governments in the past have made available in areas that have been hit by this kind of restructuring. We will make that money available to try to ensure that Adelaide and Geelong and western Melbourne have the kind of dynamic, viable, ongoing businesses into which these skilled, hard-working and adaptable workers can move. There are industries where we are competitive—in manufacturing for the mining industry, in niche manufacturing and in R&D. All of these things we can compete in—in tourism, in agriculture and in mining. We can compete in all of those industries.


The loss of BHP was a much more dramatic problem for Newcastle than the loss of Holden will be for western Melbourne and for Adelaide. Because government made sensible investments, because people did not give up hope and because we did not have the gloom and doom being preached by the Leader of the Opposition, those workers found a future and that city found a future, just as Adelaide and outer metropolitan Melbourne will find a future, and can have a future under a government which respects workers and will do the right thing by them.


The best thing we can do for the workers of this country is to ensure that taxes are low, that regulation is low and that productivity is high. That is what we are doing. Unfortunately, every single thing that we are doing to help the manufacturing workers of this country is being blocked by members opposite. Stop trying to put shackles on the workers of this country, give them a chance and back the policies of this government.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2013-12-12,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (15:19):  I seconded the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition and I did so because this government has been derelict in its duty to look after thousands of workers in this country. Today, the Prime Minister's response to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition as to whether he had sat down, as Prime Minister of this country, to talk to the senior management of Holden was that he had not. He did not because he, along with his front bench ministers, has shown no regard for the future of this company and the future of its workers since before the election and certainly after. The difference between what happened before the election and now is that there was a feigned interest, a feigned sincerity, for Australian workers.


In fact for four years we had the Prime Minister as the then Leader of the Opposition visit every workplace in the country that he could possibly find to stand next to Australian workers or, indeed, stand in front of them and use them as a prop, as he said that he was concerned for their jobs. Well, what we have seen since this government was elected is, time and time again, a government that is totally disengaged, or worse, a government, through the auspices of the Treasurer, that is willing to goad a company to leave this country. That is what we saw on Tuesday. On Tuesday, before any decision was made by Holden to leave this country, we had the Treasurer stand up in this place and dare that company to leave. Well, Joe, you got your way. The company is leaving this country, and that is a dreadful shame.


In the last two weeks what we have seen are, indeed, some very terrible decisions that will impact on Australian workers. Two weeks ago Rio Tinto made a decision that will, of course, affect up to 1,200 jobs in Gove by closing down alumina production in Gove, which will obliterate, socially and economically, Nhulunbuy. Last week Qantas announced a 1,000-job reduction; and, of course, yesterday Holden made its decision, which will have the direct impact of 2,900 workers losing their jobs in this country. But there is more to come as a result of Holden's decision. What the government has to understand is that, when a company as large as Holden leaves our shores, there are terrible consequences which go beyond the company's direct employees. Small and medium enterprises and the components industry, which need larger companies through which to create demand, are also in the firing line. So because the government—through the Treasurer—dared Holden to leave, this decision has been made by Holden.


This is a very important debate, and I think it is time we heard from the industry minister. The Minister for Industry has been prevented by this government from saying what really happened with Holden in the last few weeks. We want the industry minister to tell us what actions, if any, were taken by this government before Holden made its decision to leave the country. To date, the industry minister has been silenced. The Prime Minister, most likely the Treasurer, and, indeed, the Minister for Education wanted to enter this debate. But we need to hear from the industry minister. Clearly he has shown at least some sympathy for Holden and its workers. Unfortunately, it is clear that the Minister for Industry lost the arm wrestle; the Treasurer clearly prevailed. But it was not just the Treasurer's work; we should not give Joe all the credit. Clearly new ministers in this government have been leaking to the media that they had no interest in providing further support to Holden before the decision was made. This information was coming out before the decision was made.


Imagine this: you are Mr Devereux—who was responsible for Holden's decision and who was involved in discussions with Holden in Detroit—and you have just fronted the Productivity Commission and seen the Treasurer stand in the chamber and effectively dare the company to leave the country. But the company expected the government to co-invest in the company. The company would have hoped that, instead of ripping $500 million out of co-investment in the automotive sector, the government would have sat down with the company and worked out a way to ensure that not only would the company stay in this country but also that 2,900 people and their families would not be hit by as awful a decision as was made yesterday.


This Prime Minister must be censured because he has shown a total and callous disregard for workers in the automotive industry and because, unfortunately, there are potential adverse consequences for other workers in small and medium enterprises. The government talks about being the government for small business. But how many small businesses do you think will be affected adversely as a result of Holden's leaving the country? Hundreds or thousands of companies will be adversely affected, and the government does nothing. This is a government which has revealed itself as never putting workers or jobs first. This is a government that, when it comes to doing the work rather than just spinning out some lines, is not there to engage genuinely and comprehensively with companies—whether they be Holden or any other company.


Today the Prime Minister has feigned all sorts of sincerity. Today he is saying to this House that he is concerned about the workers. But it is a bit late now, Tony—it is a bit late now to be concerned for Holden workers after the decision has been made.



The SPEAKER:  The member will refer to members by their correct names.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Indeed, Madam Speaker. The fact is that the government has made an assault on manufacturing industry—and the automotive industry in particular. This government has made an assault on the car industry. What the government needs to do is to work out what it is going to do to provide support for the workers who have lost their jobs. What intensive, tailored support will the government give the workers who will lose their jobs over the course of the next four years? How is the government going to ensure that the workers will transition into any jobs that become available? What sort of effort is the government going to put into looking after those workers?


The government has some other challenges which it must attend to immediately. One of them is making sure that what has just been done to Holden is not done to Toyota. Toyota has made it very clear that they face challenges, and they would expect, as any major company in this country would expect, that the Prime Minister and the government would sit down with them and work through the challenges to ensure that the jobs of the local workers in the company—and, indeed, the company itself—stay in this country. Do not use the way you have dealt with Holden as a template for the way you might engage with Toyota, because you get zero out of 10 as a government for your efforts today.


I finish by pointing out that the unemployment rate went up by 0.1 per cent today—and, of course, this increase happened even before the effects of the announcements which have been made in the last two weeks could be taken into account.



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  The Treasurer wants to intervene. You should be ashamed of yourself. The fact that you even show your face in this place in this place is remarkable.



The SPEAKER:  The member will refer to people by their correct titles.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  The Treasurer should be ashamed of himself because he is as much responsible, in his goading Holden to leave our shores, as any other contributing factor in the departure of the company from Australia. That is a dreadful shame, and you will be wearing it for your entire time as Treasurer. This government must be censured—indeed, this Prime Minister must be censured—because it has shown such callous disregard and decided to fight amongst themselves instead of fighting for Australian workers.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-12-12,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (15:29):  I move as an amendment to the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition: 


That all words after “That” be omitted and the following words be substituted: “this House calls on all Members to support policies that reduce taxation, cut red tape and regulation, improve productivity and create stable and consistent Government that encourages growth and investment.


Before I turn to the elements of the amendment, there are two gaping holes in the opposition's case against the government today. The first of those gaping holes is their own record on jobs in the manufacturing sector and jobs in general over the last six years. The second gaping hole is the truth about why General Motors in Detroit made this announcement today. I will get to both.


Fancy being lectured about job losses by the Leader of the Opposition, who was part of a government that secretly planned to sack 14,500 public servants. They had that planned before the election and they were going to reveal it after the election. It was not like the Leader of the Opposition just signed up to a secret arrangement to sack 14,500 workers; many more workers than whose jobs are at risk over the next four years. These 14,500 job losses were going to occur within weeks and months of the election. He went to the Commonwealth Public Sector Union conference and  said to members:


… we believe that the necessary savings should not impact unduly on the overall number of APS jobs


On 16 August 2013, the day he assured the people he was speaking to that their jobs were safe, he accused the coalition of planning to cut to the bone while he knew all along that his government, if re-elected, was going to sack 14,500 workers. It is difficult to be lectured by the opposition about manufacturing jobs when we know that under them, in the 5½ years to August 2013, 160,000 manufacturing jobs were lost. Just over one in seven manufacturing jobs were lost under Labor. In fact, a manufacturing job was lost every 19 minutes under the Labor Party. That is the fact. Under the 11½ years of the previous coalition government, jobs in the manufacturing sector remained relatively stable. 



Mr Stephen Jones interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Throsby!




Mr PYNE:
  For 11½ years in a growing economy with an adult government in charge that was doing the things to encourage growth and productivity, manufacturing jobs in a similar international economic climate remained stable. The record of Labor, who are lecturing us today, stands them in very poor stead because they lost so many jobs.



Mr Husic interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley is warned.




Mr PYNE:
  The second big problem they have with their argument is there is no truth to it. They are trying to create the idea that within the last three months of the new coalition government, suddenly Holden decided that they were going to close their manufacturing in South Australia. Obviously, that is not how business works internationally or in Australia. We know that it is not true. We know this not because we have said it is not true, not because any economic commentator has said it is not true, but because General Motors themselves have said it is not true. In the statement that they released yesterday they said:


The decision to end manufacturing in Australia reflects the perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces … 


They went on to name four different influences. None of them were the federal government, or even the state government in South Australia. Yesterday, Mike Devereux went even further on the Jon Faine program. Jon Faine said, 'Okay let us boil it down to the nitty-gritty here, why did they close? Mike Devereux replied, 'As you and I have talked on this very show before, Jon, over many, many years you get to the point where it is simply for us no longer a viable case to assemble and manufacture cars in this country.' 


He is not the only General Motors spokesman who has made these kinds of statements. In fact on ABC radio today the spokesman for GMH in Detroit said, 'It is unlikely that any Australian government package would have averted the decision to close the Holden factories.' I repeat that because it is very important. Today General Motors in Detroit said on ABC radio, 'It is unlikely that any Australian government package would have averted the decision to close the Holden factories.' 



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Perth.




Mr PYNE:
  So General Motors has made it absolutely clear that no government package would have averted their decision. So it is intellectually utterly dishonest—

The SPEAKER:  The member for Perth.



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Perth will remove herself for one hour under standing order 94(a).



The member for Perth
 then left the chamber.





Mr PYNE:
  It is utterly dishonest for the Labor Party to continue to propagate the myth, the untruth, the falsehood that somehow a three-month-old government has had more impact on Holden, on GMH in Detroit, than the six years of their government and the international factors of costs of production, costs of labour, the cost of the dollar and the relative cheapness of being able to build motor vehicles in other markets. But this government is not going to buy up to Labor's petty and juvenile politics on the car industry. There are families' livelihoods at risk here. Let us remember it is not as the opposition leader tried to claim today that apparently over the next 10 days before Christmas hundreds of thousands of workers would lose their jobs. Often with new opposition leaders they over-egg the omelette. In this case the member for Maribyrnong has very much done that. 


Over the next four years we need to make sure that all the workers at Holden, whether they are in Victoria or in South Australia, find work in South Australia and in Victoria. The beauty of the public's decision three months ago is that they elected a government that has a plan to do just that. Over six years Labor could not save Holden, no matter how much money they gave the company. They did not save Ford; it did not matter how much money they gave the company. They did not save Mitsubishi, and their policies demonstrably damaged the South Australian economy. The only example I need to cite is the fact that BHP Billiton decided not to proceed with their expansion of Olympic Dam.


One of the reasons they did so was that bad government policy constantly changed. That created sovereign risk in Australia and that caused them to look elsewhere because of the uncertainty and instability created by very bad government policies. We will address that issue. We will create an environment in Australia for more jobs to be created, just as we did under the Howard-Costello government for 11½ years. We will create that environment, by reducing taxes such as the carbon tax; the fringe benefits tax changes the Labor Party proposed; and the minerals resource rent tax. We will create jobs by taking away red tape and regulation, which we are already doing in the tertiary education sector and right across the business sector, and as the Minister for the Environment is doing with one-stop-shops for development and environmental approvals across Australia. We will do so by building the infrastructure in Australia that makes transport cheaper in this country, by building ports, railways and roads that actually ensure that we get our goods to market faster and cheaper and at a cost to the consumer and the exporter that makes their markets grow. Infrastructure will be very important to productivity. We have made it very clear that we want to be a government that builds infrastructure and improves productivity.


But, most of all, we will take away the incredible and extraordinary uncertainty that Labor created around government policy. So many foreign businesses had to rethink their investment in Australia and Australian businesses had to rethink their investment in their own country.


I well remember the former Treasurer talking about trillions of dollars, billions of dollars of pipeline investment coming down in Australia. As the months progressed, the number would drop and drop and drop, as one after another entity announced they were not going ahead with their investments. Olympic Dam was just one of those. We expect that, through certainty of government, stability of government decision making and true cabinet processes that give business certainty, we will create the environment that will ensure that foreign investment is encouraged and welcomed in this country and that domestic corporations make their investments here in Australia rather than companies like BHP Billiton weighing up Canada, Chile and Australia and deciding that Australia was too big a sovereign risk.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2013-12-12,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:39):  Obviously, I rise to oppose the amendment moved by the Leader of the House. This is a government whose character is being revealed by its foreign investment decisions. It is a government led by a man who combines the economic policies of Malcolm Fraser, the politics of Richard Nixon and the economic xenophobia of BA Santamaria. That is its character. Its first approach is to do nothing; its second approach is to divide the community and to blame people; and the last approach is to demonise foreign investors, albeit for different reasons in different circumstances.


We saw this with GrainCorp and we have seen it with Holden. This will cost Australians jobs and it will cost Australians investment. This decision is no surprise because, on Thursday, 13 June this year the Adelaide Advertiser reported 'Libs reject Holden support ultimatum—no more car cash'. That was the headline in the Adelaide Advertiser. This government's policies were no surprise to GM in Detroit—no surprise at all. We were all waiting with bated breath on the election and on whether or not the Abbott government would actually undertake this $500 million cut. It was flagged to Detroit. They knew the nature of this government. But what we did not count on was the Minister for Industry, who is nowhere to be seen in this debate or in this parliament, who stormed out last night with the Treasurer but is not participating in this debate. 


The Abbott government came to power on 3 October this year. The ABC headline was: 'New Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane tours Holden plant and seeks patience from Detroit over federal assistance'. That was to buy time so they could have another cabinet debate, another bit of division in the cabinet. During the first debate the Treasurer lost out to the member for New England. He got done over by the member for New England. We know he had to win this one. He had to triumph over the industry minister, the member for Groom, at the cost of thousands of jobs. Fifty thousand jobs is the price of this Treasurer's bravado. 


After this long period of silence where they asked the nation for patience, where they asked GM in Detroit for patience, where they asked car workers for their patience, what do we have? The government's industry policy descends to a one-page letter. Can you imagine the governments of Germany, the US, South Korea or Japan behaving in such a way, issuing letters to their major companies? Can you imagine that? Can you imagine those nations' treasurers, standing at the dispatch box goading and hectoring a company to leave the country—goading and hectoring a company about their foreign investment decisions? What was Detroit supposed to make of all this?


It is hardly laying out the welcome mat for foreign investment, is it, as we saw with GrainCorp? No wonder you can hear boardrooms around the country drawing breath as they think, 'They promised a government of adults and what we've got is a bunch of erratic 15-year-old children.' That is what we have got. They are as fickle as a teenage girl. That is the truth of it.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Wakefield will resume his seat. I find that remark totally offensive and you will withdraw it forthwith.




Mr CHAMPION:
  Madam Speaker, I withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  And apologise as well.




Mr CHAMPION:
  I withdraw, Madam Speaker, and I apologise to all the teenage girls offended who are listening to this debate.

The SPEAKER:  I absolutely agree.




Mr Champion:
  I withdraw, Madam Speaker. What we have is a government whose policy is—and this is the headline in the Sydney Morning Herald: 'Taunts and text brought about company's exit'. That is the headline in the Sydney Morning Herald. Didn't read it today, Joe? Didn't get time? This is a government—



The SPEAKER:  The member will refer to people by their correct names.




Mr CHAMPION:
  I was referring to the member for North Sydney. This is a government whose Prime Minister's policy was to have no meetings with Holden. He had no meetings with Holden and he also refused to meet with component workers who came up to this House—citizens and workers—and asked to meet with the Prime Minister about their jobs and 50,000 other jobs across the country. They asked to meet with him and what did they get? They did not get a meeting, just as Holden did not get a meeting.


That is an extraordinary industry policy to have. I can tell you who pays the price of all this. It is Mr Murray Akehurst, who I talked about yesterday. He is a 50-year-old auto assembler at Holden, who has worked at the plant for 16 years. He is one of many. One of them emailed me today. I will not reveal his last name but his first name is Martin. He said:


From myself and my family I would like to thank you and the Labor team for your hard work to help trying to keep the automotive industry going. It has been a very hard road recently, and there will be rocky roads ahead.


What I tell Martin is that the Labor Party and I will be there for that rocky road, which has been created as a policy choice by this government. Make no mistake about it. People in my electorate and around the country are going to be paying the price for this government's investment decisions. It is not just Labor who is disappointed. It is not just people in my electorate who are disappointed. It is not just Toyota and component companies who are disappointed. It is Minister Hodgett, who said to Sky News:


My message to federal colleagues is any speculation on the future of Holden is not helpful. It's disappointing.


So the Victorian industry minister is disappointed with the federal government, because he knows as we know the economic damage that is being done to this country in terms of jobs and investment.


This is a government not of adults but of erratic children who are playing politics with people's lives. Rather than rolling out the welcome map for foreign investment and rather than engaging, they withdrew and then they demonised. It is costing jobs in the Australian economy.


This government is taking on the character of its Prime Minister, a character of doing nothing. That is the first instinct in all his decisions: to do nothing. Then, when they have to make a decision we see the division rolling out. We have seen that in the last 24 hours with the demonising of workers at this plant. These are workers who during the global financial crisis worked one week on and one week off—one week with pay and one week without pay. Many of them gave up their afternoon shift penalty rates to go onto the day shift. They made sacrifices to keep this factory going. When they were asked to stump up costs, what did they do? They gave up those costs. But they are demonised for their efforts in trying to save this company.


Finally, what do we see on display from this government: the economic xenophobia of BA Santamaria. That is where this government is revealed—the economic xenophobia of the member for New England and of the member for Warringah. To try to fight this we have a Treasurer who, to prove that he had policy grunt, sacrificed 50,000 jobs and an iconic brand. It is just not good enough.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2013-12-12,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney—The Treasurer) (15:49):  Enough of the hypocrisy. It is rather ironic that today Paul Keating was in the building addressing the caucus.




Ms Macklin:
  You are no Paul Keating.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am no Paul Keating. I can assure you I am no Paul Keating. I say that emphatically because at the same time that the Labor Party was placing Paul Keating on a pedestal today, I was reminded of Paul Keating's comments in the Sun-Herald of 1991. The article said:


Taxpayers are paying $1.6 billion a year, or $4,000 a car, to keep the car industry afloat. Treasurer Paul Keating has described this level of protection as a disgrace.


It was $4,000 in 1991. Today it is $4,961 per car. It is not the same in real terms, but does Paul Keating hold that view today? Did he say that to the Labor Party caucus today? Please spare us the hypocrisy on this. Please spare us the hypocrisy about caring for workers.


Paul Keating, the man who appeared in caucus today, said in 2000:


What do I say—


to people who lost their jobs—


What is your new job like? One of the 2.5 million created since the early 1980s. People have found better jobs. I mean, did we ever hurt anybody liberating them from the car assembly line?


That was said by Paul Keating, who appeared in the caucus today. He said, 'Of course we did not'. The way people talk about this free trade and fair trade, as if the economy is static and not dynamic, and a job lost is not a job replaced, is just bunkum—that is Paul Keating.


So today, when Paul Keating is in caucus and they are holding him up on a pedestal as the man who delivered economic reform, they come into this place and rail against the failure of the government to massively increase the amount of subsidy for car production in Australia and they say there is something wrong with change in the auto industry.


But let us deal with the facts, because the facts need to be stated. In 2000, 44 per cent of the cars sold in Australia were Australian made. In 2005, that fell to 30 per cent. In 2010, that fell to 19 per cent. There has been a transformation. In 2007-08, when the Labor Party was elected to government, they commissioned Steve Bracks to look at the entire car industry. In February 2008, Mitsubishi closed their operations in Adelaide under Labor. Did we cry about that? No. But I will tell you who celebrated that.




Mr Bowen:
  You should be hiding in your office.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Listen to this, Sunshine. I know that you are on your L-plates, but listen. Lindsay Tanner, the former finance minister, said this in March 2008, one month after Mitsubishi closed:


The Rudd government is committed to upholding the tradition of reform established in the Hawke-Keating era. We have resisted the temptation to bailout Mitsubishi.


That was Lindsay Tanner, the Labor finance minister, one month after Mitsubishi closed their doors under Labor. Save us the hypocrisy.




Ms Kate Ellis:
  You haven't talked about Holden.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Adelaide will desist.




Mr HOCKEY:
  When the Labor Party committed $573 million to the automotive sector in 2008-09, Ford announced 350 redundancies. And Labor responded and committed $6.2 billion in a 13-year long plan to create environmentally friendly cars. Then in 2010 they came up with a new policy; a new plan: Cash for Clunkers. We remember that. People could get grants for $2,000 to scrap their pre-1995 motor vehicles. But at the same time that they were announcing putting in more money, our share of global production of cars had halved since the year 2000. The Australian motor vehicle industry is selling fewer cars in Australia and is exporting fewer cars—half the percentage of global production of what it was a few years earlier. But Labor committed more money.




Ms Kate Ellis:
  Say the word 'Holden'.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Adelaide is warned!




Mr HOCKEY:
  In August 2010, they announced Cash for Clunkers. Just a few months later in January 2011 they announced the abolition of Cash for Clunkers—the abolition of something announced earlier. What is more, the Labor Party then announced that they were closing the Green Car Innovation Fund that Steve Bracks announced, saving $861 million




Ms Kate Ellis:
  Can you say the word 'Holden'?



The SPEAKER:  Does the member for Adelaide wish to leave under 94(a)?




Mr HOCKEY:
  Hang on: Labor announced Cash for Clunkers and then withdrew it, they announced that they were putting money into a Green Car Innovation Fund and then they closed that and then they announced the closure of the LPG vehicle scheme. That is $1.4 billion of promises to the motor vehicle industry, and then the Labor Party pulled the rug out from under them.


What was the reaction of Mike Devereux? Listen to what he said in June 2011:


We cut a deal with the prime minister of the country in the Lodge back in ’08, showed our business plan, as did Ford, as did Toyota, made investments and then midway through ... the rules of the game changed.


Listen to this—Mike Devereaux, the head of Holden, said:


So it certainly worries a multinational parent—


company—


when sovereign risk begins to be something that is bandied about in terms of doing business with Australia.


That was in June 2011 when the head of Holden was warning that the Labor government was creating sovereign risk here in Australia for General Motors. But wait: there is more.



Ms Kate Ellis interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Adelaide will remove herself under 94(a).




Mr HOCKEY:
  In January 2012, the Julia Gillard went down to Ford and pledged $34 million. She said:


As a result of us making $34 million available to join with Ford in new investment to keep car manufacturing here, we’ll actually see the number of jobs grow. There will be an additional 300 jobs as a result.


So, 300 jobs when they put in an extra $34 million. Six months later, Ford sacked 400 people. That is a 700-person turnaround after Julia Gillard went down there and gave them and extra $34 million. But there is more.


In March 2012, Julia Gillard went to Holden and announced an extra $215 million. Listen to what the Labor Prime Minister at the time said:


Holden will be here in Australia producing cars for at least the next 10 years. That's great news. … So this is a great day for Australian car-making, to be able to announce that Holden will be here for the next decade and we've been able to secure that by working together.


Seven months later, Holden sacks 180 people at the Elizabeth plant and a few months after that Holden announces a further 500 sackings.




Mr Husic:
  Your guilt is burning you: 50,000 people have lost their jobs because of you.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley will remove himself under 94(a).




Mr HOCKEY:
  Hang on: the Labor Party kept giving them more money and announcing job security and then months later Holden would sack workers and Ford would sacks workers.


Then along came the carbon tax. Listen to what Mike Devereux had to say on the carbon tax:


There is no question that a tax on electricity, in making it more expensive in input costs, makes it more difficult for me to make money building cars.


That is what Mike Devereux, the head of General Motors Holden, said about the carbon tax. He said, 'It makes it more difficult for me to make money building cars.' Holden then announced 500 redundancies.




Mr Bowen:
  They have gone under on your watch.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The member for McMahon was the most incompetent L-plated Treasurer in Australian history. We thought that John Kerin walking into a cupboard was incompetent. The member for McMahon was only in for 84 days but, wow, what an 84 days. He announced a $1.8 billion fringe benefits tax that saw car sales plummet. We got rid of it.




Mr Bowen:
  I did not lose Holden; you lost Holden.



The SPEAKER:  The member for McMahon will desist!




Mr HOCKEY:
  Let me tell you the real reason why Holden went: it was a perfect storm. That is what they said at General Motors Detroit. When I heard that term 'perfect storm', I knew that I had heard it somewhere else. Kim Carr in 2013 in his book said this: 'In many ways, the automotive industry was already weathering a perfect storm.' Kim Carr was talking about a perfect storm months before the General Motors announcement the other day. Stop the hypocrisy, Labor. You are looking really foolish.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendment be agreed to.



The SPEAKER:  The question now is that the motion as amended be agreed to.


Question agreed to.

The SPEAKER
 (16:13):  For the information of honourable members I present a schedule of outstanding government responses to reports of House of Representatives and joint committees, incorporating reports tabled and details of government responses made in the period between 26 June 2013 to the date of the last schedule and 11 December 2013. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members and will be incorporated in Hansard.




The schedule read as follows—





THE SPEAKER
'
S SCHEDULE OF


OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES


TO REPORTS OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND


JOINT COMMITTEES



(also incorporating reports tabled and details of Government responses made in the period between


26 June 2013, the date of the last schedule, and 11 December 2013)


12 December 2013



THE SPEAKER
'
S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES


TO COMMITTEE REPORTS



The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 27 June 2013. It also lists reports for which the House has not received a government response. Schedules of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, generally in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.


The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response. The Government's response to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, and the Publications Committee (other than reports on inquiries). Reports from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights are only listed where the committee has examined and reported on a specific item(s) of legislation. Not listed are that committee's regular reports on the human rights compatibility of bills and legislative instruments that come before either House of Parliament.


Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are usually reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are only included when first tabled.


Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. Responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within 6 months of the tabling of a report.

The SPEAKER
 (16:14):  Today is quite a special day in the history of this parliament in that it will be the last day that the Clerk of the House, Mr Bernard Wright, will be with us serving in that capacity. I want to say, before I call the Prime Minister, that it has been an honour and a privilege to know the Clerk of the House. The Clerk has served here for 42 years. He first came to the Treasury 42 years ago. He commenced in the Public Service as a casual in 1966. He then began his long-term career as a graduate trainee with the Department of Immigration on 22 February 1971. He was promoted to the Department of the House of Representatives as a parliamentary officer on 1 February 1972, and then into the Clerk's Office in 1973. He served at a senior executive level with the Committee Office, the Procedures Office and the corporate area of the department. He was Deputy Clerk from 1997 to 2009 and Registrar of Members Interests from 1997 to 2009. He was appointed Clerk in 2009. He has an arts degree from the Australian National University, majoring in political science and Asian studies.


It has been an honour to know Bernard Wright. I first had dealings with him when I became a member of this House and had to learn the standing orders of this place, as distinct from the standing orders of another place, and they are very different. They are very important to the work in this place. Through periods of serving as a committee chair, including a very difficult period, his guidance and knowledge in carrying out meeting structures correctly at all times was something without which the work would not have been done.


We have in the gallery with us today Mrs Marie Wright, Mr Wright's wife, Mrs Catherine Wright, his daughter, Mr James Wright, his son, Mrs Linda Hall, his daughter-in-law, Ms Catherine Cornish, his sister, Louise McDonald, who is a member of the family, Ms Louise Forster and Ms Lynette Eager. They are all people who are very close to the Clerk who has served us so well. I know that the House will miss his ability, miss his dedication and miss his quiet spoken advice which comes freely to all of us without bias, and will wish him well in his retirement.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2013-12-12,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (16:17):  by leave—I move:


That this House place on record its appreciation of the long and meritorious service to the Parliament by the Clerk of the House, Mr B. C. Wright, and extends to him and his wife and family every wish for a healthy and happy retirement.


Forty-one years of service is an extraordinary record. In a world where nothing lasts, one thing has lasted for 41 years, and that is Bernard Wright's service to this parliament. It has been long—obviously. It has been meritorious—of course. And it has been motivated by a love of this institution—a love that I would say is unmatched by any person currently serving in this place. I have known Bernard Wright for 24 of those 41 years, since turning up back in 1990 as a staffer. I can remember discussing with Bernard and his fellow clerks various parliamentary tactics which oppositions might use in the face of a rampant government, and Bernard's advice was good. His advice was just as frank and fearless with me as, I am sure, in other times and in other places, it has been frank and fearless with members opposite.


But what has motivated Bernard and what has been characteristic of Bernard at all times—apart from his utter impartiality and total dedication to the welfare of this parliament—is his legal skill, his profound understanding of the standing orders, his appreciation of how the standing orders could be changed and improved at any time and, above all else, his great love of this institution. We all say we love the parliament, and I suspect if we were not in this parliament most of us would miss it. But the fact is, we all too often love this parliament as, I regret to say, a vehicle for ourselves. But Bernard and other occupants of his office love this parliament as a forum for democracy and as the great council of our nation. We are so indebted to the Clerk's Office and to the various people who have held that office as the true guardians—the true keepers of the spirit and the ethos and the values—of this great institution.


Bernard, you have been utterly fastidious, utterly dedicated and utterly faithful to your task. You have been a very model of a public servant, and you have been a great patriot. So, as the 28th Prime Minister, I salute the 15th Clerk. The fact that there have been 28 prime ministers but only 15 clerks shows the longevity of clerks in office, and it shows the dedication of those who have held that office.


While I am on my feet, I probably should make some of the customary acknowledgements which we do at this time of the year. As well as thanking Bernard and the other clerks and all of the others who make this House operate—the Hansard staff, the attendants, the drivers, the cleaners and everyone who makes our life in this building possible—I would thank my own staff. They are indomitably led by Peta Credlin, someone who has had a little more publicity lately then she would like and who is undoubtedly the fiercest political warrior that it has ever been my privilege to work with. I thank my colleagues, so ably led by the Deputy Prime Minister, my own deputy leader, my frontbench and my backbench.


This has been a big year for everyone in this parliament but it has been a particularly big year for members of the coalition. What can we say about 2013? It marks the withdrawal of Australian troops in Uruzgan province after almost a decade. Our troops have done a magnificent job but they have paid a high price, and we hope that their years of service and sacrifice will be honoured by a province and a country which respects the values that we tried to bring to that province and which honours the sacrifice and the service that Australian troops and others brought to that province.


We have had floods in Queensland. We have had fires in New South Wales. But, so often in this country, nature at its worst brings out Australians at their best. I am very conscious of the fact that this is the quarter century, the 25th anniversary, of this new Parliament House. I acknowledge the fact that, along with you, Madam Speaker, three others currently in this building were in the former building and were here as members of parliament on the day this building opened: the member for Lingiari, who has served diligently in this House; the member for Berowra, the Father of the House and distinguished Chief Government Whip, who has served in so many capacities, always with honour and always with distinction; and, of course, Senator Boswell, the Father of the Senate.


I suppose inevitably, for us, the big thing this year was the election and the change of government. I note that there have only been seven changes of government federally since 1945. I also note that each change of government has been accompanied by high hopes on the part of the people that it will turn out to have been change for the better. I am determined to ensure that the change of government that took place earlier this year is indeed change for the better and I am determined to ensure that it is a very long time indeed before this country again has three Prime Ministers in one year—not a great record, three Prime Ministers in one year.


One thing that obviously has not changed for the better is the departure of our Clerk. I know he will find a valiant, a diligent and a capable successor, because that is what happens in this place. But the fact is that Bernard Wright has been a servant of this parliament without peer, without equal. We will miss him, we honour him and we wish him all the best for the future.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (16:25):  I rise to second the Prime Minister's motion and, on behalf of the opposition, to thank Bernard Wright for more than four decades of dedicated service in this place. What must be a day of mixed emotion for Bernard and for his family is a sad day for all of us who have worked closely with him. Anyone here, be it the Father of the House or the newer members, who has dealt with him in his various roles would have been impressed with his deep knowledge of the intricacies of parliamentary procedure. He worked for the department of immigration before moving to the bills and papers office the next year, and he has not left parliament since. He served as private secretary to the Speaker and secretary to the Privileges Committee. But it is in his work as Clerk that he found his calling. The role of Clerk, like all of the roles in parliament, nearly always goes unheralded. However, I can assure you that, by those of us from this side—formerly from that side—that work does not go unnoticed and it is certainly appreciated.


While we engage across the dispatch boxes in the debate or the political argument of the day of parliament, Bernard and his team go about their business in a quiet, a careful and a thoroughly professional manner. On a personal note, I should add that Bernard has always gone out of his way to assist those who are less experienced than he. Bernard Wright, I suspect, is like all truly modest people—I suspect he does not realise how appreciated he is by all the rest of us. Dedicated parliamentary professionals like Bernard make our jobs easier. They are here before parliament commences and they are here after it rises.


I thank Bernard for his years of dedicated service to this place. I wish him well for the years ahead. I thank his family for lending him to this institution, the parliament of Australia. Of course, if he misses the to and fro of federal parliament, I am sure that, from all of us on both sides, he has a standing invitation to attend any question time he feels like. Bernard, thank you very much from the opposition.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (16:28):  I am delighted to join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in extending congratulations to Bernard Wright on his career as Clerk of the parliament and to wish him good health and every happiness in his retirement.


The Parliamentary Service Act requires that a person cannot be appointed as Clerk unless the Speaker is satisfied:


… that the person has extensive knowledge of, and experience in, relevant Parliamentary law, procedure and practice.


Bernard Wright served for 37 years before he was appointed Clerk, and he clearly filled that criteria. Indeed, his service as Clerk of this parliament has demonstrated that he not only has that experience but has all of the qualities that are required to make an excellent Clerk of this parliament. He has had a remarkable period of service to the parliament—much longer than that of any member of the House. His service to the parliament has been enduring.


What has impressed us all is his never-ending courtesy, his patience and his assistance. I guess one of the first things I noticed was his attention to detail—sometimes detail that the rest of us may have considered to be trivia. Nonetheless, he had a determination that everything needed to be right. He certainly added to the dignity of the office in the way in which he conducted his duties. He held the important responsibility of leader of a team of people who served this House. He has certainly fulfilled his responsibilities with great dignity.


Bernard, thank you very much for your personal friendship and the assistance you have provided to me and my colleagues. Thanks go to your family for what they have undoubtedly given up over the years. Bernard, you have shared the unreasonable hours that are sometimes expected of those who work in this place, and we hope that you are now able to enjoy your retirement in a degree of relaxation, and to take up your hobbies. I guess you will need to learn some hobbies, because I do not know that you have had much time outside of this place in the past. We certainly wish you the best possible health and the wonderful privilege of being with your family for a long retirement.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2013-12-12,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (16:30):  I am very pleased and honoured to be able to make a contribution to this debate. It is entirely appropriate that the whole House acknowledge the contribution of Bernard Wright, a true adornment to this parliament. He has a genuine love of the parliament. He has played an extraordinary role in ensuring the proper functioning of the parliament. 


In order to indicate to the Clerk that I have listened to his advice, I intend quoting from House of Representatives Practice which is, to Bernard Wright, the bible of belief in this parliament. It indicates that the office of the Clerk of the House has its origins in the House of Commons in England. It indicates that the first appointment was in 1363. Interestingly, it says something that I did not know; you always learn something from this big green book! The word 'clerk' simply meant someone who could read and write. Since many members then could do neither, one of the clerk's main functions was to read out petitions and, later, bills and other documents to House. That is interesting, because you have to know where you come from to know why you are here and where you are going. 


Bernard Wright's experience has come to the fore. I had the benefit of his wise counsel both in government and in opposition—in particular, I must say, during the last parliament. The last parliament was a difficult parliament. There was a lot of personal tension in the chamber and outside, due to the fact that it is unusual for Australia to have minority parliament. Throughout all of that, Bernard—no matter how difficult things might have been and how unhelpful members of parliament, myself included, might have been at particular times—kept his cool and kept his counsel. He ensured that this parliament functioned effectively and that the government functioned effectively. His eyes were only ever on one thing—not on any partisan outcome but on outcomes which resulted in the parliament being held in the high regard that it should be held in. That has always been his sole focus.


There were difficult circumstances, such as changeovers of Speaker during the last parliament. Perhaps some of the stories will remain for Bernard's book! I am sure that would make an interesting read. He indicated to me in a discussion we had in the last week that I should be writing a book. He said that he hoped that I had kept a diary of the last parliament. My diary would not be as interesting as his, because, since everyone could talk with him in a manner of trust, Bernard Wright knew everything that was going on. You could get advice about whether you were on the right path or the wrong path. Advice was put forward in such a way that you knew that experience came to the fore. There are some people in this chamber who have a bit of knowledge of the standing orders—including you, Madam Speaker. But all of us combined pale into insignificance in comparison to the knowledge that Bernard Wright has. He will be a real loss to this parliament. 


I conclude by saying this. His professional conduct is one thing. Sometimes we speak about a separation of professional conduct and personal conduct. With Bernard Wright you cannot separate the two. He is a gentleman. His character comes through in the way that he does his work. If he did not have that character his work would not have been as effective, no matter how great his knowledge of the standing orders, of the history of this parliament and of the history of democracy. We have worked particularly closely over the decade when I was in the member for Sturt's and the member of Watson's position. It was a privilege to work with you, Bernard Wright. I thank you, and I acknowledge your contribution to this great Australian democracy.

As you would all know, I have known most of his relatively recent predecessors—that is, over 40 years—and I would not want to draw invidious comparisons because all of them have been fine, professional officers. But, to me, Bernard Wright has been unique in the way in which he has carried out that role—not just as a fearless adviser but also as a person who brings to the role a very considerable degree of intellectual leadership, as demonstrated in the many volumes of the Practice that some of us have on our shelves. I cannot say I have used the Practice as frequently as Madam Speaker, but it has been invaluable. Bernard, thank you very much for your friendship.

 (16:37): I inform the House that the Governor-General in Council has agreed to my recommendation and appointed David Elder to be the Clerk of the House of Representatives from 1 January 2014. As mentioned by the Leader of The Nationals and Deputy Prime Minister, the Parliamentary Service Act says a person cannot be appointed as Clerk unless the Speaker is satisfied that the person has extensive knowledge of, and experience in, relevant parliamentary law, procedure and practice'. Mr Elder certainly has that. He has had a distinguished career, to this date, in the parliamentary service and he has been appointed in accordance with that act, through a rigorous process. He joined the House of Representatives in 1981 and worked on parliamentary committees, among which was that important inquiry into the banking sector in 1990. He served as Serjeant-at-Arms, Assistant Clerk (Committees) and Assistant Clerk (Table). He has been Deputy Clerk since 2010. He has been in charge of members' interests statements for this last period. He has a Master of Arts, an Executive Master of Administration and he is a Rotarian. We have just praised our outgoing Clerk, and I have every confidence that my choice in the appointment of David Elder is going to see another person serve this parliament with great distinction.

But I have absolutely no doubt, David, that you will fill them and fill them well. I have absolutely no doubt that you will grow into the role to which you have just been promoted. Every Clerk of the House of Representatives has turned out to be a fine custodian of its traditions. In my time I have known Lyn Barlin and Ian Harris well, as well as Bernard Wright, and I am pleased to have had the chance to get to know you, David, reasonably well in the two decades or so I have been associated with the House. You have been here in one capacity or another since 1981. You know this place, you know its people, you know its tempers, its moods, its rhythms. Short only of the Father of the House himself are you familiar with this chamber. I suppose the best thing I can say about David Elder is that he is very much in the image and likeness of Bernard Wright, and that is why I am confident he will serve this chamber with great distinction.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (16:42):  I am delighted to join in the congratulations for David Elder on becoming our new Clerk. There has been something of a tradition in the parliament that the Deputy Clerk succeeds the Clerk. In this case, I think the appointment today will be of no surprise whatsoever. While it is true that over recent years we have gone through an application process—and that is appropriate—it is very hard for anyone to come into this job, from another parliament or any other place in life, and be able to pick up the pieces and do the pressured job associated with being Clerk in the parliament, especially during question time, from day one. I think, therefore, that the tradition of people having a depth of experience within our own parliamentary organisation and succeeding into the position of Clerk is a tradition that is likely to go on. David Elder has only got 32 years experience, so he obviously has a lot of potential ahead of him! Through those 32 years he has genuinely demonstrated that he has the capabilities to do this job. We all look forward to receiving his day-to-day advice and working with him constructively to ensure that the parliament achieves its objectives and the Australian people have the respect for this place that we want them to have.

One iconic event is the Twilight Carols at the Westfield shopping centre at Max Pawsey Reserve, conducted by Larry Sebastian of the wonderful Casey City Church.


I do not think it is any secret that we are ending the year in fairly challenging circumstances, with many people in my area unsure of what the future holds for them. This is not a time to assign blame, but I remind this chamber and our people that we live in a great country and I believe our country's best days are yet to come. Our country's strength derives from its people—their sense of resilience, purpose and community. I believe we will get through this terrible set of circumstances following the announcement of GMH pulling out of Australia. I want to express my sympathies to all of the thousands of affected workers in the Casey and Dandenong regions.


I received an email today from an automotive components worker who is in despair about his future, as well as the future of his family and his 400 co-workers. We need to work together in this place. People want us to work together to fix this issue. The Senate will discuss accountability, but I state that I believe in the Australian people and that Australia is a great country. I believe manufacturing does have a future in Australia, and the Australian government needs to do what it can to strengthen manufacturing.


I heard a ridiculous argument from Paul Murray that we do not make cars that are good enough. What a load of rubbish! It made me sick to my stomach to hear someone talking about Australian products in that way. Holden and Ford cars made in Australia are great. The product is good enough, but we have a problem with our currency. Commentators should not go on TV and say Australians do not make great things. They do, but manufacturers are confronting circumstances beyond their control. Do not blame the workers for the problems, because they are making a product that is great. We stand in solidarity with all those who have lost their jobs or who are about to lose their jobs. We owe it to them to work together to make sure manufacturing has a future in this country.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (11:02):  I rise today to highlight some of the fantastic volunteers in the Bendigo electorate. Last Friday in celebration of International Volunteer Day we held several ceremonies across the electorate, recognising the hard work of these local heroes. International Volunteer Day, as members know, is celebrated on 5 December, the day before, but knowing that we would be here in Canberra we organised to recognise our local heroes and volunteers on the Friday.


Volunteers and their organisations quite often do not do this work for recognition. They do it for their community, for their neighbours, for their organisations. They do it in many cases because it is a passion. Without our volunteers, I believe our communities would fall down, particularly in central Victoria. I want to highlight a couple of the organisations and individuals that we recognised last Friday in our ceremonies.


Friends of Kyneton Community Park volunteer Katrina, the vice-president, has been actively involved in working with the president, Amy, in making sure that the community understands the purpose of the project. Friends of Kyneton Community Park recently secured a government grant to be able to continue to develop the children's park.


I would also like to acknowledge the Kyneton Uniting Church Op Shop. Flo Watson there is amazing. She is a volunteer herself and she coordinates rosters of up to 80 volunteers. I have spoken to Flo about whether she would join my campaign team for the next election, given her ability to organise volunteers.


There were people in this program nominated by their children. I would like to highlight Maryanne Murdoch of the Campbells Creek Fire Brigade, nominated by her son and daughter. They know how much Maryanne cares for the local community and how she stepped in when nobody else would. She has currently completed her rigging licence so that she can now drive the fire truck. She attended the Black Saturday fires in 2009. She had just returned from assisting with the New South Wales bushfires, where she and her fellow members took five days away from our own state, our own community, to assist in New South Wales.


I must also mention the 70 City of Greater Bendigo volunteers that staff the visitors' centres, the Elmore senior citizens, the Bendigo Special Olympics team and, lastly, the Laanecoorie Mechanics Institute hall—in particular their secretary, Geoff, who has been a secretary or the president for 39 years. Before Geoff, it was his father, and before his father it was his grandfather. So as long as there has been the Laanecoorie Mechanics Institute, somebody from this family has been involved in this committee. This hall, of course, was a favourite host of the Young Farmers' Balls for decades and decades. Today, whilst they do not host the Young Farmers' Balls, they are quickly becoming the museum for the region, making sure that they continue to preserve the history and the culture of the region.


All of us recognise that our local heroes are our volunteers. Our volunteers are the people who ensure that our communities remain strong and remain connected. They do this work not for recognition, but they do this work because it is their passion and because there is a job that needs to be done. We have decided to make this an annual event to recognise the Bendigo electorate hard-working volunteers on or around International Volunteer Day.


I seek leave to table a list of the recipients of the Bendigo International Volunteer Day awards for 2013.


Leave granted.
