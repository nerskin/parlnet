"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2000-11-09,"—On behalf of Senator Coonan and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, 15 sitting days after today, Senator Coonan will move that the following delegated legislation, a list of which I shall hand to the Clerk, be disallowed.
The list read as follows—
	1.	A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax)(Exempt Taxes, Fees and Charges) Determination 2000 (No. 2) made under section 81-5 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999.
	2.	Defence Portfolio Regulations Amend-ment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Regulations 2000 (No. 1), as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No. 263 and made under the Defence Act 1903 and the Air Force Act 1923.
	3.	Radiocommunications (Third Party Users—Apparatus Licence) Amendment Determination 2000 made under the Radiocommunications Act 1992.
	4.	Radiocommunications (Third Party Users—Apparatus Licence) Amendment Determination 2000 (No. 2) made under the Radiocom-munications Act 1992.
	5.	Temporary Order No. 4 of 2000 made under subsection 43(8) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991.
—As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax)(Exempt Taxes, Fees and Charges) Determination 2000 (No.2)
The Determination specifies the taxes, fees and charges that are excluded from the scope of the GST. Section 81-5 refers to a written determination of the Treasurer but the Minister for Finance and Administration appears to have made the Determination for the Treasurer. There is no indication whether the power to make this determination was delegated to the Minister and, if so, under what authority that delegation had been made.
Defence Portfolio Regulations Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 263
New regulation 11A states that Part 3 of the Regulations (""Aid to Civilian Authorities"") applies if the Defence Force is called out under ""any lawful authority other than Part IIIAAA"" of the Defence Act 1903. The Explanatory Statement adds only that Part 3 will apply where powers under Part IIIAAA are ""not appropriate"".  On the basis of the instrument and the Explanatory Statement it is difficult to determine under what situations the new regulations might apply. 
New subregulation 11B(1) applies when the Defence Force is called out to protect ""Commonwealth interests"". The regulation goes on to state that the Defence Force must be utilised in a way that is ""reasonable and necessary to protect the Commonwealth interest"".  This regulation appears to be modelled on section 51D of the Defence Act 1903. Like subregulation 11B(1), section 51D uses the expression ""reasonable and necessary"" to define the level at which the Defence Force is to be utilised. This expression may not be sufficiently precise and certain. Unlike section 51D, subregulation 11D(1) does not specify that ""the Commonwealth interest"" which it is reasonable and necessary to protect must be the same as the ""Commonwealth interests"" which have caused the Defence Force to be called out in the first place.  That is, as the provision is currently worded, there is no necessary relationship between ""Commonwealth interests"" and ""the Commonwealth interest"".  
New subparagraph 11D(1)(b) provides that ""a member of the police force"" of a State or Territory may give a written request to the Chief of the Defence Force requesting that the Defence Force, which is being utilised in accordance with regulation 11B, be utilised for a particular task.  This reflects a similar provision in paragraph 51F(1)(b) of the Act.  It is not clear whether it is intended that any member of the police force might make such a written request.  
Radiocommunications (Third Party Users - Apparatus Licence) Amendment Determination 2000 
The Explanatory Statement refers to three errors in relation to this instrument. First, the preamble to the instrument refers to `section 115' rather than `subsection 115(1)'. Second, section 3 makes an incorrect reference to the determination that is amended by this instrument. Third, section 1 of Schedule 1 contains a typographical error where it refers to the name of the Determination.  
With regard to the third error just mentioned, it is not clear what error is being referred to. Both the heading to the instrument and section 1 of Schedule 1 refer to the Radiocommunications (Third Party Users - Apparatus Licence) Amendment Determination 2000. However, section 1 of the Determination, which specifies the name of the Determination, refers to ""Apparatus Licences"" (ie plural).
Radiocommunications (Third Party Users - Apparatus Licence) Amendment Determination 2000 (No. 2) 
The purpose of this instrument appears to be to correct at least one of the errors referred to in relation to the Radiocommunications (Third Party Users - Apparatus Licence) Amendment Determination 2000. However, the instrument gives rise to some confusion about this. Section 3 of this instrument purports to amend the Radiocommunications (Third Party Users - Apparatus Licence) Amendment Determination 2000 which, the section says, was made on 13 December 1995 and notified in the Gazette on 20 December 1995. However, as the Explanatory Statement notes, the Radiocommunications (Third Party Users - Apparatus Licence) Amendment Determination 2000 was notified in the Gazette on 26 July 2000. It was made on 17 July 2000. 
Temporary Order No. 4 of 2000 made under subsection 43(8) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991
The Order amends the Southern Bluefin Tuna Management Plan 1995 by defining Southern Bluefin Tuna only in terms of species Thunnus maccoyii. The Explanatory Statement refers to the similarities between the Southern and Northern Bluefin Tuna species, and notes the difficulty which fishers and compliance officers have had in differentiating between them. Because of this difficulty, the Management Plan had previously included both species within the definition of Southern Bluefin Tuna. The Explanatory Statement advises that with the development of genetic testing it is now possible to positively distinguish the two types of tuna, and therefore it is no longer necessary to include both species in the Management Plan. However, it is not clear how distinctions based on genetic testing can assist fishers and compliance officers in differentiating the two species.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-09,"—Last night when debate on this bill was adjourned, I was in the process of discussing issues regarding choice in education. I pointed out that the government talks constantly about the concept of choice and says that it lies at the heart of this legislation. It claims that every Australian parent has the choice of sending their children either to any state government school or to any non-government school. That is simply not true. As I said last night, parents in many communities across this country who send their children to the local state school or to one of the local non-government schools, such as those in the Catholic systemic system, do not have the choice, because of their income levels, of sending their children to elite, wealthy schools. So all this talk about choice is mere sophistry: it is being used to disguise the real intent of this legislation.
The real intent of this legislation is to allocate additional funding to category 1 schools—elite private schools, which have been identified by many other speakers in this debate—at a level much greater than the funding for all other schools, whether they be state or other non-government schools. I do not wish to take up the time of the Senate restating the many examples that have been put before this chamber of the gross inequities that will arise from this system. They have been well documented. The Australian public—not just parents of students at state government schools but also many parents of students at non-government schools—recognise that this legislation is inequitable. I have spoken to many parents whose children attend non-government schools—in the Catholic systemic system and other schools as well—who are appalled by what this government is doing. They have opted to send their children to a non-government school in their local community and, in making that choice, they have elected to pay the additional fees that are required. 
But what those parents also support—and what the Labor Party has always supported since the days when the state aid debate was finally put to rest—is the principle that there has to be equity. Parents in those schools have said to me that they do not accept this government's proposals to direct huge amounts of additional funding to a narrow group of 61 select elite private schools at the expense of schools throughout the rest of the country in both government and non-govern-ment sectors. We have had examples put forward of how, for instance, the King's School in Sydney can raise huge amounts of money by a whole range of fundraising activities as well as by the extraordinarily high fees that the parents pay to send their children to those schools. Now, fine—this is not about greed or envy, as the government would try to suggest; what it is about is equity. Those parents have elected to send their children to those schools and to pay those huge fees. But they are a very small minority of people in this country. Very few people can afford to send their children to those schools. They have to battle in their P&Cs—such as in the western suburbs of Sydney, or Melbourne, or in rural and regional areas—to scrimp to raise money through the chook raffles, the trivia nights, the Christmas hamper raffle and the chocolate fund raising ventures—
—Chocolate wheels.
—I will not get into chocolate wheels. All those parents know that their kids will come home from school with an appeal from the P&C for some more funds because it desperately needs those funds for resources. They are the schools that we have to be directing our attention to—and that is what the Labor Party is about.
This bill has led to widespread community outrage. As I have said, we have all received hundreds of emails and letters and petitions, as well as personal representations, complaining about this legislation. What is the position of the ALP? As I said last night, and I repeat: we are about equity in education. We are about funding both the government and non-government school sectors on the basis of need and on the basis of ensuring that every kid in this country, no matter which school he or she attends, has access to a high standard of education and to the resources required to deliver that education.
What we are proposing is the abolition of the enrolment benchmark adjustment. That measure alone has already been responsible for taking $60 million out of government schools. Our amendments will also stop those 61 schools in category 1, the wealthy elite private schools, from getting the largest funding increases. We are not saying they should not get any funding; they should continue to get funding—but not the additional funding that is prescribed under this legislation. That is inequitable and unfair to all those other schools throughout the country that desperately need those government resources. It is our proposal that that funding—that unnecessary funding which currently is to be directed to the category 1 schools—be redistributed in areas of special need, special education services, particularly for the 100,000 students across Australia with disabilities where funds are desperately needed to improve their situation.
This government has a terrible record on education. It has taken a few years, but the public is now seeing the evidence of this government's attempts—indeed, its successful attempts—over a number of years to slash away at the level of government funding for state schools as well as in areas such as TAFE and universities. We also see it evident in their approach to other important areas related to education and training, such as research and development.
It is not too late for this government to think again and to listen to all those parents out there who have corresponded with us and expressed their concerns. They are parents who care about their kids' education and, as I said, those parents exist in both the government and the non-government school sectors. What they want is equity of funding for all Australian students in the school system. I look forward to the committee stage of the bill when we can advance our arguments in respect of the ALP's amendments to this legislation in more detail. I urge the government to have cognisance of the community outrage against this legislation and accept those amendments.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-11-09,"—Today I wish to make a contribution in the debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. I would like to comment on a number of issues arising out of this legislation related to the role of the churches in this debate about equity and fairness. This is a debate about a bill which will see an increase of $100 million in funding for Australia's 7,000 government schools, an increase that delivers nothing beyond keeping up with inflation, and I want to underline that. This is in contrast to increases of $561 million a year to non-government schools by 2004, a 40 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding.
I know, because they have told me so, that many church based schools are reluctant to speak out about the SES funding formula, and there are various reasons for this. We have been told that one reason is that poorer schools that belong to associations or groups are often under pressure from their wealthier peers to stay silent. The churches are in a paradoxical position with this legislation. Most denominations have wealthy, elite schools that claim some association with the church, although most of these schools have a very loose association with the churches whose names they claim. All of them are administered and incorporated quite independently of the churches. I know this is so because, as a parish minister, I was on the board of governors of one of these schools which was situated within the boundaries of the parish. It was not a good experience. The school took little account of the church's position on many issues and made it very difficult for me as a parish minister. On the other hand, the churches provide assistance to people who are having trouble feeding and educating their children. So in the name of the church, you have a paradox at both ends of the social spectrum.  
I would like to illustrate what I am saying by citing the experience in Victoria, for in Victoria at least there is an increasing demand from church-run agencies for assistance with education costs. As compulsory and quasi-compulsory fees and levies spread in public schools, many more parents are seeking help. The Catholic Social Services in Melbourne recently completed a report on truancy. The Jesuit Social Services focused on educational opportunities in its report Unequal in life: the distribution of social disadvantage in Victoria and New South Wales. The Uniting Church has also called for the abolition of fees in Victorian government schools. Any church-run agency that offers relief to families is, by necessity, having to address education issues as well. It would be useful to ask those agencies what they think of the government's unjust and unfair proposals for the future of education in this country. Fortunately, we do know what some of the churches think about the government's bill, and it is important to put that on the record. 
Recently, the Victorian Synod of the Uniting Church issued a formal response to the states grants bill. It is a very important response because it outlines some serious concerns with the legislation. The Uniting Church argues for the greater good of decent funding for public education. There are several comparatively wealthy schools that stand to gain enormous windfalls from the formula. They include MLC in Burwood, which will get an additional $1.5 million a year; Methodist Ladies College in Kew, which will get an additional $1.1 million; and Newington College, which will get an additional $1.8 million. These are just a few examples. The Victorian Synod of the Uniting Church has written that the socioeconomic status of a school community may be a reasonable funding criterion. However, it then severely criticises the government legislation. In order to give you the flavour of what the synod secretary has said, I will give you some quotes from the letter. After noting the government's funding model, the synod secretary wrote:
However, we believe it would be more equitable if the funding model also incorporated the resources of the school in consideration of the funding, including the level of fees. 
We would recommend that the States Grants Bill be amended to cap funding to non-government schools on the basis of the overall funds available per student compared to the Average Government School recurrent cost. 
	...	...	...
We are concerned that the Bill does not abolish the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment ... We are deeply concerned that this policy removes money from government schools that they would have otherwise been entitled to by legislation on the basis of private school enrolments.
So here we have it. Dr Kemp likes to hammer the point that non-government schools do not get the EBA money. We all know that it does not end up there directly; no-one argues otherwise. It goes into consolidated revenue. Yet here is a prominent member of the non-government school sector identifying the EBA for what it is: a lose-lose policy all round. The EBA policy has taken $57 million out of public education since its inception, simply because private schools have increased their market share.
—I said $60 million.
—In round figures. And it does not work in reverse either. When public schools increase their market share relative to private schools, private schools do not get penalised. I conclude with the last paragraph of the Victorian Synod of the Uniting Church letter: 
Our response to the bill is in recognition that students from independent schools are more likely to gain tertiary education placements than students from government schools, due at least in part to the greater level of total funding many independent schools have per student. Therefore, increased government funding to schools with high levels of existing resources serves to increase this inequity.
Let me now turn to Reverend Tom Doyle of the National Catholic Education Office. The office is a professed supporter of the SES. Yet even he told the inquiry at its Canberra hearings that the SES should not be the sole determinant of funding, as it is under Dr Kemp's bill. Instead, it should be weighted along with recurrent and capital resources, geographic spread and the necessity to provide a wide range of central services and it will redistribute the money it gets from the government according to its own SES criteria. The Reverend Doyle said:
We would still maintain that the SES model in itself is not sufficient and that it needs modification ... We would also say that, realistically, we accepted the political reality of the situation as it is.
So there you have from two of the larger churches their analysis of the SES, which clearly states that they see it as inequitable. But let me go on. Some Jewish schools are also comparatively worse off under this legislation. The Democrats received representation from one school close to Caulfield Grammar. The Australian Coordinating Committee of Jewish Day Schools says:
The model significantly disadvantages families who must, for religious reasons, reside in expensive areas. Many such families are recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Their large family sizes mean that these schools have a high proportion of parents receiving social security benefits, even though the heads of families are employed. They are upset that neither family size nor receipt of social security has an impact on their school's funding level. 
According to the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs, a school with more than 43 per cent of students on Austudy would be expected to have an SES score of 90 or below. However, Addas Israel School in Elsternwick has 60 per cent of families in receipt of Austudy, yet its score is 113. Yeshivah and Beth Rivkah has 36 per cent of students in receipt of Austudy and its SES score is 117. Addas Israel will get a per student funding increase of zero under this legislation, while its wealthy neighbour Caulfield Grammar will get an increase of $1,442 per student—an increase of $3.8 million a year. It is surely obscene that a school such as Addas Israel should be treated as less needy than Caulfield Grammar. The minister has, according to the Jewish News, resisted calls to address these anomalies. 
We were approached some time ago by the principal of Trinity College, a low fee Anglican school in one of Adelaide's most disadvantaged areas. Principal Michael Hewitson was a product of the private system but taught in public schools. He said his eyes were opened to the extreme levels of disadvantage suffered by many children in the system. He became a convert to the principle that public education needs to be decently funded. He maintains that the unofficial exclusion policies of many non-government schools—where the difficult to teach students are booted out and left to the state system—are unChristian. He says, `I don't see how you can justify accepting state funding without also accepting open enrolment.' I believe Senator Hogg, who will speak soon in this debate, will spell out more of the inequities which I have illustrated to the chamber in this debate. 
It is noteworthy that two Christian schools in New South Wales face state deregistration after continuing to cane students. One of the schools will have its funding increased by $100,000 a year under the SES—an increase of $1,085 per student. The public surely is entitled to demand that schools operate within the law if they wish to receive taxpayer funding. The Victorian Independent Education Union also spoke out against the legislation. It was acting on the considerable disquiet of its members. They are concerned at the disproportionate increases going to the wealthiest non-government schools. In its submission to the recent HREOC inquiry into pregnancy and work, the Independent Education Union states that it was a battle getting many non-government schools to agree to six weeks paid maternity leave, let alone the standard 12 weeks that government school employees enjoy. I hope that schools receiving these funding increases will do the right thing by their members.  
So while there are a few schools willing to speak out, there is recognition within the sector that this bill is unfair. It is recognised that the SES entrenches privilege and throws just enough to the needier schools in some cases to buy their silence. Dr Kemp's argument that this funding model has unanimous non-government support is a whitewash. Fairness cannot be reduced to a matter of perception or be inferred from what the non-government sector is prepared to commit to a media release. The figures, in the end, say it all.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2000-11-09,"—Regrettably, the focus of the debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 has so far been on the extremities. On the one hand, there has been a lot of emphasis on elite, wealthy schools, principally in metropolitan Melbourne and Sydney; on the other hand, a lot has been said about the very poor state government schools. The purpose of my contribution to this debate is to focus on what I call the forgotten group: independent schools that have generally been established for quite some time, that are often resource poor and that are located in regional Australia. We all know that there are a great many parts of regional Australia that are not enjoying the great financial booms of Sydney and Melbourne. That is reflected in the financial problems these schools have, and it is these schools that strongly support the change in the basis of funding.
These schools are struggling not only for numbers, often, but also for resources. They are not among the well-endowed schools like the King's School, but they are nevertheless called independent within the system and are generally located in non-metropolitan areas. It is these schools that have a limited ability to lift their fees, so it is these schools that are calling on the Senate to urgently pass this legislation, in many cases to make sure that they can pay their salaries until term 1 commences next year. That is how serious the situation is. Many of these schools are operating on the basis of deficit funding and deficit budgeting. It would be cruel to allow them to continue into the new year without adequate resources.
There is therefore an urgent need to pass this SES funding bill to enable these schools to cope. I ask those who are thinking of amendments, to not neglect in the amendments they are putting forward the financial plight of these independent schools that have generally been going for some time in regional Australia. Why do I say this? The previous mechanism, which is known as the education resource index, ERI, has been shown to be inconsistent, inadequate, complex, unfair and, worse still, not transparent. This educational resource index has been found by these long established, independent schools in regional Australia to be very harsh. Very often, these schools have been assigned to category 3 or 4, some of them verging on category 2. They receive grants which are less than 25 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost. That is an appalling situation which cannot be allowed to continue.
The analysis of changes over time in this aggregate government school recurrent cost, or the educational index from the CPI, clearly shows that the real cost of delivering education is rising much faster than the CPI. That is the dilemma these schools are facing,. The real cost of delivering education is rising much faster than the CPI. The 1992 to 2000 total percentage assessment of the CPI, for example, was 17.6 per cent. On the other hand, the educational index was 47.6 per cent. This will continue because of employment costs, technology and the changes in school curriculums, such as in vocational education.
This gap is widening to such an extent that these schools are being placed in an impossible position under the current system. I put to the Senate that schools in regional Australia have not been able to increase their fees at the same rate. Therefore, they are struggling to keep abreast of the changes going on in education and the quality of education is at risk and suffering. 
In short, these schools are badly underresourced. Some are operating this year with budget deficits based on the promised increases. I hope this Senate is not going to let them down. The change to the SES based funding was announced in the federal budget in May 1999, and it has taken this long to bring the bill before the Senate. Extensive information about the mechanism and the funding levels has been available since then and, I hope, has been available to every senator in this place. There has been ample opportunity to analyse the changes, to look at the figures and to see the disparities in the percentage increases and the problems faced by these schools.
I put it to you that you have had ample opportunity to look at these changes. If you have not, I say that you are negligent in your duties as a senator and in your responsibilities to the electorate at large. You have had ample opportunity, so pick up the cudgel, look at the figures and make your vote on that basis. Comprehensive simulation studies and the validation reports have been published by DETYA, so there is no excuse for this bill not to be passed.
In Tasmania and, indeed, across regional Australia, there has been strong support from all the independent schools for the new mechanism. All schools see the bill we have before us as fair and equitable. All see it as vital for the adequate resourcing of schools in 2001 and beyond. Across the nation, schools are budgeting now for next year and setting their fees. They deserve some certainty, and they can have certainty only if this bill is passed.
Without the assistance of the SES funding improvement, many struggling schools will need to introduce massive fee increases, cut programs or make staff redundancies, et cetera. In fairness to the independent schools, particularly those schools long established in regional Australia, and to their families, this bill should be passed without delay so that the necessary arrangements can be put in place for the new school year. They need time.
The first grant payment to the schools takes place in January next year, so there is limited opportunity. This is 50 per cent of the total, and schools will be relying on this payment to pay January and February salaries. If this bill is further delayed and this payment cannot be made, many schools will be severely embarrassed. I implore the Senate to pass this bill.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-11-09,"—Following on from Senator Watson is a treat in some ways.
—Put the same passion into it. Come on!
—Thank you, Senator Patterson, but I do not think Senator Watson necessarily understands what some of the motives of the Labor Party are with regard to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. I will come to those as time goes on.
It was interesting listening yesterday to Senator Tierney, who said that Labor was peddling the politics of envy, that the system had been run down over 20 years and that what the government was about was restoring part of the funding for some schools. He also raised the issue that it reopened the sectarian debate. Of course, I refute all of that and, again, I will address that during my statements here this afternoon.
The bill is terribly important. People should not lose sight of what the bill is really about. It is about giving people basic educational opportunities in an atmosphere of fairness and equity. People should be able to get a reasonable education for their children, not one that is distorted in favour of a few specially favoured schools. The approach that Labor has adopted in this debate is a very principled and correct one, in looking at the exorbitant funding that the 61 category 1 schools are receiving. One must take the government to task on that issue. It is something that the Labor Party, through its amendments, will be seeking to remove. We will be seeking to have the money placed in the important area of disability education.
Education is important for the nation; it is important for our children. In response to what Senator Tierney said, I do not want to see this debate go back to the old state aid type of debates that characterised the sixties and seventies. Education should be about offering very basic educational opportunities to all, as I said, in equity and in fairness. There is an inherent disadvantage in coming from poor schools, be they private or public schools. 
Yesterday, Senator Forshaw declared his private education background, and I do the same. I was educated at a private Catholic school in Queensland. I have tried to search the records to find out whether anyone else was. I found out that the school not only produced a socialist in me, but it produced an agrarian socialist in Senator Boswell. The fact is that that is my background. My three children have gone through the Catholic system. My son has now left the same school that I attended and attends university. The other two are girls. One completes her final year 12 exam today, so it is her last day there, and the other is in year 10. So I understand the pressures and problems that confront parents in the private system, but I understand the pressures that confront parents in the public system as well. All children should have a fair and equal opportunity to acquire a reasonable education. Some should not be disproportionately favoured, which is what will occur in the case of the 61 category 1 schools.
Most of the schools with which I have been associated, be they state or private schools, have not been wealthy schools; nor were the parents who sent their children to those schools necessarily wealthy. Quite the opposite was the case—many of them were average, ordinary, everyday workers who relied on an average, ordinary, everyday income. However, the bill that is before us today has the effrontery to feather the financial nest, not of the not-so-poor schools in Australia, but of the top 61 category 1 schools in Australia. This defies logic, but unfortunately it sits well with the ideological disposition of the government. Instead of the most needy receiving the necessary injection of funds, the 61 category 1 schools will receive massive windfalls. I do not think anyone should lose sight of that. There are 61 category 1 schools, and 61 out of the 61 are going to be better off. On average, they are going to be nearly $1 million per annum better off.
One fails to find the equity in that, when the average state school—where the greatest need is—is going to be $4,000 better off. My colleague Michael Lee made a speech in the other place, listing a number of the schools in category 1 which are going to be better off, and by what amounts. Against the $4,000 in the state school system we may weigh amounts such as: Trinity Grammar, New South Wales, $3.1 million; Newington College, New South Wales, $1.8 million; the King's School, New South Wales, $1.5 million; Wesley College, Victoria, $3.9 million; Caulfield Grammar, Victoria, $3.6 million—and so the list goes on. They are not unsubstantial amounts.
I then took the opportunity to look at some of the schools in my state, Queensland, picking them just at random. The first one I looked at was the Calvary Christian College, Mount Louisa, Queensland. As against the Trinity Grammar's $3.1 million or the Caulfield Grammar's $3.6 million, Calvary Christian College is going to be better off by $87,410. Columba Catholic College, Charters Towers, in a rural and regional area, is going to be better of by $88,536; Assumption College, Warwick, by $21,232; the Darling Downs Christian School, $31,824. Those amounts pale into insignificance alongside the windfall that is going to be received by the likes of Trinity Grammar and Caulfield Grammar. This is not the politics of envy. It is purely and simply that the resources are going to the wrong place. We see that the 61 category 1 schools are benefiting disproportionately from this process, and there is a meagre handout, at best, to the state school system.
People from both the state school system and the private system have corresponded with me on this issue. It is interesting to note that we are being asked by the state school system to reject the legislation, to say that the way in which the government has cut the cake is unfair and should be rejected completely by this parliament. On the other side of the lobby, the private schools have been exhorting me, as a senator, to accept the government's legislation. Those private schools could surely not be at odds with the stance that Labor has taken. Labor will seek, in its amendments, to have the 61 category 1 schools as funding maintained schools, that is, they would be treated the same way as 272 other non-government schools which are funding maintained, and in a similar way to the 1,600 Catholic schools which have opted out of the socioeconomic status—SES—system. The proposals being put forward by Labor seek to address the issue of funding those 61 category 1 schools. I do not think anyone would, by any stretch of the imagination, see those schools as being poor, impoverished or unable to provide fair and reasonable access to an up-to-date education system such as our young people are entitled to and need to have if we as a nation are to prosper. 
If one looks at the Labor proposal, one sees that the amendment seeks to take the funding out of the category 1 schools and give it to special education. That redirection of funds in the order of $100,000 would assist schools which provide education for students with disabilities. Labor's proposal is to double per capita funding in the non-government special education area and, of course, it would quadruple per capita funding in the government's special education area. That seems to me to be a proposal that is fair and reasonable, and it is a proposal that one could live with in good conscience. That is not defeating the bill because, as we all know, Labor has given a commitment that the bill will pass. Senator Watson made the point, and quite rightly, that there are people in the education area who want to fix their budgets for the next year and are needing to pay people.
What we are looking at is a piece of legislation that will set the funding for the next quadrennium, the next four years. What is put in place now is terribly important. If the additional $30 million that has been given to category 1 schools can, by good conscience, be redirected towards special education, it does not affect the funding that goes to the non-government schools; it does not affect the funding that goes to the private system; and it does not affect the funding that will go to the Catholic systemic system. I would maintain that the only losers under the Labor proposal will be those schools which I would maintain have the capacity to be placed on a funding maintained basis. Good conscience and equity alone would dictate that. That should not be lost in this debate, because I think there are a few red herrings flying around out there about what the proposals of Labor are exactly about.
I have taken only a few examples out of the correspondence that I have been given, but I am sure that the Cooloola Christian College, on College Road, Gympie—which has written to me asking me to support the bill—the Trinity College, on Archer Street, Gladstone, and the Parents and Friends Association of A.B. Paterson College at Arundel on the Gold Coast would not be averse to the Labor proposals. I have not consulted them and I have not raised it with them. But the Labor proposals in no way affect the funding of those organisations, nor would the Labor proposal in any way affect the funding that will be given to the Calvary Christian College or the Colombia Catholic College, or the Assumption College or the Darling Downs Christian College—just to name a few. As I keep saying, this is an issue of equity, of good conscience. 
Labor, in its proposed amendments, has said that it will seek the abolition of the enrolment benchmark adjustment. That will have the effect of reinjecting more than $30 million a year into the public school system. So that is a plus for the public school system. I believe the amendments that Labor will move in this area, together with the funding-maintained schools, the increases in funding for special education and the abolition of the enrolment benchmark adjustment, are, indeed, important enhancements to the bill. They are enhancements that will help our younger generation, who are deserving of the best that we can provide to them. 
I cannot be convinced by the argument about the 61 category 1 schools. If one looks at the complete list of those schools, one finds that there are very few there who would be in need. There may well be the odd person who receives a scholarship to attend one of these schools but, in the main, they are not from what I would call average suburbia, average Australia, and they would not be in any need or want whatsoever. Having experienced a private school education myself, as have my children, having come from that background, I believe that what is happening with the 61 category 1 schools is totally inequitable. That has been the focus of Labor, along with its other initiatives, and I commend to the Senate the amendments that Labor will move during the consideration of this legislation. ",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-11-09,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 puts in place the 1999 budget announcement which delivers almost $800 million extra for private schools, but only $90 million for government schools—and government schools have twice the number of pupils as private schools. I put some emphasis on the 1999 budget decision, because we have been waiting an extraordinarily long time for this piece of legislation to come into the House of Representatives and then to the Senate. I think it has been a deliberate tactic of this Liberal-National Party government, and in particular the minister in the other place, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, to hold back this legislation until the last possible moment.
We know the legislation has to be passed, for obvious reasons, and there are some amendments that the Labor Party is proposing which I will touch on a little later. But it has been a deliberate tactic of the government to hold this legislation back until the last possible moment. Not only that; we have seen in the behaviour of the minister, particularly, and in the behaviour of the Liberal-National Party government in general, a very long period of seeking to hide, to keep secret, the outcomes of this legislation. 
What concerns me overwhelmingly with this legislation is its basic unfairness. The Labor Party, and I personally, have always supported funding for needy private schools. We had a very lengthy and bitter debate in the 1960s about the funding of private schools, but I believe philosophically that needy private schools should receive assistance from government, and I think that is a principle that most people in this country accept. But what surprises me—actually, it does not surprise me, having regard to this minister, I have to say—is that, in some recent remarks about this legislation, the minister, Dr Kemp, mentioned private schools eight times but only mentioned government schools twice.
The comments by the minister have been marked by very hysterical, inaccurate and defensive correspondence, as well as public remarks, addressed to government school principals and to the media in general. I think this has served to highlight the approach of the minister in respect of his schools funding, which is unbalanced and unfair. I said earlier that the Labor Party is supporting the legislation with amendment. We believe those amendments are very important.
As I said earlier, this is a budget announcement from 1999. Over the last year and a half our shadow education minister, Mr Lee, has spent a great deal of time trying to find out what the precise impact of this legislation would be. However, it has been like extracting teeth, trying to find out the precise outcome and impact of this legislation. The minister and the government have been involved in trying to cover up as desperately as they can the impact of the legislation and the suspicions the Labor Party has had that this legislation represents a very significant increase in funding for the wealthier private schools. 
Labor's concerns were confirmed at the Senate estimates hearings in August of this year after questioning by Labor senators. I pay tribute here to Senator Carr, who has pursued this issue very vigorously. In front of the estimates committee it was finally admitted that the additional moneys for the 62 wealthier schools was probably in the vicinity of $50 million, although we now know it is more than that. It took months and months and months of trying to extract figures from the government before we got some idea of what the figure would be for the wealthiest private schools. This occurred finally at estimates hearings earlier this year.
What we are facing is an extreme ideological drive by Minister Kemp and the Liberal-National Party to shift funding from needy schools, both government and private but particularly the government sector, to the wealthier private schools. This is an ideological position. It is interesting to note that the Labor Party obtained the 1991 minutes of the Liberal-National Party's ERC processes where the current Minister Kemp is recorded as saying: 
Noted that the Coalition sought to encourage students to move from government to non-government schools. 
This was back in 1991. It said that the now minister, Minister Kemp, would report back to the Liberal-National Party's ERC on non-government schools and whether additional expenditure could be offset by reductions in grants to government schools and in untied grants. This was a clear philosophical position, on this occasion—in secret, of course—laid down by the minister some 10 years ago. 
Look at what the Liberal-National Party government have done since their election to office in 1996. Minister Kemp has systematically implemented the philosophical and ideological commitment that was laid out in secret in 1991. I will give some examples. Firstly, there was the establishment of the enrolment benchmark adjustment policy, which has taken $60 million from government schools so far. Secondly, there was the cutting of untied grants to the states in the area of education by more than $1.5 billion in 1996. And now we have the third element, which we are considering in this legislation: the massive biasing of Commonwealth funding in favour of wealthy private schools. So this has been a long-term ideological commitment of the minister and the Liberal-National Party.
In the House of Representatives, the trade union background of some members and senators on the Labor side is often highlighted. Frankly, I am not one to take a great deal of notice of the background of members and senators from either side of the chamber, but I did note the recent survey of the educational background of the current federal cabinet that was published in the Sydney Morning Herald.
—You ask me how I got to my school and I'll tell you.
—You interject, Senator, but you are one of those who likes to allege the trade union background as having some sort of impact on our approach to legislation. I am not going to make that allegation about members of the current Liberal-National Party cabinet, but I will draw the attention of the chamber to this Herald survey and the population can draw their own conclusions. Let us run through the survey, because I think it is important background information that people should be aware of. The survey shows that three-quarters of the current federal cabinet went to exclusive private schools. Of the remaining 14 cabinet ministers, 12 attended private schools such as Scotch College, Carey Grammar and Geelong Grammar in Victoria, and the King's School and Barker College in New South Wales. There are two cabinet ministers who went to Catholic schools: the former New South Wales Premier and now Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Fahey, went to Chevalier College in the New South Wales Southern Highlands, and the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Alston, went to Xavier College in Melbourne. Apparently the bias in respect of private-public was not as marked in the outer ministry, with three ministers attending government schools and the other 10 attending private schools, five of which were Catholic. I mention these statistics in passing; people will make their own judgments. But I do wonder about the level of neutrality when it comes to decisions.
—Don't comment on Natasha, because her mother will write to you.
—You get outraged, Senator, but when you choose to highlight the trade union background of people on this side of the chamber maybe you should think about the particular allegations you make in respect of that link. This serves to illustrate the bias of the current Liberal-National Party government in respect of the extraordinary additional funding that is going to wealthy private schools as a result of this legislation. But this debate has been highlighted by a significant level of vitriol, personal abuse and attack, and the minister has engaged in some extraordinary criticisms. The bill in respect of the legislation resulted in 100 prominent people signing an open letter condemning the philosophical approach of the government. The signatories included actress Sigrid Thornton; singer Paul Kelly; food writer Stephanie Alexander; trade union leader Sharan Burrow, apparently, and Olympic gold medallist Natalie Cook. A long list of prominent Australians expressed their concerns about the philosophy behind this particular piece of legislation. Minister Kemp just dumped on the signatories of the letter and accused them of being all the usual suspects. He can probably make that claim about Sharan Burrow, but the list of very prominent, and I think balanced, Australians who served that letter should not be subject to abuse in this way by the minister. 
To highlight some of the schools that will be receiving additional money, I will run down the list of Australia's 12 wealthiest schools and what they will receive: Trinity Grammar, New South Wales, an additional $3.1 million; Newington College, New South Wales, an additional $1.8 million; Wesley College, Victoria, an additional $3.9 million; and Caulfied Grammar, Victoria, an additional $3.6 million. I could go on, but the top 12 receive an additional $27.3 million.
In respect to King's School, I was given a copy of a pamphlet which outlines the facilities available at the school. They are very impressive. I congratulate King's School on having this extraordinary array of educational facilities. I am sure that the students and the parents are deeply appreciative of them. But most private schools would not have this range of facilities, including reflection pools and a centre for learning and leadership—certainly, I do not know of any in my home state of Tasmania—and the list just goes on and on. It is very impressive. The point I would make, and it is fundamental to fairness, is: why should a school like this, which has excellent facilities already, receive an additional $1.5 million in funding? The reality is that resources are scarce and have to be shared not only between private schools. It is just not fair to the overwhelming majority of students who go to public schools and the needy private schools in this country for this approach to be taken.
The amendments that Labor is moving are very important. They go fundamentally to attempting to restore fairness in this legislation. There are three key amendments. Firstly, the abolition of the enrolment benchmark adjustment, known as the EBA, has been used by the Liberal and National parties to take more than $60 million of funding out of government schools over the last three years. By the abolition of this unfair benchmark, Labor will be injecting more than $30 million a year back into public schools. 
The category 1 schools are the wealthiest private schools and I have referred to a number of them. There are 61 in this category. They are getting increased funding under this legislation of an average of $900,000 a year and $57 million a year in total. Labor's amendment is to limit the funding to the 61 category 1 schools at their current level. I think that is quite fair and reasonable, given the very extensive, comprehensive and very adequate range of facilities and the education levels offered at those institutions. 
Thirdly, in the interest of fairness, Labor's proposal is to increase funding for special education. This funding in a responsible way is achieved by redirecting the money from the 61 wealthiest private schools. The money that is saved here will go to those students, whether at government or private schools, who are in need of special education. In the case of government schools there is an increase of $30 million a year, and that is money that will be very well spent. 
I just conclude my remarks on this legislation by making the summary that, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, this legislation raises a matter of fundamental fairness and equity. Is it fair and reasonable to significantly increase moneys to the wealthiest 61 private schools in this country when they do not need that additional money for the education services of the facilities they offer? Is that fair when, at the same time, a very significant number of government schools and needy private schools struggle to in any way match the facilities and the education levels offered by those very wealthy schools? This approach of the Liberal National Party government and particularly the minister in the other place, Dr Kemp, highlights the elitist view of this government when it comes to education—and a range of other policy areas, but we are talking about education funding today. They are elitist, they are out of touch, and they are fundamentally unfair. ",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2000-11-09,"—We have heard repeated a number of times in this chamber on this debate the need for fairness and equity across the spectrum of education, particularly to students. A lot has been said, but there has been very little said on the real recipients of what this debate is about, and that is the students. It is all right for us to say that we want fairness and equity as to the distribution of the funding, but if that fairness and equity does not go to the real core of the business of education—that is, the students—then we are missing the mark quite badly. The bill, in its current form, does miss that mark. It provides funding for one class of school against another—that is, to some 61 of what I would call the elite schools as opposed to those in the public school system. If we are going to provide funding to one class of student as opposed to another then there is inequity, and the long-term damage to this country will be felt for many years to come.
The idea of education, in my understanding—and it may be very rudimentary—is that all students should get the opportunity to learn to read, to write and to count and then go on to contribute to the nation's future. If we look at South Australia, we find that there are five schools in the category 1 situation. Knowing those schools as I do—not particularly intimately, but knowing their circumstances—I am not too certain that any one of them is in great need of financial assistance. They need the assistance of the government—they are no different from any other school—but on the basis of their contribution to society in teaching, the facilities they have and the backgrounds of those students who attend, they are quite different from those in the public sector.
The real difficulty I have is that a great deal of money will be going to the wealthier schools as opposed to the less wealthy or the public schools. If you look at the schools in South Australia, they will be getting between $243 and $383 per student in 2001, going up to $1,100 to $1,800 per student in 2004. The public schools will be getting $4,000 for the entire school community. I am not too sure either whether the wealthier schools have to have fundraising events to provide the basic needs of some students, such as cornflakes or toast and jam to give them a breakfast before they start their school work in the mornings because the parents just do not have the means to provide it for them. I do not see those wealthier schools having their fetes and applauding themselves when they can get $1,000 or $2,000 as a result of that event. What I do see is that those fetes in the wealthier schools are catered for.
The real damage that is being done to the system now is that those in most need are those who are losing out by what is happening and by what is proposed through this bill. Those who have the greatest need are in the public education system, where the children from disadvantaged backgrounds and the children with learning difficulties are mostly found. We also find that 88 per cent of the indigenous students received only 65.5 per cent of the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program funding in 1995-96. This is predicted, from what I have found, to decline to 52 per cent by the end of this financial year—an extraordinary reduction. 
The special learning needs and targeted programs as a whole show similar patterns. Public schools cater for more of the needy in our society, yet Commonwealth funding, even in equity programs, seems to be grossly skewed in favour of private schools—those schools which are in the category 1 group.
I think we have a responsibility when we are considering this bill to look at its impact and to make those changes that are necessary in order to return some degree of equity not only to the students but to the school communities and to the community at large. The whole emphasis of the bill is on catering only for the wealthy schools at the real expense of state schools. The response of the government to this claim is to say that public schools are state or territory responsibilities. To some extent, that is correct. But speaking for public schools in South Australia, it is not so much the state government that is doing the damage; it is the reduction in funding at a federal level. We can certainly highlight the inadequacies of the state government, with their cuts and school closures.  
None of the five category 1 schools in South Australia is earmarked for closure, but schools throughout the state are being reviewed at this moment as to their ongoing viability on a cost basis, without any concern for the impact that may have on the student population. It is not reasonable to suggest that the private school sector, such as the Catholic or Christian schools throughout South Australia, can take up the slack. They are no better off. The majority of them fall into categories 11, 10 and 8. It is not reasonable to suggest that they provide the answer to the real issue that is facing the nation at the moment in relation to education—that is, educating young people to contribute to the future of Australia.
The amendments to be moved by the Australian Labor Party will go a long way towards righting some of the wrongs that are contained in the bill at the moment. We believe that the category 1 schools should be held where they are for the moment; that the additional funding being directed towards them should be put towards assisting those public schools which have a wealth of children who are disadvantaged or from an indigenous background and who are suffering because of lack of facilities and lack of ability on the part of those schools to provide a reasonable education that will give them a role in the future.
Unless we take steps now, the current values and ethos of public education will be undermined and the role of a coherent and cohesive public education system will simply collapse. That will be to the detriment of us all. We need to look, too, at the contributions that parents make. I have no difficulty with any child being sent to a category 1 school, to a private school. My neighbours can send their children wherever they wish, if they have the means to do so.
What I do have a difficulty with is that those in most need do not have that opportunity—people who live in the outback and in small communities where the income of families is so much smaller than it is for those living in capital cities or large regional areas. These people suffer. They do not have the same opportunity and there is no fairness in that. There is no fairness for a child living in a remote area not having the opportunity to learn at the same rate as a child who can be sent to a more luxurious school, one that can provide amenities that are not available elsewhere. 
We cannot allow government subsidies to go to schools that already have resources in abundance. We need to redirect that money to where it is properly needed: to indigenous education and to schools providing high levels of training and one-to-one education for children with learning difficulties or with social background problems. At the moment the bill, as it is designed, cannot provide for these.
The enrolment benchmark adjustment has taken some $60 million away from the Australian public school system. If we are going to have equity and fairness in what is being done to educate our community for the future, then the enrolment benchmark adjustment simply has to be abolished. We have to find a better way to more equitably spread the funds across the education system to provide the teachers with the opportunity to properly educate those that are put in their care and to give the opportunity to children to learn those things that they desire to learn. I commend the amendments to be put forward by the Labor Party to the Senate.
Finally, it is difficult to come here after being out in the community for so long dealing with public schools—and private schools to some extent. It has been difficult to be out there and to see how the schools are suffering, to take the phone calls that we have taken in my office and to read the emails that have come through not only from my own state but also from the other states. They are pleading for this bill to be defeated as it currently stands and asking for assistance to cater for those in need and to get further education for young people who are leaving the system simply because their parents cannot afford the very basic education that they need. 
We talk about wanting to grow this country. Unless we put those funds into a system that provides equality for all children to learn and for equality for all schools to compete on the same basis, we can no longer call ourselves lucky. We can no longer say that we are truly catering for the needs of the nation's future. We have an ageing work force, and at some point in the not too distant future that work force will need to be replaced. Unless the young people coming through now are properly educated and have the opportunity to use the latest educational facilities, they will not be able to contribute into the future as we require them to do and this country will further slip behind the rest of the world in self-esteem and in providing for the future needs of our economy.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-11-09,"—This time I am able to thank Senator Cook for giving my office plenty of notice of his intention to raise this matter after question time. This is better than the way Senator Cook proceeded last time. I want to put on record that I appreciate the courtesy with which this matter has been dealt with this time—in contrast with last time. 
I would not want Senator Cook to think, having raised these issues, that I have done nothing about them. I always take particular notice of what Senator Cook says—and he has the same interests as me. I am advised that the answer to question No. 2944 was tabled two days ago, on 7 November. As to questions Nos 2899 and 2904, I have the answers on hand and I will seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard. I have looked more closely at question No. 2943, which is in 13 parts. It seeks a vast amount of information, which it requires to be drawn from a number of areas in the tax office. My office has had discussions with the tax office and, to be quite frank, if there is a huge amount of work involved, I am not prepared to authorise that it be carried out. 
The tax office is always busy, but this is a particularly busy time. We are not trying to hide any information from Senator Cook, but at the end of the day a minister must make a judgment as to whether he is prepared to authorise the undertaking of work that will entail a great deal of effort on the part of the tax office. I will look at the question and at those parts of it that I feel we can answer without tying up vast resources. I will see what we can do. I will have to reflect upon those parts of the question that I think will require a great many resources and see whether we can provide the detailed information that Senator Cook requires. I seek leave to incorporate the answers in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answers read as follows—
TREASURY Senate (Question No. 2899)
SENATOR COOK asked the Assistant Treasurer upon notice on 7 September 2000:
(1) When the Government announced, on 30 June 2000, its decision to legislate against the abuse of employee benefit arrangements relating to superannuation, why did the Government only announce a review rather than legislative action in relation to the abuse by company executives of employee share plans that was identified by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in its submission to the inquiry into employee share ownership plans by the House of Representatives Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee.
(2) In the ATOs submission to the same House of Representatives committee inquiry into employee share ownership schemes, dated 30 April 1999, the ATO estimated the revenue at risk from abuse by company executives of employee benefit arrangements at $1.5 billion (as confirmed in evidence given to the committee by the ATO on 11 May 2000): What is the latest estimate of revenue at risk from employee benefit arrangement type schemes, given the evidence of ongoing aggressive marketing of the schemes provided by the Member of Lalor at the 11 May 2000 hearings. 
(3) What is the estimated revenue impact of the exemption provided in Taxation Ruling TR 1999/5 `for taxpayers who have received a Private Ruling (under part IVAA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953) and have implemented the arrangement ruled on, in substantially the same terms as the Private Ruling'. 
(4) How much money has been identified by the ATO as flowing into non-complying NZ superannuation and like schemes over the past 4 financial years. 
(5) (a) What estimates, or educated estimates, were available to the Government as at the end of March 1996 of the revenue at risk from the abuse of employee benefit arrangements and (b) what steps were taken by the Government to address the abuse of these arrangements. 
Senator Kemp - I have provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions: 
(1) I refer the honourable Senator to my Press Release of 30 June 2000 which outlines the reasons provided for the actions announced on that day. 
(2) The premise of the question is false. The ATO did not claim that $1.5 billion in revenue was at risk. The ATO has consistently stated that abusive employee benefit arrangements are not effective under existing law. 
(3) and (4) Estimates have not been published.  
(5)(a) and (b) No estimates have been provided to the current Government of the revenue at risk from the abuse of employee benefit arrangements because as the ATO has stated, abusive employee benefit arrangements are not effective under the existing law. 
—————
TREASURY Senate (Question No. 2904) 
SENATOR COOK asked the Assistant Treasurer upon notice on 7 September 2000: 
(1)(a) Who is conducting the review into the abuse of employment benefit arrangements announced by the Government on 30 June 2000; (b) what stage has the review reached; (c) on what date is it anticipated the review will be concluded; and (d) will the results of the review be publicly announced and/or tabled in Parliament. 
(2) In evidence given to the House of Representatives Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee, on 11 May 2000, representatives of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) stated roughly one-third of the employment benefit arrangement schemes that could be the subject of litigation had made use of the ATOs safe harbour arrangements and sought to come to an agreement regarding the payment of tax: (a) how many schemes have come to an agreement regarding the payment of tax; (b) how much tax has been paid as a result of these agreements; and (c) how much in tax and penalties has the ATO agreed to forgo to come to these agreements. 
(3) In evidence given to the House of Representatives Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee, on 11 May 2000, representatives of the ATO stated Federal Court litigation was being undertaken in order to recover tax from employment benefit arrangement schemes: (a) how many Federal Court cases have been initiated; (b) how much tax would be payable if the ATO were successful in each of the cases; (c) at what stage is the litigation process in each case; and (d) have any of the cases in which court action has been initiated been subsequently settled; if so, what are the terms of settlement and what is the difference between the settlement amount and that originally by the ATO. 
Senator Kemp - I have provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's questions: 
(1)(a)-(c) A review is being conducted by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) of the interaction of the income tax and fringe benefits tax laws to ensure that employee benefit trusts and employee share plans are taxed appropriately. 
(d) If any announcements are to be made, the honourable Senator will be aware of them when they are made.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-11-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation. 
The minister thanked me for being courteous and for giving him more notice of my intentions this time than I did last time. I gave the minister sufficient notice last time as well and he criticised me for providing insufficient notice. This is very odd behaviour. The minister has gone beyond the regulatory time for providing answers. He is late, yet he criticises me for giving him notice of my intention to ask: `Why haven't you supplied the answers?' Yet again, this is insulting behaviour—as if last time I did not give him notice before question time.
—As if you are the one at fault.
—That is right. The minister is at fault: he has passed the 30-day rule. As he leaves the chamber and turns his back on this debate, it is worth recording that the minister is well and truly in breach of a rule that applies in this chamber to ensure that ministers answer questions from the Senate. I thank the minister for—at long last, after three tries and three reminders—incorporating in Hansard late answers to two questions. I will read those answers and, if they produce more questions, I will pursue the matter further.
Can I just say this? In answer to question No. 2943, the minister says, `This is a long question,' and that, if he `deems' that too much time will be required by the tax office to answer the question, he will decline to answer it. That is just a barefaced refusal by the minister, on behalf of the executive wing of government, to provide to the parliament the information that we seek—information that in the case of this question is quite clearly necessary; and it is responsible information that should be provided. If the forums of this parliament do not operate, if ministers refuse to answer questions on notice past the deadline on which answers by resolution of this chamber are required to be delivered—and, in the case of this question, after prompting on two previous occasions—and respond with a tempestuous display of `Oh, it might take too much time,' then what avenue can be followed by any member of this chamber or any citizen in this country who wants to inquire of the executive wing of government about issues of considerable importance? Does this not smack of high-handed censorship and denial of the right of senators and citizens in this democracy to know what is happening, when ministers just slam the door on those questions and refuse to provide answers? 
At this stage the minister has not refused to provide the answer, so it would be premature of me to take this debate further. What the minister has done is given notice that he may refuse to provide the answer. I am going to be patient. I am going to wait until the next fortnightly sitting. If the answers are given in full, that will be fine—and congratulations. At long last the government will have done what it is required to do: it will have performed its duty, albeit late and albeit after several promptings. But if the answers are not given, then that does raise a serious matter of accountability by the government to the community and the parliament. That will therefore raise a serious matter of breach of faith in this chamber and with the community by the government.
I remember quite well, before the 1996 election, the Prime Minister promising an honest and accountable parliament and an honest and accountable government. I do not remember, I have to say, too many occasions on which that promise has been honoured. But here is one opportunity for the Assistant Treasurer to prove that the Prime Minister meant what he said: for his colleagues in the government to live up to the Prime Minister's undertaking given to the Australian people in a pre-election speech and do as he promised. One hopes it was, in fact, a core promise and not a non-core promise. But I do mark the spot now that, if this answer is not provided, I will be pursuing the matter further.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-11-09,"—I thank Senator Bolkus for the reminder. I did promise on Tuesday to investigate the question that Senator Bolkus asked. To quote myself on that occasion:
As I said, I am happy to investigate that on his behalf but, more importantly, on behalf of the residents of South Australia ...
My investigations reveal that the Aged Care Act 1997 requires that the income derived and the retention amounts from accommodation payments must be used for the purposes of: providing aged care services to meet capital works costs relating to residential care; retiring debt relating to residential care; and improving the quality and range of aged care services where no capital expenditure is reasonably necessary to comply with certification or accreditation. Accountability for the use of these funds is achieved through certification and accreditation standards introduced by this government. Funding is forfeited if these standards are not maintained, and this creates the imperative to use the money for capital purposes to the extent necessary. It also allows the flexibility to apply to care and services where there is no capital need. All providers, even those intending to leave the industry, will have capital related expenses such as depreciation. Moneys earned from accommodation payments provide a source of funds to meet these expenses. That is by way of preliminary. Senator Bolkus also asked in relation to the Hindmarsh Nursing Home: where has the money gone? I have been unable to answer that question.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-09,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on its inquiry into the mandatory bid rule. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON CORPORATIONS AND SECURITIES ON THE MANDATORY BID RULE
On 7 December 1999, the Minister for Financial Services & Regulation, the Hon. Joe Hockey MP, requested that the Committee consider whether the framework for regulating takeover activity contained in the Corporations Law should be amended to include the Mandatory Bid Rule (MBR).  
The MBR would allow a bidder to acquire shares above the statutory threshold of 20 per cent of the voting shares in a target company in advance of a formal takeover bid or announcement, provided the acquisition was immediately followed by an unconditional cash takeover bid for the remaining shares.  
The MBR was included in the Government's Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998.  However the relevant provisions were removed from the Bill by the Senate on 13 October 1999.  The MBR was therefore not included in the final version of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999 (CLERP Act) that commenced on 13 March 2000.  
The Parliamentary Joint Committee's Report on the Mandatory Bid Rule
The Committee tabled its report on the MBR on 21 June 2000.  It recommended `that the MBR as proposed in the CLERP Bill should be enacted'.  It also recommended that the operation of the MBR should be reviewed two years after its commencement.  
A dissenting report by the Committee's four Australian Labor Party (ALP) members recommended that the Corporations Law not be amended to include the MBR.  It stated that `the Labor Party does not believe that the advantages of such a rule outweigh its disadvantages'.  
A minority report by Australian Democrats Senator Murray recommended `that the MBR not be enacted at this time'.  However it indicated that the Australian Democrats might be prepared to support the adoption of the MBR at a later date.  Senator Murray's report indicated that the other reforms contained in the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999 (CLERP Act) as well as the introduction by the Government of rollover relief from capital gains tax in relation to scrip for scrip bids had the potential to increase the level of Australian takeover activity.  It suggested that any decision concerning the introduction of the MBR should be delayed until the impact of these other reforms had been assessed.
The Government's Response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee Report
The Government supports the Committee's recommendation that the MBR proposed in the CLERP Bill should be enacted.  In the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the CLERP Bill the Government has already indicated that it would `review the operation of the MBR two years after its commencement, to ensure that the Government's policy goals with the introduction of the mandatory bid are being achieved'.  
In the light of the present views of the other parties in the Senate, the Government will not seek at this time to re-introduce legislation containing the MBR.  Nonetheless, as the Government believes, for the reasons set out in the remainder of this response, that the implementation of the MBR would be a worthwhile reform, it remains committed to the introduction of the necessary legislative amendments at the appropriate time.  
A More Efficient Market for Corporate Control
The Government believes that enactment of the MBR would enhance the efficiency of the market for corporate control in Australia.  It would therefore complement other reforms to the regulatory framework governing takeovers in Australia contained in the CLERP Act.  
Despite the positive contribution made by the CLERP Act reforms, the Government believes that the current regulatory framework continues to place unnecessary obstacles in the path of corporate takeover activity by preventing a bidder from obtaining a controlling stake in a target company except through a public auction process.  This is because prospective bidders may refrain from launching takeover bids because of their reluctance to participate in a public auction process.  
This reluctance is due primarily to the uncertainty inherent in launching a formal takeover bid and to the high transaction costs associated with takeovers.  These costs derive from the potential for free riding and ""greenmailing"" by rival bidders as well as the scope available for the adoption of defensive tactics by target companies.  The uncertainty and cost associated with takeover bids in the current environment reduces the contestability of the market for corporate control in Australia.  
The enactment of the MBR will ameliorate these problems by providing potential bidders with the option of acquiring a controlling interest in a company without a public auction.  This has the potential to reduce the uncertainty and costs associated with takeover bids which in turn can be expected to increase the contestability and efficiency of the market for corporate control in Australia.  
A number of benefits can be expected to be derived from establishing a more efficient market for corporate control.  Most importantly, the threat or increased prospect of a takeover can be expected to significantly enhance managerial performance and work to more closely align the interests of managers with those of their shareholders.  This will significantly increase the pressure on corporate boards and managers to perform to the benefit of all shareholders in listed companies.  Enhanced corporate performance would improve allocative efficiency by ensuring that corporate assets are put to their most valuable use.  A more efficient market for corporate control can therefore be expected to benefit all shareholders whether a takeover occurs or not, as well as the economy more generally.  
While the enactment of the MBR should reduce some of the uncertainties and costs associated with takeover activity, it will not necessarily reduce the size of the control premium paid by the bidder.  This is because the MBR maintains and strengthens `price tension' on the value of shares.  Shareholders, including those with a substantial shareholding, have a powerful incentive to gain the highest possible price from any prospective buyer.  This incentive is also evident in the case of so-called `distressed sellers', since creditors will also seek to obtain the best price for a parcel of shares.  Under the MBR shareholders would remain at liberty not to sell their shares or seek a better offer if they believe that the price being offered is too low and that a higher price could be obtained through a public auction process. 
Protection for Minority Shareholders
The Government believes that the MBR provides ample protection for minority shareholders.  A number of specific protections are afforded as part of the MBR provisions that would augment those provided by the other relevant provisions of the Corporations Law.  As the Committee noted in its report, the requirement for the transfer of a controlling stake to be followed by an unconditional cash offer to remaining shareholders ensures that all shareholders have an opportunity to exit the company following the transfer of control.  Conditional bids would be prohibited as these could deny minority shareholders the opportunity to exit the company.  
The MBR would also maintain the principle of `equal opportunity' by ensuring that minority shareholders participate in any control premium obtained by the initial seller.  This is achieved by requiring the consideration offered to remaining shareholders as part of a mandatory bid to equal or exceed the value of the consideration received by the initial seller.   
Under the Government's proposal, minority shareholders would remain at liberty to reject an offer to purchase their shares under a mandatory bid.  Mandatory bidders would therefore face the potential prospect of being left without full control of the target at the completion of the bid period.  As bidders would wish to avoid this predicament, they have a powerful incentive to offer sufficient consideration to ensure that remaining shareholders sell into the bid (including, if necessary, increasing the size of the consideration offered under the mandatory bid).  
The MBR proposed by the Government also contains several further safeguards for minority shareholders.  These include the right of minority shareholders to receive an independent report evaluating the adequacy of the consideration offered under the mandatory bid, prohibitions against the bidder exercising control of the target until after the beginning of the offer period under the mandatory bid, and restrictions against securities being issued, dividends declared or distributions made during the mandatory bid period.  For these reasons, the Government does not accept the suggestion that small shareholders are more likely to be disadvantaged or presented with a fait accompli under the MBR.

I table today the committee's third report on the Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS). Senators will recall that they referred the matter of the PBS to the committee in November 1996, following the widespread dissatisfaction expressed with the documents in the 1996-97 budget estimates hearings. The committee has continued to monitor the reception accorded to the PBS since that time and to report as necessary.
This report is based largely on the views expressed by senators in the context of the 2000-01 budget estimates hearings and at an informal briefing with officers from the Department of Finance and Administration held on 4 October. The committee did not attempt to evaluate accrual budgeting per se, nor the quite separate but frequently confused issue of the outcomes and outputs reporting framework. It merely considered the difficulties reflected by senators in their use of the documents and developed a number of suggestions and recommendations that build on the committee's previous recommendations.
High amongst the priorities expressed for the PBS is stability in the reporting frameworks. In addition to stability, these also need to be sufficiently disaggregated to enable comparisons to be validly drawn on pricing and performance. In this report, the committee has suggested that real funding changes need to be identified more clearly and that partial performance information should be provided where possible in the PBS. It has also recommended that the PBS contain the name and contact details of an officer in each agency who can answer factual questions on the contents of that agency's PBS.
The committee has again recommended that forward estimates be provided, at the very least for administered items. 
In a few areas, the committee believes that agencies are well aware of problems and are actively taking steps to remedy them. In particular, the reporting on progress towards outcomes needs to be much more robust. The committee will continue to monitor developments in this area. 
Finally, the committee encourages all senators to take an active interest in the PBS and to participate in briefings on their contents. The committee again recommends that legislation committees routinely include in their reports on estimates and annual reports an assessment of the adequacy of the PBS and the performance information they provide.
I commend the report to the Senate and I take this opportunity to thank all those senators who assisted the committee in its most recent inquiry.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-11-09,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 21st ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation Conference, which was held in Singapore in September 2000. The 21st AIPO General Assembly was held in Singapore between 10 and 15 September 2000. Parliamentary representatives of eight ASEAN countries, two special observer countries and eight observer countries attended the assembly. The assembly provided a forum from which to examine, discuss and propose solutions to issues of common interest throughout the Asia-Pacific region. One of the major features of the general assembly was the dialogue session during which representatives of the ASEAN member countries discussed issues with the observer countries. During Australia's dialogue session, the key issues examined included regional and political matters, trade and investment issues, environmental issues, and health issues.
During the discussion on regional and political matters, the Cambodian delegation commended Australia for its participation in helping to bring peace to Cambodia during the early 1990s. The Cambodian delegation also sought more information on Australia's domestic response to United Nations committees. The Australian delegation indicated that any examination of its domestic social policies should be balanced and fair. The Australian delegation suggested that Australia was open to scrutiny, provided external bodies were balanced and objective.
As part of the debate on trade and investment, the key issue was the region's response to the Asian financial crisis. We encouraged ASEAN countries to continue with their domestic economic reform programs so that individually and as a regional community we can all benefit from the opportunities of globalisation. I indicated that Australia's experience with globalisation has been extremely favourable, with export industries and foreign investment contributing substantially to employment growth and an increased standard of living.
The Australian delegation elaborated on the merits of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, AFTA. In particular, we encouraged delegates to consider positively the feasibility of an AFTA closer economic relations, CER, free trade area. Economic modelling by the Centre for International Economics shows that the benefit of establishing an AFTA CER free trade agreement during the period 2000 to 2020 would be US$48.1 billion of additional GDP across the ASEAN region.
During the discussion on environmental issues, I indicated Australia's support for environmental initiatives in the ASEAN region. In particular, I elaborated on aid packages to address haze in South-East Asia. These included a $660,000 assistance package in 1998 and a recent announcement to provide approximately $250,000 over 12 months to fund an immediate action plan for West Kalimantan Province through the ASEAN secretariat. The Indonesian delegation indicated its appreciation of Australia for its assistance and support in helping ASEAN to resolve environmental issues and, in particular, the haze problem.
As part of the discussion on health issues, one of the key concerns was the global situation of HIV-AIDS. It was noted that 34 million men, women and children world wide are infected with HIV. Of this total, 18 million people have AIDS. Accordingly, the assembly recognised the need to strengthen existing health mechanisms to include and put emphasis on AIDS. The assembly urged ASEAN member countries to incorporate a regional component to foster ASEAN cooperation in fighting HIV-AIDS in the respective member countries. 
The delegation wishes to make a few recommendations. One of the objectives of the delegation was to identify key practice and features of the AIPO General Assembly that may assist future AIPO delegations. Therefore, the delegation made two recommendations. In recommendation 1, we advise future delegations to ensure that an officer of the Australian overseas post attends the Australian delegation's dialogue session of AIPO. This officer should assist the Australian delegation by coordinating answers to questions taken on notice and then provide information direct to the AIPO member delegate, together with a copy to the leader of the Australian delegation. Recommendation 2 suggests that the Presiding Officers give consideration to the proposal that delegation secretaries to AIPO parliamentary delegations attend at least two or three consecutive AIPO general assemblies. This would enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of future delegations by providing continuity and corporate knowledge.
Because Australia is an observer country to AIPO it does not attend all sessions of the conference. In view of this, the delegation, with the assistance of the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore, attended a series of meetings and inspections with Singaporean organisations. These meetings provided a valuable opportunity to share information and examine issues of mutual interest to both Australia and Singapore. The delegation met first with officials from the Port of Singapore Authority Corporation. The Port of Singapore is, as many of us would know, one of the most efficient container terminals in the world. The PSA Corporation is responsible for the management and the strategic development of the port. As part of this briefing, the PSA Corporation discussed its current and future operations and provided the delegation with a detailed tour of the port. The delegation's next meeting was with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore. IDA provides advice to government and industry on information communications, including telecommunications and Internet commerce. The delegation's final meeting was with the Ministry of Health in Singapore. This briefing focused on health policy issues ranging from health insurance to care and prevention strategies.
The Australian delegation's attendance at the 21st AIPO General Assembly was very successful, and the Australian Parliament was ably represented by my colleagues Ms Burke and Dr Nelson from the House of Representatives. On behalf of my colleagues and me, I express our appreciation to Ms Brenda Herd of the Parliamentary Relations Office, who did an outstanding job in making sure we got there and back. She does a fantastic job for all of us. I can see you, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, nodding in agreement. The contribution of His Excellency Mr Murray McLean, Australian High Commissioner to Singapore, and many of the staff of the High Commission in Singapore was equally outstanding. They really did put themselves out for us. Nothing was ever too much trouble. They played an instrumental part in ensuring that the other meetings we had were as successful as they were, and they also ensured that we were well briefed prior to the AIPO General Assembly. Finally, I put on record our very great thanks to Mr Stephen Boyd, the secretary of the delegation. He was nothing short of brilliant. I know that many of us have been on delegations where the secretary has been outstanding. I can assure the Senate that Mr Boyd did not let down the reputation of his colleagues—he was absolutely terrific.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-11-09,"—When I first entered the Senate, Mr Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister and Mr Howard was both federal Treasurer and a very influential member of cabinet. They presided over a system of parliamentary entitlements in which there was little accountability and absolutely no transparency. Shortly after arriving here I heard various anecdotes which were passed on from one generation to another that would raise concern—for instance, in terms of parliamentary entitlements.  
A Queensland Labor senator who had left this august chamber well over 20 years before I arrived had regularly claimed a form of travel allowance and slept in his parliamentary office. However, because they did not have the same facilities as we have today, every morning he would slip down to the Hotel Kurrajong, sneak in through the side door and have a free breakfast, as though he was a guest at the Kurrajong. This went on for years. In the end, he was finally sprung because he complained that his toast was not hot enough one day and the manageress tracking that through found he was not a guest there. Many other similar anecdotes have come down over the years about people who may not have properly acquitted the entitlements that accrue to us as parliamentarians. But, as I said, it was a different era. That has to be said. There was far less temptation by politicians to keep their peers accountable, and there was certainly little transparency.
The first major change in this, however, came with the passing of freedom of information legislation in the late seventies/early eighties. That enabled any interested party—be they a politician, a journalist or a member of the general public—to use freedom of information to gain an insight into how parliamentary entitlements were being accessed and acquitted. But over the years the value of FOI as a tool has become highly marginalised. It is not that it was a wrong provision, but it does require third-party consultation, which often means very long delays in the response to an FOI request. Sometimes six months, sometimes a year, goes by before a response is given.
The second problem with using freedom of information is the excessive cost involved in this regime at the moment. Let me give you an example. The Melbourne Herald Sun put in an FOI request for information about overseas travel—mostly the overseas travel entitlements component—of members of Parliament. They were billed $279,000 before the information would be provided. I know we have to guard against vexatious use of FOI. I know resources are limited. But all of us have been through this sort cost regime that basically means we cannot afford it. About 2½ to three years ago I put in two FOI requests. The bill for the first one was about $9,200. The bill for the second one was over $2,000. It does make it very expensive. In response it was pointed out to me that I could put questions on notice. I tried to explain to the officials that the information I was seeking I may never want to use. The moment I put a question on notice it is published in the Hansard and can be misinterpreted by anyone who wants to. But it does make it very difficult when freedom of information is so expensive today.
The second avenue, of course—for a parliamentarian, at least—is to ask questions on notice. The current government, you would have to say—like all governments—has got a very mixed track record on questions on notice. The coalition parties and the Democrats when in opposition combined to demand that at least in principle all questions should be answered in 30 days and if not an explanation has to be given. But I think it is true to say that is more honoured in the breach than in the observance. I rarely come in here and complain when it is more than 30 days, because I understand that some complex questions take time to answer. But, for instance, I have got at least 20 questions on notice which have been outstanding for over 500 days. That is an awfully long time in terms of scrutiny of government.
In one notable case—which I complained of recently—Minister Wooldridge refused outright to answer a question that eight of his colleagues had answered fully, citing the reason of cost. I then put further questions on notice, and one of the answers I elicited was that in fact the department forwarded the response to Mr Wooldridge's office within just a few days of me asking the question and it sat there for four months until I raised after question time why it had not been answered. And in that elicited response they said they did not intend to answer it because they thought it was too costly. Having taken out a freedom of information request on the same information I got it within a month. And, to give credit to the department, I got it without charge. So what I am saying is in terms of scrutiny these two tools are very blunt weapons and ones that are not always effective. 
Finally, you can pursue these matters through estimates committees. A question put on notice by Senator Faulkner on 23 May—the answer to which we already knew existed, because the department had said they had just reviewed this area—still is not answered today. That is a question on telecard use. It was not answered, yet they had just done a revision and established telecard use by all members of parliament. That remains unanswered, and it remains unanswered because politically the minister did not want to answer the question at that stage, because it would have revealed that Mr Reith had some problems with his total and maybe in the end with more probing the way that total was in fact achieved.
Let me say that the first major step towards accountability and transparency was taken by the then Special Minister of State, Mick Young, in 1983. For the first time ever, the cost of all travel allowance claims of office holders—mostly ministers, but also leaders of the opposition and presidents and speakers—was published. It was published annually around budget time, after the end of the financial year, for everyone to look at. Virtually at the same time the cost of all Comcar use by office holders was published. Finally, all costs associated with overseas travel by office holders was published on that occasion. This, if you like, was the first step towards transparency of use of parliamentary entitlements. The costs of travel allowance claims and the costs of Comcar use by office holders' staff was also published
The next major advance in transparency was when the Senate published travel allowance claims put in by chairs of Senate committee. This was an initiative of the coalition senators in 1991, and I congratulate them for it. There was some suspicion of abuse, but I think by publishing those figures any suspicion of abuse disappeared. The problem was that, while most travel allowances were claimed for committee work et cetera, there was one exception: chairpersons of committees could claim in their own right as chairpersons of committees—quite a reasonable proposition, especially when they were travelling to Canberra to write and rewrite reports. But the difficulty was that maybe one or two people were abusing it. This initiative, which resulted in the publication of that information, kept people on the straight and narrow.
The next major advance did not come by the way of an initiative; it came when this parliament considered the abuse of entitlements in 1997, owing to the exposure of rorts perpetrated by the then Deputy President, Mal Colston—sorry, that should be Dr Colston. This in turn led to a decision by the Senate, I think made without dissent, to publish all travel allowance claims by senators. That initiative was in turn eventually adopted—somewhat reluctantly, I believe—by the House of Representatives, and they also published all travel allowance claims by members. And in turn, the executive published similar detailed lists.
It was following such publications that  the problems really started. Senator Minchin and Senator Ian Macdonald had to repay travel allowances claimed during the election period—post policy speech. I want to stress here: each one of those claims was legal—it was simply in breach of a convention—and it was really optional for Senators Minchin and Macdonald to repay that money. Similar problems were found with claims by Labor ministers from 1993 and 1996. They similarly had legal claims, but they repaid them because they were in breach of the convention. Of course in all this panic at the time Mr Sharp and Mr McGauran secretly repaid large sums incorrectly claimed in travel allowance. That resulted in Mr Sharp losing his job and Mr McGauran spending a fair bit of time on the interchange bench. It has to be conceded that this was a difficult time for politicians. The public could not understand how Mr McGauran could claim something like $68,000 for basically living at his residence in Melbourne. 
Both chambers then agreed to have KPMG audit travel allowance claims of MPs for the previous two financial years. This audit turned up a significant number of mistakes, but no systemic problems were identified. It also led to the transfer of travel allowance administration for members of parliament—not for the executive—from the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate to the then DAS and later DOFA, which has meant for a more robust examination. None of us like examining these matters in an adversarial way if they exist within parliamentary departments. It is a lot easier if they rest in a government department where there is direct political responsibility, even though some people would say that runs the danger of political manipulation. It is a much healthier system in the long run. New procedures were introduced to vet all travel allowance claims but, even more importantly, twice-yearly publication has achieved full transparency in this regard.
Another lesson that can be learnt is that the minister in charge of these areas should avoid trying to take a partisan political role. It cost Mr Jull his job. This is a stark reminder to all his successors—whoever they are, Labor or Liberal—that transient opportunism comes at a price. The opposition are a little cynical about the claims of the current SMOS that the coalition have cleaned up the area of parliamentary entitlements. I acknowledge they have made advances, but only under the pressure of exposure. It is time now, we are suggesting, to take a quantum leap.
Going into the last election the Australian Labor Party adopted, as part of its election platform, a promise to appoint an auditor of parliamentary entitlements. We did so as a matter of principle, but we also acknowledge that pragmatism suggests this is a very wise course of action. My only doubt about the wisdom of this bill is the term `auditor'. I prefer the term `inspector-general'. When you look at the various inspector-generals that exist and the powers that they have, both in a limited and extensive way, this suggests a better role to me than that of an auditor. We have several inspector-generals working in the Department of Defence, working in the security area, who I think operate very effectively and very independently. But I guess the problem is that this not a term well known to the general public.
The Labor proposal differs a little from the proposals put up by the Democrats, who seem to want to have an ethics commissioner. My problem with that is that a lot of ethics are subjective. I do not accept appointing someone to tell me not what strict laws and regulations to follow but whether or not my ethics are good. But I do accept that the electorate is the best judge of my ethics and that, if they have doubts about that, they will mark my card—and so they should if I misbehave. I would much rather leave it to them than someone we appoint, but we agree to differ on that, I am sure.
Put simply, this act allows the auditor that we appoint to investigate complaints concerning the use of parliamentary entitlements. I think it is sensible to have someone do that. It is up to that auditor to institute a regime to decide how many of these entitlements are published. I argue that the more transparent you are, the less abuse and the fewer attacks on politicians there will be. He or she can also make recommendations to change parliamentary entitlements where they find anomalies here or there. Finally, that person exists to give advice to parliamentarians, hopefully in writing, about how they could access an entitlement or how they should use it. This is very much a vacuum that we live in at the moment.
Situating this auditor in the Auditor-General's office I think makes sense because it is traditionally an independent area and you have to situate this person somewhere. If the scheme comes to fruition, I think it would be nice for there to be agreement, especially amongst the major parties, as to who should be appointed auditor. Eventually that would go in any event to the Joint Public Accounts Committee where it can have some exposure. 
There is no question that the accessing of entitlements by Australian parliamentarians is more scrutinised by both the press and the public in this country than in any other country in the world. The other night I watched A Current Affair. I heard Mike Munro introduce it, and I could have written the script. He went through one entitlement after another—with no qualifications and a bit of distortion, but we all accept that. I will tell you what I found hard to accept: Mike Munro's introduction. I would have accepted every criticism on that show if Mike Munro had anted up his own salary and entitlements at the start of the show. But he did not. Yes, we are well remunerated; yes, we have good parliamentary entitlements to make us do our job. But I tell you what: I am not earning a quarter or probably a tenth of what Mr Mike Munro is earning. He should have put that up front before he took cheap shots at politicians. 
The fact is that, even with the publicity we have had surrounding several cases, the truth has to be put down. There is less abuse of parliamentary entitlements in this country than in almost any comparable country in the world. That does not mean that we should sit back and relax. We should be ever vigilant, and it is in all our interests to make the system as transparent and as accountable as we can. In the end, and I think I have said this in this chamber before, I cannot remember a Liberal or a Labor minister in this country directly accused of taking a bribe in federal parliament. You could not say that about any other country around the globe. There has never been an accusation in this country of `cash for questions' such as has plagued the House of Commons in recent years. There have not been any of those silly defamation cases that Jonathan Aitken and others have been involved in. The problem is that the spotlight is on us. We should not rail about the fact that the spotlight is on us: it always will be. But we should do something about it.
This bill should not be taken as a criticism of the current government. I do not take it as a criticism of the current government. I say it is time to make the next leap forward, to take some of the administration and problems with this out of political hands and have an independent auditor who can in fact ensure proper accountability and proper transparency. With that in place, those who seek to abuse the system will come unstuck. We want a regime that will frown on maximisation and have zero tolerance for rorters. By supporting this legislation and by bringing it into being, you will go a long way down the track towards achieving that. I am not sure whether it will come about now, but I know that eventually it will. So I hope the Senate will give the bill serious consideration. I am sure there will be some suggestions as to the technical aspects of it. Oppositions never draw up perfect bills no matter how much skilled help we have from the Clerk of the Senate, but I really think it is time to contemplate this proposal.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR OF PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES AND ENTITLEMENTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-11-09,"—I would like to start my comments on the Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements Bill 2000 where Senator Ray left off. I am actually sorry that Senator Ray spoke before me because I really would have liked to hear his answers in relation to some of the things I am going to raise in regard to this bill. He mentioned the fact that Australian parliamentarians have a very good record of honesty and that it is a very small proportion of senators or members who have ever gone against the grain. That is true. As Senator Ray quite rightly said, when a few things came to light some years ago, in 1997, an independent audit by KPMG of travel allowance claims was instituted. But the interesting thing about that audit was that it showed an error rate of less than two per cent.
—And not all the same way.
—Exactly right, Senator: not all the same way. But the interesting thing was that it was so small. When we read media reports about that at the time, there was a report right across the media that every member of parliament was rorting the system. If we can have a situation in Australia where less than two per cent do something wrong, this will be a pretty flash country—or even more flash than it already is.
—There would be a lot of lawyers out of work. 
—Exactly, Senator Campbell, there would be a lot of lawyers out of work. But it is interesting because we say that most members and senators are honourable people who, by and large, use their entitlements correctly. Of course, there will always be some who make mistakes and some who make quite genuine mistakes. I think that was the interesting thing about the KPMG audit: an error rate of less than two per cent. The Auditor-General himself usually does not investigate discrepancies of less than five per cent. Yet some members of the opposition would have the public believe that we are all crooks, and I think that is very sad. 
In our society today where authority is being debased the whole time—it does not matter whether it is politicians, police, schoolteachers or whatever—this bill makes fundamental assumptions that the members of this parliament are so untrustworthy that there is a need for a permanent auditor to hang over their heads. One has to ask the rhetorical question: what is wrong with the Auditor-General himself? Are the opposition saying he is not up to the task? I cannot understand, given the recent revelations of things that are happening in Queensland and so forth, why the Labor Party would have such a poor view of themselves and their elected officials. We have to look at the issues, and the bill before us today has a number of very peculiar features. I hope we will get an answer regarding some of these features during this debate.
Firstly, the bill grants an auditor a 10-year term, when the standard term for public service appointments is five years. Why is this the case? The second reading speech gives no reason for this unusually long appointment. Secondly, the Remuneration Tribunal sets the level of remuneration for the auditor. There is a clear conflict of interest here, because the auditor may have to make critical comment about the determinations of the tribunal in the course of issuing guidelines and advice on the use of those entitlements. Thirdly, the bill explicitly states that the appointment of the auditor must be approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. No other section allows the minister to appoint a person to act as auditor on the minister's own discretion. Fourthly, there is a fundamental problem in the proposed role of the auditor. The auditor is not only the adviser for members and senators on the use of their entitlements but also the investigative body for those same entitlements and the body that recommends any change. Therefore, the auditor becomes the rule maker, the policeman, the jury and the Law Reform Commission. Why do we have such a situation being put to the chamber? That is just manifestly unworkable.
Fifthly, the hypocrisy between proposed sections 17 and 20 is outrageous. It grants no punitive measures against uncooperative members and senators and their staff but strong measures against everyone else. Sixthly, proposed section 29(6) means that any offence—even the most minor, even giving a single sheet of paper to another person—immediately becomes a matter which must be referred to the Australian Federal Police. Is that workable? Seventhly, what does proposed section 30(1)(b) actually mean? Are Labor admitting that there are times when it is acceptable to use taxpayer funded entitlements outside the guidelines set out for their use? If this is an admission that the guidelines need to be rubbery, why are they trying to establish a system with absolutes? I want to go to proposed section 30(1), because it is so unclear. It says:
The Auditor may, in his or her discretion, decide not to investigate, or further investigate, a complaint under this Division, if, in the opinion of the Auditor:
(a) the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or was not made in good faith; or
(b) the investigation, or further investigation, of the complaint is not warranted having regard to all the circumstances.
What does that mean? Who makes such a decision? It is an absolutely outrageous proposition. Then we have to look at the way in which this bill could be used against senators and members. It is a very intrusive bill which makes the proposed system unworkable. 
I am sure that the Labor Party and the Democrats know that this is unworkable. They are such political opportunists that they are still proceeding so as to paint all members of parliament as crooks. There is an element in the media that wants to believe that and that wants to portray that. I know that Senator Ray said, `Wouldn't it be nice if, one day, one of the reports in any of the electronic media or print media actually spelt out what these commentators are getting paid?' I am talking about what John Laws is getting paid or what Alan Jones is getting paid and whether or not they use their mobile phones to ring home and whether or not they use their work phones to ring home. 
—Do you mean paid by the ABA or paid by 2UE?
—Exactly. Who are they paid by? I am talking about the cash for comments thing. They rail against members of parliament but they never declare their self-interest. They rail against members of parliament travelling overseas, but there is a traffic jam out at Fairbairn if there is a plane going overseas. They are all trying to get up the gangway at the same time—with their mobiles, with their laptops and with every other apparatus they need for their jobs. Do they ever have an audit? No. Do they ever ring home when they are overseas—ring their husbands, wives, girlfriends or whatever—to say, `I'm okay. How's the family?'
—I hope they do.
—Exactly, Senator Campbell. I am not saying that they should not. I hope they do. That is what public life is all about and that is what other lives should be about, if we really want a decent country. But how do we know any of this? We just have to look at the second reading speech of Senator Faulkner, where he made the point that one of the key motivations for this bill is a Herald Sun poll that shows 54 per cent of people think politicians rort their entitlements. I would have thought that that would have been a higher percentage. Why? Because of some of the people in this parliament. Look at Peter Andren in the House of Representatives. Forgive me, but the platitudes that come out of that man's mouth! He has been here fully five minutes, does not understand the system and then goes yapping on television at every opportunity, just as self-promotion. Has he ever rung home? I wonder if he has ever rung his wife. I wonder if he has ever rung his children. If he has, according to this bill, he is in contravention of the entitlements.
Rather than try to counter the spurious belief—and it is spurious; Senator Faulkner engages in a bit of cheap opportunism—we just have to look at the effects. This creation of a permanent investigator into members' and senators' entitlements is just so intrusive that it is frightening. There are many people who ring a senator's or a member's office who do not want to be recorded in any way, shape or form as having made contact with the senator or member. They quite often ring about very serious matters and they do not ever want someone to be able to FOI a phone bill or FOI that they have been in contact with a member of parliament. But that is exactly what this bill will enable.
The roles that senators and members perform are many and varied. The bill places absolute discretion to investigate any aspect of a member's or a senator's entitlement in the hands of the proposed auditor. They can extract any record they want at any level of detail they want. What happens to that constituent who does not want any identification with a senator or member at all? There are very delicate things. There might be family law issues, and so on. They do not want that disclosed because some clown decides that our phone lists have to be made public.
They do not need a reference. They can jump up and investigate anyone at any time for any reason. They can say, for example, `We note that there has been a local council election in your electorate recently. We want you to certify that every ream and every sheet of paper used in your office—every photocopy done and every copy that has been made on the Risograph or anything else—has been solely for the purpose of parliamentary or electorate business.' Who keeps the record? Who provides the information? According to this legislation, that is an outcome. They could say, `We note a number of calls between your office and your home. We want you to certify that every call you made was solely for the purpose of parliamentary and electorate business.' Can you tell me who is going to keep that record? How are people going to justify ringing home on that basis? 
—Peter Andren would get his sister to do it. She works in his office.
—That is another story, isn't it? A lot of people who take on righteous roles in this matter actually have their families working in their offices. It is a very interesting proposition. But they could then go on to say, `We note that you have called the head office of your party or your union on several occasions. You have also called people who are factionally aligned to you. Are you aware that entitlements are solely for the purpose of parliamentary and electorate business, not party and union business?' But, under this legislation, that is a very valid question that could be asked. They could also say, `We note that you have sent letters to people outside your electorate. Are you aware that that is outside your entitlement?'
Therefore, in the case of senators, when someone writes to us from another state and we respond to that letter, that is outside our entitlement. The mere fact that someone has asked a question of us and we have responded is, according to this bill, outside our entitlement. In the absence of any specific allegation, they could just turn up on the doorstep of your electorate office and say, `Here is a list of telephone calls that you have made from your office in the last six months. We want you to certify that every call from this office has been solely for the purpose of parliamentary and electorate business.' Therefore, you have a situation where your staff are working back late at night and they are not allowed to ring their husbands, wives or children and advise them that they are going to be working late at night because that is not within their parliamentary and electorate business. How preposterous! 
Do senators opposite realise the stupidity inherent in the bill that they are currently proposing? How many members or senators, particularly members in highly marginal seats, would be willing to spend days going through telephone records and justifying each and every telephone call? For those senators who might have forgotten why itemised bills were stopped by Labor back in 1991, it was because they did not want public servants to see who they were calling. Now we have seen an absolute backflip.
I have been in this place for 16 years, and I can tell you that I know of very few instances of people rorting the system. But I do know of senators and members on both sides who work very hard, and I do know of senators' and members' families who have to put up with an immense amount of criticism. All this criticism hurts them. They also put up with the absence of their family member to do their job, even when they are supposedly back in their electorate. With this bill we are saying, `Whatever you do, when you walk out your front door, you cannot even contact them. You can't fax them, you can't phone them and you can't do anything, because we will have an auditor on your back.'
The ultimate irony—and I want to get onto this in the last few minutes that I have—is that Labor have put this forward. It is no secret to anyone in Australia. They were in office for 13 years, had the opportunity to do something about it and did nothing. It is not as though they did not know that things were going on and being done by some of their own, and they sought to do absolutely nothing about it. But this government has done something when there has been any evidence—and even when there has not been evidence—of any fraudulent behaviour. The safeguards and accountability are now an integral part of the process of administration of entitlements, and I want to quickly go through some of those.
The government introduced a policy that frequent flyer points should be used only to offset the cost of travel which would otherwise be at the expense of the taxpayer. We do not want people roaming around the world thanks to frequent flyer points, so that has been put in place. There is now six-monthly tabling of travel related costs, including travelling allowance payments, commercial fares, car travel, charters and the cost of self-drive vehicles. There is reconciliation of travelling allowance claims with evidence of travel before meeting the payment, a reduction in the rate of travelling allowance when members and senators stay in non-commercial accommodation, a 60-day rule relating to the submission of travelling allowance claims and a warning mechanism as the deadline approaches for senators and members who have not made their claims. Car travel in Canberra has been clarified so that members and senators may make reasonable use of the access available without risking allegations of misuse. 
Once again, the public would prefer to have senators and members walking everywhere once they get to Canberra. I personally have my own car that I paid for, and I have had it for years and years. That is my choice. But, when people choose not to do that, the media would have them just walk. They say, `We don't care where you live; you should walk to and from work,' whereas people in the private sector can get cabs, they can get limousines, they can get anything and the company picks up the tab. But somehow the media think that it is different for a member of parliament. The journalist concerned can do that, but a member of parliament cannot in the execution of their job.
Senators and members who undertake overseas study travel are now required to submit a report upon their return to Australia detailing their activities overseas. If they fail to do so, they lose their entitlement to further overseas study travel. The cumbersome arrangements for the payment of home telephone accounts have been removed. If I have time, I will speak a little bit more about that later. Family travel has been made more flexible but within the existing financial limits, so it places no increased burden on the taxpayer but recognises the important role of families in the lives of senators and members. If that is a sin, I plead guilty and so does Senator Ellison. The old postage allowance has been modified so that senators and members are not put at risk by the build-up of credits in franking machines in electorate offices. The arrangements for parliamentary secretaries have been changed to establish a satisfactory constitutional basis for the entitlements. Telecard issuances and monitoring have been significantly improved. Senators and members now have to personally sign for their telecard to receive it, and any unusual usage of the card is reported to the senator or member. Telecard costs have now been included as a separate line item on the monthly management reports.
All of these changes have been instituted by the coalition government. Labor had 13 years to act, and they did not. Senator Ellison should be congratulated on the work that he has done to ensure that these measures were put in place. They represent major improvements in accountability and in the administration of entitlements. If any problems are identified, they are fixed. 
I would like some answers from the opposition and from Senator Murray as to why this legislation should be supported when it will put an immense burden on staff. In many instances, we do not have enough staff now to do the job that is required of us. So we simply lump on them an accountability system that applies to every sheet of paper, every telephone call and every fax—everything that moves. I think that is totally and utterly unreasonable and unworkable. Nothing like it occurs in the private sector and nothing like it should be considered here. The government has corrected any misuse of entitlements as it has occurred, and it seeks to do so on an ongoing basis. Let us not forget that an audit by KPMG found that less than two per cent of senators and members—not 98 per cent—had transgressed in any way.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR OF PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES AND ENTITLEMENTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-09,"—We are debating Labor's private member's bill, the Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements Bill 2000. I will answer one of Senator Knowles's many questions. As the debate progressed, she mentioned my name in conjunction with that of Senator Ray. This is a Labor bill, and I will come to its flaws later. We have our own bills and our own views—which differ somewhat from those which Labor has put before us. Having identified the bill's authors, we will move through the general to the specific.
Before I initiate a general discussion, I must note that accountability measures come to the parliament in surges. It does not matter what those issues are; there are different types. For instance, the coalition's own charter of budget honesty was a reaction to a demand for a type of accountability. These things happen on that basis. There are four private members' bills currently before both houses of parliament that are reactions to a perceived problem and an actual problem. Those four bills are: the Government Advertising (Objectivity, Fairness and Accountability) Bill 2000, the Leader of the Opposition's bill, which is in the House of Representatives; my two bills, the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000 and the Electoral Amendment (Political Honesty) Bill 2000; and Labor's bill, which is the subject of today's debate. At the two previous Selection of Bills Committee meetings I have asked Labor to agree to combine all four of those bills as one reference to a legislation committee because I think these matters need to be reviewed and assessed as a group to gauge their overall strengths and weaknesses. I think this government, and the parliament as a whole, must deal with this issue on a legislated basis. I believe the government will come to that view—the community, media and political pressure is such that they must do so.  
When I heard Senator Knowles's analysis of, and reaction to, the bill before us, I noted that it was not important who did what when or what was done—let those who have done things take the credit that is due to them. What is important is what needs to be done. That is what this bill is about. Before we embark upon criticisms of the detail, we need to decide whether we accept certain principles. When I enunciate principles such as these, I find that parliamentarians seldom disagree. For instance, when I say to parliamentarians that we, in the exercise of our duties and through our offices—both in the Senate and at home in our electorates—are the recipients of public money and therefore should be accountable for it, I have never heard anyone not say, `Well, of course we should; that's obvious.' If I then go on to say that that accountability should include transparency and an auditing process—like any other field of government expenditure—they will generally answer, `Well, of course it should.' The question then is: what practical measures are appropriate in the exercise of accountability, transparency and auditing? That is really where the focus lies. 
However, I think we must first accept the principle and whether that principle is established properly in the way in which our salaries, allowances and electorate expenses are dealt with. My view and that of my party is that for a long time—for decades, not just years—it has not been. In terms of general remarks, we must also recognise that the climate has changed—not just in this arena, but in every field of human endeavour. About a year ago, the Institute of Company Directors produced a graph showing the amount of legislation that this parliament has produced over the last 100 years. It revealed—do not hold me to the details; this is a rough description—that in the last 10 years we produced more legislation than in the previous 90 years.
The reason for my raising that point in this debate is that I perceive that people no longer trust individuals, institutions or organisations to do the right thing. There has been a diminution of trust and an increase in cynicism in our society—and, consequently, the demand that there is legislation and regulation for everything we do. We must recognise that that applies to us as parliamentarians as well. The level of trust generally in society is lower. Of course, it is fanned and flamed by media reporting, which emphasises, if you like, the darker side of our national soul. Even though I accept the point made by both Senators Ray and Knowles that the level of honesty in our parliament is no better or worse than that in the community—and those are my words, not theirs; that is my interpretation of what they are saying—even though I accept that, the fact is that the perception which is within voters of there needing to be far more transparency, better reporting and more openness has to be dealt with.
—By the media.
—No matter how it is created, we will have to react to it. That is my point, Senator Knowles: if we accept the principles which I enunciated earlier, we have to then say to ourselves, `Well, what is the mechanism by which those principles will be met and by which this voter perception will be reacted to?' 
The other point I want to make is that this is not a federal parliament issue; this is a national issue. We have nine parliaments in this country; we have over 850 parliamentarians. How entitlements are dealt with is an issue for every parliamentarian in this country in every parliament, and we cannot deal with this in isolation. It is similar, if you like, to the Auditor-General situation. You do not just have one Auditor-General in this country; you have one for every state as well as the federal parliament. The reason for that is that you require the same principles of identification, of audit, of transparency, of reporting to be carried out in every parliament. In parliamentary terms, those are universal truths, they are universal requirements—and they need to be exercised as such. So, for those parties that are truly national and are represented in any parliament in this country, whatever decisions you make in terms of your accountability mechanisms have to be replicated. If Labor wants to go this route federally, it should be arguing that it should be going this route in every other parliament in this country.
There is also the question of probity and honesty. I made the point that we reflect community attitudes. We are as a group of people, I do not think, any better or worse than the people we serve. It is a fact that, in statistical terms, a percentage of the community does the wrong thing and sometimes does the criminal thing—and we would expect that to be reflected in the parliaments of this country. We know it to be so. There are parliamentarians who are subject to criminal convictions and fines, or who have even been jailed—former parliamentarians.
To go back to your percentages, Senator Knowles, if out of the 224 federal parliamentarians one per cent are crooked, that means there are two people that we have to find out and sort out. Frankly, I would not be surprised if there were two people of that sort, and neither should we be. But we have to guard against it through appropriate auditing mechanisms. If you take that same very low percentage nationally, you are talking of maybe nine parliamentarians. Our laws are designed for the wrong minority, not for the right majority. We have laws that deal with how people behave in society and what they can or cannot do, because of a minority. There are not many people who resort to murder, but we still need laws for murder. That percentage argument has to be put into that perspective.
Let me turn now to the bill before us. I think some of the criticisms expressed by Senator Knowles have bite. For us Democrats, the most important criticism probably relates to the fact that the roles or the intended roles of Labor's auditor—and I agree with Senator Ray that the title is wrong—are confused. The Democrats are of the opinion that the Auditor-General is the most experienced, capable, best resourced auditor that we have; and that, if his or her powers or abilities are limited with respect to parliamentarians, they should simply be enlarged so that he or she can exercise that duty.
We have argued in my bill, the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000, for a commissioner for ministerial and parliamentary ethics. The timing of the laying down of my bills in this parliament was particularly acute, because it was within a couple of days of what is now known as the `Reith affair', the telecard issue. But its genesis was in some cases decades before—and, certainly in my case, years before. I should remind senators that the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000 has four parts: to prevent the misuse of government advertising for party political purposes; to require truth in political advertising; to establish a comprehensive code of conduct for ministers and other members of parliament; and to ensure that public appointments are made on the basis of merit.
Part of that bill, such as the bit about truth in political advertising, relates to campaigns which we have been running since the early eighties and which were reflected in South Australian legislation and now exist. All the other elements of the bill have come about as a result of my and our frustration with putting up propositions as amendments to bills or presenting ideas which have been rejected by the Senate. So we have accumulated them and put them in as a block and here they are as a legislative footprint before you. We recommended the Commissioner for Ministerial and Parliamentary Ethics as recently as 1996, and it was repeated in 1998 in the federal campaign. Our approach is entirely different from Labor's. Our bill would establish a Commissioner for Ministerial and Parliamentary Ethics appointed by the Presiding Officers in accordance with what are known as the Nolan appointments on merit formula. Nolan was the person in England who headed the 1995 Nolan commission and managed to get the government to accept an appointments on merit approach there. 
The Presiding Officers would be required to consult with the leaders of all parties prior to making the appointment. The commissioner may be removed by the Presiding Officers prior to the expiry of his or her term for misbehaviour or incapacity following an address by the Presiding Officers to their respective houses. So it is a parliamentary body. The commissioner would have the following functions in relation to the code of conduct: to review the codes of conduct for ministers and members of parliament at least once every two years, to implement an education program, to give advice on ethical standards, to recommend guidelines to both houses of parliament on interpretation, to investigate complaints of breaches of the code and to do such other functions in relation to parliamentary ethics and standards as may be determined by resolution. What we are seeking is somebody who would take advice on setting standards, who would administer those standards, who would give advice to people who demanded it, who would investigate breaches and who would make recommendations. The attempt in that bill is to avoid the conflict of interest which is absolutely apparent in the way in which the Prime Minister has to deal with breaches within his own cabinet and his own party and to reduce the conflict of interest which is apparent in this parliament. We would see the Auditor-General as fulfilling the auditing role. That contrasts very markedly with Labor's approach.
We do, however, welcome Labor's approach from this point of view: it seems to us that they have accepted the principles I outlined earlier and they have recognised that they need to do something to lift the legislative standard in this transparency area. To assist them will be the review which the Senate last week requested the Auditor-General to undertake at our request and with Labor's support but, unfortunately, with the coalition's opposition. The Auditor-General first needs to identify where rules and guidelines on expenditures and entitlements are unclear or imprecise, whether the administration of such allowances, entitlements and expenditures is adequate, whether the bureaucracy have sufficient resources and means to do the job required of them, which line items should in future require regular audit, which line items should be publicly reported singularly or in the aggregate, which line items should be benchmarked to determine unusual or excessive expenditure, and which line items should be subject to comparative assessment between parliamentarians. We think the Auditor-General should determine which expenditures and entitlements are potentially at risk of abuse and should be tightened. In other words, in that package of consideration, Senator Knowles, are some of the answers to your questions. The practical issues as to how transparency and reporting can be undertaken without affecting detrimentally the way in which parliamentarians must do their job can be carried out by the Auditor-General. I would think the Auditor-General's report, if he undertakes that request from the Senate, would be absolutely seminal to the proper introduction of an accountability device such as either we recommend or Labor are recommending. I think that is a key step to be taken, and I am personally delighted that we were able to get approval of the Senate for that request to be put to the Auditor-General.
In my closing remarks, I want to go back to the fundamental issue—that is, there will never be a parliamentarian's office, whether in the electorate or in the parliament itself, which does not allow people to use phones to phone home, to see how mum is, to see how the kids are or to order taxis. There will never be a parliamentarian's office which will stop people taking home rubbers, pencils and pads. What we are discussing in these issues is the wholesale rorting and abuse of entitlements or electorate expenditures by people who do not abide by the norm. We all know that that potential exists. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that, if the government do not accept this proposal of Labor's, they come up with something of their own which meets the very great demand there is for much better transparency and honesty by politicians in the exercise of their duties. ",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR OF PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES AND ENTITLEMENTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-11-09,"—The purpose of the Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements Bill 2000 that Labor has brought before the Senate is to create an office of Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements. This initiative was originally proposed by the ALP three years ago and was incorporated into the 1998 ALP platform. Lamentably, Mr Howard chose to disregard Labor's proposals, something I am sure he now regrets, considering the series of unethical and inappropriate actions of which many in his party have been found culpable. So now we have before us today a Labor initiated bill which seeks to clean up the mess created by the coalition and restore public confidence in the political system. This bill will establish the office of Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements. The principal functions that the Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements will be engaged in include investigating complaints against members of parliament who misuse their entitlements and providing politicians with independent advice on ethical matters.
Specifically, the auditor will have the power to undertake inquiries on his or her own initiative and then to report to both the House of Representatives and the Senate on any matter relevant to this act. The auditor will also be able to make recommendations to either chamber and to the minister of the day about changes to the system of parliamentary entitlements and allowances. Importantly, the auditor will also have the powers in relation to parliamentarian staff who are classified under the MOPS Act. These powers relate specifically to requests for information to be provided to the auditor or to produce requested documents or give evidence as the particular circumstances require. 
In short, the office of Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements will act in a similar manner to that of an ombudsman or Auditor-General in that they will have certain codified powers and the ability to provide independent advice. For example, the auditor will be able to investigate matters brought to their attention by either a minister or the parliament. The auditor will be able to initiate sample audits on how the members of parliament use their entitlements. The auditor will also have powers to make recommendations for modifications to the system of entitlements. Furthermore, the appointed auditor will be positioned so that they can give advice to members and senators about ethical matters related to the use of their entitlements. 
This latter function is very significant because, for the first time, members of parliament will be able to seek genuine independent and impartial advice about ethical issues that may arise. Of course we would not need an auditor with those powers if the coalition's own guidelines and ministerial protocols had been structured transparently and then followed to the letter in the first place. If Mr Howard had actually enforced his code of conduct, if Mr Howard had acted swiftly to deal with breaches of entitlements and unethical behaviour or if Mr Howard had adopted Labor's proposals three years ago, then we might not be here today debating this bill. But because the coalition has not done the right thing, we are currently experiencing a very general and negative perception of politicians. Therefore, this bill will hopefully usher in a period during which the reputation and standing of all federally elected representatives will be enhanced.
Transparency and openness are two key motivators in ensuring that all members and senators comply with the rules and regulations laid out. Ensuring that the details about entitlements are made public and open to analysis by the legislature will ensure that members of parliament are well and truly accountable for how they use taxpayers' money. Considering the litany of betrayal of public trust that has characterised the Howard government, this bill should be welcomed by every single member of this parliament. The truth is: this bill has been far too long in coming—too long in the eyes of many Australians who are fed up with politics seemingly being dominated not by policy and ideological debates about social policy and economic policy but by rorts and misuse of entitlements. There is no doubt that the tabloids lap up the rort stories far more enthusiastically than they do the serious debates about social welfare, for example. 
We know that many other major Western democracies already have in place offices or commissioners overseeing ethical standards of members of parliament. So, in this respect, Australia has been lagging behind in creating such an office along similar lines to the British Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The behaviour of Minister Peter Reith, in particular, was one of contempt for the ethical standards required by the national parliament and its representatives. Perhaps if the Howard government had adopted Labor's proposals, as I said before, three years ago, then Mr Reith could have sought independent advice and paid back the $50,000—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. On three occasions the senator has reflected on members of the Liberal Party as a class, members of Mr Howard's party as a class and now Mr Reith as an individual. It is entirely out of order certainly to do the latter, and I would put it to you that it is out of order to do the two former.
 (Senator Bartlett)—Perhaps in accordance with a ruling made a week or so ago, under standing order 193(3), it might be wise not to use offensive imputations against members of either house, if possible.
—Mr Reith's actions and those of some of his colleagues have done little to enhance the reputation of elected members.
—I would request that the senator opposite withdraw her imputation against members of the Liberal Party, particularly Mr Reith.
—Perhaps withdrawing imputations against Mr Reith would be helpful, Senator Lundy.
—Are you instructing me to withdraw?
—I am asking you to withdraw, yes.
—I withdraw. 
—I thank you for the ruling and I thank Senator Lundy for the decency of withdrawing her unparliamentary remarks. But I also put it to you that applying the words `breaches' of ethics and `unethical behaviour' to members of Mr Howard's party is equally an imputation against members and senators.
—My advice and my reading of the standing order is that it relates to members of houses of parliament, not members of a party. I realise this might be a thin dividing line, but it seems to come on the other side of it.
—So what you are saying is that it is entirely parliamentary for me to reflect on the gross unethical behaviour of members of the Australian Labor Party, and I so do. Is that within standing orders?
—It is not within standing orders to do so via a point of order, but it would be if you were doing so in debate, as I am advised, yes.
—Thank you for your advisory opinion.
—It is, however, an unfortunate reality that many voters do not differentiate between the political parties when they are surveyed about the honesty and integrity of politicians and the individual politicians themselves. It is extremely frustrating to read that the unethical and inappropriate actions of a few people can reflect on us all, but that is the case until we collectively act to rebuild the public's trust. As shadow minister for youth affairs, I am constantly talking with young Australians. And one of the main barriers they see with respect to engaging in political activism and participation in public debate is that many of them are deeply cynical, apathetic and plain disgusted with some of the behaviour they see within the political forums of this country.  
Part of this cynicism comes from the way in which young people are stereotyped and categorised in particular ways that negate any positives that they have and that highlight the controversial. Part of it also derives from the scepticism they have about their political representatives and the way they perceive their conduct. There have been a number of polls specifically targeting the youth sector, and these polls reveal that an exceptionally small percentage of young Australians trust the messages that politicians disseminate. In one poll only two per cent of Australians aged from 15 to 24 said that they trusted politicians to inform them about politics. The majority of young Australians in this poll trusted their family, teachers and the media more than they trusted politicians. A Morgan poll from last year found that, when asked to rate professions in terms of honesty and ethical standards, federal and state members of parliament were viewed positively by only 13 per cent of respondents.
Survey results like this are deeply troubling and indicate just how much ground needs to be made up in order to garner the trust of not just younger people in Australia but the whole population. Let me remind the Senate that young people in the 15- to 24-year age grouping make up 15 per cent of the population, yet they are under-represented in structural and political decision making roles in Australian politics. Not only are they under-represented, but they are often bombarded with negative messages about the political system.
This was brought to the fore during last year's republic referendum. A situation that certainly sticks in my mind is the quite absurd experience we had when a coalition minister, Mr Abbott, was going around telling young Australians that politicians could not be trusted, particularly with respect to appointing an independent Governor-General. This message, which was repeated loud and wide by Mr Abbott in his campaign for the monarchist side of the republic debate, did us so much damage in the way young people perceive politicians and the role we have in this and other parliaments in the country. The Abbbot approach—obviously endorsed by the Prime Minister, who also took a monarchist view in that debate—exposed how low the leadership of this country was prepared to sink to divide and foster distrust in the community. For what purpose? It was nothing more than short-term political gain, and in this example it was with respect to the republic referendum.
Public trust and public confidence are absolutely essential if young people are to engage with our political system. We must act in a positive and progressive manner to ensure that the highest standards of accountability and trust are set. We stand here and we continually ask young people to take on leadership roles. We encourage them to stand up in front of their peers and demand their respect and lead by example. And, yet, we have a situation in the federal parliament where our leaders do not lead by example; they lead by trying to foster division and they lead by trying to denigrate the political institution that was designed 100 years ago—we will be celebrating the Centenary of Federation next year—to guide this country through all circumstances. Unless we do this, the next generation of voters will continue to be turned off by the negative connotations and images that so often of late have dominated the political landscape.
In many respects, politicians are in the same boat as members of other services, like the police force and the armed services. They are suffering in terms of lack of recruitment, and part of this can be attributed to recent media attention focused on unethical and inappropriate behaviours that are reflected negatively across the entire spectrum of these professions. If young people perceive that a profession is beset with unethical practices and tabloid scandals, they will not engage. They do not want to be a part of it, and they will turn their backs and find a profession that they can feel proud to be a part of.
The sporting world is going through a similar crisis of trust with the honesty and integrity of sporting representatives being called into question. It is interesting to study the parallels between the cricket scandal and the scandals that have characterised the Howard government since 1996. Given that cricket is the Prime Minister's obsession, he of all people should be ensuring his party supports this bill. By failing to deal with the unethical behaviour of cricketers, the cricket world has been rocked by scandals, allegations and mistrust. If the powers that control national and international cricket had adopted a code of practice that was independent, transparent and enforceable, then I have no doubt that the current crisis in cricket would not be occurring. However, they adopted the Howard government approach—that is, to do nothing and hope it will all go away but pay a lot of lip-service along the way. 
Trust is something that has to be earned. Words have come so cheaply and never so cheaply as those uttered by the Prime Minister in reference to the coalition's code of conduct. But it is actions that the citizens of Australia will judge this parliament by. And it is in taking action that Labor brings this bill before the house. This bill is about re-establishing that trust through transparent and open measures that will enhance the standing of the federal parliament and ensure that all members and senators have access to independent and authoritative advice.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR OF PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES AND ENTITLEMENTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-11-09,"—Like so many of the policy criticisms that come from those opposite, they are always characterised by a curious failure to acknowledge that they had an opportunity to change or improve this particular policy administration over 13 long years in government. It is a little like the outsourcing or the cuts to the ABC which Labor, we know, would most likely have done in government in time. We need to question what was done in government by the previous administration: this time it is in relation to the administration of entitlements.
Sadly, many Australians have a somewhat negative view of politicians and their entitlements. I am sure I am not the only one who is often confronted by members of the community questioning me about my use of entitlements, and of course I am always very happy to answer. To preserve our democraticprocess, it is important that this negative view of politicians is dispelled as quickly as possible, because it only gives vituperative people in this place the chance to engage in acts of cheap populism. Having read Senator Faulkner's speech on the second reading to the Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements Bill 2000, I was struck by the examples that he used to justify having this legislation. There were allegations about Dr Colston, Dr Woods, former Minister Sharp and Minister Peter McGauran—all a product of a different time and a different style when it comes to the administration of parliamentary entitlements.
Perhaps at this point it is worth noting that Senator Lundy said that independent and impartial advice is already available to politicians. She said that you just have to ring up the branch managers of Ministerial and Parliamentary Services. Those people are in fact public servants. They are not politicians and they are the ones who administer the entitlements. They give advice if they are asked. While we know that Senator Faulkner's bill is more about playing to the 54 per cent of people he quotes as believing politicians are rorters, it is obvious that he is not serious about such reforms. Pollie bashing may have become a popular and fashionable sport but, by and large, the members and senators in this parliament use their entitlements correctly. While mistakes have unfortunately been made in the past, they are thankfully only a tiny minority. In fact, in 1997 an independent audit of travel allowance claims conducted by KPMG found that the error rate of politicians in the use of entitlements was just two per cent. To put that in perspective, the Auditor-General usually does not investigate discrepancies of less than five per cent.
This government has continued the basic allowances and entitlements of the previous Labor government. Telecards, fuel cards, leased vehicles and mobile phones are entitlements supported and, in many cases, introduced by Labor. However, there is one very crucial difference between our approach and that of the previous Labor government, and that is in the area of accountability—perhaps the most important area of all. We have reforms to the entire system of entitlements, reforms that Senator Faulkner's government curiously failed to even contemplate.  
Let us have a look at telecards, for instance. We have now made telecard costs a separate line item in monthly management reports. Members and senators now have to personally sign for a telecard, and they are immediately notified should any unusual use of the card be noted. There are other things we have done other things to strengthen accountability in this area. We have introduced a policy that ensures frequent flyer points given by airlines can only be used to offset the cost of travel. The rate of travel allowance when staying in non-commercial accommodation has been reduced, and claims are now only paid once evidence of travel has been provided. Senators and members who take up overseas study allowance travel now have to submit a report when they return to Australia. Importantly, we now table six-monthly travel related costs, including travel allowance payments, domestic and international travel, the cost of self-drive vehicles and the use of charters. Senator Faulkner, why didn't you and your government introduce this probity? What did you do and what did your government do to make the administration of entitlements more accountable when you were in government?
I turn now to Senator Faulkner's bill, which is, in my view, highly intrusive and probably quite unworkable—I have a sneaking suspicion that Senator Faulkner knows this as well. For example, the bill establishes an officer of Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements, with the auditor being granted a 10-year term. I could find no information in Senator Faulkner's second reading speech as to why the auditor would be given a 10-year term when the standard term for Public Service appointments is five years. What about the obvious conflict of interest contained in the bill, whereby the auditor is paid by the Remuneration Tribunal and yet the auditor might have to make critical comments on the tribunal's determinations? Then, interestingly enough, there is the proposed role of the auditor. According to the bill, he or she will be not only the adviser for members and senators on using their entitlements but also the investigative body for those same entitlements and the agency that recommends change. Surely, it is a little odd that the centrepiece of this legislation—that is, the auditor—has absolutely no clear role to fill. If anything, the confusion the auditor would create as it tries to fulfil those three dimensions of its role would create more difficulty and could lead to more breaches of entitlements.
Senator Murray said words to the effect: `Murder laws are to catch murderers, not innocent people.' I agree, but the problem with this bill is that the potential powers of the auditor are so great that they represent a threat to the privacy of the vast majority of honest members and senators. I notice also that, in section 29(6) of the bill, any offence, even the most trivial, could immediately become a matter which has to be referred to the Australian Federal Police. Surely, this bill is merely a crude populist gesture that does a great disservice to all the honest and honourable members and senators in this place.
Remarkably, it is quite difficult to find out what Senator Faulkner himself has done since he was elected, even when he was in government in the previous administration, to reform any branch of parliamentarians' entitlements and the administration of them. Worse still, he refuses to acknowledge that the efforts of this government have made the whole process more transparent and more accountable. There is now public scrutiny, through each of the chambers of this parliament, of every single member. I am sure I speak for many colleagues in this place when I say that on the day the entitlements and costs are tabled you can pretty well expect to get two or three calls from the media asking why you were in this place or that, why you flew to this place or that and why the costs for this item or that were what they were. There is no doubt in my mind that the opportunity to scrutinise some of the costs incurred by politicians in one way or another is in fact looked forward to by members of the press gallery and invariably finds its way onto the front pages of the newspapers in the state where the politicians come from. I can remember several opportunities when those lists were published in my home state of South Australia. 
But all Senator Faulkner now offers us is a confused, poorly thought-out piece of legislation which aims to score a few cheap political points and reinforce negative attitudes to politicians in the wider community. Surely this is the last thing that members, senators and the wider community need in this place or in any other place. It does nothing to enhance the positive view that some people in the community do have of their politicians; that is, that they are honest, hardworking and try their best to help the community and bring in good policy. I urge this chamber to reconsider Senator Faulkner's bill.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR OF PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES AND ENTITLEMENTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-11-09,"—I rise to support the Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements Bill 2000, but I think there has been a little bit of misunderstanding on the part of some people as to the real intention of the bill. Let me say at the outset that I think this bill, if it has achieved nothing else this afternoon, has achieved one thing: it has caused a debate to take place on the issue of accountability and transparency in the use of the parliamentary entitlements and allowances that are given to senators and members. I think that that in itself is a very healthy thing. The unfortunate part—and I think Senator Knowles alluded to it—is the fact that the same sort of scrutiny does not apply to those in the field of journalism and the like. But I will come to that later on. Two things need to be said at the outset. Firstly, there is a determination process and, secondly, there is an accountability process for the entitlements and allowances. With those processes comes the transparency of the allowances that are paid to people in this place.
I have a little bit of experience, going back over a fair time, with the issue of accountability and transparency; it is not something new to me at all. In my former life as a full-time trade union official I found myself having to be accountable and transparent in all that I did. If I had not done so in that role, I would have found myself no longer in office, and the organisation and the people I represented would have fallen by the wayside. I believe that I have imported the accountability and transparency ethos that I have developed over a long period of time—not only in my former work life but in my personal life—into this lifestyle. I believe that not to be accountable, not to be transparent, is a recipe for disaster. It is not just a recipe for cynicism amongst and criticism by those out there in the general community but a real recipe for disaster, because those people lose faith and trust in the people in whom they have placed that faith and that trust. Once we have caused a breakdown in trust, faith and goodwill among those people whom we represent, we cause a breakdown of the system in general.
This bill is about the fact that some politicians—regardless of their political persuasion—have, over time, acted badly. And, to answer one of Senator Ferris's claims, in many instances this parliament has moved only in response to abuses that have been exposed rather than being proactive and preventing those abuses taking place in the first instance. Nonetheless, it should be said that those people who have acted badly over time have deliberately put their own personal greed and disposition before those whom they represent. The bill is about putting in place an Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements to restore public trust and confidence in politicians and in the political system. Much was made of the 54 per cent that Senator Faulkner mentioned in his second reading speech. But I think it would be fair to say, and I think this would be acknowledged by most, that if you get out on the hustings you will find that many people—ordinary people, average people—are cynical about the entitlements, the pay and the allowances given to politicians. Many of them believe, rightly or wrongly, that we lead a life of absolute luxury, that we are fairly constrained in the amount of time that we spend at work and that most of our life is spent in some sort of social ether, which I have yet to find. That misconception is fuelled by media perceptions—quite wrongly and quite poorly, in my opinion. Nonetheless, a large number of people out there believe that.
The purpose of this bill undoubtedly is not to try to put in place a process for determination of the entitlements and allowances that members and senators receive but a process to audit the various parliamentary allowances and entitlements. The interesting thing is that currently the only scrutiny of these entitlements is, as I understand it, done through Ministerial and Parliamentary Services, which is part of the Department of Finance and Administration. Senator Faulkner's bill goes to the appointment of an independent auditor. It was raised here this afternoon—by Senator Murray, I think—that that scrutiny could well be carried out by the existing Auditor-General. That may be a reasonable point. Senator Ray raised the issue of whether or not the word `auditor' was the correct title. Again, that was something that found favour, as I understand it, with Senator Murray—and that is quite a reasonable debating point. But the fact is that something is needed because of the damage that has taken place over a period of time. Senator Faulkner says in his second reading speech that the purpose of the auditor will be to: 
... investigate complaints relating to the use of entitlements; inquire into any matter referred by the Minister or Parliament—
That is fair. He continued:
undertake sample audits of the use of entitlements by members of parliament; undertake inquiries on his or her own initiative; make recommendations for changes to the entitlements system and provide advice to members of parliament on ethical issues associated with the use of parliamentary entitlements.
Currently, if you are seeking advice on your entitlements you rightfully go to the people who work in Ministerial and Parliamentary Services. I cherish their advice. It is good advice. But in the end they are the people who give you your six-monthly report and your monthly report on the use of your entitlements. It seems to me that it only makes good sense to divorce those roles, to separate the role of advising members of parliament on ethical issues associated with their entitlements from the role of the administration of those entitlements, which rests with Ministerial and Parliamentary Services. The intentions outlined in Senator Faulkner's second reading speech are quite reasonable tenets on which to base the appointment of an auditor of parliamentary allowances and entitlements.
I have had a number of papers from the library—and I must say they have been very helpful to me in looking at the range of issues surrounding this debate—one of which shows that payment to members of parliament in the Westminster system, the system that we embrace, have been made since the 13th century. I would imagine that there has been, over that period of time, claims and counterclaims of corruption, misuse of entitlements, and so on. This is further backed up in a paper from the library, which talks about the British system. It states:
In the 18th and for much of the early 19th century, a seat in the House of Commons could be a lucrative source of wealth in the form of sinecure offices and pensions. Many were prepared to pay large sums for a seat or sought the patronage of the magnates who had seats at their disposal. In so far as Members were paid during the period, Lloyd George described the system in 1911, during the debate on the resolution to pay MPs a regular salary as, ""indirect, surreptitious and corrupt"". Of course, many Members were equally concerned to maintain their independence of such corruption.
So accountability and transparency have been a problem over a long period of time—not just in this parliamentary environment but in parliaments established far longer than ours. The problem, though, in many instances—as has been acknowledged here this afternoon—has been caused by the few. That is the central issue. It has been caused by the few but attributed to the many. Therein lies much of the problem. Everyone is tarred with the same brush—by accusations that beset a few of the people who seek to abuse the privileges they obtain once they become parliamentarians. That is unfortunate indeed. But let us not be under any illusion. There are people who abuse the trust that is placed upon them in other areas of employment as well. So we are not on our lonesome. But we are in a situation where we are under the public purview, we are scrutinised by the media, we are scrutinised by the public at large; and they have a higher expectation, I believe, of the accountability of politicians than of many other people out there in the community.
In looking at the general issue I looked at what happened in other countries. It is interesting to note that in the documentation the Parliamentary Library provided me was a comparison between a number of countries. The countries included the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Belgium, France, Italy, Greece, the EU and Australia—just to name a few of the places that were in the comparative charts. The issues covered were salary, review of salary and allowances, allowances, secretarial research staff, office accommodation, telephone, postal services and stationery, travel, subsistence and constituency expenses. Not every nation that was canvassed in that document had something under each of those headings, but it covered the broad range of entitlements that we as politicians receive. 
Interestingly, the United States has an office of government ethics, which I understand reviews the entitlements and looks at the conduct of the various politicians in the use of those entitlements. Canada has an ethics counsellor, and the United Kingdom has a parliamentary commissioner for standards. There are varying degrees of scrutiny, but from what I can gather—and I think this was confirmed by Senator Ray—we probably have as much scrutiny and close scrutiny as any of those parliaments that I have mentioned throughout the world. Irrespective of that, the cynicism and disbelief still exist out there.
When I came to parliament 4½ years ago I found myself in the position where I had to set up my own internal procedures to enable me to support myself in terms of accountability not only to the public but also to Ministerial and Parliamentary Services, and so on. No-one should be under any misapprehension that I was handed a pro-forma which told me what to do, how to do it, what to avoid and what not to avoid. That was certainly not available to me. Nor did anyone give me any administrative systems which linked in with either the ministerial and parliamentary systems or anything else that could assist me in reaching reasonable accountability standards. I found that over a period time I had to put in place my own administrative procedures.
Of course, each month we receive a monthly management report from Ministerial and Parliamentary Services. I have now got into the habit of not only trying to check this but also trying to make sure that even such a thing as their year-to-date figures are correct. Let me say that I have found a number of discrepancies in their year-to-date figures. When I have queried those figures, what have I found? That I have had some other senator's expenses attributed to mine and the overtime for another senator's staff attributed to my account, and so on. When I have raised these discrepancies with Ministerial and Parliamentary Services they have been corrected. In some instances this has taken some time, but without that close scrutiny I could have easily exceeded some of the entitlements that might have been allowed for use by my office.
I do not think it is advocated that everything be placed under the close scrutiny of the Auditor-General, but it seems to me sensible and reasonable to separate the audit process from the ministerial and parliamentary group. They are the people responsible for administering the various entitlements, and it seems to me that `administering' is what they should do. But this should be on the basis that there is an independent auditor—or call the person by some other name—who will inquire into any complaints about entitlements and look at making their own inquiries and taking their own initiative to audit certain entitlements and allowances paid to senators and members. If one reads this proposal by Senator Faulkner reasonably and sensibly, it is not going to go down to every minutia. Certain things are already very closely and very successfully scrutinised. Our air travel, for example, is very well covered. You now get the ticket number and the flight number, and it is very simple and very easy—
—What is not scrutinised properly?
—There are a range of things, and I am glad you raise that, Senator McGauran. A number of things should be subject to closer scrutiny—like Comcar, for example. I could tell you a story about Comcar charges.
—That is a different question. 
—We can come to that. Unfortunately, Senator Troeth, I am going to run out of time. But those are the sorts of issues that need to be canvassed and subject to an independent auditor. They should not be subject to a review process by the people who administer the process. This is what we lack under the current system.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-09,"—It is very timely that this debate has arisen now, and there is no doubt that some of the questions posed and some of the answers given by members and senators during this debate have been quite instructive. But I would like to make it clear from the outset that the government regard this bill as an insult to every member and senator. The fact is, much as the opposition would like to think otherwise, there is no widespread rorting of entitlements. I think Senator Murray made the point that, if the statistics were applied properly, there would perhaps be two members of federal parliament at any given time who were actually indulging in some rorting. Nevertheless, I would be the first to agree that we would always have to be watchful that we as members of parliament do not abuse the entitlements we are given, courtesy of the taxpayer. But I believe that the present system already provides for that accountability, transparency and openness to be possible.
Senator Murray also remarked that accountability comes to parliament in surges. But at the moment we seem to be refining and refining and refining. Where will this level of scrutiny finish? I believe that the bill reaches a level of scrutiny that simply makes it impossible for any government to function. To institute another office, another officer and another level of bureaucracy to deal with this problem is simply beyond belief. Senator Murray also indicated that there should be principles which apply to parliamentary behaviour or the behaviour of members of parliament in respect of their entitlements. Well, there are principles, and those are the guidelines which have been laid down both by the Department of Finance and Administration and by the Prime Minister in various edicts.
To set in place the level of bureaucracy that the Labor Party would like is simply not dealing with this problem. In any group of 100 people there will, of course, be wrongdoers. We have had instances of this in the past; no doubt we will have instances of it in the future. If people are determined or predisposed to find a way around the system, they will set their minds to do that and they will inevitably do it. I hope that inevitably they would also be found out. But at the moment we have a very good system in place for dealing with this as it arises.
In contrast to what Senator Lundy said, there is transparency and openness in our system. We have a legislative process which can be used. Senator Lundy said that it cannot be used and needs further refinement. It can be used. We have this place, the parliament, where question time and orders for the production of documents are regularly used by the opposition and the Democrats. I cannot say that I have ever noticed that they have been particularly shy about asking for or demanding the production of those documents. There is the Senate estimates process, where individual officials can be called to account for the administration of entitlements. Again, I have never noticed any lack of use of the time available for the opposition to question officials on the way in which those processes work. There is, as a last resort, the Auditor-General, who can investigate the administration of entitlements. The Auditor-General's office operates perfectly well already. As well, if you took this bill at face value, you would assume that the Department of Finance and Administration is unable to look after its own territory. I totally reject the implied slur that this bill also places on the officers of that department. There is already in place a range of mechanisms which the public can count on.
I would also like to comment on Senator Hogg's remarks. He said that the proposed role of the auditor separates the role of advice from administration. The key point of this bill is that the proposed auditor will not only combine advice with administration but also combine the roles of enforcement and investigation. So this bill defeats Senator Hogg's express purpose. As Senator Knowles has already remarked, the auditor, under this proposed role, becomes the rule maker, the policeman, the jury and the Law Reform Commission. That becomes an impossible role for any person to play. 
Senator Lundy, unfortunately, became totally diverted with the public view of politicians. Senator Hogg went on—and, possibly, so did Senator Lundy—to describe this bill as proactive and said that the role of the government until now had been reactive in only reacting to any perceived breach of the law. I would also like to suggest that the way in which this government has moved has been totally open, honest and transparent, which defeated the total lack of interest which the Labor Party displayed when they were in office for 13 years. As I said, there are transgressors in every party. I have no doubt that, during the 1970s and the 1980s, for every 100 politicians there would have been people likely to transgress. In that case, why didn't they during that time move to make rules or guidelines which dealt with the way those people offended? They did not, and they stand indicted because of it.
To introduce a piece of legislation like this is to suspect every member and senator. We do not need to encourage cynicism—as various speakers have remarked, there is plenty of that around already. But that is what we will do if we agree to this legislation to put in place a law enforcer whose sole role is to watch politicians and see that they are not doing anything wrong. Senator Hogg also compared this with the rotten boroughs of Georgian England, which are well known to any middle school student of history. I am sure you would agree, Senator McGauran. Didn't you learn about that in junior school history? But to compare this with the modern system that we have now is totally ludicrous.
Senator Ray mentioned the A Current Affair program of the other night and Mike Munro's comments. If I could speak personally for a moment, it was pointed out to me by several people that, in the promotion of this program, footage was shown of me getting out of a Comcar, I presume at the Senate entrance. To portray this as a rort is indeed going beyond the bounds of possibility. It was made perfectly clear to me when I arrived in parliament that Comcar use was a condition of my employment. I know it sits unhappily with some members of the public that politicians are provided with transport for various roles that they might play, but that is made perfectly clear to everyone. We are totally honest and transparent in the way we go about it. We are given, as Senator Hogg pointed out, an itemised and detailed list or program of when and where we have used a Comcar, which we need to check. The onus is on us to check it and we do check it. That I was somehow, wittingly or unwittingly, indulging in a rort by travelling to my place of employment in transport that is provided for me as a condition of that employment I totally and utterly refute.
Senator Hogg also touched on a very interesting point: when you arrive in parliament, there is no book given to you on day one as to how to be a senator or how to be a member of parliament. You have to think about this for yourself and decide how you are going to play that and what you are going to do. We have already agreed, on the figures available, that 98 out of every 100 members of parliament choose to go by the rule book and look after what they do very well. Frequently, when I have looked down the list of domestic flights that are provided, to my amazement I have found myself travelling both on an Ansett and a Qantas flight at exactly the same time to different places. This obviously needs to be picked up by the member or senator concerned and pointed out to the Department of Finance and Administration. It obviously arises through a mix-up with tickets or some similar occurrence. The department is only too willing to rectify that sort of error and the matter is resolved.
We have had instances in the past where members and senators have, wittingly or unwittingly, not looked at what they are supposed to have done—in some cases, in the more distant past, when those systems were not in place. They are now in place, and those systems have been put in place by this government. Those members and senators who want to check up and who want to run a proper system—and, again, that is 98 out of every 100 members of parliament—can check that what they have done is correct to the best of their knowledge. There will always be room for human error but we have seen room for errors of other sorts in the past and, naturally enough, they should be looked at very closely indeed. 
We see this suggestion for a standing auditor of parliamentary entitlements to be unworkable, intrusive and unwarranted. Several of my colleagues have pointed out the reasons for that already and I will not take the trouble to repeat them. However, I will say that I certainly believe that we can do without this piece of legislation. In his second reading speech, Senator Faulkner used as examples former Senator Colston, former Senator Woods, former member Mr Sharp and so on. They are products of a different time and a different style of administering entitlements. Since then, we have tightened up considerably on how members and senators should run their offices. This bill seeks to fix a problem that no longer exists.
I have no doubt that the Labor Party will seek to portray our opposition to this bill as some sort of cover-up and that we do not want any of our entitlements further explored. The mechanism is there to explore them and for proper scrutiny, and this is what this government is trying to do. It is not a cover-up. We will be opposing this bill for the very clear reasons that have been presented today: it is unwarranted, it is intrusive and it is unworkable.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR OF PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES AND ENTITLEMENTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-09,"—Isn't it amazing that this is the government that puts through legislation that requires people who are on social security to account for their work seeking activities and the like, that puts through legislation that requires small business to complete business activity statements and puts the onus on them to collect tax, to fill in statements to engage accountants and to report on their activities, that puts through legislation that requires companies—just as parliaments have in the past—to publish accounts which have been audited, to comply with the law and to establish that they have complied with the law but, when a bill is put forward by the opposition to establish an auditor for the special purpose of auditing the allowances and entitlements of members of parliament, that is objectionable? Isn't that amazing?
I do not envy any of the coalition senators who have been tasked with the obligation of speaking against this bill—and that is what has occurred. This is a bill that the opposition has put forward, and the government have decided that it would be too embarrassing were this to come to a vote—they would have to stand up and vote against this legislation today—so they will talk the bill out. I will be speaking until the time for this debate to conclude, tonight at six. If I sat down, I am sure that Senator McGauran would ensure that we did not get to the point of voting on the bill, so I do not propose to do that. I am not sure whether Senator McGauran is prepared tonight, but I will be ensuring that some of the issues that ought to be dealt with are now dealt with.
In her contribution, Senator Knowles described this as an absolutely outrageous bill. In the context of what I have just said, I am expecting her to say the same thing every time we put obligations on members of the Australian community, on companies and on businesses and to describe them all as absolutely outrageous. It is absolutely untrue to suggest, as Senator Knowles did, that the ALP are trying to paint all members and senators as crooks. It is quite the contrary. We would like to see an auditor—or inspector general, which was Senator Ray's term—investigating, reporting to the parliament and establishing, on the record, whether the entitlements of members and senators are entirely observed within the limits and bounds of the determinations and allocations they are allowed and whether they are used properly. You can nitpick a bill in the debate on the second reading. Of course, this government is going to try and ensure that we do not actually get to the committee stage where, if there are deficiencies in the bill—and there are many deficiencies in government bills—they can be dealt with. The government is going to try and make sure that we do not do that.
What I think we ought to focus on from Senator Knowles in particular is her complaint about the scrutiny of telephone accounts. She said—and I tried to write it down; I do not think I am misrepresenting her—that many people who ring a senator's office do not want to be identified in any way, shape or form. Doesn't that remind you of the comments that were made by former Senator, now member of the House of Representatives, Bronwyn Bishop when pressure was put on the Labor government in 1991 to ensure that there was no publication in any way, shape or form of phonecard accounts? That is the reason that Senator Bolkus, the then minister, responding to pressure from the then Senator Bronwyn Bishop, said that there should not be publication of telecard accounts. That was the complaint of the coalition, yet Senator Knowles is raising it again. She has clearly forgotten that the point that created the problem that Mr Reith complains about was initiated by the complaints of the coalition and the then Senator Bronwyn Bishop, who had exactly the same complaint. She said, `People don't want to know who is ringing us, and we don't want you to know who we're ringing, so we can't possibly publish anything that could identify that.' It has been raised again. 
We are trying to say not that these should be published widely but that an independent auditor should look at the general activities and the use of entitlements and allowances and ensure that they are within the bounds of those allowances and entitlements. I say again that what Senator Knowles said about 1991 is not correct in the sense that the reason it was done and was not stopped by Labor is that, as she said, Labor did not want the public servants to know who they called. That was the complaint of the coalition. It is strange that it seems to have been revisited by a coalition senator again in this place.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator O'Brien needs to substantiate that, because my belief is that it was Mr Gordon Bilney who instituted this complaint.
 (Senator Chapman)—It is not a point of order. It might be a point of information, Minister, but it is not a point of order.
—It is interesting. That is the way the matter has been clearly reported. Because the coalition will want to talk this bill out, I guess we will even hear from Senator Herron as to why we should not have the bill when we bring this matter back here just so that we do not get to the committee stage. Isn't it interesting, as I said, that the coalition will do anything to stop this bill from proceeding through this place and, I am sure, through the House of Representatives?
I was reminded by the comments of Senator Hogg about his role in his previous occupation as a union official—and that is my previous occupation—of how, as union officials, on a monthly basis we would hold meetings of committees of the executive or councils and present to them details of expenditure: what had been expended, what we were buying and how the members' money was being spent, as required under the rules of the organisation. All of that was published for the members as required in summary form with full accounts available and supplied to the registrar of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It seems to me that there was good reason for the parliament requiring trade unions to do that.
I know the coalition want to be critical of trade unions, but the fact of the matter is that here we are proposing an audit system which will simply require the members and senators to establish that what they have done is appropriate, within entitlement and within the bounds of what is allowed—and they want to oppose it. They say that we should be happy with a system which seems to be the subject of amendment each time there is a crisis. Unfortunately, each time there is a crisis, the government have chosen to point to some deficiency within the administration of a department. We saw the abolition of the Department of Administrative Services with the demise of the then minister Mr Sharp, the then minister Mr Jull and the then minister Mr McGauran, who has subsequently been reinstated. We saw the abolition of the Department of Administrative Services, yet the government were prepared to point the finger at public servants and say it was all their fault that something was wrong with the administration. 
Had the law that is being proposed by the opposition been in place and an auditor been available to give advice on the ethics of actions by particular members and senators, we might not have even got to the position where Mr Sharp, Mr Jull and Mr McGauran had to be sacked. We probably would not, because there would have been a requirement for the entitlements which were wrongly used at the time—and I do not say that about Mr Jull; he was sacked because of the knock-on effect of the abuse of entitlements at that time—to be attended to by the auditor. There would have been an opportunity available to those members of the House of Representatives to check things with the auditor, who, just as an auditor in the commercial world provides advice to businesses about what they are entitled to do in terms of taxation claims, the operation of their accounts and revelations that they need to make to shareholders, could have done similar things with members and senators. Some of the problems which have caused the lack of standing that politicians may be held in by some members of the public could have been avoided.
There is no point in saying that we are in a position where we should resist any move to something new. I may later have the opportunity to touch on what happens overseas, but here we have an opportunity to do something new which would put into place an auditor who would be able to say to the public, `I've audited the activities of members and senators and I've found that they have operated within the law and within the limitations that are applied to them in terms of the use of allowances and entitlements.' If there were a case where that had not happened, the auditor would say, `I have found a problem and I'm dealing with it.' I would personally much rather be in the situation where I am able to say, `I've been audited. I've done the right thing. It's on the public record. Check the public record,' than, as some coalition senators have said here today, have to answer every question of the constituents on the matter.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-09,"—The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report into acts and practices in immigration detention centres has been spoken to a few times—by Senator Cooney, among others. The detail in the report makes interesting reading in terms of a specific case and the aspects of that investigation. Its clear finding is that there were breaches of human rights in that case. This report was tabled earlier this year but the case dated from 1996. It has taken a while to reach this point, and I look forward to the government's response. It is worth noting that the management of detention centres has changed since that time so the finger cannot be pointed at the current management group, ACM, in this case. 
This report is important not just because of the specifics of that case but because of the ongoing and repeated concerns that have been raised about the impact of detention centres on so many people. A large number of those detained in such centres are subsequently found to be refugees, and the Democrats are greatly concerned that genuine refugees are subject to detention for often quite significant periods. That is hardly the way that we should treat people who, in many cases, have already suffered immense trauma and separation from family members and whose future and safety is incredibly uncertain. In effect, jailing them for an indeterminate length of time obviously compounds that suffering enormously. 
I point to some recent commentary and statements by medical practitioners—made, from memory, on the Four Corners program, among others—about the immense psychological damage that can be done to people in detention centres, particularly those who are already traumatised. People who have suffered torture and trauma need specialist and very intensive assistance in order to recover. I know detention centre management does its best to assist people in that situation, but that is often simply not possible. Similarly, it is worth emphasising the fact that numbers of children are currently in detention throughout Australia. These children—members of families who do not have valid migration visas and who are often asylum seekers—are sometimes incarcerated in detention centres for years at a time. We heard terrible reports of the suffering of some of the Kosovars who were sent to detention centres after they refused to return home because they feared for their safety. They were locked up at Port Hedland. 
The Democrats very much congratulate and welcome the recent decision of the immigration minister to free some of those people. But it really should not get to a situation where people have to go through such enormous torment and get such a wave of support from the community. I congratulate those people in the broader community who continued to campaign for the Kosovars and who continued to highlight the traumas that they were going through. I have absolutely no doubt—no doubt at all—that, if the reality of the Kosovars' situation was not continually being kept in the public eye by the media and was not continually being put in the face of the minister and the government, those people would have been deported and would be back now in what would be potentially a significantly unsafe situation. As anyone who has got ongoing reports on the situation in Kosovo would be aware, there is no doubt that it is not a safe place and there are ongoing difficulties there for people—people who now include some of those very people whom we have forced to return.
But all of those instances, including the one in this report, highlight the fundamental flaw in our policy of mandatory detention. That is a policy that is supported by both the ALP and the coalition. It is one that the Democrats oppose. We recognise that there is sometimes the need to detain people who are here without authorisation. But to compulsorily detain every single person, many of whom have been through great trauma, many of whom are genuine refugees; to compulsorily detain children and to put people who have been through torture and trauma in situations where they cannot get adequate assistance—that is not the mark of a humane country. Also, it is something that is not necessary: it is not necessary for our safety, our health or our security as a nation. We really need to re-examine that policy. The Democrats believe that reports like this highlight how crucial it is that we re-examine where we are going in this area and look for a better way.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2000-11-09,"—When I previously spoke on this issue, I inadvertently sought to adjourn the debate by asking for an opportunity to continue my remarks later and thereby cut off Senator Brown from speaking. I have apologised to Senator Brown. But I have thought about this issue and realised that I inadvertently abused the Senate's standing orders. I do apologise for that. I realised that should this practice become common, especially if adopted by more adept senators, we could create real problems, as Senator Conroy might realise. So I do apologise to the Senate for this transgression. 
Turning to the greenhouse gas abatement inquiry, a number of previous speakers have noted that this wide-ranging inquiry into Australia's response to global warming has been very productive. In the course of the inquiry, the committee has collected much valuable information on the perceived danger of uncontrolled warming of the lower atmosphere of the earth due to changes in the composition of the air induced by human activities. However, in drawing conclusions from this information, the committee has been preoccupied by political priorities and ideological bias and has come up with the usual mixture of hackneyed slogans and myopic demands which not only are meaningless and impossible to fulfil but also prevent Australia from making an effective contribution to worldwide efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, and unfortunately, the majority report the committee tabled in the Senate last Tuesday, 7 November is seriously flawed. To demonstrate this point, I shall offer two examples of fundamental flaws. The non-government members' majority report either conveniently overlooked serious issues presented in evidence at the hearings or simply failed to seek evidence to pursue issues which are important. Nevertheless, the committee went on to make recommendations about those issues. 
Firstly, I wish to cite the committee's failure to investigate the issue of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide. The committee was informed quite emphatically that there are a number of naturally occurring gases, including nitrous oxide, methane, tropospheric ozone, free carbon particles and water vapours, and a number of industrial synthetic gases, including chlorofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. Some of these gases, including methane and most, if not all, of the synthetic gases, produce greater greenhouse effects than carbon dioxide. Yet the report showed little sign of deliberation about possible ways and means of dealing with these gases, nor does this matter feature in the 121 recommendations of the report. 
Another issue that is conspicuous by its absence from the inquiry, but not from the list of recommendations, is nuclear energy. Given that nuclear energy is completely greenhouse gas emission free, it should at least be examined in an inquiry into greenhouse gas emission reductions. It was never mentioned in the course of the inquiry. Nevertheless, nuclear energy technology features in recommendation No. 9 of the non-government members' majority report. Out of nowhere came the statement that nuclear technology should be excluded in the clean development mechanism. In other words, we do not know what kind of nuclear technology we are talking about. We just do not want to know. In other words, the committee said, `We do not want to know what the alternatives are. We do not care, as long as it is not nuclear technology.' This conclusion of the committee came from a single reference from a single submission by the Climate Action Network Australia. These are not examples one ought to find in a rational, objective report from an important and wide-ranging fact-finding investigation. I submit to the Senate that this report is seriously flawed. 
However, the greatest discrepancy between evidence related to facts presented to the committee and the recommendations of the non-government members' majority report is on the issue of the government's achievements in the area of greenhouse gas abatement. This is where the report's recommendations are clearly preoccupied and inspired by the opposition's political agenda. The first achievement we should note is that this government has been doing something about global warming. Global warming has been recognised as a major issue in informed political circles as well as scientific circles for more than 20 years. This government has not sat back, like previous governments, to wait for things to happen. It has taken a risk management approach, identified key risks and opportunities and established a credible record of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia and ensure our national interests are protected. 
In the three years since the Kyoto protocol was approved, the government has taken a consistent and comprehensive approach to tackle climate change and meet our international obligations. This approach was outlined in 1997 by the Prime Minister in his statement Safeguarding the future: Australia's response to climate change. The key to this approach is to seek realistic, cost-effective reduction in key sectors where emissions are high or growing strongly while also fairly spreading the burden of action across our economy. We should not single out any sector, whether intentionally or unintentionally, to carry the cost of the nation's response. It needs to be appreciated that the government has the responsibility to do so in a manner that will not harm our international competitiveness and that will protect Australia's interests, Australian jobs and Australian industry—a point which apparently was lost on the non-government members of the committee. To successfully achieve this goal, we require a commitment in support of industry and the community and effort on the part of the states and territories. In other words, we require a cooperative approach, and you cannot achieve a cooperative approach by compulsory legislation, which is what the opposition members of the committee require.
—What about your renewable energy bill? That's compulsory.
—The renewable energy bill will not be passed, Senator Bartlett, if you people insist on letting wood rot on the forest floor to release methane into the air, rather than allow us to clean it up and at least get some energy out of it. That is typical of the response we get from the opposition and particularly the Democrats—that it is more important to see the trees than to see the forest—whereas to face a global challenge such as global warming, it is important that we have an approach for the long term that will not only solve the problem for Australia but also contribute to the world's ability to solve this global problem, particularly the ability of developing countries, who not only have to catch up to our development but also have to catch up in a form that is sustainable and safe for the rest of the world.

The debate that we are having here in this chamber about the funding of schools is one that unfortunately we have had many times before. It is a debate that we actually had for most of the last century. It was a debate that was characterised by division whereby the denomination of the church in which we were christened determined how we approached the discussion about education funding. It was hurtful and irresponsible and was not based on any understanding of the differing needs of children in our communities. It was a debate about religion and class, and it was divisive and destructive. It is to the shame of this government that they have extended the politics of division that we have seen in their dealings with indigenous, health and women's issues—in the whole way that this government have operated. They have extended the politics of division to education.
We need to remember that it was a Labor government which, in the early seventies, tackled the issue of education funding and brought a sense of peace and closure to the whole state aid debate through the bringing down of the Karmel report. Professor Karmel's report set the model for the funding of education with an even-handed approach to each sector, with funding being provided on the basis of need—not religion; not the old school tie—but in a fair and responsible manner that ended the division about education funding. 
Ever since the Howard government's election, there has been a concerted effort by this government to break down the peaceful coexistence between each of the sectors of the education system. The first thing they did, we remember, was to abolish the new schools policy, which regulated the establishment of any new private schools in favour of a policy of funding any non-government school which met minimum state standards. The result was that any new non-government school could be established without analysis of the impact on the schools in the surrounding area. There were no requirements for minimum or maximum enrolments, and we know that the result has been a burgeoning of a large number of very small schools, most of them based on specific beliefs. And it is true that many of those schools are fundamentalist Christian schools. I find it quite ironic that, on one hand, we have the deregulation of the planning for schools in the schooling sector, yet, on the other hand, we have this government embracing—and I think quite rightly—a planning system for the opening of new child-care centres, whereby any new application for a child-care centre has to be assessed for its impact on any child-care centre in the surrounding area. That is a sensible policy: it acknowledges that the opening of a child-care centre will impact on the operations of other child-care centres in the area and will diminish the quality of care available in those pre-existing child-care centres. They can do it for child care, but they cannot do it for schools.
Their next action in the move to cause division within the education sector was to create the enrolment benchmark adjustment scheme, which shifts $1,700 per student from the public to the private school when growth in the private sector occurs. Given the abolition of the new schools policy, growth in the private sector will be at a rate of about five times that of the public sector, resulting in significant movement of funds from the public to the private sector. The third action was the abolition of the education resources index, which responded to the capacity of private schools to raise their own funds. This will allow private schools to raise funds without any impact on the funds that are provided by government. It is very evident that, in the private sector, there is a capacity for private fund raising—widening even further the resource gap between private and public schools.
The result of these three actions and the intent of this bill are clearly to shift enrolments away from the state school system and into the private system. It is a huge shift away from this particularly Australian policy setting whereby publicly funded private schools coexist with the public sector. It is a unique Australian arrangement that is based on the existence of a strong and effective state schooling system and, where parents decide to enrol their children in the private sector, they do so in response to specific religious or cultural needs. It is premised on excellence in the state school sector and the belief that I think all Australians have—the belief that every Australian child, whatever their background or wherever they live, has access to an excellent education.
The shift of funding to the private sector undermines the capacity to deliver the excellence in the state school systems that all Australians believe should be there. I think of the small rural towns in the state of Queensland which have one state school to provide education services to that community. There are no options for families to enrol their child in a private school; there simply is not one in town. With the shift of funds from the state sector to the private sector, these small rural communities will receive relatively fewer education dollars than the large towns or cities. This government, which has all the rhetoric of caring for rural and regional people, is advantaging city people over their country counterparts. I suggest that country people will not be pleased. 
I think too of the role that a state school plays in a suburban setting. These suburban state schools play a significant role in providing a sense of community cohesion through sports days, fetes and tuckshop duty—all the things that happen around a state school which bring us together around our children. I think of my daughter's school—a state school—and the diversity of our school community, and the way that all of these school events bring us all together from our suburbs, building links between families across the small feeder region. The establishment of schools with specific ethnic or religious foci means that the suburban cohesion created by us all knowing each other is undermined. The government's intent to divide us will reach down to the suburbs, where the growth of small fundamentalist schools has been the greatest. It is building distrust through a lack of understanding of our neighbours and can only lead to further division in the suburbs. 
It has been argued that the decrease, in relative terms, of funding to the state sector is in fact a threat to our democratic system. The argument was extremely well made by Professor Alan Reid of the University of South Australia when he said:
The common spaces we call schools should be places characterised by plurality and diversity because it is here that we can teach that a respect for difference is precisely what binds our society together. Such lessons are not possible when our schooling system is organised to separate out rather than to mix young people from a variety of backgrounds. It is within these public spaces that students can serve an apprenticeship in democracy. The knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to function as effective and participating citizens are not things people are born with, they need to be taught systematically. Not the least of these is the capacity to recognise the reality and legitimacy of different perspectives and diverse points of view. That is, the capacity to live beyond the comfort zone of a narrow group is essential to the exercise of democratic life. But it is surely more difficult for this capacity to be developed and practised in schools which are built around the marginalisation or exclusion of particular lifestyles, cultures and points of view. It is ironic that at a time when the government is urging that schools embrace a civics education program called Discovering Democracy, it is pursuing also a policy direction which erodes the essential conditions for participation in civic life.
I need to make it very clear that I am not arguing against funding for the private school sector but against what is fundamentally wrong with the shift of resources from the state school system to the private sector, and that is that it is based on ideology and not on need. That is what this government is hell-bent on doing. As I have said, the last 25 years have been characterised by a respectful recognition of the different but complementary roles of each of the sectors of education services, but this bill, if it is passed in its current form, is an attack on this fair and sensible approach.
I will take a moment to look at the history of school funding over the last decade. In 1983, 3.6 per cent of Australia's GDP was spent on the schooling sector. By 1997-98 that had dropped to 2.7 per cent. This decline in the priority of education means that schools have $45 billion less funding to do what they do best—to teach our children—than they would have had if their share of GDP had stayed at 1983 levels. It is also interesting to note that, in 1996, 57 per cent of Commonwealth funding went to private schools. If this trend continues, by the year 2003 it will rise to 65 per cent of total Commonwealth funding for schools.
I turn now to the bill and what we know about it. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 provides much greater funding increases for private schools, including some of the richest private schools in Australia, than for government schools. It introduces a new funding model which, under the guise of equity, is, as I said earlier, a recipe for increasing inequality in education. It continues the enrolment benchmark adjustment scheme, which takes from government schools the funding to which they are entitled under the Commonwealth per capita funding formula. It is part of a plan to increase the privatisation of the provision of schooling and to increase costs for parents. We know that, on average, 62 of the most well resourced elite private schools will receive increased funding of around $800,000 a year. We know that the Catholic schools will receive increases of around $60,000 a year while government schools will receive increases above indexation of only around $4,000. 
Dr Kemp has claimed that the Commonwealth has the responsibility to fund non-government schools and that the new bill will promote equity and choice in education. This shows no understanding of the largest schooling sector, the state sector, which enrols the vast majority of students from low income families, those of indigenous origin, those from remote and rural areas and those with disabilities.
Turning to the socioeconomic status model, the legislation changes the formula for funding non-government schools from one based on school resources, including fees that are charged, to one based on a statistical estimate of parental incomes. By removing the link to school resources, the new model allows very wealthy schools to increase expenditure to levels even further above those of government schools, while continuing to receive increased funding from the Commonwealth. Dr Kemp has claimed that the new funding model means that:
As a result of this Budget, no working class Australian family ... is going to be deprived of a choice of school ...
Statements like this anger the Australian public. It shows absolutely how out of touch he is with the reality in the schooling sector. It shows that he has no understanding of the education system that he is meant to be managing. It also shows that he has no understanding of the geography or the demographics of Australia. We know that most private schools have said they will not be cutting their fees. Melbourne's Wesley College has said it will cut its $11,000 fee by $200. Let's get real, Dr Kemp. That will hardly open up that school to low income families.
I turn now to the introduction of the enrolment benchmark adjustment. The unstated but very real intent of the EBA is to shift enrolments from the public to the private sector. We have heard that leaked minutes from the coalition's 1991 expenditure review committee record that Dr Kemp had:
... noted that coalition policy was to move children from government schools into private schools.
He has denied that over and over again, but that is the underlying ideology of this bill. Further, Dr Kemp had also said he would report on:
... whether additional expenditure could be offset by reductions in grants to government schools and in untied grants.
And that is what we will get if this bill were to pass unamended. 
The government's strategy is to talk up private schools, to talk up a crisis in government schools and to shift the dollars into the private sector. As enrolments continually shift into the private sector, the EBA will kick in yet again, further diminishing funds to state schools. I am pleased to be able to support the ALP amendments that will make this bill fairer for all children in Australia. Firstly, we will move to abolish the enrolment benchmark adjustment, and thus limit the encouragement of the enrolment drift from the public to the private sector. Secondly, we will reduce the funding increases for the ERI category 1 schools and redirect that funding to special education in both government and non-government schools. This reflects Labor's commitment to fairness and equity in our education system. And, thirdly, Labor will provide increases in federal funding for government schools to match the significant increases for non-government schools. Surely this is only fair for all.
Before I conclude I would like to make some comments about how we compare internationally in terms of education spending. It is true that the level of private spending on education is now above the OECD average. The level of public spending on private schools in Australia is also above the OECD average. The level of public spending on education in Australia is well below the OECD average. Australia has a strong and effective schooling system. It is one which we should be very proud of; it is one which, when we are in government, we will support and grow. We have excellent teachers who should be encouraged and supported whether they work in state or private schools. This bill does nothing to show these teachers that we value them. Our amendments will go some way to retaining the education system that we value. ",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-11-09,"—I also rise to speak about the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000, as have many of my Democrat colleagues. There are a number of things that need to be said about it, particularly in relation to New South Wales. There is an ongoing flow of views from people in New South Wales—various parents and citizens groups, including teachers in the public education system—about the consequences of this bill. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, says that this bill is about delivering choice to parents. What that essentially comes down to is whether that includes choice to parents in need. The question that then needs to be asked is: why Wesley College in Victoria, with an additional $3 million a year, and King's in New South Wales are among the biggest winners under this bill? As one commentator recently said, `You can only consider Wesley as needy from the vantage point of Scotch.'
My home state of New South Wales, probably more than any other state, has had a foretaste of Dr Kemp's obsession with private sector largess at the expense of public schools. New South Wales has so far borne the brunt of the enrolment benchmark adjustment. This formula cuts federal education funding to the states every year that private schools increase their share of enrolments relative to public schools. Dr Kemp keeps saying that this money represents the savings to taxpayers when students leave public schools for private schools. This alleged drift from public to private schools is not what it seems when you consider that the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs does not track whether students are leaving public schools to go to private schools, as Dr Kemp maintains. It does not record whether they are leaving school altogether to go to TAFE, whether they are dropping out of education or even whether they are moving interstate. But, based on 1999 enrolment figures, federal education grants to New South Wales were supposed to be cut by $16.7 million under the EBA. This is despite the fact that New South Wales lost only 42 students last year. How can 42 students justify a cut of $16 million or translate to mean $16 million? The minister generously reduced this amount to $10 million, and an almighty row ensued when the state minister, in response, deducted $5 million from the state allocation to private schools. It is telling that, at a recent public meeting on the new SES funding model, the New South Wales shadow education minister, Patricia Forsythe, distanced herself from Dr Kemp. Ms Forsythe expressed her disagreement with the EBA and expressed concerns about the SES. She emphasised that she wanted to remain focused on state issues and said that Dr Kemp could defend his own policies.
It has just been revealed that Dr Kemp deducted $3.8 million from grants to New South Wales over the now famous toilet blocks provision in guidelines in the states grants legislation. Basically, these guidelines ensure publicity opportunities for coalition MPs at the launches of federally funded public works in schools. If the guidelines are not adhered to, states can have up to 20 per cent of their capital works budget withheld. Dr Kemp has threatened Victoria with the withdrawal of up to $10 million for precisely this. So far the guidelines do not call for a framed photograph of Dr Kemp in every classroom or for coalition MPs to be included in daily prayers at non-government schools. Perhaps those are matters for a future states grants bill. But, entertaining as they may be, these stoushes get in the way of education delivery and they pit public against private schools. Dr Kemp's bill is so outrageously inequitable that I fear we will see far more unproductive haggling over funds.
I think that Dr Kemp ought to understand the new powers under this bill that he is given to withdraw money from the states if they do not reach as yet unknown performance targets in different subject areas. He has flagged his intention for benchmarks and performance targets to be set in information technology, civics education and other areas of the curriculum. The department has also made assurances that there will be no untoward use of that particular power; that there will be no league tables or withdrawals of funds from schools that are performing the worst—of course, those are the ones that need the most help. But if Dr Kemp is prepared to withdraw funds over meagre publicity opportunities in suburban papers, can we trust him on this? Can we trust him to use this power for the good of all? Probably not, particularly as the government stood by silently as the Northern Territory proceeded to axe bilingual education in indigenous languages against the wishes of many communities in that territory. Bob Collins, a former senator reporting on education in the Northern Territory, found that up to half the federal money destined for indigenous education was siphoned off over many years into consolidated revenue and administration. 
The national inquiry into rural and remote education conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission found areas of significant need in rural and remote indigenous communities for early childhood development, particularly community based early childhood training institutions. That inquiry also found that a number of indigenous children living in homeland centres have no access to primary or secondary education, particularly in communities with fewer than 12 children. The report estimates that half of all indigenous secondary aged students in the Northern Territory are in so-called non-graded programs taught at community education centres by primary trained teachers. The report points out that this is at odds with goal 8 of the national policy, which is to ensure that all Aboriginal children have local access to primary and secondary schooling.
Much can be said about the shortcomings and the needs in the provision of education for indigenous students. Many of those shortcomings need to be addressed through more funding and a greater interest in indigenous education by the federal government. The Democrats acknowledge that this new SES model will increase funding to some very needy non-government schools which serve indigenous communities in rural and remote areas. But our amendment, which would take actual parent incomes instead of notional average incomes, will benefit these schools as well.
The new formula disregards the level of fees that are charged by a school and any sources of private income. Instead, it funds schools according to where parents live. It does not even take into account actual parent income to measure need. Instead, parent addresses are matched with ABS data to come up with a profile of the school community. It is important to point out that there is a fundamental flaw in this approach, and that is that census data on average income is unreliable. It is determined from a census question which it is not compulsory to answer, which cannot be checked for accuracy because of tax office confidentiality, and which is unlikely to be answered honestly or at all by any family with undeclared income or for any number of other reasons.
The Democrats have been called a number of things by Dr Kemp during this debate—ignorant, arrogant and veering on being totalitarian—for daring to suggest that the present funding arrangements continue for another year. Our amendments will provide for the usual indexation to apply in 2001, contrary to the claims going around that suggest that funding would somehow be capped at the 2000 level. We want an extension of the current funding arrangements for a year so that there will be time for a proper inquiry into a fairer funding model. We are not opposed to funding non-government schools fairly on the basis of need and in order for all children to be educated with an agreed standard of resources.
A true democracy demands that we educate all of our children to the best of our capacity. A decent education should not be solely for those who can afford to pay high fees. However, Dr Kemp is trying to convince parents that they do not care about their children if they send them to state schools and that they are a burden on the taxpayer if they choose state schools when they cannot afford private schools. One email sent to a Democrat senator repeats this rhetoric, saying:
We chose education over assets, and that was our choice. We are really not happy having pressures put on us to have to bludge on the public system.
The Democrats find this talk of bludging offensive to the 70 per cent of Australian families who chose, for whatever reason, to educate their children in the government system. I also find the bludging argument disingenuous. In the end, the decision to send a child to a private school is a very personal one. Parents do not think to themselves, `I'd better alleviate the burden on the taxpayer and send my kids to a private school.' People who send their children to private schools do so in the belief—whether right or wrong—that they have something to offer that the local government schools do not. This is not a betrayal, because in the end they are maximising their self-interest, as parents ought to. Fair enough. But there are limits to taxpayer support of this choice, especially in a climate where 70 per cent of Australia children are in an under-resourced state system. We believe it is the government's priority to fix this before delivering such windfalls to elite schools. The public system needs active, committed and concerned parents who are prepared to fight for improvements. Without these parents—the very ones Dr Kemp is targeting—we risk moving towards a residualised public system. 
There is an argument that parents should not be penalised for using their after tax income on education. This is an astonishing argument. The federal government is not doing anything of the sort. It is not the responsibility of governments to spend an equal amount on the government and non-government systems. If you make the choice to go a private school, then good luck to you. Dr Kemp and the independent schools lobby have pointed to the fact that some very affluent families earning more than $80,000 are using the public system. I think that is a vote of confidence in the public system itself. I am glad that those families are there. Without them, I would be very worried that the public system was failing to deliver quality education.
The Democrats have no beef with parents sending their children to private schools. In fact, a good many of our members and some of our MPs, including me, have done exactly that. I am perhaps the product of the public and the private school education systems. What we object to is Dr Kemp's ideological commitment to running down the public sector, both verbally and financially. He said in 1996 that if you can find a service in the Yellow Pages you have to ask why the government is providing it in the first place. What we object to just as strongly is the idea that if you send your child to a public school you are a bad parent. I have heard coalition members in the House talk about parents who go private as just wanting to give their kids a chance. What does that say about the public system? That kids have no chance there at all? Roy Martin from the Australian Education Union described the government's rhetorical shift quite nicely. He writes that in the past the concept of need:
... has applied to schools which were operating on resource levels below the norm, or schools that had large numbers of disadvantaged students and needed extra resources. The government is bending the term to apply to parents who are finding it difficult to afford a privileged education for their children. Under their definition, the new `needy' schools are not schools operating below reasonable resource levels, but parents `struggling' to afford the fees in private schools ... in some cases these fees enable the schools to operate at twice or more the level of most other schools.
Several of the schools in NSW operating as categories 2 and 3 match this description. These schools' funding increases will be spared the impact of the ALP amendment scapegoating category 1 schools. These schools generally charge high fees and are already splendidly resourced. For instance, Meriden School, a category 2 school, will receive an increase of $1.2 million by 2004. It charges $10,290 in fees for year 12. Another category 2 school is PLC, which will get an additional $1.4 million a year. PLC has four rebound ace tennis courts, a swimming pool, a music centre, an extension centre for gifted and talented children, and a studio theatre.
It is interesting to contrast the situation of these schools with that of the public schools that have also come to my attention. One teacher from a primary school in the Canterbury-Bankstown area—the same electorate where our Prime Minister grew up and went to a public institution—says they have no hall or covered-in assembly space. He continues:
This school has to lobby local members of parliament to get an upgrade in the toilet block. Crime and vandalism is on the increase at the school and meagre security measures have to be paid for directly from the school's global budget instead of the money being appropriately used for sound pedagogic purposes. 
Another teacher talks about a school where all the classrooms are portables. This is a common occurrence. She says:
You should try working/learning in one of these rooms in the extremes of summer or winter. I have never even taught in a school with its own hall. Currently our Parents & Citizens Association pays a Support Teacher Learning Difficulty wages for 1 day per week.
Jesmond High School in Newcastle does not have a gym, a pool or adequate access to computers. They talk about the walls shaking in a strong breeze and the roofs leaking and say that they do not have enough money for textbooks. These are the comments coming through from teachers.
I am concerned that, as a result of this bill, the department will soon cease collecting financial information from non-government schools on their fees and private income. This information, contained in the annual financial questionnaire, was the basis for funding under the ERI. However, it also served a useful purpose in giving governments a snapshot of how non-government schools were doing. Without that we have no way of knowing what resources these schools are putting into student education and what proportion of schools are really in need. Without this information we probably have little chance of funding schools according to what they really need to deliver a decent education.
This week's letter from 120 Australians calling for the rejection of this bill was unfortunately jeered at by Dr Kemp. I hope that Dr Kemp does not seriously think that the only commentators with any legitimacy are stockbrokers, Liberal members of parliament or those people in stable full-time employment. He was even amused at the fact that some comedians had signed this letter. I would have thought the only qualification for speaking out on schools funding would be a concern about the future of this country.
I think the point that needs to be made about funding for public schools is that public education is a great equaliser—it is a fantastic instrument of social change. More than anything, it demands more funding because it improves the nature of Australian democracy without necessarily creating new classes in our society. This is not to have a shot at private schools—as I said, I am one of those who has benefited from them—but I still believe that a bill of this sort must establish a sense of interrelationship between public and private school sectors and not be divisive on the basis of a rigid ideology of trying to establish a regime of the haves and the have nots.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2000-11-09,"—I seek leave to incorporate my speech.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Anyone that has seen the glow in someone's eye when they understand an idea or concept that has not be available to them before will intrinsically understand the value of teaching. This is often a rare gift for a teacher to be there at that moment of comprehension when the neurones fire in new ways, sometimes completely changing that person forever. To play such a part in someone's development is surely a gift.
Will this bill increase the likelihood of that happening for either student or teacher? I doubt it. In fact I am sure it will not. For those in public education those teachers and students that need it most it will do nothing at all.
In some ways this bill typifies the policies of the Howard government to look after those that do not need it and do nothing for those that do. Hence, Geelong Grammar gets heaps but a school in Gagebrook, Tasmania, gets very little.
As my colleague the member for Braddon Sid Sidebottom revealed in the House the enrolments for the North West Coast in 1996 were as follows: the total enrolled students was 16,923. This breaks down to 13,129 enrolled in government schools, 2,791 in Catholic schools and colleges and 1,003 in non-government schools.
If we break this down further into primary and secondary the figures are 10,209 primary aged students in state schools and 6,714 secondary students in public education.
Thus more than 73 per cent of primary education demand on the North West Coast of Tasmania is met by state education and around 74 per cent of secondary education is catered for by government education. 
This means that most of the money will go to those that cater for under 30 per cent of the needs of parents with school age children and adolescents on the North West Coast of Tasmania.
I must say I find it extremely puzzling that a government with an obsession for rationalism could justify this bill. It is quite simply irrational to excessively fund those that have the most. It does not make sense.
Perhaps the funding to top private schools is an attempt to reduce the power of the Australian Education Union. By giving more money to the top private schools there is the potential to force through changes by changing the power relationship in the sector.
Additionally this form of targeted funding has a whiff of Commonwealth interference in what is essentially a state issue—something the Howard government has ridiculed previous Labor governments for time and time again.
The Australian Education Union stated in their submission to the Senate inquiry into the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000:
""Public education is dedicated to giving all Australians the foundations upon which to build a future for themselves and their families. It strives to ensure that regardless of personal circumstances all Australians receive a fair start in life and have access to continuing education throughout life.
However the capacity to provide high quality education for millions of young Australians is being undermined. It is being replaced with private systems where the capacity to pay and where parental wealth determines the resources available.""
One could be excused for thinking that the Howard government know that knowledge is power and they are engineering the next generation of elites, thus creating a return to a two-tier segmented, divisive society.
As the public education system is ground down by the relentless punishment handed out by the Howard government the reintroduction of the pre-Whitlam era of education will become more and more a reality. This will re-entrench the `which school did you go to' question and dubious clubs and memberships will count more than intellect or creativity in life opportunities.
This was vividly illustrated in the House the other day by the Labor Shadow education minister the member for Dobell Mr Lee when he explained that public schools will lose nearly $30 million to 12 category 1 private schools. Which schools? you ask. I will list them for you:
Trinity Grammar, NSW gets an extra $3.1 Million,
Newington, NSW gets an extra $1.8 Million,
King's School, NSW gets an extra $1.5 Million,
Wesley College, Victoria, $3.9 Million,
Caulfield Grammar, Victoria $3.6 Million,
Haileybury, Victoria, $2.9 Million,
Ivanhoe Grammar Victoria 2.4 Million
Mentone Grammar, Victoria, 1.6 Million
Geelong College, Victoria, $2.3 Million
Geelong Grammar Victoria, $1.7 Million
Scotch College, Victoria, 1 Million
St Peters Collegiate South Australia $1.5 Million
Unless most of these are boarding schools, I doubt they will have to run breakfast to ensure the children are fed as they are in some Tasmanian schools. I doubt their parents are having the phone cut off as they cannot see their child miss out on one more school function, as some of the parents are in Tasmanian schools.
That is not to say that some of the parents sending their children to these schools are not going without, due to the largely manufactured belief that they will receive something that they cannot get in government schools, but any reasonable person would concede that they are in the minority.
Finally, I suggest that the benevolent funds and the fixed term accounts that these category 1 schools have hidden away, deny any need to give them any more public money at the expense of those that have least .",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-11-09,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 determines the federal government's funding commitment to primary and secondary education for the next quadrennium—that is, the period 2000-04—and is worth something like $22 billion, representing a very substantial investment by the community, by the taxpayer, in the education of children for the future. As such, this bill is extremely important. It is our commitment not just to providing knowledge to young people but to securing our future knowledge base. Adequate funding of primary and secondary education is a fundamental factor in determining whether or not Australia becomes `the clever country' and whether or not we are able to hold our own in the global economy we are moving into in the immediate future. 
Universal education has traditionally been an important way of addressing inequality in society. The purpose of universal education has been to give our young people equality of opportunity no matter where they come from or what background they come from. It is a belief that dates back to the Elementary Education Act passed in England in 1880. How we fund education and the access we provide to all children, irrespective of socioeconomic status, is a cornerstone to providing equality of opportunity. The values reflected in the policies and rhetoric surrounding the government's approach to schooling provide an important background against which school education takes place.
A well funded public education system and policies that talk about addressing disadvantage and achieving equality of opportunity are key facets of striving for an egalitarian society. Our children are taught this important principle as well. The values of excellence, equality and fairness in the provision of education create the basis for young people's understanding of their society and nation—that is, that no-one is born better than anyone else, that everyone deserves a fair go. This is the cornerstone of what Australia is all about. The states grants bill undermines these beliefs and tries to provide preferred funding to those of privilege. Minister Kemp is dividing the Australian community on the basis of massive funding increases to the privileged private schools, while public schools remain cash-strapped and underfunded. It is a policy founded on beliefs that existed in England pre-1880 and it is driven by a naked class ambition.
The socioeconomic status, SES, funding model that distributes the next four years of funding between private and public schools is fundamentally flawed. Nearly all the state education departments reported to the Senate inquiry that the SES funding model does not treat socioeconomic disadvantage seriously. It is too simple and cannot accurately measure the complex factors that attribute to disadvantage. Its faults are now well documented. For instance, Dr Tease Warren, in an article in the Australian of 11 October 2000, argued:
The socioeconomic status of catchment areas is not a reliable indicator of educationally relevant characteristics of families using private schools. These schools are often academically selective. They do not enrol random samples of children from each catchment. But under the new scheme their subsidy will rise with every student they can find from a poor area, regardless of whether that student comes from a poor household.
The SES model does not look at private schools' existing wealth or total funding resources and makes funding judgments on notoriously inaccurate census collection districts. 
The point is that this SES measure is deliberately simple. This government does not believe in eliminating disadvantage at the level of primary and secondary schooling. If it did want to seriously address inequality, it would have done away with this regional system. It would have, in consultation with the state government education departments, fixed the well-reported problems with this model. Minister Kemp has had plenty of time to fix the SES funding system. Tests on the model were carried out in 1998. The government knew which schools were going to get which amount of funding. Minister Kemp chooses not to change the model and has tried to hide its results from the Senate inquiry. The result is that the SES model transfers funds that should be going to public schools to the rich, wealthy schools that can get their money from elsewhere. It makes a mockery of the principle of needs based funding.
So Minister Kemp is about dismantling the egalitarian values underpinning our education system and wants to assist his classmates—the rich and the privileged. He wants to divert money from poorer schools and give that money to the rich schools. Let us be frank: the Howard government are lining the pockets of the old boy schools because that is where they were all taught. This is the rich ruling for the rich. Yesterday's article in the Sydney Morning Herald showed that nearly all of the Howard government's cabinet went to old boy private schools. This is private school ministers ruling for their own kind and, ultimately, their children. Let us look at which schools Howard ministers went to and what funding they are going to get as a result. 
—Where did Kim Beazley go?
—If you had read the paper, Senator Abetz, which you obviously did not get enough education to do, you would see he went to Hollywood High, which is a public school. John Anderson, for example, went to King's School, a school that will end up getting $1.5 million. Alexander Downer went to the very poor Geelong Grammar, which will get $1.7 million out of this funding arrangement. Chris Ellison went to Trinity College—
 (Senator Knowles)—Order! Senator Chris Ellison.
—Senator Chris Ellison went to Trinity College. His school gets a massive $3.1 million out of this funding arrangement. Minister Kemp's own school, Scotch College—where he did his schooling with Michael Wooldridge and Senator Rod Kemp—
—Order! Dr Wooldridge.
—Dr Michael Wooldridge and Senator Rod Kemp's school gets $1 million. Other examples of private schools that do well out of this bill are: Newington College, $1.8 million; Wesley College, $3.9 million; Caulfield Grammar, $3.6 million—that will help pay for the gym that was burnt down two or three days ago; they will have no trouble replacing that in a relatively short period of time—and Hailbury College, $2.9 million. Twelve elite private schools are getting an additional $27 million in funding. In some instances this funding increase amounts to $2,000 per student. The King's School in Parramatta is set to receive $1.5 million in funding as a result of these changes. This is a school that has 15 cricket fields, five basketball courts, 13 rugby fields, three soccer pitches, a 50-metre swimming pool and a rifle range. It is also talking about some new buildings. Let us look at the issues of concern that King's School has. For example, it wants to create a learning and leadership centre. It says:
The Learning and Leadership Centre will be the central project in a plan to totally revitalise the Academic Precinct.
...	...	...	
The E and F block will be demolished and students relocated to new classrooms built near the Science building. These classrooms will be air conditioned and fully equipped to enable the delivery of contemporary curriculum relevant for the 21st century. 
The school wants to upgrade the quadrangle classrooms to provide airconditioning and better teaching facilities, and upgrade the central teaching area as well. It wants to refurbish the science laboratory and the staff and administration centre. It says:
It is planned that the existing Library be converted into an Administration and Staff Centre. Current staff facilities are inadequate with far more space being required for teaching staff and a gracious reception centre needed for those visiting the School.
...	...	...	
Currently Futter Hall cannot seat all the students in the Senior School, thus Futter Hall needs to be extended. This initiative will also enable a new front to be put on Futter Hall so that it might be matched architecturally with the other upgraded buildings. 
...	...	...	
A `green heart' is planned for the centre of the academic precinct ...
Contrast that with a lot of the state schools that have got portable classrooms and no airconditioning. I understand that some of the new portable classrooms were taken off state schools in the lead-up to the Olympics—they were given second-hand portables for that period—so that the Olympic athletes, staff or people associated with the Games could be adequately housed.
Contrast that with the very difficult conditions that pupils at King's School will have to suffer while they go through their education. No-one begrudges those kids at King's School getting the advantage of adequate and proper facilities, but this argument is about all kids getting the advantage of and access to proper and adequate facilities and an environment in which they can get a proper education and in which the same grounds and the same basis for that education is provided to every other child in the community. 
I could go on and on, but the point is well and truly made. This is education funding for the rich by the same rich that went to these establishment schools. The taxpayers and Prime Minister Howard's so-called battlers must be angry, and I know they are, because faxes and emails to me with complaints about this bill have not stopped. Literally thousands of emails and faxes have come in from parents, teachers and pupils all around this country, complaining about this bill and asking for it to be defeated. Their hard-earned taxes are being given to a wealthy minority, helping to further establish their privilege. This is a ripping off of the poor to feed the rich—so much for the Australian ethos of a fair go.
This is money that could be better spent on our ailing public school system. But, under this government, funding for public schools will be and is being cut. In 1996, when the government came to power, 43 per cent of federal outlays on schools went to government schools. In 2000, this will fall to 36.4 per cent and, by the end of this funding period, it is forecast to fall again to 34.1 per cent. Under the bill, by 2004 every public school will lose $63,000 per annum. At the same time, the 50 richest schools will get $1 million each.
This trend spells the potential demise of public education and, therefore, universal education. At best, it creates a dual school structure that then further reinforces a dual labour market. In this country, since the mid-eighties we have seen a dual labour market develop. We have heard arguments about the need to increase executive salaries. We have seen executives in major companies lining their pockets with salaries of $2 million or $3 million a year as well as share options and a range of other remuneration packages that have been substantially to their benefit. And the argument for it is that we need to retain these brains, these skills and these people with the training to be able to run our companies operating in the global economy.
At the same time, since the mid-eighties and perpetuated by this government, we have heard the argument in respect of the other end of the labour market, and that is that we have to force down wages and free up the labour market if we are going to be able to compete with our goods and services in the global economy. There are two different arguments for two different groups. Exactly the same fundamental principles that are behind and inherent in this schools bill are what is driving the labour market. We are seeing the same things occur in respect of the school structure as are happening out in the labour market and within our community. We are seeing a substantial divergence in wealth. Those at the top are getting richer and richer while those at the bottom are getting poorer and poorer.
This bill degrades public education to a system of last resort, and those students going through it are not treated the same as those in the exclusive private school system. If you do not get to go to one of these elite schools, because you cannot afford it, you probably will not go to university or get an interesting, well-paid job. I grew up in a school system not dissimilar to the type of system Dr Kemp is trying to introduce here. I got my education in Belfast in the period after the Second World War, in the early fifties. I left school at 13, not because I wanted to go into the labour market and not because I did not want to go on and get an education but because there was no other option. Because I came from a poor working-class area, I was designated to only go through the primary school system. There was no secondary school system in Northern Ireland when I went to school. There was no option for someone like me at that period of time.
I was forced to go out and find employment at the age of 13 simply because my access to further education in that period was cut off. My only access to the system at that time was to pass an exam when I was aged 11. What kid at age 10 or 11 has the maturity to be able to understand the importance to his future of passing his exams at that stage, when that is three or four years down the track and when total access to the system is well down the track?
It was well known in Belfast, where I grew up, that the vast majority of kids in that private school system were actually paid for by their parents and did not go through the 11-plus exercise. It was only the very elite in the primary school system in Northern Ireland at that time who actually got through that system and got to go on to further education. I know how difficult it was for me to struggle—after putting in 12-hour days, at times, at the dockyard in Williamstown—to go home and study at night for three and four hours at a time, well into the early hours of the morning, to try and give myself an education. There is no kid in our community that ought to have to go through that system. Education should be a universal right for every child. 
—It is.
—The totality of education that is available to children in the community should be available to all children, and you know it is not, Senator Abetz. Don't sit there and say that it is, because you know it is not. You know that people from disadvantaged areas cannot put their kids through the education that is available to the children of people who do not come from disadvantaged areas.
—I'm not saying a damn thing, George.
—That is not what your remarks indicated, Senator Abetz. If you want to mutter under your breath, maybe you ought to do it a little bit quieter so that it is not picked up on this side and you do not get the response that you are entitled to.
I want to now refer to a couple of letters out of the overwhelming number of letters, faxes and so forth which I have received. The first one is from some parents in regional Australia, and it is addressed to me. It says:
To George Campbell
We are writing to protest about the Howard government schools funding bill.
Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for private education. If anything the funding should be increased for state schools to help our ailing school system.
We have a 14 year old son that has a learning difficulty and we have fought tooth and nail to get him help. We started trying to get him help in 2nd class and he is now in year 8. We have finally got him the help he needs and if these cuts to the school funding happen we are afraid that we may lose this great help that he is getting.
We are so sick and tired of the Howard government promising the world when you're actually getting nothing at all. What happens is the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. If we get any poorer our family and many other families in Australia will be living on Parliament House grounds in cardboard boxes.
...	...	...	
Where is the future for our country and our most valuable assets, our children and their education.
The second letter that I want briefly to refer to is from the principal of Ulladulla Public School. It says:
This week we lost our place on the Federal Government's Disadvantaged Program. This is in spite of our school community being in the same position economically as it was three years ago when we were originally placed on the program. In effect this means we lose one teacher position and approximately $80 000 p.a. in additional funding. You can imagine the effect this is going to have on our ability to provide aide support and resources for our school population.
Universal primary and secondary education has been a central part of citizenship and a key democratic institution. Undermining this principle by not securing funding equities between public and private education could have far greater ramifications than even this government envisages. If this social experiment goes wrong, thousands of children will be condemned to a life of disadvantage.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2000-11-09,"—I too wish to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. I listened to the remarks of Senator George Campbell—as I have listened to the remarks of other Labor senators who have participated in this debate—with growing disappointment and dismay. Try as they might, though I do not think they try very hard, the Australian Labor Party cannot escape the old shibboleths, the old class war rhetoric, the belief that there is something wrong or something invidious about choice, the belief that in order to enable parents to achieve the education that they would choose for their children one is therefore handicapping families and students who attend government schools, and the idea that private provision and public provision are a zero-sum game. It is nonsense. I believe that this legislation is some of the finest legislation this parliament will consider. 
—You have got to be joking!
—There he goes. Senator Carr is displaying all of the old prejudices, the bigotries and the shibboleths of the 1950s. This is about empowering parents and empowering families. Let me correct a couple of the misconceptions which either deliberately or through ignorance the Labor Party have advanced about this legislation. The first—and we heard it in ringing tones from Senator George Campbell—is that this legislation is anti government schools. Senator George Campbell should know, as all senators should know, that funding for government schools will be increased as a consequence of this legislation, not reduced. The legislation appropriates a sum estimated at $7,620,191,000 for grants to government schools in the 2001-04 quadrennium. In addition, as honourable senators such as Senator Carr and Senator George Campbell ought to know—or perhaps they do know but pretend not to know—100 per cent of the GST revenue is returned to the states so that they can spend that money on government schools through their own budget allocations and at their discretion. There has never been more Commonwealth money invested in public education in this country before than there will be as a direct consequence of this bill, which, for the most foolish and ideological reasons, the Labor Party have chosen to oppose.
The second misconception, a misconception born either of deliberate falsehood or of ignorance, which the Labor Party cultivate in this debate is that it is about elite schools. Tell that to the Catholic schools, who have welcomed this proposal with open arms. Tell that to the entire private school sector, which has welcomed this proposal with open arms. As usual, rather than come to terms with the basis of a policy, the Labor Party, as they did in the GST debate, pick upon a wilderness of single instances and then try any way they can, through the distortion of language, to make the legislation seem unappealing to the public and suggest that therefore the legislation and the policy underlying the legislation are flawed. They pick on the category 1 schools. They pick on the so-called elite schools. Senator Campbell and Senator Carr: this is not so much about schools; this is about students. It is about families. It is about giving those families the choice not to send their children to government schools if they choose not to. If they are religious people—if they are Catholics, members of other Christian churches or members of other religious faiths—in this country and they want to send their children to a school where they will be educated in the religion of their family, the legislation enables parents to do that. It looks not at the needs of the schools but at the needs of the families.
—They pay tax too.
—As Senator Calvert rightly points out, they pay tax too. It looks at the needs of the families and enables them to have a choice. This nonsense about category 1 schools being the home of elitism is lamentable. There are so many families—I know many in this position, as I hope would all honourable senators—who make tremendous sacrifices so that they can send their kids to what they consider to be the school that will give them the best education. That is not to say that private schools are better than government schools—many government schools are better than a lot of private schools—but it is the right of parents to say where they want their children educated. I speak in this debate with real passion because my family made that choice with me. 
—What a surprise!
—My mother was a widow and she worked hard. She worked overtime and made a hell of a lot of sacrifices to send me to a private Catholic school—not an elite school, but a middle range, very fine school in Brisbane: Villanova College. If parents want to make sacrifices so that they can choose where their children are educated, who is to say that they ought not to have that right? How dare anyone say that a parent or a family should not be given every encouragement by policy and by legislation to exercise that choice. 
My little girl attends a very fine school, St Margaret's, in Brisbane and the parents of the children in her grade 3 class are not rich—some might be, but most are not. They are shopkeepers, small businesspeople and public servants—I daresay a few of them are trade unionists. They make the sacrifices because they have decided that they would like to have their daughters educated at a school that they think is a good school and one that they would prefer them to be educated at. I understand Senator McLucas is a St Margaret's old girl.
—No, I'm not.
—I am sorry, I am contradicted. If parents make that choice, who is to say that they ought not to? The parents of children even at the so-called elite schools—such as Geelong Grammar, Shore and the King's School—are, in many cases, struggling people who make tremendous sacrifices to give their children what they perceive to be the best start in life. Who is to say that they should not have that opportunity and that government ought not to encourage it?
The test of this legislation is whether it will increase access to schools, government and private. In that regard, I will read into the record some communications that have been passed on to me by the minister from some of the schools to which the right of parents to send their children is being attacked by the Labor Party in their opposition to this legislation. Let me read from a circular letter, dated 6 November 2000, to parents of the Westminster School in South Australia from Mr R.H. Graham, the secretary of the school council. The letter commends the legislation, and Mr Graham writes:
In the event that SES funding passes the Senate and results in increased funding being received for 2001, the Council has determined that it will reduce the fee levels by passing on the full increased benefit to parents. If this occurs, I will write to you again to inform you of the reduced fee details.
—Don't hold your breath.
—What a cynical remark! How dare you, Senator Carr, impugn the motives, the integrity and the good faith of the parents and the council of the Westminster School. That is a disgrace; I am ashamed of you. Let me quote again from a letter from A.A. Twig, the acting principal of the Geelong Grammar School. The Geelong Grammar School has been the subject of the tired old socialist shibboleths that are being trotted out by the ALP in an attempt to deny parents their right of choice. In a letter of 13 September 2000 to Senator Alston—which the minister passed to me—Mr Twig says, among other things:
Geelong Grammar School has an open entry policy and serves the educational needs of a wide and diverse community. It is the School's stated intention to use additional funds derived from the application of the SES model to increase access to the school. This will be achieved through the offer of additional scholarship and bursary support. A fairer share of public funding for education will recognise the significant contribution towards national education made by parents who choose to invest their after tax savings in their children's education.
The image that I am sure lives in the minds of those opposite is that of category 1 schools as nothing other than bastions of elitism and playgrounds of the rich. It is not so, and only those who are ignorant of the sacrifices that Australian families make in order to be able to choose to send their children to the schools that they regard as being the best schools would say otherwise.
I will finish my contribution on that note. It is the parents' right—it is not the right of the Senate—to choose where they will send their children to be educated. It is the obligation of the Senate and of the political leadership of this country to put in place a set of public policies that will enable that choice to be made—that will reduce the financial pressures on private schools to make them more accessible, not less, so that the sacrifices of middle-class parents in this country will be rewarded, not penalised. This legislation is a great championing of the principle of equality of opportunity, and I suggest that the Senate pass it emphatically. If social justice and equity are the criteria according to which education funding legislation is to be judged, this legislation and this funding mechanism pass the test. ",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-09,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 delivers unprecedented gains to the top private schools—and the Democrats hold the view, like large numbers of Australians, I think, that this is unfair and unreasonable. Make no mistake: the Australian Democrats recognise the need to fund non-government schools with public support. But this particular bill is just unfair. It is unfair to the non-government schools in genuine need of more funding, and it is unfair to the 70 per cent of the school population who are in our critically underresourced public education system. This bill is overgenerous to the well-off and better-off schools.
Public education is underresourced in this country. As a percentage of GDP, our overall spending on education has dropped from 5.1 per cent in 1992-93 to 4.3 per cent in 1999-2000. We have also dropped well below other OECD countries in public spending on education. Australia was spending 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1997, compared with the OECD mean of 5.1 per cent. This is a policy we will live to regret, and our children will curse any government that allowed this kind of situation to develop.
It is quite clear that the coalition government is not prepared to fulfil its obligation to fully support—I recognise that they do support, but they do not fully support—a free, universally accessible and secular, high quality public education system. Quality needs money. It is also clear that Minister Kemp is very interested in parents paying more for education by shifting students out of government schools and into the private sector. This is a minister who once posed the question, `If a service can be found in the Yellow Pages, why is the government providing it?' Every parent forced out of the public sector system by a low investment policy is effectively forced to pay an indirect tax by paying for private education. It is cost shifting from the public to the private.
The Democrats think there are very good reasons to provide high quality public education—reasons such as equity, such as securing a sound future in Australia with a population of well-educated young people; reasons such as making Australia as competitive as it can be in what is a very tough world. This legislation will help some schools produce outstanding, well-educated young people. But they will be in schools that, by and large, are already well resourced or will become well resourced.
The coalition makes the charge that it is unfair to pick upon the schools which illustrate the point of being excessively funded, but that indicates the weaknesses of what you are suggesting. No-one denies that you should not be funding non-government schools, but there are excesses in what you are proposing. The King's School in Sydney has been raised several times in debate. As we all know, it will get an additional $1.4 million a year under the new system. The school has just announced a $16 million capital works program. It has already raised $2½ million from parents—and good on them. But how can this possibly be considered a needy school? The money raised works out to about $2,200 per student, and it is going to get an additional $1.4 million a year.
In my home state of Western Australia, Dr Kemp's reward system for the already privileged is yielding similar results. The Hale School, which I know well and have visited several times, is a category 2 under the present system: it gets an extra $1 million a year under the SES. Hale has 12 tennis courts, four basketball courts, a gymnasium, an Olympic size eight-lane swimming pool, a rowing fleet on the Swan River, four football fields, two soccer fields and hocky fields, four squash courts and two rugby fields. Terrific young people are educated there. It is a great school. The annual fees are in the order of $9,000. Why is it getting extra money?
We are told that many families make great sacrifices to send their children to non-government schools. That is obviously the case for some families. The rhetoric of many needy families making sacrifices to give their kids a better chance is powerful, and it is true—and Dr Kemp knows this. But is it a sound basis for this kind of subsidy, for this kind of public policy?
The Democrats have fundamental problems with relying solely on notional parental income to establish the basis for deciding which non-government schools are in need of more Commonwealth support. The current system of funding takes into account all of the resources flowing into each non-government school and the fees that each is able to command. In many schools receiving large increases, those fees alone are equal to twice the amount spent on students in government schools. The issue here is not the top amount which students are getting; the issue is the bottom amount and how we can ensure that our system's base is as strong and as of good a quality as we can make it. 
The role of government should be to alleviate inequities, not to entrench them or increase them. Ultimately, the issue at hand is excessive public subsidy of the private sector and what the limits should be. We should be focusing our efforts and our dollars on ensuring a high minimum educational standard for each child—and that should be a quality minimum educational standard. At present, we are failing at this challenge. Forty per cent of students in government junior secondary schools are being taught maths and science by teachers who are not qualified in those areas. We are not giving children at risk of homelessness or early school leaving the support that they need. That is hard work, looking after the disadvantaged or difficult is hard work, and you need to pay teachers and have enough teachers to do that hard work. It is much easier teaching bright, well-fed privileged kids than teaching those sorts of children—which really is hard work and needs money.
In country areas, access to a decent range of curriculum choices and cultural enrichment is often severely lacking, and successive federal governments of both persuasions have neglected their responsibility to provide pre-school access. The Democrats believe the primary role of government is to ensure that every Australian child has access to a good standard of education, regardless of what their parents are able or willing to pay. We do believe in a fair go. All of Australia believes in a fair go. We are also unashamedly egalitarian on educational matters. We believe funding is better done by basing it on the resources schools can call upon.
The fundamental flaw in the SES is the fact that it does not reflect directly the actual income of households where students live. It uses the average income of their neighbourhood. Many urban areas are mixed income neighbourhoods—and these are generally close to the city—where the wealthy can live cheek by jowl with those on low incomes and social security. Again, in my own city of Perth, there are very wealthy areas where there are also very poor people because the city and the government have had a policy of putting assisted housing in wealthy areas, and I think that is a good policy. It is against the ghetto mentality, but it does have an effect when you are looking at this kind of funding of distorting the formula. The ABS say that this phenomenon tends to produce scores around the middle of the range.
Even worse the SES does not reflect the actual wealth of households with private school students. Aspects such as tax minimisation techniques, inherited wealth, savings, indebtedness, property values, possession of trusts, et cetera, are not included. The ABS acknowledges that people filling out the census form tend to understate their income, especially in relation to investment income. In the end, this is information that is supplied voluntarily and cannot be checked against tax records. There is no wealth database in this country. The consequence of all this is that well-off and better-off schools are being overpaid, and that is what this debate is about.
The SES will also disproportionately reward high fee schools which take boarders from rural areas. These schools will benefit from the low SES of rural areas, even though only a handful of families from these districts would be able to afford boarding fees. For instance, the 700 boarders at Geelong Grammar make up roughly half the school population. On the whole, they may come from lower socioeconomic rural areas but higher wealth households. It is clear that the SES will favour above all the most affluent urban schools in the eastern states. Professor Richard Teese from Melbourne University found that outside the Catholic system more than three-quarters of the SES funding increases would go to schools in ERI categories 1 to 3, which are the schools charging the most fees and with the highest resourcing levels. Dr Kemp says the hefty increases to the most privileged schools are meant to redress years of underfunding. By whose measure? It seems to me that schools like Hale in Perth have been doing just fine without Canberra's help. Of course they will accept any more money that is coming their way—they would be mugs not to—but do they deserve it and would that money be better placed in the public sector system? I believe the money would be most efficiently and equitably redistributed to the genuinely needy. I cannot accept that schools like Hale have been underfunded significantly, and I cannot accept that this is a fair or particularly efficient use of taxes to promote the widest distribution of educational skills in our young people.  
Fair enough if there was money to splash around, but the need in the public system deepens. The supply of teachers at WA public schools is expected to satisfy only 72 per cent of demand by the year 2003. Western Australia in particular, because of its size, has a problem with staffing schools in regional and remote areas. Year 12 completion rates nationally in 1998 were 67 per cent in urban areas, 63 per cent in rural areas and 54 per cent in remote areas. Year 12 completion rates in privileged private schools are outstanding by contrast. ABS figures show that in 1996 the region with the poorest school attendance in Australia was the Kimberley in my state of Western Australia.
The recent HREOC inquiry into rural and remote education heard that teacher turnover is high. In remote areas, new graduates in government schools are expected to teach multigrade classes with few facilities and usually live in substandard housing. They are usually unable to help children with special needs or special talents because there is not enough human resources support. The plight of these teachers will be worsened under the bill, not only because funding in general to public schools will stagnate but also because funding for the federal Country Areas Program will go into decline. Indeed, $18.7 million a year is supposed to give additional support to thousands of schools all over the nation. A couple of years ago this figure was $20 million, so it has not even kept pace with inflation. Ninety per cent of what is known as CAP money goes to government schools. There is a pattern here: where targeted programs support government schools, Dr Kemp seems to be running with a suitcase full of money in the opposite direction. These schools are shuddering under the weight of not enough resources. The Western Australian Farmers Federation said:
There is a desperate need for the Federal Government to take a long hard look at the hardships that thousands of families encounter just by being located in the rural or remote areas of Australia. No wonder those small towns, jobs and people are disappearing from rural areas, where the sacrifices that those people endure are greater than the benefits their families would gain by staying.
I do not consider the Western Australian Farmers Federation to be a hotbed of radical Socialist Leftism, but if you had to ask them whether they would prefer to take that money out of Hale and pop it into the public sector rural schools, I suspect they might answer yes. The inquiry into rural and remote education by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission painted a stark picture of the need for special funding in Western Australia. We are talking here of an entirely different realm of need from what Dr Kemp's notion of need is. One principal told the HREOC inquiry:
We have children here with foetal alcohol syndrome. We are not really sure of their learning capacity. In the younger years it is not so much of a problem but we have one girl here who is nearly 14 and she can barely write her name. This child is also developmentally delayed. She has been tested once before and she once had access to an occupational therapist. Students with foetal alcohol syndrome really need an integration aid.
We have to ask ourselves as a society: do we give up on these people and say it is a hopeless case and it will just go on from generation to generation like that, or do we actually try to turn matters around? I think, as someone who has hope in the human nature and human condition, we should try to help them to turn things around. Another witness to the inquiry highlighted the desperate need for health specialists in remote areas of Western Australia, where indigenous children suffer high levels of ear infections, saying: 
There is a teacher of the deaf in Broome. But this person does not have money for travel nor does he have a vehicle. 
Quite a number of children have hearing disabilities. We have 6 children who had a referral to the ear specialists out of 40 children. Two of those 6 children have priority one ear operations. We have one child who has no hearing and no speech. He floats between two communities. One child has recently had an ear operation. It might be next year before the ear specialist comes so it might be a long time before these children have an ear operation. 
Those children are harder to teach. They need more resources to deal with them and to bring them along so that they can become productive and meaningful members of society. Another witness talked about the severe levels of undernourishment impeding children's learning saying:
We don't provide a breakfast program though we do have children who are failing to thrive. We sell Weetbix at recess and some children hold on to them for lunch. 
Our children do not have much energy. You get a few hours of work out of them and then they say they are `weak'. `We are weak, we are slack'.
Everybody who is involved in education knows that an undernourished child does not concentrate as well and needs, again, more teacher attention. There is a desperate need for English second language teachers in remote communities. Several teachers told the inquiry that it was very difficult accessing ESL support for Aboriginal students. They said, `Students that in Perth would be deemed to be ESL or English Second Language students are not recognised as such if they're Aboriginal.' The retention rate for indigenous students is 33 per cent compared to 75 per cent for all students. I know it has improved over the last decade, and that should be said, but it still has a long way to go. Only 5½ per cent of the indigenous school aged population are participating in years 11 and 12. Nearly half of indigenous people aged 15 years and over have received no formal education. 
The life chances and aspirations of all Australian children, some more than others, rest in part with the fate of this bill. It is quite proper in the debate on this bill to concentrate on those at the very top and those at the very bottom because it illustrates the distance between the kind of funding which is being proposed at each end. We think that is distorted and should be shrunk. The Democrats believe that delivering $500 million in increases to private schools while granting only $106 million extra to public schools over the next four years is not a recipe for efficiency or equity or a fairer nation. One communist hope, which was never realised in its awful tyranny, nevertheless held an interesting ideal. That communist hope was: from each according to their means to each according to their needs. In this bill the coalition are feeding the rich and rationing the poor, and that is just not fair.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-09,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this very important States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. This is a significant piece of legislation. It will appropriate $22 billion to schools over the next four years, and it has implications for raising the quality of education and increasing access to education for all Australian school children and Australian families. The bill renews the government's commitment to school education across Australia. 
This bill reflects the government's policy decisions related to the 2001 to 2004 school funding quadrennium. These include implementation of the new socioeconomic funding arrangements of non-government schools; the introduction of a streamlined structure for Commonwealth targeted programs for schools, improving accountability and permitting greater flexibility in the application of Commonwealth funds to improving outcomes for educationally disadvantaged students; and strengthened accountability and reporting arrangements where education authorities will be asked to commit to reporting on student outcomes against agreed performance indicators and targets underpinning the national goals of schooling. This bill also contains provisions for establishment grants to assist new non-government schools with costs incurred in their formative years and enable them to be competitive with existing schools. For the first time it will provide recurrent funding for distance education students in the non-government sector receiving that education from non-government schools and the streamlining of legislative requirements for the capital grants program which will be accompanied by a broader reporting by states on the state of their school infrastructure and improvements year on year.  
It is necessary to put in place a new funding mechanism for non-government schools because the mechanism which the Labor Party put in place—namely, the education resource index, or ERI as it is commonly known—is badly broken and has no credibility. It has been broken because it has been subject to constant political manipulation and political decision making with the result that the categorisation of the schools through the ERI has now no obvious rationale whatsoever. The ERI is inequitable, complex and readily manipulated. Increased funding for the non-government sector will give a significant funding boost for the neediest non-government schools. It addresses areas of need which have remained unaddressed for many years and restores an equitable balance between funding for government and non-government schools alike. The ceiling of maximum funding will be lifted from about 56 per cent of average government school costs to 70 per cent, representing a 14 per cent funding increase to where it is needed most. The legislation will ensure that the level of funding need assessed for parish schools will be secure. It will ensure that the new schools are funded at the assessed level of need of their parents and not at some artificially reduced level designed to inhibit lower income parents from exercising their choice as to which school they send their children. It will mean that the gross inequities of the ERI, especially for schools in categories 1 to 4, will at last be replaced by a fair funding arrangement reflecting the actual needs of parents who have children at these schools.
With regard to this new SES funding system, Mrs Audrey Jackson of the Association of Independent Schools in my state of Western Australia, which has 120 members throughout the state, wrote in the Australian on 6 November this year that the association has schools:
... at Carnarvon, Coolgardie, Gibson and Mukinbudin. There are schools also in the Great Sandy Desert and other remote areas of the Pilbara and Kimberley. In these latter schools, access to a reliable power and water source is problematic, as is ready access to the internet. These schools will benefit from the implementation of a socioeconomic status (SES) model of funding, since the maximum funding level has increased to 70 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost.
It is time to stop taking the narrow view with a focus on the larger, high-fee, longer established schools and to consider the benefits across the sector. In the SES, the Government has developed a method of funding that truly recognises the circumstances of schools in rural and remote Australia.
I think Mrs Audrey Jackson puts the point very well that what we are talking about in the non-government sector are many schools which are at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale and, in some cases, are schools which are in the remote and regional areas of this country. I might just refer to correspondence that I have received from the National Council of Independent Schools Association urging the Senate to pass this legislation. Correspondence from the National Catholic Education Commission urges that the Commonwealth parliament pass this legislation as soon as possible. There are other items of correspondence that I have received and, indeed, it would be fair to say that churches across Australia have endorsed this legislation and are urging this Senate to pass it intact.
No school will be financially disadvantaged by the move to the new SES funding system. Schools that would otherwise have their funding reduced under the new arrangements will have their 2000 per capita entitlements maintained. Schools that are funded under the SES model will have their increased funding phased in at a rate of 25 per cent of the increase each year, so that by 2004 schools will be fully funded at their new level. In the legislation the Commonwealth's increased funding for schools is not confined to non-government schools. Commonwealth spending on government schools is at the highest level ever. I stress that the government believes that you need to have a strong government school sector as well as a strong non-government school sector. By having that, you give the parents of Australia a viable choice as to where they send their children. The total funding for government schools in the Commonwealth budget this year is $2 billion and over the next four years will total $8.6 billion. Government schools will receive over $1 billion more for the next four-year funding period than during the previous four years. 
The government's fairer funding reforms enjoy the support of the entire non-government sector, as I have said. At the recent meeting between the Prime Minister and state premiers, there was a press conference after the COAG meeting, and the Prime Minister stated, `Nobody criticised the new funding formula for independent schools,' Whereupon Premier Beattie from Queensland supported this with a comment saying:
The Prime Minister is quite right. In fact, I made the point that we didn't want to see one cent go out of any private schools.
That came from a Labor Premier, from a Labor state, and he was supporting the government funding formula. Senator Allison, of the Democrats, has proposed an amendment requiring greater accountability for non-government schools. With respect, she has missed the point on a major feature of this bill—that is, it is seeking to achieve equality of outcomes for all students. This bill contains provisions which give effect to a new accountability framework aimed at strengthening the link between the funding provided under Commonwealth school programs and improved outcomes for all Australian students. This bill also provides for a revised structure for some Commonwealth programs of targeted assistance for schools, which is the outcome of the review foreshadowed in the 1999-2000 budget. The revised structure combines the literacy and numeracy grants to schools and the special education support fixed and per capita grants into the strategic assistance for improving student outcomes program. What we have here is not just SES funding; it is a comprehensive bill that deals with targeted assistance for Australia's school children.
The priority and community languages programs will be combined into the Languages Other Than English program to provide greater flexibility for funding to achieve improved learning outcomes. The changes give education authorities greater freedom to allocate Commonwealth funding to schools to achieve improved learning outcomes for students. They are intended to encourage sectors in schools to think more strategically about how to utilise this funding to achieve improved outcomes. Targeted programs need to have the capacity to produce far-reaching changes to school practice, not just act on the margins in a few selected schools. For example, schools going through a revolution in the senior years of schooling, as a result of the Commonwealth's strategy of encouraging a major stream of enterprise and career education supported by business and community organisations, to greatly expand options for the 70 per cent of school leavers who do not go straight from school to university. The result has been a veritable explosion in the number of senior students doing enterprise and career courses. It has risen from 26,000 in 1995 to an estimated 167,000 students this year. We also have over 7,000 students in school based part-time new apprenticeships. What we are providing is a seamless transition from school to training, and that of course is applicable to the 70 per cent of students who do not go on to university.
We have here a genuine and positive educational change taking place not in a few selected areas but in schools across the country. I expect our initiatives in indigenous education, especially in literacy and numeracy, to have similar widespread effects. Senator Lees from the Democrats made the remark that there is no requirement for non-government schools to spend Commonwealth funding on education. I recommend that she read the first page of the bill that states:
A Bill for an Act to grant financial assistance to the States for 2001 to 2004 for primary and secondary education, and for related purposes. 
This means that all funding under this bill is for the provision of education.
We believe that the amendments proposed by the ALP and the Democrats are unfair and completely unworkable. As Senator Tierney quite rightly pointed out, Labor's proposal to maintain the funding of category 1 schools at the current level is ridiculous as it assumes that all category 1 schools are the wealthiest schools in Australia. The SES funding model has shown this to be incorrect by revealing the socioeconomic status of parents who send their children to these schools. They are not necessarily rich parents. This also highlights the deficiencies of the current ERI index, which I mentioned earlier. The amendments proposed by the Democrats are not based on any sound rationale. Freezing funding for 12 months would be totally untenable for the schools sector and would deprive schools of additional funding of $285 million under this bill. The proposal to change the calculation of the SES system by checking every parent's income is equally inappropriate. This has significant privacy implications and would be an administrative nightmare. 
Senator Lees's claim that the Commonwealth increases for government schools are only cost supplementation is incorrect. This government's commitment to government schools is shown in the substantial election and budget increases provided since 1996: some $516 million for important literacy and numeracy programs, $187 million for languages, $180 million for special learning needs, $78 million for quality teaching—to assist teachers in professional development—$239 million for indigenous education, and $130 for VET in schools. We also have, for the first time ever, a comprehensive drug education program involving $18 million and the setting up of a National Schools Drug Advisory Council. That is something the parents of Australia would indeed acknowledge as very important. Some 70 per cent of the funding I have just mentioned goes direct to government schools. We have a bill here which is for all, not just for some.
There is widespread support for this bill within the schools sector and the public arena. There have been calls from both sectors for this bill to be passed so that schools can get on and start planning the new school year. Labor and the Democrats have been delaying the passage of this bill by proposing amendments which are not appropriate and by delaying the tabling of the Senate legislation committee report not once but twice. This bill is the single most important piece of schools legislation that this government has introduced.
We are also going to provide new arrangements for educational accountability which will require education authorities—government and non-government—as a condition of funding, to commit to achieving performance targets underpinning the national goals for schooling. As a nation, we will know for the first time where we are headed in relation to our education in this country. The outcomes expressed in these targets will be those related to the national benchmarks in literacy and numeracy and progressively to those performance measures in other key areas as identified and endorsed by education ministers. These performance measures, in the form of targets with a clear time line, will be agreed through the relevant MCEETYA task forces. Education authorities will be required to publicly report on progress towards achieving these outcomes. I expect that the reporting built into this legislation will have immediate and direct benefits. It will build public confidence in our schools by providing an agreed national framework against which parents can assess their children's progress in key areas.
The Commonwealth is encouraging educational authorities to improve reporting to parents, including the provision of information on the performance of students against the national standard. The strength of this approach is that it provides assessment and reporting of student achievement against nationally agreed standards, but it does not mandate how schools should achieve those improved outcomes. These accountability measures will throw the whole weight of the federal government's $5 billion annual investment in schools behind improving educational outcomes. The Commonwealth approach to school quality includes parent choice and increased funding. We are also providing important strategic intervention to help schools improve these outcomes for the most disadvantaged students. This bill has a variety of measures which will all go to improving education in this country. As I said, it is the single most important piece of schools legislation that this government has introduced. It will involve $22 billion of funding over four years. The Commonwealth's commitment to improving educational outcomes for all young Australians is clear and backed up by increased funding, strategic intervention, improved standards and, of course, choice.  
I note that Senator Carr has moved a second reading amendment. The government will be opposing this. In his proposed amendment to the second reading speech, Senator Carr is entirely off the point. He has not recognised the benefits of this bill. He has not recognised the increased funding for the schools sector in this country. He has not recognised the increased accountability and transparency in relation to the funding of the education sector. For those reasons, we will be vigorously opposing the second reading amendment. I have touched briefly on the amendments proposed by the ALP and the Democrats, but I believe they are best addressed individually when we come to them in the committee. I commend this very good bill to the Senate.
 (Senator Calvert)—The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-11-09,"—Recently I enjoyed the great privilege of leading the 10th Australian Political Exchange Council delegation to Japan. The eight delegates chosen were parliamentarians or party activists representing the four major Australian political parties. The trip was organised by the Australian Political Exchange Council as part of its program to foster international understanding through exchange visits by young leaders who, in the council's opinion, will best benefit from the experience and thus build stronger ties among nations.
Professor Ross Terrill, a distinguished Australian academic teaching at Harvard University, recently published a book titled The Australians. It concluded:
Australia will continue its steps into the Asian orbit. It has been going on for decades. Yet it may never be total. Australia, like Japan in a different way, hangs at a tangent to the nearest region. It may over a long period become to Asia what Japan is to the West—the most Asian nation of the West, as Japan is the most Western nation of the East. Eventually, if not in my lifetime, Australia will draw, as Japan draws, great dynamism from this dualism.
Japan is like a distant uncle for many Australians. We assume we will like him but are a little wary of some of the stories we have heard. While Japan is our major trading partner and the rhetoric of friendship is cultivated and warm, it is difficult to talk of a popular appreciation of a Japan-Australia partnership. The Japan we visited was one filled with uncertainties unleashed by globalisation, the push for trade liberalisation and the fallout from the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis. There was no evidence of a fat or conceited Japan—the subject of some Western commentary in the 1980s. Japan is undergoing fundamental change with a comprehensive program of reform, challenging demographic shifts such as its rapidly ageing population, a restructuring and reorientation of its economic system and perhaps even a questioning of cultural values. 
One of the exciting advantages of politics is that you enjoy marvellous access to individuals and to places. Japan was no exception. Our exchange group enjoyed 3½ days of briefings in Tokyo. These sessions covered the whole range of Japanese life: politics, economics, culture, bureaucracy, interest groups, education and the environment. Again, what startled me was not so much what was said as who said it. We had access to cabinet ministers, heads of departments, leaders of opposition political parties including—and it is sad that Senator Carr has gone—
—I have not gone anywhere.
 (Senator Chapman)—Order! Senator Carr, you know that not only is it disorderly to interject but it is most disorderly to interject when you are not sitting in your own seat.
—They included the famous feminist and reformer, former Speaker of the House of Representatives in the Japanese Diet and leader of Japan's Social Democratic Party, Ms Takako Doi, leading commentators on Japanese affairs as well as the rising stars of Japanese politics. Despite representing different opinions on so many facets of Japanese life, all the commentators agreed on one thing: that Japan would have to reform its economy, its industry, its education and, to some degree, even its psyche.
Liberal democracies classically divide society into two realms: the public and the private. The public realm is largely the institutions of state: the political system, the administration of justice and the bureaucracy. The private is the household and the affairs of the individual. Since World War II the Japanese public has certainly changed, though not in the wholehearted way that some might argue. The bureaucracy, for example, predates World War II and yet remains very much at the centre of power in Japan. The private, many argue, has changed much more slowly. The regime of family life—the centre of the private—is often said to be more conservative than in the West but even here attitudes are undergoing transformation: the number of young educated Japanese women in the work force has forced a somewhat reluctant change. But in the West our communities are not defined just by the strength of public institutions nor the role of the family. Rather, the strength of social ligatures is enhanced by a strong civil society which bridges the public and private realms.
Civil society is what communities do for themselves, specifically through non-government organisations that fulfil social, cultural, welfare and other roles. Unlike Australia and the United States, however, Japanese life has not developed a mature civil society. It is still dominated to a large extent by its great public institutions—the spider web of the bureaucracy, big business and political parties, particularly the Liberal Democratic Party. Their influence on all aspects of life is complemented by the private sphere: the extended Japanese family and its social support. However, Japanese attention to the great benefits of a healthy civil society was awakened amidst the destruction of the Kobe earthquake in January 1995. More than 1.3 million volunteers and a large number of non-governmental organisations converged on the city. Their success in offering relief and assistance to their victims was in stark contrast to the ostensibly inefficient and bureaucratic performance of government aid efforts. In another context, roles such as policy advice, once exclusively the province of the bureaucracy, have also been challenged by the development of independent think tanks. Harnessing this aptitude and appetite for a strong civil society and better governance is one of the goals of our sponsors, the Japan Centre for International Exchange. 
Even when the memory of the briefings and the marvellous hospitality of our Japanese hosts begins to fade, none of us will forget the inspiring individuals whom we met. First, Mr Tadashi Yamamoto, the President of the Japan Centre for International Exchange. Here was a man, schooled in the United States and inspired by the liberal internationalism of President John Kennedy and Senator Robert Kennedy in the 1960s, who upon returning to his native Japan was determined to make a difference. Tadashi Yamamoto established the Japan Centre for International Exchange as a means of fostering international understanding. He has achieved that. He has truly lived Robert Kennedy's challenge to his generation:
Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation.
Tadashi Yamamoto is a proud son of Japan but also a committed citizen of the world.
Secondly, I must mention Mr Naoto Kitamura. Mr Kitamura is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party and represents a constituency in Hokkaido Prefecture in the House of Representatives. The Japanese are very great hosts. But Mr Kitamura massaged this cultural trait to grand heights. We were treated with great respect and deference and enjoyed hospitality I know I will never enjoy in this country—and perhaps that is a very good thing. Hokkaido is a strikingly beautiful island and we enjoyed its bounty immensely. But I am indebted to this enthusiastic, charming and, most of all, generous man. He is a great friend of Australia.
Finally, I must thank my fellow delegates for their marvellous company and strong support—Ms Elizabeth Penfold, Mr Charles Gillies, Ms Mick Scheider, Ms Jan Field and Ms Lyn Dengate. They were a credit not only to their respective political parties but also, more importantly, to their country. I am indebted also to Mr Daryl Wight, the Secretary of the Australian Political Exchange Council, for his gentle but artful prodding. Sincere thanks also to my federal parliamentary colleague the member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Michael Danby, and Mr David Williams, the senior adviser to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator John Faulkner. Both Michael and David were great support on the trip, and no matter how often I embarrassed them they smiled—ever so gently, almost in the fashion of our hosts.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>10th Australian Political Exchange Council Delegation to Japan</title>,Adjournment,27,1
