Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (09:31):  I am delighted to have this chance to continue my remarks on the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2], which has been brought to this chamber by Senator Bushby.


The issue that we are looking at here really is one of trying to maintain what has been a very good and privately based service in Australia. At a recent inquiry the Australian Dental Association was forced to make the point that they hope that private practice will continue to be a centrepiece of the dental offers made to Australians all over Australia, but particularly in rural areas. There have been a number of instances of this government trying to change the way that dental services are offered, along with others, and the Australian Dental Association has made the point that it believes that clinical independence is a very vital part of the way that dentistry is practised in this country.


The Australian Dental Association has also slammed the way the government has gone about establishing Medicare Locals. It is a bit startling to find that dentistry has generally been completely excluded from the Medicare Locals model. Eighty-five per cent of the dental services provided in Australia are provided by the private sector, and without those private sector dentists there would be virtually no dental services in rural and regional Australia in particular.


The practitioners of dentistry need to be fully consulted and to become part of any change in dental care delivery, otherwise there is a very real risk that rural and regional areas will lose the dental care that they already have. I think it is worth noting that a survey of members by the Australian Dental Association showed that dentists in rural and regional areas offer a higher mean number of services at a discounted rate compared to metropolitan-based services. In the country—rural and regional areas—39 per cent of services are discounted on average, compared to nine per cent in cities and urban areas.


Rural and regional dentists also offer a higher mean number of free consultations compared to their metropolitan counterparts. I must add that I have yet to come across a free dental consultation, but apparently they do exist. And rural and regional dental practitioners offer an average of 63 per cent free consultations compared to 50 per cent in urban areas. These results suggest that, in spite of the additional challenges that dentists face in rural and regional dental practice, dentist practitioners in these areas strive to provide a quality service at a reasonable rate, in the interests of their patients.


But, of course, there continues to be a problem with dental services in the country, and nothing that this government is doing is likely to improve that. There has been a large increase in the supply of dental professionals recently, with the opening of three new schools in 2007, and the number of new dentists entering the workforce, including new graduates and overseas trained dentists, will be double the number of new entrants that there were in 2006.


There was an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report released recently on dentists, specialists and allied practitioners in Australia which, unfortunately, uses 2006 labour force data—simply because that is the most recent that we have. It indicates that there were 12,212 dentists registered in Australia in 2006. That was a 21 per cent increase on the number of registered dentists compared to 1996, and during the coming decade about 250 new dentists will enter the workforce each year.


Based on these figures, the Dental Board of Australia, in May 2011, estimates that there are now 13,750 dentists with just over 300 new dentists a year coming into our workforce since 2006. Along with the large number of new doctors that will come into the system over the next decade, there will also be a large number of new dentists and other dental professionals, I should point out, and the number of allied dental service practitioners will also increase at a substantial rate.


Despite this, the odds of the figures in rural and regional areas improving is not high given the government's current policies in this area. The number of practising dental practitioners per 100,000 of population ranges from 59.5 in major  cities down to 17.9 in remote and very remote areas. How we go about improving those numbers is something that was the subject of an inquiry by the Community Affairs Committee, and it is also something this government needs to focus on. We do not need to be still saying in years to come that the supply of dentists has been found to decrease dramatically with remoteness, and that the allied health workforce is found to be largely based within the major cities, as the DOHA report titled Audit of the health workforce in rural and regional Australia found in 2008. We need to work on policies to improve this, and might I suggest to the government that a good place to start is the inclusion of dental services and dental practitioners in the people who are consulted about the structure of Medicare Locals. The idea of a needs-based locally-developed medical and health provision is an excellent start, if it works—and of course the 'if it works' is in very large letters when you look at the way this government has gone about it.


The issue that the Australian Dental Association raises is:


Medicare Locals in rural/regional Australia to date has been implemented hastily and has excluded dentistry which will affect dental care delivery for Australians in these areas.


It should go without saying that dentistry must be adequately included in the development of primary healthcare responses to ensure that activities such as dental health promotion and oral disease prevention are undertaken in what, in many cases, are more vulnerable communities. The Australian Dental Association makes the point that establishing a dental surgery is an expensive exercise, considering the equipment that is needed, so establishing it in a small town is a very problematic approach unless there are (a) incentives for people to do so and, (b) a sense that the care they are offering has been integrated into a well-structured health service provision for the local community. No dentist in private practice is going to set up in an area where they know they will not be fully occupied servicing customers. 


I commend Senator Bushby for this bill. It seeks to correct some of the attempts of the government to undermine private practice for dentists in Australia and it seeks to ensure that the sorts of programs that have been so extraordinarily successful—for instance, the chronic disease prevention program involving dentistry that was established by the Howard-Costello government—will be maintained.


The Australian Dental Association points out that a number of factors limit the supply of dental practitioners in rural and regional areas. As I said, not only are there financial constraints such as the very high capital cost, but also the lack of resources and professional support coupled with the lack of social and local infrastructure in the community. Not only do we need to attract dental practitioners to rural and regional areas but we also need to find methods of ensuring that they stay in those rural and regional areas. This involves not just looking after the financial needs of practitioners, but also fostering and supporting their professional, social and community needs. Just as we have had concerns raised during the recent Community Affairs Committee inquiry in terms of the support needed for younger doctors and other health professionals moving into rural and regional areas, the same issue arises of course for dentists and allied dental professionals. It is not going to happen if we do not support it and foster it.


The Australian Dental Association did a survey of its members in September 2011 that found that 17 per cent of the metropolitan-based members would be willing to consider relocating to rural or regional areas to practise dentistry. If this were to occur, if that whole 17 per cent were to move, we would in fact end up with an oversupply of dental professionals in the rural and regional areas. But there are a number caveats on this. The ADA members survey said that there were things that would encourage dentists to move to rural practice. For example, 44 per cent of members said that the quiet rural lifestyle would encourage them to move to rural practice; 23 per cent said the demand for services, the need—thought to be unmet—for services; and 21 per cent believed there were greater employment opportunities for rural and regional dental practice.


But these members also identified what they needed to stay in the area. Some of the very large concerns expressed by the 17 per cent who would consider moving were that there would be social and community issues and professional issues.


The social and community issues that were identified by members of the Australian Dental Association were a lack of access to quality secondary schooling, spouse or partner's unhappiness in moving to a rural setting, the potential lack of employment opportunities for partners, the lack of community resources and what was perceived as a lack of 'cultural fit' with the local community. Professionally, these dentists' concerns were a lack of financial incentive to compensate for a more isolated lifestyle, heavy workload and high community expectations, professional isolation—a very, very important point—and inability to access continuing education. They referred also to the lack of access to general anaesthetic facilities in hospitals, a lack of mentoring for recent graduates and more inexperienced operators, a lack of access to specialist services and support, and—perhaps one of the most important issues for families of an overworked dentist in a rural area—a lack of leave cover for holidays. The lack of access to further education was one of the greatest areas of concern. There have been a number of suggestions made by the Australian Dental Association with regard to this. Certainly the government's view is not going to succeed. Senator Bushby's bill will assist.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2012-08-23,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (09:46):  I am pleased to join the debate on this private senator's bill, the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2]. It is a bill which I think is flawed and poorly focused, a bill that does nothing to redress some of the failings we do have in our dental services system in this country that Senator Boyce has just identified. But the problems that Senator Boyce has referred to will not be fixed or even attended to by the passage of this bill through the parliament, and I certainly hope that does not occur.


This bill is not about providing better dental services to the thousands of people who need them, and let's just be clear about who are the needy when it comes to dental services in this country. We have identified—everyone knows this; it is not new information—that the people who are most in need of dental services are those who are on low incomes and those who live in regional, rural and remote areas. That is where we should be targeting our effort when it comes to dental services. This bill does not do that in any way, shape or form. In my view, this bill is a political stunt, but taking the opportunity to put on a little stunt with this bill actually proves what a poorly designed scheme the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme is.


The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme is deeply flawed. Firstly, it is not means tested. Let's have a look at who has the largest take-up of the CDDS. It is people on higher incomes. That means that people on very high incomes can get up to $4,250 of free dental care. The scheme is not targeted, so that means those people highest in need, those on low incomes and those who live in regional, rural and remote areas, are not targeted through this program—and they are not taking up the scheme at the rate that their dental health would clearly indicate that they should. Patients can get cosmetic work done rather than the basic work that we know our community really needs, which is attendance at a dentist so that proper cleaning is done, particularly for young children, on a regular basis and work can be done when the first caries are identified. Instead, a lot of the money that this scheme has expended is at the cosmetic end, on crowns and caps that, whilst important, are often less important than what should be targeted.


We know that there have been more than a thousand complaints lodged about the CDDS. Misuse of the scheme includes ordering dentures that do not fit, unnecessary crowns—and there is a question there that should be investigated—and charging the full $4,250 without completing the work. Let us go to some of the examples that we have seen of misuse of the scheme.


In one case a dentist has been ordered to repay more than $700,000. In an initial self-assessment sample of 20 patients, the dentist admitted billing for services that were never provided. In my view, and I am not a lawyer, that sounds a lot like fraud. After a subsequent audit began, the dentist admitted incorrectly billing patients 293 times. This is not just an oversight or a mistake; this is systematic. The dentist also said she had no record of 112 services provided to patients that she billed to Medicare. After the audit began, the dentist voluntarily paid back $25,000 for instances where she agreed services had not been provided to the patient, but I think there is a lot more in that story. It just goes to show the way that some dentists, and I really do underline the word 'some', thought that this was a bucket of money that they could simply delve into. This reflects badly on the profession. I must say it is only a small number, but we have to tidy them up.


In another case, Medicare visited a dentist in 2009 who was providing no treatment plans, no quotes to patients and no copies of treatment plans to referring general practitioners. Clearly, that was part of what was expected under the plan. On a return visit in 2010, Medicare found that the dentist had not rectified those issues. In total, the dentist had claimed $1.9 million that was potentially noncompliant with the scheme.


In another case, an audit of the dentist found that he had incorrectly claimed $1.8 million. These are extraordinary figures. During the audit it was revealed that the dentist repeatedly failed to inform the referring GPs of the course of treatment he intended to carry out on their patients. The dental practitioner said this was because he did not use computers—not an excuse in my view. The final case is of a dentist who was reported to be going to aged care facilities to provide cosmetic dental work to aged care residents with dementia without the appropriate permission. I do hope that has been referred to the appropriate medical boards.


This is a scheme which does not work. It is untargeted, it is unfocused and it allows that small number of dentists who want to rort the system to do so. We have been able to identify a number through the audit and we will be able to fix those up. We know that anyone claiming funds from the Australian taxpayer has an obligation to do so according to the law, and dentists are no exception. The government has provided all known dentists with information about the requirements of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme on nine separate occasions, and I refer here to a letter from a former Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Tony Abbott, who writes, 'Dear Dental practitioner', and in paragraph 5 says, 'It will be a requirement that patients are informed about the cost of any recommended dental services before they commence a course of treatment.' We know in many cases that that did not occur. We know that in many cases the referring GP was not told of the course of treatment that was to be undertaken.


The requirements of the scheme are not onerous. It is not onerous, surely, for dentists to tell patients and their doctors what work they are doing. And it is not onerous to tell patients upfront what the cost will be. At the end of January 2012 around $2.27 billion had been claimed under the scheme since it commenced in 2007. The Senate should remember that this scheme was meant to cost $90 million a year when it was first implemented. It is now costing around $1 billion a year. It has blown out by that proportion.


On 29 May 2012 the Minister for Human Services, the honourable senator Kim Carr, issued a statement announcing the government's view that a retrospective change to the dental services determination is needed in relation to the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. Senator Carr also reiterated the government's intention to close the scheme. The retrospective change to the determination would bring compliance arrangements for the scheme more closely in line with other Medicare program compliance arrangements. So that means that those dentists who have inadvertently erred in the delivery of services do have an opportunity to rectify the situation. But that does not mean that those dentists who have systematically, in my view, rorted the scheme can avoid their obligations. There is a full audit, but Senator Carr has indicated that there will be a retrospective change to the dental services determination in relation to CDDS. This change to the determination is not a free pass to practitioners to do what they want. The Minister for Health and the Minister for Human Services will ensure that. But, instead of trying to write off debts as this bill is trying to do, and amend a flawed scheme, our government is making meaningful investments in dental health services. Our government is making a targeted $515.3 million over four years investment in oral health for Australians who are least able to afford dental care. We have a targeted approach to those people in Australia who are least able to afford or access dental care. The new spending will include funding of $345.9 million for a public dental waiting list blitz, which would, according to the National Dental Advisory Council, address the current 400,000 people on waiting lists around the country. It is targeted to those most in need. The funding will be delivered through a national partnership agreement with the states and territories and, in addition, states and territories will be required to maintain their existing effort, including work with children and targeted dental services provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. That is targeted dental care, and that is the sort of approach I would suggest this bill goes nowhere near. 


As part of that package, there is funding of $10.5 million for oral health promotion and the development of a national oral health promotion plan and funding of $35.7 million for an expansion to the voluntary dental graduate year program to offer 100 places per annum from 2016. This will increase the dental workforce to enable the delivery of more dental services through a national scheme. While I have this opportunity I would like to commend James Cook University dental school and the work that they are doing, particularly in rural and remote areas and particularly for low income people in the community of Cairns. 


Funding also includes $45.2 million for a graduate year program for oral health therapists to support 50 placements per annum from 2014 to increase service delivery capacity and create a more flexible dental workforce. It also includes funding of $77.7 million for rural and remote infrastructure and relocation grants for dentists, and funding of $450,000 to non-government organisations to coordinate further pro bono work by dentists for the most disadvantaged Australians across the country.


The Senate, I think, is well aware that the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme has been a failure on many fronts. It has been a failure in terms of targeting and fiscal blowout, and it is not targeted to people most in need. The government will not be supporting this bill.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (09:59):  It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise today to talk on the extremely important Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2]. I just want to put a couple of things on the record before I speak more generally. The first point is that it is clear that the coalition is the only side of politics that has delivered a Medicare dental scheme that provides for treatment. The second point is I am indebted to my colleague Senator David Bushby, who authored this bill. I seek to refer to a speech he made in this place on 21 June. He said:


The coalition strongly supports a transparent and appropriate audit process to detect cases of fraud, the misuse of taxpayers' funds or the provision of inappropriate services. But we do not support Labor's tactic of using innocent and inadvertent administrative errors as a means to claw back funds from dentists, presumably to assist the government in their unattainable quest to achieve a budget surplus—something they have not done for over 20 years!


I quote further from the speech:


Upon commencing the audit process, officers from Medicare identified that many dentists had failed to comply with section 10 requirements of the scheme. Under section 10, dental practitioners were required to provide the patient's referring general practitioner with a dental treatment plan prior to undertaking any work on the patient. However, primarily due to a lack of education on those requirements many dentists were unaware of their administrative obligations and commenced treatment on the first appointment with a new patient prior to providing the necessary paperwork to the GP. Treating the oral health needs of a patient prior to fulfilling the administrative requirements of the scheme does not constitute fraud.


Let us go back and try and ascertain why the government might be pursuing the dentists and trying to destroy this scheme. 


Why do you think the government might have tried to destroy the scheme that was clearly working and why would they possibly use dentists as the fall guys in this? I have a very strong view on this and I suspect that this has been done because of the author of the original scheme who happens to be the current Leader of the Opposition. I think this is a bloody-minded attempt to destroy a scheme that was working because of the person who authored it. What does that mean? That means that destroying the scheme is not good policy. It is actually about bad politics. That is what has been driving this issue. The parliamentary secretary has not responded to a letter I sent her in relation to another matter the other day, which I hope was not an example of cheap politics but I look forward very much to receiving the response in relation to that matter. 


The Labor government wanted to destroy this scheme from day one. In fact, their policy was to destroy the scheme. As part of that, they failed to have any educative process in place. They failed to provide education to a group of professionals for whom this was their first interaction with Medicare. There was no education for that group of professionals and, as a result of that, these administrative errors occurred. They were errors, not fraud. We do not support fraud but we do not support the actions that have been taken on these issues.


I will just go through the outcome of the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme which, as honourable senators know, provides up to $4,250 in Medicare dental benefits over two years for eligible patients with a chronic health condition. Over 17 million services have been provided to approximately one million patients since 2007. What a remarkable policy outcome and yet the Labor Party in government has tried to destroy the scheme. 


One of the other implications of this audit process involved veterans. Again, a knee-jerk reaction caused considerable angst amongst the veteran population because earlier this year, as a result of this audit, the Department of Veterans' Affairs advised dentists that services provided by dental hygienists were not covered by the gold card. Dental services provided by dental hygienists had always previously been covered but as a result of this audit, the implications of which were widespread, DVA stepped in to stop these services being covered. They had been covered under the gold card.


In February this year I received a number of emails from veterans in relation to the removal of the coverage of this service under the gold card. Apparently it had been removed without any consultation whatsoever—no consultation whatsoever—and there was no advice to veterans about why the services were to change. In Senate estimates this year, in February, I pursued this matter with the department, who at the time, remarkably, were unable to provide any reasons why the service was no longer being provided—no reasons whatsoever. Thankfully, common sense prevailed and the Repat Commission extended coverage of the gold card to dental hygiene services.


As always when you remove services like this, the group upon which the impact is most felt is those in rural and regional Australia. And the proposed changes were going to impact most severely on those in regional and rural areas because, as everyone in this place should know, dental services in regional and rural areas are extremely difficult to access. And those who do not know that clearly have no understanding of regional and rural Australia. These dental hygienists provide a valuable preventative health service assisting veterans and others in the community to avoid further health issues arising from poor dental health. Indeed, DVA's decision to stop treatment and not provide any information or advice to veterans caused unnecessary panic. I wonder, quite frankly, where the government's priorities are when they are creating that sort of angst amongst a group of Australians who have either served this nation or are the partners of someone who has served this nation. It was an ill-considered, knee-jerk reaction.


It is interesting to look at what the government has done in relation to dental health. Honourable senators would be aware that in 2008 the Labor Party proposed the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. It promised a million services by providing funding to the states and territories. But—surprise, surprise—the Labor Party did not assess the capacity of the public dental workforce to provide the services, and the number of services would have therefore been significantly less than had been promised. It was never delivered and it was finally scrapped in the 2012 budget. The much vaunted and promised Commonwealth Dental Health Program, which the Labor Party was running around the country lauding, was finally scrapped in this year's budget. It is interesting that, irrespective of whether it had been put in place, it would not have come anywhere near to matching the 17 million services that have been provided under the Medicare scheme—nowhere near that which has been provided under the Medicare scheme. 


The Teen Dental Plan, which was introduced in 2008 by this government, provides only for a preventative check, and the Australian Dental Association quite rightly has argued the scheme provides no follow up care for those with dental issues and its focus is too narrow. The program has had low take-up, with only 429,000 services forecast for 2011 out of an eligible 1.3 million teenagers. The continuation of the Labor Party's rhetoric in relation to dental care was continued in this year's budget, but there was only $60 million in new net funding announced in the budget. More promises have been made, but nothing substantial has been delivered.


It is interesting that any government funded dental scheme is going to require the participation and the cooperation of the dental professions. In one fell swoop, the government has destroyed any trust between itself and the dental profession. This government led witch-hunt, following on from the section 10 investigation, has destroyed that relationship. And, quite rightly, why would any dentist again trust this government in relation to any publicly funded program in which they are required to participate? What an appalling outcome that is for those who require these services. What an appalling outcome that is for those in regional and rural Australia who already have enough difficulty accessing services. What an appalling outcome that is for those who believe, as we do, that there is a significant role for government in relation to the provision of services via Medicare.


In the time left open to me I will now go to some very, very interesting evidence given in the Community Affairs Senate estimates hearing on 30 May this year in relation to the Professional Services Review:


As I understand the current stories in the media around dentistry—and I am simply going on what I read in the media—I understand they are more to do with strict auditing processes, auditing of paperwork et cetera. That is not the sort of matter that comes to PSR—


the Professional Services Review—


We have had no formal notification from Medicare, although there has been some suggestion that there may be cases later this year. But we have had no formal indication from Medicare that they are referring a dentist to us for inappropriate practice which goes beyond, as I understand it, the sorts issues that have been in the media lately. As I said, they are more to do with auditing. Inappropriate practice in terms of the actual professional decisions being made by a dentist, which would be the type of matter that would be referred to PSR—we have not had any referrals and no formal notification.




Senator McLucas:
  But there might be some coming.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Oh, 'There might be some coming,' says the parliamentary secretary. When are they coming, Parliamentary Secretary? You have just said there might be some coming, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. You have said there might be some coming, so when are they coming?




Senator McLucas:
  No, you said that.




Senator RONALDSON:
  When are we going to see them, Parliamentary Secretary? When are we going to see any justification for the government's actions in relation to this? There is nothing before the PSR. This is premised on the back of your attack on dentists for being unprofessional.




Senator McLucas:
  No.




Senator RONALDSON:
  That is what this is about: being unprofessional. The PSR has had no evidence before it of unprofessional behaviour, and yet you have continued this witch-hunt against a group of people that you refuse to educate, who are having—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! Parliamentary Secretary, I would ask you to stop interjecting. Senator Ronaldson, I would ask you to direct your remarks through the chair.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I actually thought I had directed my comments through you, but if I had not then I humbly apologise and I will continue to do so. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, what we have heard from the parliamentary secretary is that there may be cases coming forward. This witch-hunt is premised on unprofessional practice, yet there have been no referrals at all from Medicare to the Professional Services Review. I think that says it all.


This is a policy that was designed to destroy something that was working but was set up by the Leader of the Opposition—cheap politics to destroy something that worked. If the Australian Labor Party, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, had actually put in place something that was working or that would replace it then their bona fides might be a bit stronger. But, as we all know in this place, their much hyped up and much vaunted Commonwealth Dental Health Program failed. So the government has fallen at the first step in relation to their own program, while at the same time taking out of the system—or attempting to—something that is working. You did not educate the dentists because you thought you could destroy the scheme as soon as you got in, and by not being able to destroy the scheme as you wanted, you left it hanging out to dry. In doing so, you left hanging out to dry the very people that were going to be delivering this program, the dentists themselves.


We, under no circumstances, support fraudulent behaviour, but under no circumstances do we support what has been done by this government. This bill seeks to address that wrong, and it has my full and complete support.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (10:19):  This is a very important debate, because many elderly people in this country do have really severe oral health problems, and unfortunately very often they are not able to have those problems fixed because they simply cannot afford the cost of dental treatment. If you can imagine what it is like to live with rotten teeth, not being able to chew properly and with ulcers in your mouth, you would, I think, agree that the lot of such people—and they are the ones I am referring to—is pretty miserable.


The whole purpose of this scheme, which was introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for Health, Tony Abbott, was to provide a means by which elderly people in the community who needed dental and other oral health treatment could obtain that treatment through the Medicare system. I think it is quite outrageous that the government is seeking to stop this scheme and is alleging fraud against dentists when, in fact, it seems that the communication between the Department of Health and Ageing and the dental profession was very poor and that dentists very often innocently made mistakes for which they are now being charged with having created a fraud. This is just an absolute nonsense and I totally support the remarks of Senator Ronaldson in that regard.


The other thing I would say is that this government has a habit of curtailing debates on the health sector. For some reason the government feels very sensitive about health issues. Towards the end of the last sitting before the winter recess, I was to speak on the National Health Amendments (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2012. I say 'I was to speak' because I did not get the opportunity to do so. The government rudely guillotined the debate, preventing a number of my colleagues and me from making comments on that bill.


Today, we debate the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No.2] which is a bill based on a misconception that dentists were defrauding the scheme when, in fact, it seems the Department of Health and Ageing and the government were at fault for their failure to communicate the essential features and requirements of the scheme adequately to the dental profession.


This Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, introduced in the last months of the previous coalition government, allows eligible patients to claim up to $4,250 in Medicare benefits for dental services in any two consecutive calendar years. Over 17 million services have been provided to approximately one million patients since 2007. That speaks for itself in quantifying the specific need for a scheme like this to ensure that the mostly elderly patients who are in this cohort are able to obtain dental treatment so that their quality of life can be improved.


Dental care items were introduced in the Medicare Benefits Schedule in 2004 for patients with chronic conditions and complex care needs under the former enhanced primary care arrangements—again, an initiative of the Howard government. Sadly, as I have said, the need for this kind of service remains but this government appears to be determined to curtail it as much as possible.


In May 2007, significant changes to the EPC program were announced in the budget, to take effect from 1 November in the same year. Eligible patients under that scheme, introduced by the Howard government, could then claim up to $4,250 a year in Medicare benefits for dental services in any two consecutive years. The scheme has been a great success, as I have said, despite two attempts by the Rudd government to shut it down for purely political reasons. One must really question the motivation, the principles and the sense of responsibility of those in the Rudd government who sought to shut down this scheme, and which, fortunately, were rejected twice by the Senate. So, the scheme remains in place.


In June 2010, Labor established an audit task force after its initial attempts to close the scheme failed. These audits are primarily focussed on 'incorrect claiming'—which has also been described as fraud and which it is not—associated with legislative requirements found in section 10 of the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Determination 2007. The coalition supports a transparent and appropriate audit process to detect cases of fraud, misuse of taxpayers' funds or the provision of inappropriate services. However, under Labor's audit processes, dentists have been found to be noncompliant and action has been pursued against them for minor technical mistakes with paperwork, which has been misrepresented as fraud. In most cases, the dentists caught by the audit process have provided appropriate services to patients in need but merely did not comply fully with the technical requirement to provide medical general practitioners with copies of treatment plans and quotations for services prior to commencing treatment.


Why, one might ask, would the dentist not provide these treatment plans if that was a requirement? It seems that a lot of the responsibility for this lies with the government. It seems that consultation with the dental profession as such was almost nonexistent. Instead of sitting down with the dentists, who are not used to working with Medicare in the same way that doctors are, the government did not sit down and consult with the dental profession and make a point of the fact that there was a need to provide the referring general practitioner with a treatment plan. Dentists are certainly well versed in the Department of Veterans' Affairs system and very conversant with its requirements, but they have not had the same degree of exposure to Medicare and its requirements as medical practitioners. So it is not really surprising that many dentists inadvertently did not send copies of their treatment plans to the referring doctors.


An interesting comment from the Australian Dental Association is that, from the doctors' point of view, they wrote to the Dental Association saying that they saw no point in dentists sending them treatment plans because the medical GPs were not dentists and the treatment plans actually meant very little to them. In effect, the government says the dentists were guilty of fraud because they did not send treatment plans to the general practitioners and it seems the general practitioners really did not think these were particularly useful because they did not understand the treatments proposed.


More broadly, the education of the dental profession about this scheme was not comprehensive. When the CDDS was introduced, dentists did not in many cases pay due regard to the detailed requirements of this scheme. The only interaction between the profession was delivery of a letter, a copy of the Medicare benefits fee schedule and some reference to website information.


Clearly inadequate information was provided by the Department of Health and Ageing to the practitioners. As the Australian Dental Association noted, it was not until deficiencies in the education program provided by Medicare were recognised in early 2010 that any more detailed and clear information was provided. Since then, the Australian Dental Association have regularly updated its membership on compliance issues. Obviously, the ADA, as one would expect from a responsible, professional organisation, do not like to see its members accused of committing fraud, for very large amounts of money in some cases, when they were simply providing a much needed service to very needy patients under the Medicare system.


Some of the sums which have been stated to have been obtained by fraudulent means by some dentists under this scheme run into millions of dollars—extraordinary amounts of money. But I am advised by dental practitioners that the implication that individual dentists were charging these huge sums of money is quite wrong and that, in fact, these very large sums of money reflect the services provided by group dental practices, who naturally see a lot of patients and ran up very large accounts and submitted those to Medicare for payment, but not in any individual capacities. So they represent group practices—many dentists, not single dentists. 


Again, I come back to this issue of the lack of communication between the department of health and Medicare and the dental profession. As I understand it, the dentists have now sought to inform the Australian Dental Association of the compliance requirements of reporting back to the referring practitioner. That is a development in recent times and I think, if anything, it underlines the good faith of the Australian dental profession in seeking to remedy the flaws which existed in the information provided by the health department to the dental profession in the way this scheme was to be run. 


I think it is absolutely outrageous that the government have, in effect, sought to defame the dental profession for committing frauds within this scheme, when in fact the real faults were that there was very little consultation by Medicare with the profession and there was no attempt to hold educational seminars with dentists to explain the detailed reporting requirements of this scheme. For the government to go from there to claiming that dentists who provided services to people who have a very real and, if you like, a sad need for improvements in their dental and oral health were engaged in fraud is quite outrageous. The people affected here are mostly elderly and mostly could not afford dental treatment. They went to the dentist in good faith, had their treatment provided in good faith, and now the dentists who provided that treatment are accused of rorting the system.


The whole record of this Labor government has been to curtail medical services provided to the people of Australia through the Medicare system by restricting the listing of new drugs. Now we find they are trying to shut down a scheme which has provided a very important service to a very vulnerable group of people in our community. If I was on the Labor side of either the House of Representatives or the Senate, I would hold my head in shame. It is quite a disgusting thing from my point of view that the needs of these elderly people who have been provided with dental treatment under this dental services plan should now face the possibility that these services will be withdrawn. 


I hope that the Senate makes sure that this legislation is passed and that the government are made to feel guilty and ashamed of their attempts to restrict the service. It is a very good service. The flaws lie with the government and government departments, as I have said, in failing to communicate the key reporting requirements to referring general practitioners. The dental profession have never had a requirement to do that in the past, and the fault very much lies with the government. Their opposition to this bill is very, very hypocritical.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-08-23,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:35):  I rise to speak on the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No.2]. The bill requires the Minister for Health, in conjunction with such other ministers as may be necessary, to redress past and future inequities that have arisen from the operation of section 10(2) of the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Determination 2007. The bill describes the inequalities imposed on dental practitioners by the operation of the section of the determination and specifies five courses of action which the minister can take to redress those inequities. It also establishes a time frame in which action is to be taken and it requires a report to be tabled in both houses of parliament detailing the actions taken.


I would like to make note that the bill before us ensures there are some accountability measures in both houses of parliament and that things are actually transparent, as opposed to some of the legislation that has been coming before us where we are being asked to make decisions and to formulate what those decisions are going to be about at a later stage, giving ministerial discretion a whole new definition.


That being said, the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, introduced in 2007 by Tony Abbott as Minister for Health, provides $4,250 in Medicare dental benefits over two years for eligible patients with a chronic health condition. Over 17 million services have been provided to almost a million patients since the scheme began. That sounds like a fantastic story, but following special Medicare audits since 2010, 46 dentists have been hit with bills for incorrect Medicare claims totalling $21.5million—over small paperwork problems and issues relating to red tape, not to fraud.


Obviously where fraud is occurring, it is important to have it identified and dealt with appropriately. However, in these instances that does not seem to have been the case. An inquiry into this legislation revealed the depth of feeling across the community and within the profession, with 432 submissions received. Many, many dentists have contacted me and my colleagues right across the country to express their concern at the way this issue has been handled by the Labor government, a government which has been trying to do away with the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme for years, doing its best to undermine the only available option for those people who desperately need dental care but can least afford it.


It is astonishing to think that so many dentists stand accused of having done the wrong thing in relation to their Medicare claims. It seems dentists right across the country were effectively being persecuted as corrupt, as if involved in some vast conspiracy to defraud this scheme. Sixty-six out of 95 of the Medicare audits returned a non-compliant result, which surely suggests a structural or process issue rather than deliberate fraud. We know now that the great, great majority of these dentists were trying to do the right thing. They had made administrative errors as a result of being ill informed about correct process. 


It seems education and information, rather than financial punishment, would be more appropriate actions for Medicare to take in relation to these matters. Explanation and understanding would have made a significant difference all round, and yet education, information, explanation and understanding are concepts that this government struggles with across a range of issues in dealing with subsectors of our communities with which the government is not familiar. I think particularly of the regions and our agricultural industries—and obviously the dental service industry.


These were not problems related to the standard of care or to unethical practice. Even the Professional Services Review Board has indicated that these problems were not related to professional misconduct, saying at the Community Affairs Committee's Senate estimates hearing on 30 May 2012:


We have had no formal indication from Medicare that they are referring a dentist to us for inappropriate practice which goes beyond those, as I understand the sorts of issues that have been in the media lately.


And so these dentists were left under severe stress as Medicare hit them with enormous bills and demanded back payment of their treated—and might I say, very happy—patients, because they had been able to access the key dental services that they required. As usual the dentists involved were just trying to help disadvantaged patients with their dental healthcare needs.


For example, a dentist in my electorate in Victoria contacted me expressing his 'grave concern at the action of the federal government in insisting that Medicare demand full repayment of rebates paid to dentists for paperwork errors, when in fact they provided necessary treatment to patients appropriately referred to them by medical practitioners'. This dentist went on to explain that, with the introduction of the scheme, many dentists had no experience with the bureaucratic demands associated with publicly funded care and said: 'People with chronic diseases often have more dental problems than healthy people. Some publicly funded patients have been waiting years for access to care, and it is not surprising that there has been high use of the Medicare scheme given this pent-up demand.'


This is exactly what we were talking about. This program worked and was addressing a pent-up need within the community of disadvantaged people's dental concerns. Clearly there was an issue around the understanding of the profession of how to document and process these claims. But it was not about fraud. That is just one example. Another dentist got in touch to tell me that: 'The audits have placed myself in the unenviable situation of severe financial distress, and I personally know of some dentists facing bankruptcy or insolvency. I have six employees who will be severely affected by the repayment of such a large sum of money. This is an extreme action on Medicare's part that will take its toll on our young practice and there will be community backlash as the public will suffer as a result of reduced access to quality dental care.' So the outcomes are possibly severe. Dentists have had their reputations ruined, some are facing bankruptcy and professional trust in government funded dental schemes is being destroyed as a result of this process. It was a first step in the right direction when the minister agreed to have the department take a fresh look at the cases of those 46 dentists that were ordered to repay a total of $21.5 million.


But the minister has been awfully quiet on the issue since then. It may be suggested that he only acted when forced to—when this legislation was introduced by my good colleagues Senator Bushby and, in the other chamber, shadow minister the Hon. Peter Dutton. It is designed to redress past and future inequities that have arisen from the operation of subsection 10(2) of the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Determination 2007.


Then, just two days before the coalition's private member's bill was expected to pass the House without government support, Senator Kim Carr tabled a statement in the Community Affairs Committee's estimates hearings that the government would issue a retrospective determination to remedy the case and the issues. The minister said:


This retrospective change to the Determination would bring the compliance arrangements more closely into line with other parts of Medicare, and would allow for a more educative approach to be used by the Department.


I am all for an educative approach to be used by departments; however, the timing and the tabling of this retrospective determination smacks of political expediency. I am not sure why the compliance arrangements were not already in line with other parts of Medicare.


The government's change of heart has come about after years of lobbying by dentists and long-term inaction by the Labor government. They have admitted that they want to scrap the scheme. They have tried and failed to scrap the scheme. They have done everything they can to push poor, hardworking, honest dentists out of the scheme. This is a scheme that has provided much needed treatment to nearly one million people with chronic disease and those who can ill afford the cost of private dental care. One million people—I doubt you could call that anything other than a success, and Labor really could not have done anything more to make it collapse.


Any government funded dental scheme is going to require the participation and cooperation of the dental profession. Labor has eroded the trust of the dental profession through its inexcusable actions on audits. In addition to undermining the existing successful Medicare dental program, Labor has failed to deliver on its own promises on dental health. The coalition is the only side of politics that has delivered a Medicare dental scheme that provides for treatment within the public system. I commend this bill to the Senate and hope that it restores some faith for the dentists in our community who work with those most desperately in need of good oral health.


As we debate this bill brought on by Senator Bushby, it gives me the opportunity to discuss the issues of rural health, with the launch yesterday of the Community Affairs References Committee's report into rural services and medical professions in rural areas. We heard, when we were in Albury for one of the committee hearings, from the dental profession within Victoria. We heard about the concerns they have about young dentists heading out into the regions and setting up practice. The expense involved in the equipment to set up a dentistry practice is significant. Similarly, ensuring that young dentists have experience throughout their training of practice within rural and regional Australia is important. Those of us outside capital cities who love where we live and work still have teeth that need professional and considered care, and those disadvantaged among us need to be able to access a scheme which allows us to access the health care that we need in an appropriate way, and within our own communities. It is an issue that, I am sure, other speakers will address in their contributions, and I look forward to hearing about that.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (10:49):  I rise to address the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No.2] partly because of the importance of the dental health issue and partly because of the importance of the principles that underpin the approach that the current government takes to dealing with individuals versus their ideological aims.


By way of background, this bill was introduced by the coalition as an opportunity to provide dental services funded by Medicare for people who had chronic conditions. Some 966,000 people accessed the service. Some 17 million services were provided to people. Over 12,000 dental practitioners were involved—66 were found to be noncompliant in terms of some paperwork. As my colleagues have indicated their clearly throughout this debate, when that was investigated it became abundantly clear that the fault lay predominantly with a lack of education and awareness for the providers in terms of the kinds of paperwork and the sequence of things that were required. But, in fact, there was no fault with the quality of work or the fact that the services were delivered to people who needed them.


The issue here is not one of quality of service. It is not one of equity of access, because it was the people who had those chronic conditions and needed that support who were able to access it. The issue is about how the government chooses to prioritise its activities. Is it on service delivery? Is it on meeting the need? Or is it on the bureaucracy and the reporting? Is it about ideology?


Let us take ideology first. This current government was implacably opposed to the scheme when it was put forward by the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, when he was the health minister.


They indicated that it was their desire to close the scheme down, and this provided a convenient excuse for them to do so. Commentators who consider the philosophical approach to life indicate that often when respect for the individual is diminished in the interests of the state then we are moving towards a more totalitarian or authoritarian regime. I think it is disappointing in the extreme that individuals have been bankrupted in some cases, and some have had careers and reputations ruined because of an ideological pursuit by this government. It is interesting to note that none of the government's own proposed schemes have ever actually got off the ground and worked. I think we need to put on the record that this whole affair, which has ruined individual lives, has come about because of ideological and political purposes of the government. How do we rectify it?


The purpose of this bill is to make sure that the government puts in place appropriate remedies to recognise and address the inequity. The inequity is that dental practitioners who have legitimately provided a dental service and claimed a Medicare benefit as a payment have been required to repay the benefit when they did not provide a patient, before commencing treatment, with a written plan of their course of treatment and a written quotation or when they have failed to give copies of these documents to the referring doctor. The requirements this government has placed on providers introduces incredible inefficiencies in the system. Somebody comes in, they have got a chronic need, they have been referred by their doctor, the dentist looks at and knows what he needs to do—but what is he required to do? He must write a plan, give the person a quote, send it to the referring doctor, and then he can start treatment. Is it any wonder that around Australia, in capital cities and particularly in rural areas, there are waiting lists for people to access dental health care in the public system? Any approach which prioritises this kind of bureaucracy over the effective delivery of service is not effective use of taxpayers' money. 


The Productivity Commission have looked at the area of private hospitals and have indicated that the private hospital sector provides more effective health care than the public sector, with a 12 per cent lower realised expected mortality rate. Why? Because of increased productivity and effective use of available assets and people—cutting down on the red tape.


I am a great supporter of the fact that we need to have both the private and the public sector. I do not think, in Australia's situation, we should aim to have just one. The two can complement each other. It is interesting to see that, in this very area of dental health, the private sector has actually come to the rescue of the public sector. In Victoria, for example, a company that is based here in Canberra, Aspen Medical, was contracted to go around all the rural schools and complete the dental health checks for children. They did it so efficiently that they had capacity at the end of the program to include other sites. The same company was contracted, in the Northern Sydney and Central Coast regions, by the area health service to look at reducing the waiting lists so that they could actually meet their targets, which they were failing to do. This private company used the same facilities that were owned by the public purse, and they managed to reduce the waiting list by 1,500. Other health services were so impressed that around the state this company was taken on to reduce waiting lists and, by the end of their involvement, they had reduced the waiting lists by 5,500 people. We are not talking about a massive injection of new infrastructure; we are talking about efficient work practice, because the focus is on providing timely and effective service to the people who need it—not on the paperwork and the reporting—and particularly in a model and a method that makes the interaction between the clinician, the patient, the use of the facilities and the time so incredibly inefficient.


That is one of the reasons that the coalition, as we approach the coming election, are being very clear about the fact that we are making very deliberate efforts to reduce the red tape. It does not matter which sector you talk with, whether it is people in the community services sector or people in the aged-care sector, what consistently comes back to us is that people are spending increasing amounts of their time and resources in compliance reporting. When you chase those compliance reports back, quite often you cannot actually put your finger on anyone who uses those for a productive purpose. It appears that processes have been put in place that are absorbing more and more of people's productive time for no useful purpose in terms of good governance. 


Shadow minister Kevin Andrews was interviewed this week by Lyndal Curtis, and there were articles in the paper yesterday, and he talked about the approach the coalition will be taking to try to reduce the paperwork burden on providers in multiple service sectors. We are looking for a cooperative engagement with the states so that we can reduce duplication, which means that in some cases we would be asking the states to trust the Commonwealth to look at compliance.


But in other cases, we would say that we are happy to accept the state's oversight, such that we reduce the burden on the people who are delivering the services. We owe it to the taxpayers of Australia to make sure that their money—their taxes—is not supporting systems that exist for the purpose of the system. We owe it to the taxpayers of Australia to make sure that their money is used for the effective delivery of high-quality services.


So when I look at this dental scheme I see a service that provided support to 966,000 people—some 17 million individual services provided. Then when I see a government wanting to tear it down and prevent that service being provided, because in a few cases the practitioners did not follow a bureaucratic system that required multiple handling of plans and copies to referring GPs before the service could be provided, I think that government should hang its head in shame. We have a duty to the Australian people to be effective in our governance and in our use of the taxpayer dollar and, certainly, this is not an example of where that has occurred.


The government's predisposition to allow ideology to come in front of the benefit of individuals, or even sectors of the community, has been demonstrated again and again. I stand here as a senator for South Australia, the day after we have seen this government refuse to heed the warnings of BHP Billiton, one of Australia's largest companies, working extensively in iron ore and coal exports. It has been warning about the sovereign risk that has been introduced by this government in their ideological pursuit of penalising success and profit, in introducing a carbon tax purely because of their coalition with the Greens in an attempt to retain power and the flow-on effects that that is having for people in the community. Just like there were dentists harmed by their approach to this dental scheme, there are people across the sector in South Australia who are suffering now because of being laid off, or who are having contracts cancelled because of the lack of business confidence demonstrated by BHP Billiton in deciding that they could not build the business case to invest in South Australia.


Just last weekend I was speaking to a small business which employs draughtsmen supporting the construction and development of the mining industry. They were already having to lay off people because of the uncertainty. And now that this decision has come through the ramifications for individual people and their families in South Australia will be significant, and it was driven, in large part, by the ideological pursuits of this government.


Australians, thankfully, do not have that long to wait before they will have a chance to let their voices be known. I would encourage them when they cast their votes not to look at what is said but to look at what has been done, and to look to a side of politics—in this case, the coalition—which in the case of dental care actually put a plan in place. And it worked; it provided good services to many people. But it was cut down by this government, which has not been able to replace it with anything that has actually worked.


As the people of Australia make their choice, they need to look at the collapse in business confidence that has affected BHP Billiton and they need to look in South Australia at that other pillar of our economy, the defence industry, which has been curtailed, with many businesses on the brink of bankruptcy. In fact, there are some in Australia who have already closed their doors because of deferred and cancelled projects. They have made investments in infrastructure to support our national security endeavours, just to have the cash flow essentially cut off by deferred or delayed defence projects.


There are many reasons—this dental situation being just one of them—why the Australian people should hold this government to account. I am pleased to support this bill put forward by my colleague Senator Bushby, which seeks to address the inequities and unfairness that has been levied against dentists in our country—the very people who either side of politics will need to engage with if we are to build a dental system, both public and private, that will provide for our community into the future.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2]</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:04):  I rise to support the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2], and I congratulate Senator Bushby for his generosity on behalf of the Australian people to help the Labor government out yet again from a hole that it has dug for itself.


Originally, the legislation for the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was introduced by the coalition while in government by none other than the then very successful health minister—and probably last successful health minister we have had in this country—and that was Mr Tony Abbott. But what we have seen, as usual, is an effort by the Labor government to try and dismantle a scheme that was enormously successful, that was cost-effective for the Australian community and, amazingly enough, was not concentrated on bureaucrats and bureaucracy. It was actually concentrated on taxpayers with dental problems. But, needless to say, the efforts made by the Labor government to try and dismantle it—because it was ideologically driven, because it had been introduced by Mr Abbott—have come back to haunt them, and they have been unable to actually dismantle it.


That is why I congratulate Senator Bushby, because in this legislation he genuinely is helping the government out of a problem that they cannot get themselves out of. Needless to say, we see an analogy for this in the asylum seeker debacle that we see today, where the Labor government of today inherited a perfectly good solution to what had been a problem and, led by the now Prime Minister, they dismantled it only to find some years later that they have to go back and reinstitute what was a successful policy position. As others have said, we have a circumstance here where under this Medicare chronic disease dental scheme, initiated by then Health Minister Abbott, we had 17 million services delivered to one million people since 2007. Needless to say, it has been tremendously successful.


Now, I applaud the government for the move to want to audit public expenditure; only I wish that they would audit themselves when they misspend public moneys, such as on pink batts, school halls and failed green schemes. But, nevertheless, like everybody in the chamber knows, it is the role of the parliament to ensure that funds are wisely spent, and to root out—excuse the pun in terms of dentistry!—where there is rorting, where there is corruption and where there is failure.


But where there has not been rorting or corruption, there is not a role for the audit process to vilify dentists, as of course has happened in this circumstance. What has failed is the commonsense approach. What we have seen is the effort of using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut and the failure to ask: did in fact the peanut, or those represented by it, fail in the first place? As Senator Bushby has eloquently said in his contribution to this debate, 'Therein lies the problem.'


I refer to correspondence and communication from a colleague of mine in Fremantle in Western Australia, a very senior member of the dentistry profession, a very, very credible man of great integrity. When I asked him about this he said, 'The disappointment, Chris, was that the government made no attempt to consult with the dental profession on this whole question.' This is not a man given to rorting or to corruption. He simply made the point that as a profession 'we have not interacted with the Medicare system; we did not understand or know the rules of the Medicare system'. He said the disappointment now that this confusion has been created is that some of the very people who have been treated successfully under the scheme introduced by the coalition are now turning their backs on the chronic dental work that they so badly need. 


He mentioned cases to me, and I am going to refer to a second and even more distressing case in a minute where a GP referred a patient to the dentist and the dentist failed to write back in time to the GP, the very person who referred the patient. This is a circumstance in which very often people are disadvantaged. Fremantle is an example and there are many other areas around urban and rural and regional Australia where low socio-economic families or individuals, young people living on their own, and Aboriginal people suffer disadvantaged. As my colleague said to me, 'Chris, not only is it difficult to get these people into the dental service to start addressing some of the chronic dental problems they have, the great difficulty is in being able to predict the amount of work required.' 


This brings me to the second point: giving some sort of close indication, which you are then bound to, of what the costs of the treatment are going to be before you start the treatment. Any of us who have a clinical background would know—and particularly anyone from the dentistry profession where there is such an underservicing in this country and so many people who have not visited a dentist for a long time—it would be very, very difficult for a dentist to be able to predict what sort of work is required.


Can it be audited? Is there a process in which an independent auditor or scrutineer could go back afterwards and see whether or not they think that dentist has rorted the scheme, has actually instituted treatments that the patient never needed? Of course there is a process, and of course it can happen—it happens every day of the week. It does not need a whopping bureaucracy from Canberra to determine it. My colleague and friend Dr Colgan said, 'Chris, get the system right and then worry about the money. But let us go back to the centrality of who this is all about and what the system is in place for. It is for those people who have fallen through the gaps in the dental treatment process.'


Let me give you an indication of the stupidity of this legislation as it was attempted to be introduced by the Labor government, and the consequences of this audit process. This is an actual case. A medical specialist referred a patient to a dental specialist, a periodontal surgeon. This particular person had a history of a renal transplant, was using immunosuppressive medications and had a very, very severe necrotising ulcerative gingivitis—and if Senator Farrell would like me to repeat that so that he can get it down and understand it, I will do so. In other words, this was an acute emergency—should I refer this to Minister Kim Carr—referred by the doctor. What do you think that dentist did? Heavens above, what they actually did was commence emergency treatment of this patient, a highly acute patient, a renal transplant patient, one who was on immunosuppressive medication, now presented by the doctor because of the urgency of the case.


But this dental specialist regrettably fell foul of the Labor-led audit process. Why? There are two reasons. Firstly, they did not seek in writing the permission of the doctor who had referred the case as an emergency. They failed to write to the doctor in the first place to say, 'I am about to treat this patient—would you like me to?' And, secondly, with this patient in tremendous distress, they failed to give some indication of what the cost might be. So foolishly, one would think, they actually went ahead with the treatment, only to find themselves foul of the system and being vilified—this being a highly-credentialed dental specialist in the city of Perth.


What do you think they did? The practice manager wrote to the authorities outlining the circumstances and asking whether they could review it and meet the payment. That was a letter from the practice manager of the dental specialist. Lo and behold, there was a second letter, on this occasion from the referring doctor, an associate professor, writing to support the application because of the treatment given to this gentleman with necrotising ulcerative gingivitis. Where do you think it all went? It was refused because of the so-called failure of the bureaucratic process, which was doing nothing to help the patient who is surely the most important person in this triangle. So what was the endgame? The person was not paid. The dental specialist then was caused to reduce the account enormously so that they could at least get some of their cost back. This is the actual effect when you go and speak to people rather than trying to adopt a bureaucratic process or procedure.


What it does, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you and I well know, is that it destroys confidence from practitioners back to government back to the bureaucracy. And when that happens, what would be the next reaction by that dental specialist should they have a patient referred to them by that doctor in an emergency circumstance? How willing would they be to actually pick up their instruments, place the patient in their care and start treatment because they have not gone through these Sir Humphrey Appleby-like bureaucratic processes? So in May this year, a couple of days before this private senator's bill was to go through the house without government support, we had Senator Kim Carr, the minister, tabling a statement in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee estimates hearings that the government would issue a retrospective determination to remedy the issues, some of which I have explained here this morning and some of which of course go to  Senator Bushby's recommendations in the first place.


In her contribution Senator McKenzie spoke of dental services in rural Australia. I heard Senator McLucas retort to a comment made by Senator Boyce that there was no relationship between this discussion today and rural and regional Australia. Well, let me tell Senator McLucas—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—it goes straight to dental services in rural and regional Australia. It is hard enough now to get dentists to go to and stay in country towns without having this sort of threat of vilification in a circumstance where they may find themselves in default under the Medicare process. But what about patients under these circumstances? In the absence of a dentist in a country town, not only do we have the ultimate cost of dental services, but very often we have the cost of travel to get to the dentist and, if there is need for treatment over a couple of days, there are the overnight accommodation costs, often not just for the patient but for their carer or the person supporting them. And who are those most at risk in this circumstance, Mr Acting Deputy President? You guessed it: low socioeconomic people, singles very often, and members of our Aboriginal communities. It is vitally important that we have that level of confidence between government, the medical and dental associations and individual practitioners, and this sort of activity does nothing to encourage that level of confidence.


In Senate estimates this year I asked the Director of the Professional Services Review what interaction, if any, he had had with cases referred to him by Medicare in the circumstance of possible corruption or rorting. I will quote the words he said to me in estimates:


As I understand the current stories in the media around dentistry, and I am simply going on what I read in the media, I understand they are more to do with strict auditing processes, auditing of paperwork et cetera. That is not the sort of matter that comes to PSR. But we have found no formal notification from Medicare, although there have been some suggestions in the future there may be cases later this year—


So we have that threat hanging over their heads. The quote goes on:


But we have had no formal indication from Medicare that they are referring a dentist to us for inappropriate practice which goes beyond, as I understand it, the sort of issues that have been in the media lately. As I said, they are more to do with auditing. Inappropriate practice in terms of the actual professional decisions made by a dentist, which would be the type of matter that would be referred to PSR—we have not had any referrals and no formal notification.


I was very much a participant in a Professional Services Review Scheme review last year by a committee which I recall was chaired by Senator Siewert. We looked in great detail at the involvement of the PSR, its relationship with Medicare and its examination of doctors who, it was claimed, may have been rorting the system. So PSR very much is an organisation that would be central to this circumstance, should there be the level of corruption that is claimed. This has unfairly vilified the dental profession and, of course, it has been in many instances the first time that dentists have ever interacted with the Medicare process. How much better would it have been to have spent some education money and to have sat down with the associations to get information out to the dentists to say that these are the circumstances, but that there must be occasions—such as the emergency I spoke about with the necrotising ulcerative gingivitis—where a dentist can go ahead with emergency treatment and be able to fill in the innumerable bits of paper afterwards.


What we have seen from the Labor government, in its attempts to replace the Abbott initiative, has failed. The Commonwealth Dental Health Program introduced in 2008 failed, as it would indeed have to do because it delivered so little that it was scrapped in the 2012 budget. We saw the Teen Dental Plan, which one hoped might have been successful, but regrettably less than a third of children who could have accessed this service have done so. I see children in the public area here today and I can only recommend to them that prevention is always better than cure. Whilst many of us do not like attending the dentist, I do encourage them to get into the habit—which I myself have not done—of making sure that they have regular dental check-ups. Not only is the cost of prevention a lot less to your parents than treatment afterwards, it is also a lot less painful.


I come to the recommendations made by Senator Bushby in his contribution. Not only is his draft legislation spot on the money, but he went as far as to help the Labor government, because they need all the help they can get, with the options that they might take to try and redress the failure they have visited upon the dental profession and the Australian people. The first recommendation is that they should enact amendments, as laid out in schedule 1, which relate to quotations not being provided prior to treatment—and I will not labour that anymore because I have already given a very good example of why those amendments are necessary. 


A second option is for the government to waive its right to repayment under the Medicare scheme to try to build confidence again with the dental profession. His third suggestion, if the first two cannot be enacted, is to make act-of-grace payments to redress the inequality that has been visited upon them or alternatively to provide for the inequity to be addressed through the income tax system—although I hope that would not happen, simply because many dentists, as Senator McKenzie has told us, are now facing financial ruin—or to take some other action which might redress it.


I am pleased to speak to this bill. I support it strongly, and I particularly look forward to the support of the Greens through Senator Di Natale, because we are fortunate now to have in Senator Di Natale a medical practitioner who has had a lot of involvement in rural, remote and Indigenous communities and who is well and truly across issues associated with dental health and the need for it to be improved in Australian communities, particularly those in which he has worked. I have heard him speak in this chamber about dental services, and I look forward to his strong support of this legislation to right a wrong, to put dentists back where they have always been—and that is at a level of high confidence in the community.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:23):  Over the past year the Greens—and, in particular, Senator Di Natale—have been putting a lot of effort into reforming the nation's dental health services. We have made that one of our top priorities. In fact, as the former health spokesperson for the Greens, before being joined by my colleagues in the Senate, I worked very extensively on dental health as well. Through this process we have been fortunate to get to know many hardworking people in the dental profession.


Senator Di Natale, shortly after taking his seat in the Senate, was approached by some dental practitioners who were being audited for services provided through the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. The more he learned about this situation and the more dentists he talked to and met who were expressing similar concerns and having similar issues, the more he became convinced that something was seriously wrong—as many other people have been articulating in this chamber.


The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was the first step for most dentists into Medicare. What became apparent, as Senator Di Natale spoke to more dental practitioners and those who had taken part in the scheme, was that the entry into Medicare had not been managed well—and I think that has been very well highlighted in this debate. While the rest of the medical profession are, by and large, now of course very familiar with Medicare, this was not true for dentists and those involved in the dental profession. In those circumstances, the department had a responsibility—and we believe an ongoing responsibility—to make sure that these practitioners were properly educated. Over time we have been increasingly convinced that this was not done at all.


As a result, many dentists who, in good faith, took part in the scheme to ensure delivery of these services to eligible patients who, we must point out, were in urgent need of dental support and care—many of whom had not received it for many years, if in fact at all—have fallen foul of the administrative arrangements for the scheme. In subsequent audits, many of these well-intentioned practitioners were required to repay the entire amount of the benefit they received from Medicare, despite having already provided critical treatment to eligible patients and, in many cases, having spent considerable amounts of money in delivering these services and treatments. This has resulted in enormous stress and hardship for dentists and has in fact threatened the viability of otherwise thriving practices providing very necessary treatment to the community.


We have no sympathy for any medical practitioner who acts unethically and seeks to defraud the public—and I want to make that very clear. It is clear, however, that the vast majority of dental practitioners affected by these audits do not fall into this category. We have made repeated representations to government on behalf of the affected dentists, and we are pleased that we have finally seen some major progress on this front. During Senate estimates on 29 May this year, the Minister for Human Services, Senator Kim Carr, made the following statement:


It is our view that we need a retrospective change to the dental services determination within the near future that creates greater flexibility about the compliance arrangements, while still protecting important principles of public policy. This retrospective change to the determination would bring the compliance arrangements more closely into line with other parts of Medicare and would allow for a more educative approach to be used by the department.


This means that the government are seeking to change the regulation that will enable them to revisit all the audits and change the determinations made in those cases where a significant injustice has been done. The Greens will support this through the parliament and ensure that all dentists who have delivered genuine services are assisted with education rather than the recovery of benefits paid for services that have already been delivered.


The bill that we are debating now, the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2], which the coalition has brought into the parliament, would compel the minister to take action on this issue. Although we strongly support the intent of the bill, there are concerns that the bill is structured in a way that would not achieve its aims. In light of the minister's announcement and as a show of good faith we have been trying to talk to the government on their proposed solution. We understand that this is very close to a resolution and continue to believe that the government are acting in good faith on this issue. At the moment we are in the position where we believe that it is better to support the government in their ongoing resolution of this problem as we believe that they are very close to its resolution and we are in fact taking in good faith the government's commitment that they are very close to a resolution. If however they do not deliver this in the very near future, we believe that we will need to either revisit this bill with amendments so that it is structured correctly or in fact support the introduction of a new bill. This is putting the onus back on the government to resolve this issue in the very near future.


As we have always said, the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme is far from perfect.


However, we have voted in the past with the coalition to not support the destruction of this scheme and for the retention of this scheme because this has been the only scheme that has delivered dental services to the most vulnerable people in our community and has genuinely delivered change to people suffering from chronic disease. This is in some cases the first time these people have been able to access dental treatment. So we have very strongly demonstrated our commitment to this dental scheme and the support of the most vulnerable people in our community.


We have never said that this scheme is perfect. There have been some concerns with it. We remain committed to reform of dental care for Australians because, while this scheme was a step in the right direction, it has not gone to the full extent of the reform that is needed. We strongly believe that no scheme will succeed unless the dental profession is properly consulted, fully engaged and strongly supportive of any new scheme. Finding a way to fix this problem with Medicare and the CDDS is critical to maintaining a good relationship with the dental health profession. Although this cannot make up for the terrible months of stress and uncertainty that those in the dental profession and dentists who have been subject to these audit processes have been through, we hope that the move that the government has underway will resolve the issue and allow dentists to get back to what they do best, which is providing the necessary treatment to our community. We will not be supporting the bill. That is on the understanding—and I am very strongly eyeballing the government—that the government is in the process of resolving this most stressful situation for our dentists.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:31):  I am disappointed to hear that the Greens will not be supporting the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2]. I do acknowledge that in the past the Greens have been on our side, which is the correct side when it comes to remedying some of the deficiencies in dental health servicing. It seems that the Greens support for the Labor-Greens alliance has overridden what I previously understood was the strong support of the Greens for this program, acknowledging that it is not perfect. It was the Greens who helped us implement this and I am very disappointed that political considerations by the Greens have now interfered and have caused them to indicate they will not be voting with us.


It seems that the reason the Labor Party are opposed to this is purely the fact that it was a great scheme introduced by Tony Abbott and heaven forbid that the Labor Party should ever agree with anything that Tony Abbott should do. It was good to see the Labor Party backing down humiliatingly and agreeing with Tony Abbott on offshore processing. I just wish they would do that in relation to this bill before the chamber.


There are a number of others from our side who want to speak on this bill but we are very keen to bring this debate to a close so we can get a vote. I know Senator Bushby, who introduced the bill, has some comments he wants to make. So regrettably my comments will be very brief. I did want to refer to the contribution made by my fellow Queenslander, Senator Jan McLucas from the Labor Party. There was one thing in Senator McLucas's speech that I agreed with. That was when she praised the James Cook University dental school in Cairns on the great work it is doing in providing the support and tuition for those who will go out and help.


Senator McLucas talked about fraud amongst the dentistry profession. The coalition have made it very clear that there have been perhaps a couple of genuine cases but, as Senator Back has pointed out, there have been many cases where honest, god-fearing dentists who do a great job and make a great contribution towards their society have been penalised by an over-zealous Medicare police unit for things which—no matter which way you look at them—were simply minor omissions as to the red tape that Medicare imposes. Compare that with, for example, the four years that it took Fair Work Australia to investigate the member for Dobell. In that case, this government ensured that the investigation and prosecutions went on for years. Compare the alleged offences, the things that Fair Work Australia eventually found Mr Thomson had done, with some of the things that dentists have done—for example, the incident Senator Back raised. If Mr Thomson had been prosecuted with the same enthusiasm and vehemence as these dentists who have made some error in the clerical work, there would have been an election by now because Mr Thomson would have been out on his ear and a by-election would have meant that a full election was needed.


The duplicity of the Labor Party lies in how they treat prosecutions of almost innocent dentists on the one hand and how they deal with Mr Thomson' case on the other hand. Senator McLucas was accusing the dental profession of fraud. There were a couple of incidents but, if you go on that principle, do you say that Mr Thomson being a Labor Party MP has allegedly—according to Fair Work Australia—defrauded the country, defrauded his union? Does that mean that we should not allow into parliament any Labor Party parliamentarian who ever worked for a union? It is the same sort of convoluted logic that you get from this government. You talk about fraud. A dentist does not fill in the form properly and he is in real trouble with the authorities.


Ms Gillard gets up before Australians, promises to every Australian, 'You vote for me, you make me Prime Minister, and I will not bring in a carbon tax'. And you talk about fraud? What even the worst of the dentists have done cannot compare with that sort of fraudulent act. Again, last night Ms Gillard, in addressing the AMA, deliberately told untruths about breast screening and Queensland. Is that a worse offence than some dentist who does not fill in the forms correctly? The duplicity of the Labor Party in its approach to administration knows no bounds.


Mr Deputy President, I did have a lot of things I wanted to say on this bill, but unfortunately time has beaten me. I say on the record that I concur with all of the remarks made by colleagues on this side of the chamber, and I urge the chamber to support Senator Bushby's bill.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:38):  I start first by thanking senators on both sides of the chamber for their contributions to the debate on the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2], but I would like to express my disappointment at the contributions and the approach taken by both the government and the Greens on this matter. From the government's perspective, the minister himself has acknowledged that the treatment of some of the dentists involved under this scheme was unfair, and he has indicated as far back as during May estimates that he would be taking action to redress that. So there was a clear acknowledgement that there were problems, there were issues.


Presented today is a clear and easy way of fixing that. The fact that it has taken at least three months to try to address it in the way the minister is trying to do it, with still no resolution, no indication at all about how or what is going to occur, shows that the government is having some challenges in the approach it is taking to fix this. And yet here before us today we have the bill which will fix it. It will address the injustice that dentists across Australia have faced as a result of the appalling approach the government has taken to dealing with the minor transgressions that occurred in their administrative approach to the scheme.


From the Greens' perspective—Senator Di Natale has been a champion for these dentists. Here we have today an opportunity for the Greens to support a resolution that dentists around the country require urgently. There are dentists around the country who have faced issues that have led to them thinking about committing suicide. There are dentists around the country who have debts hanging over their heads, who are looking at bankruptcy, who are waiting for a resolution. They cannot sit around and wait for the government. As Senator Siewert has just said, they cannot take on faith that the government is going to do the right thing, because as of now the government has done absolutely nothing other than make a short statement through the medium of estimates. I am particularly disappointed that those on the other side of the chamber have used this debate as an opportunity to further perpetuate misinformation in relation to the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. They have failed to acknowledge the essence of what this bill seeks to achieve, and instead hijacked the debate to suit their own political agenda.


I introduced this bill into the Senate to redress the injustice that the government has inflicted upon the nation's dental health professionals. When I introduced this bill, I did so because I wanted the parliament to examine the wrongdoings perpetrated by this government against the many dentists in this country who have acted in good faith and provided dental services to Australians under the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. I did not introduce this bill seeking a debate on the pros or the cons of that scheme. Nor did I introduce this bill seeking a debate on who in this parliament has the best dental scheme. This is an issue that is now well beyond grubby political point-scoring, and now is not the time for one-upmanship. Now is the time to address this issue and reach a conclusive solution, and the opportunity is here today if the Greens join with us to make that happen.


In fact, the intentions of this bill are not entirely removed from Minister Kim Carr's own announcement in May that retrospective change to the legislation is required to address the issues in relation to the audit processes. But Labor clearly does not want to take this opportunity to redress their own wrongdoings against Australian dentists who have been penalised for unwitting mistakes that they have made when working under this program. That is blatantly obvious from Labor's total inaction, as I mentioned, since Minister Kim Carr's announcement in May.


Instead, Labor's senators have used the time for this debate to stand up in this chamber to try to trash the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and shamelessly promote their own dental policy. In her speech in this debate last sittings, Senator Urquhart went into great detail to outline the measures this government is planning to revolutionise publicly funded dental care, which would all be well and good if it were actually relevant to the issue we are here to discuss today—that is, their own incompetence and mismanagement of the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It is an issue that, if this government refuses to face up to it, will prove prohibitive to them implementing any further public dental schemes in the future.


The dental profession is rightly irate with this government over the handling of this scheme. Even Senator Moore conceded in her speech that dentists have withdrawn from practising under the scheme as a result of the audit process. If the Labor Party do not actively seek to engage with dentists now to address the profession's concerns and implement a legislative solution to this problem, they will struggle to find in future any dentist who will be willing to participate in any further government initiatives in this area.


But instead, during debate in the last sitting period, Labor senators spoke on anything but their own mismanagement of the scheme. Senator Bilyk said:


If we could free up the money for this flawed scheme, we could provide investment in dental services where it is really needed, because we all know that it is difficult for Australians in rural and remote areas to access dental services.


She went on to say that it was 'a scheme which is not targeted or means tested and which has not serviced Australians in need'.


This is not true. I urge Labor senators to check their facts. This scheme has been accessed by close to one million Australians. And as Senator Di Natale informed the chamber when he spoke on this bill, 80 per cent of those one million patients are concession cardholders. This does not really stack up with Labor's claims that the scheme is being used by millionaires. In fact, many patients of the scheme, on hearing of this government's desperate attempt to claw back from dentists moneys under this scheme, wrote to and phoned their dentists out of concern. I have had patients of the scheme phoning my office to tell me how upset they are by the way that their dentist has been treated. And patients of the scheme even went as far as making submissions to the Senate inquiry, writing in to tell the committee how much of the dental care they received under the scheme assisted in improving their overall health and lifestyle. Senator Bilyk and her colleagues are wrong; the scheme is assisting Australians in need and Australians in regional and rural areas.


Tasmanian dentist Dr Wilma Johnson was practising under the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme in the Huon Valley region, a rural area just over 30 kilometres from Senator Bilyk's own electorate office. Dr Johnson was prepared to work in a rural area that is notoriously difficult to staff. She showed me before and after photos of some of the work she has conducted, and I can assure Senator Bilyk that her patients, Senator Bilyk's constituents, were definitely in need of the dental services she provided for them under the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, dental services that undoubtedly contributed to the patients' greater overall health and less dependence on the public health system as a result, and services that the patients themselves would not have been able to fund. I am surprised that Senator Bilyk did not know this already and that she made those ill-informed statements in her speech last sittings, especially as that particular example is from her own constituency, less than a one-hour drive from her electorate office.


What has Dr Wilma Johnson received for her trouble and hard work? A bill from the Commonwealth in excess of $24,000—just because she failed to fill in a form prior to conducting the treatment. The treatment provided was necessary and completed to a high standard. The patients are happy, they received the services and, in fact, some of Dr Johnson's patients called my office to tell me so. None of her patients were financially disadvantaged as a result of their treatment. Indeed, in some instances, Dr Johnson provided additional work on a pro bono basis. So why is it that this government has been so relentless in pursuing Dr Johnson for over $24,000, a figure that represents more than three times her earnings as a part-time employee in a rural Tasmanian dental practice? There were hundreds of other cases just like this all over the country, and on each occasion the timing of the completion of paperwork has had no impact on patient care or financial outcomes. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the dentists who were found non-compliant in the audit process have provided legitimate care to patients in need entirely in accordance with the terms of the scheme but for minor and incidental requirements.


Presented today is a bill which gives this place an opportunity to redress those injustices, an opportunity to ensure that dentists like Dr Wilma Johnson and hundreds of dentists in a similar position, right across Australia, can have the concern, the worry and the imposition that has been placed upon them by unfair bills to claw back the money paid for services that they did deliver. We are not talking here about cases of people who are defrauding the Commonwealth. We are talking about cases where they would legitimately be entitled to claim these funds if only they had dotted the 'i' or crossed the 't' properly for services that they actually did deliver. It is not a case of fraud; it is a case of minor administrative mistakes. As a result, these people are suffering. We have the opportunity today to redress that injustice and I urge the Senate to support the bill.

  The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (09:31):  I am delighted to have this chance to continue my remarks on the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2], which has been brought to this chamber by Senator Bushby.


The issue that we are looking at here really is one of trying to maintain what has been a very good and privately based service in Australia. At a recent inquiry the Australian Dental Association was forced to make the point that they hope that private practice will continue to be a centrepiece of the dental offers made to Australians all over Australia, but particularly in rural areas. There have been a number of instances of this government trying to change the way that dental services are offered, along with others, and the Australian Dental Association has made the point that it believes that clinical independence is a very vital part of the way that dentistry is practised in this country.


The Australian Dental Association has also slammed the way the government has gone about establishing Medicare Locals. It is a bit startling to find that dentistry has generally been completely excluded from the Medicare Locals model. Eighty-five per cent of the dental services provided in Australia are provided by the private sector, and without those private sector dentists there would be virtually no dental services in rural and regional Australia in particular.


The practitioners of dentistry need to be fully consulted and to become part of any change in dental care delivery, otherwise there is a very real risk that rural and regional areas will lose the dental care that they already have. I think it is worth noting that a survey of members by the Australian Dental Association showed that dentists in rural and regional areas offer a higher mean number of services at a discounted rate compared to metropolitan-based services. In the country—rural and regional areas—39 per cent of services are discounted on average, compared to nine per cent in cities and urban areas.


Rural and regional dentists also offer a higher mean number of free consultations compared to their metropolitan counterparts. I must add that I have yet to come across a free dental consultation, but apparently they do exist. And rural and regional dental practitioners offer an average of 63 per cent free consultations compared to 50 per cent in urban areas. These results suggest that, in spite of the additional challenges that dentists face in rural and regional dental practice, dentist practitioners in these areas strive to provide a quality service at a reasonable rate, in the interests of their patients.


But, of course, there continues to be a problem with dental services in the country, and nothing that this government is doing is likely to improve that. There has been a large increase in the supply of dental professionals recently, with the opening of three new schools in 2007, and the number of new dentists entering the workforce, including new graduates and overseas trained dentists, will be double the number of new entrants that there were in 2006.


There was an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report released recently on dentists, specialists and allied practitioners in Australia which, unfortunately, uses 2006 labour force data—simply because that is the most recent that we have. It indicates that there were 12,212 dentists registered in Australia in 2006. That was a 21 per cent increase on the number of registered dentists compared to 1996, and during the coming decade about 250 new dentists will enter the workforce each year.


Based on these figures, the Dental Board of Australia, in May 2011, estimates that there are now 13,750 dentists with just over 300 new dentists a year coming into our workforce since 2006. Along with the large number of new doctors that will come into the system over the next decade, there will also be a large number of new dentists and other dental professionals, I should point out, and the number of allied dental service practitioners will also increase at a substantial rate.


Despite this, the odds of the figures in rural and regional areas improving is not high given the government's current policies in this area. The number of practising dental practitioners per 100,000 of population ranges from 59.5 in major  cities down to 17.9 in remote and very remote areas. How we go about improving those numbers is something that was the subject of an inquiry by the Community Affairs Committee, and it is also something this government needs to focus on. We do not need to be still saying in years to come that the supply of dentists has been found to decrease dramatically with remoteness, and that the allied health workforce is found to be largely based within the major cities, as the DOHA report titled Audit of the health workforce in rural and regional Australia found in 2008. We need to work on policies to improve this, and might I suggest to the government that a good place to start is the inclusion of dental services and dental practitioners in the people who are consulted about the structure of Medicare Locals. The idea of a needs-based locally-developed medical and health provision is an excellent start, if it works—and of course the 'if it works' is in very large letters when you look at the way this government has gone about it.


The issue that the Australian Dental Association raises is:


Medicare Locals in rural/regional Australia to date has been implemented hastily and has excluded dentistry which will affect dental care delivery for Australians in these areas.


It should go without saying that dentistry must be adequately included in the development of primary healthcare responses to ensure that activities such as dental health promotion and oral disease prevention are undertaken in what, in many cases, are more vulnerable communities. The Australian Dental Association makes the point that establishing a dental surgery is an expensive exercise, considering the equipment that is needed, so establishing it in a small town is a very problematic approach unless there are (a) incentives for people to do so and, (b) a sense that the care they are offering has been integrated into a well-structured health service provision for the local community. No dentist in private practice is going to set up in an area where they know they will not be fully occupied servicing customers. 


I commend Senator Bushby for this bill. It seeks to correct some of the attempts of the government to undermine private practice for dentists in Australia and it seeks to ensure that the sorts of programs that have been so extraordinarily successful—for instance, the chronic disease prevention program involving dentistry that was established by the Howard-Costello government—will be maintained.


The Australian Dental Association points out that a number of factors limit the supply of dental practitioners in rural and regional areas. As I said, not only are there financial constraints such as the very high capital cost, but also the lack of resources and professional support coupled with the lack of social and local infrastructure in the community. Not only do we need to attract dental practitioners to rural and regional areas but we also need to find methods of ensuring that they stay in those rural and regional areas. This involves not just looking after the financial needs of practitioners, but also fostering and supporting their professional, social and community needs. Just as we have had concerns raised during the recent Community Affairs Committee inquiry in terms of the support needed for younger doctors and other health professionals moving into rural and regional areas, the same issue arises of course for dentists and allied dental professionals. It is not going to happen if we do not support it and foster it.


The Australian Dental Association did a survey of its members in September 2011 that found that 17 per cent of the metropolitan-based members would be willing to consider relocating to rural or regional areas to practise dentistry. If this were to occur, if that whole 17 per cent were to move, we would in fact end up with an oversupply of dental professionals in the rural and regional areas. But there are a number caveats on this. The ADA members survey said that there were things that would encourage dentists to move to rural practice. For example, 44 per cent of members said that the quiet rural lifestyle would encourage them to move to rural practice; 23 per cent said the demand for services, the need—thought to be unmet—for services; and 21 per cent believed there were greater employment opportunities for rural and regional dental practice.


But these members also identified what they needed to stay in the area. Some of the very large concerns expressed by the 17 per cent who would consider moving were that there would be social and community issues and professional issues.


The social and community issues that were identified by members of the Australian Dental Association were a lack of access to quality secondary schooling, spouse or partner's unhappiness in moving to a rural setting, the potential lack of employment opportunities for partners, the lack of community resources and what was perceived as a lack of 'cultural fit' with the local community. Professionally, these dentists' concerns were a lack of financial incentive to compensate for a more isolated lifestyle, heavy workload and high community expectations, professional isolation—a very, very important point—and inability to access continuing education. They referred also to the lack of access to general anaesthetic facilities in hospitals, a lack of mentoring for recent graduates and more inexperienced operators, a lack of access to specialist services and support, and—perhaps one of the most important issues for families of an overworked dentist in a rural area—a lack of leave cover for holidays. The lack of access to further education was one of the greatest areas of concern. There have been a number of suggestions made by the Australian Dental Association with regard to this. Certainly the government's view is not going to succeed. Senator Bushby's bill will assist.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2012-08-23,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (09:46):  I am pleased to join the debate on this private senator's bill, the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2]. It is a bill which I think is flawed and poorly focused, a bill that does nothing to redress some of the failings we do have in our dental services system in this country that Senator Boyce has just identified. But the problems that Senator Boyce has referred to will not be fixed or even attended to by the passage of this bill through the parliament, and I certainly hope that does not occur.


This bill is not about providing better dental services to the thousands of people who need them, and let's just be clear about who are the needy when it comes to dental services in this country. We have identified—everyone knows this; it is not new information—that the people who are most in need of dental services are those who are on low incomes and those who live in regional, rural and remote areas. That is where we should be targeting our effort when it comes to dental services. This bill does not do that in any way, shape or form. In my view, this bill is a political stunt, but taking the opportunity to put on a little stunt with this bill actually proves what a poorly designed scheme the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme is.


The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme is deeply flawed. Firstly, it is not means tested. Let's have a look at who has the largest take-up of the CDDS. It is people on higher incomes. That means that people on very high incomes can get up to $4,250 of free dental care. The scheme is not targeted, so that means those people highest in need, those on low incomes and those who live in regional, rural and remote areas, are not targeted through this program—and they are not taking up the scheme at the rate that their dental health would clearly indicate that they should. Patients can get cosmetic work done rather than the basic work that we know our community really needs, which is attendance at a dentist so that proper cleaning is done, particularly for young children, on a regular basis and work can be done when the first caries are identified. Instead, a lot of the money that this scheme has expended is at the cosmetic end, on crowns and caps that, whilst important, are often less important than what should be targeted.


We know that there have been more than a thousand complaints lodged about the CDDS. Misuse of the scheme includes ordering dentures that do not fit, unnecessary crowns—and there is a question there that should be investigated—and charging the full $4,250 without completing the work. Let us go to some of the examples that we have seen of misuse of the scheme.


In one case a dentist has been ordered to repay more than $700,000. In an initial self-assessment sample of 20 patients, the dentist admitted billing for services that were never provided. In my view, and I am not a lawyer, that sounds a lot like fraud. After a subsequent audit began, the dentist admitted incorrectly billing patients 293 times. This is not just an oversight or a mistake; this is systematic. The dentist also said she had no record of 112 services provided to patients that she billed to Medicare. After the audit began, the dentist voluntarily paid back $25,000 for instances where she agreed services had not been provided to the patient, but I think there is a lot more in that story. It just goes to show the way that some dentists, and I really do underline the word 'some', thought that this was a bucket of money that they could simply delve into. This reflects badly on the profession. I must say it is only a small number, but we have to tidy them up.


In another case, Medicare visited a dentist in 2009 who was providing no treatment plans, no quotes to patients and no copies of treatment plans to referring general practitioners. Clearly, that was part of what was expected under the plan. On a return visit in 2010, Medicare found that the dentist had not rectified those issues. In total, the dentist had claimed $1.9 million that was potentially noncompliant with the scheme.


In another case, an audit of the dentist found that he had incorrectly claimed $1.8 million. These are extraordinary figures. During the audit it was revealed that the dentist repeatedly failed to inform the referring GPs of the course of treatment he intended to carry out on their patients. The dental practitioner said this was because he did not use computers—not an excuse in my view. The final case is of a dentist who was reported to be going to aged care facilities to provide cosmetic dental work to aged care residents with dementia without the appropriate permission. I do hope that has been referred to the appropriate medical boards.


This is a scheme which does not work. It is untargeted, it is unfocused and it allows that small number of dentists who want to rort the system to do so. We have been able to identify a number through the audit and we will be able to fix those up. We know that anyone claiming funds from the Australian taxpayer has an obligation to do so according to the law, and dentists are no exception. The government has provided all known dentists with information about the requirements of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme on nine separate occasions, and I refer here to a letter from a former Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Tony Abbott, who writes, 'Dear Dental practitioner', and in paragraph 5 says, 'It will be a requirement that patients are informed about the cost of any recommended dental services before they commence a course of treatment.' We know in many cases that that did not occur. We know that in many cases the referring GP was not told of the course of treatment that was to be undertaken.


The requirements of the scheme are not onerous. It is not onerous, surely, for dentists to tell patients and their doctors what work they are doing. And it is not onerous to tell patients upfront what the cost will be. At the end of January 2012 around $2.27 billion had been claimed under the scheme since it commenced in 2007. The Senate should remember that this scheme was meant to cost $90 million a year when it was first implemented. It is now costing around $1 billion a year. It has blown out by that proportion.


On 29 May 2012 the Minister for Human Services, the honourable senator Kim Carr, issued a statement announcing the government's view that a retrospective change to the dental services determination is needed in relation to the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. Senator Carr also reiterated the government's intention to close the scheme. The retrospective change to the determination would bring compliance arrangements for the scheme more closely in line with other Medicare program compliance arrangements. So that means that those dentists who have inadvertently erred in the delivery of services do have an opportunity to rectify the situation. But that does not mean that those dentists who have systematically, in my view, rorted the scheme can avoid their obligations. There is a full audit, but Senator Carr has indicated that there will be a retrospective change to the dental services determination in relation to CDDS. This change to the determination is not a free pass to practitioners to do what they want. The Minister for Health and the Minister for Human Services will ensure that. But, instead of trying to write off debts as this bill is trying to do, and amend a flawed scheme, our government is making meaningful investments in dental health services. Our government is making a targeted $515.3 million over four years investment in oral health for Australians who are least able to afford dental care. We have a targeted approach to those people in Australia who are least able to afford or access dental care. The new spending will include funding of $345.9 million for a public dental waiting list blitz, which would, according to the National Dental Advisory Council, address the current 400,000 people on waiting lists around the country. It is targeted to those most in need. The funding will be delivered through a national partnership agreement with the states and territories and, in addition, states and territories will be required to maintain their existing effort, including work with children and targeted dental services provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. That is targeted dental care, and that is the sort of approach I would suggest this bill goes nowhere near. 


As part of that package, there is funding of $10.5 million for oral health promotion and the development of a national oral health promotion plan and funding of $35.7 million for an expansion to the voluntary dental graduate year program to offer 100 places per annum from 2016. This will increase the dental workforce to enable the delivery of more dental services through a national scheme. While I have this opportunity I would like to commend James Cook University dental school and the work that they are doing, particularly in rural and remote areas and particularly for low income people in the community of Cairns. 


Funding also includes $45.2 million for a graduate year program for oral health therapists to support 50 placements per annum from 2014 to increase service delivery capacity and create a more flexible dental workforce. It also includes funding of $77.7 million for rural and remote infrastructure and relocation grants for dentists, and funding of $450,000 to non-government organisations to coordinate further pro bono work by dentists for the most disadvantaged Australians across the country.


The Senate, I think, is well aware that the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme has been a failure on many fronts. It has been a failure in terms of targeting and fiscal blowout, and it is not targeted to people most in need. The government will not be supporting this bill.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (09:59):  It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise today to talk on the extremely important Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2]. I just want to put a couple of things on the record before I speak more generally. The first point is that it is clear that the coalition is the only side of politics that has delivered a Medicare dental scheme that provides for treatment. The second point is I am indebted to my colleague Senator David Bushby, who authored this bill. I seek to refer to a speech he made in this place on 21 June. He said:


The coalition strongly supports a transparent and appropriate audit process to detect cases of fraud, the misuse of taxpayers' funds or the provision of inappropriate services. But we do not support Labor's tactic of using innocent and inadvertent administrative errors as a means to claw back funds from dentists, presumably to assist the government in their unattainable quest to achieve a budget surplus—something they have not done for over 20 years!


I quote further from the speech:


Upon commencing the audit process, officers from Medicare identified that many dentists had failed to comply with section 10 requirements of the scheme. Under section 10, dental practitioners were required to provide the patient's referring general practitioner with a dental treatment plan prior to undertaking any work on the patient. However, primarily due to a lack of education on those requirements many dentists were unaware of their administrative obligations and commenced treatment on the first appointment with a new patient prior to providing the necessary paperwork to the GP. Treating the oral health needs of a patient prior to fulfilling the administrative requirements of the scheme does not constitute fraud.


Let us go back and try and ascertain why the government might be pursuing the dentists and trying to destroy this scheme. 


Why do you think the government might have tried to destroy the scheme that was clearly working and why would they possibly use dentists as the fall guys in this? I have a very strong view on this and I suspect that this has been done because of the author of the original scheme who happens to be the current Leader of the Opposition. I think this is a bloody-minded attempt to destroy a scheme that was working because of the person who authored it. What does that mean? That means that destroying the scheme is not good policy. It is actually about bad politics. That is what has been driving this issue. The parliamentary secretary has not responded to a letter I sent her in relation to another matter the other day, which I hope was not an example of cheap politics but I look forward very much to receiving the response in relation to that matter. 


The Labor government wanted to destroy this scheme from day one. In fact, their policy was to destroy the scheme. As part of that, they failed to have any educative process in place. They failed to provide education to a group of professionals for whom this was their first interaction with Medicare. There was no education for that group of professionals and, as a result of that, these administrative errors occurred. They were errors, not fraud. We do not support fraud but we do not support the actions that have been taken on these issues.


I will just go through the outcome of the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme which, as honourable senators know, provides up to $4,250 in Medicare dental benefits over two years for eligible patients with a chronic health condition. Over 17 million services have been provided to approximately one million patients since 2007. What a remarkable policy outcome and yet the Labor Party in government has tried to destroy the scheme. 


One of the other implications of this audit process involved veterans. Again, a knee-jerk reaction caused considerable angst amongst the veteran population because earlier this year, as a result of this audit, the Department of Veterans' Affairs advised dentists that services provided by dental hygienists were not covered by the gold card. Dental services provided by dental hygienists had always previously been covered but as a result of this audit, the implications of which were widespread, DVA stepped in to stop these services being covered. They had been covered under the gold card.


In February this year I received a number of emails from veterans in relation to the removal of the coverage of this service under the gold card. Apparently it had been removed without any consultation whatsoever—no consultation whatsoever—and there was no advice to veterans about why the services were to change. In Senate estimates this year, in February, I pursued this matter with the department, who at the time, remarkably, were unable to provide any reasons why the service was no longer being provided—no reasons whatsoever. Thankfully, common sense prevailed and the Repat Commission extended coverage of the gold card to dental hygiene services.


As always when you remove services like this, the group upon which the impact is most felt is those in rural and regional Australia. And the proposed changes were going to impact most severely on those in regional and rural areas because, as everyone in this place should know, dental services in regional and rural areas are extremely difficult to access. And those who do not know that clearly have no understanding of regional and rural Australia. These dental hygienists provide a valuable preventative health service assisting veterans and others in the community to avoid further health issues arising from poor dental health. Indeed, DVA's decision to stop treatment and not provide any information or advice to veterans caused unnecessary panic. I wonder, quite frankly, where the government's priorities are when they are creating that sort of angst amongst a group of Australians who have either served this nation or are the partners of someone who has served this nation. It was an ill-considered, knee-jerk reaction.


It is interesting to look at what the government has done in relation to dental health. Honourable senators would be aware that in 2008 the Labor Party proposed the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. It promised a million services by providing funding to the states and territories. But—surprise, surprise—the Labor Party did not assess the capacity of the public dental workforce to provide the services, and the number of services would have therefore been significantly less than had been promised. It was never delivered and it was finally scrapped in the 2012 budget. The much vaunted and promised Commonwealth Dental Health Program, which the Labor Party was running around the country lauding, was finally scrapped in this year's budget. It is interesting that, irrespective of whether it had been put in place, it would not have come anywhere near to matching the 17 million services that have been provided under the Medicare scheme—nowhere near that which has been provided under the Medicare scheme. 


The Teen Dental Plan, which was introduced in 2008 by this government, provides only for a preventative check, and the Australian Dental Association quite rightly has argued the scheme provides no follow up care for those with dental issues and its focus is too narrow. The program has had low take-up, with only 429,000 services forecast for 2011 out of an eligible 1.3 million teenagers. The continuation of the Labor Party's rhetoric in relation to dental care was continued in this year's budget, but there was only $60 million in new net funding announced in the budget. More promises have been made, but nothing substantial has been delivered.


It is interesting that any government funded dental scheme is going to require the participation and the cooperation of the dental professions. In one fell swoop, the government has destroyed any trust between itself and the dental profession. This government led witch-hunt, following on from the section 10 investigation, has destroyed that relationship. And, quite rightly, why would any dentist again trust this government in relation to any publicly funded program in which they are required to participate? What an appalling outcome that is for those who require these services. What an appalling outcome that is for those in regional and rural Australia who already have enough difficulty accessing services. What an appalling outcome that is for those who believe, as we do, that there is a significant role for government in relation to the provision of services via Medicare.


In the time left open to me I will now go to some very, very interesting evidence given in the Community Affairs Senate estimates hearing on 30 May this year in relation to the Professional Services Review:


As I understand the current stories in the media around dentistry—and I am simply going on what I read in the media—I understand they are more to do with strict auditing processes, auditing of paperwork et cetera. That is not the sort of matter that comes to PSR—


the Professional Services Review—


We have had no formal notification from Medicare, although there has been some suggestion that there may be cases later this year. But we have had no formal indication from Medicare that they are referring a dentist to us for inappropriate practice which goes beyond, as I understand it, the sorts issues that have been in the media lately. As I said, they are more to do with auditing. Inappropriate practice in terms of the actual professional decisions being made by a dentist, which would be the type of matter that would be referred to PSR—we have not had any referrals and no formal notification.




Senator McLucas:
  But there might be some coming.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Oh, 'There might be some coming,' says the parliamentary secretary. When are they coming, Parliamentary Secretary? You have just said there might be some coming, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. You have said there might be some coming, so when are they coming?




Senator McLucas:
  No, you said that.




Senator RONALDSON:
  When are we going to see them, Parliamentary Secretary? When are we going to see any justification for the government's actions in relation to this? There is nothing before the PSR. This is premised on the back of your attack on dentists for being unprofessional.




Senator McLucas:
  No.




Senator RONALDSON:
  That is what this is about: being unprofessional. The PSR has had no evidence before it of unprofessional behaviour, and yet you have continued this witch-hunt against a group of people that you refuse to educate, who are having—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! Parliamentary Secretary, I would ask you to stop interjecting. Senator Ronaldson, I would ask you to direct your remarks through the chair.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I actually thought I had directed my comments through you, but if I had not then I humbly apologise and I will continue to do so. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, what we have heard from the parliamentary secretary is that there may be cases coming forward. This witch-hunt is premised on unprofessional practice, yet there have been no referrals at all from Medicare to the Professional Services Review. I think that says it all.


This is a policy that was designed to destroy something that was working but was set up by the Leader of the Opposition—cheap politics to destroy something that worked. If the Australian Labor Party, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, had actually put in place something that was working or that would replace it then their bona fides might be a bit stronger. But, as we all know in this place, their much hyped up and much vaunted Commonwealth Dental Health Program failed. So the government has fallen at the first step in relation to their own program, while at the same time taking out of the system—or attempting to—something that is working. You did not educate the dentists because you thought you could destroy the scheme as soon as you got in, and by not being able to destroy the scheme as you wanted, you left it hanging out to dry. In doing so, you left hanging out to dry the very people that were going to be delivering this program, the dentists themselves.


We, under no circumstances, support fraudulent behaviour, but under no circumstances do we support what has been done by this government. This bill seeks to address that wrong, and it has my full and complete support.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (10:19):  This is a very important debate, because many elderly people in this country do have really severe oral health problems, and unfortunately very often they are not able to have those problems fixed because they simply cannot afford the cost of dental treatment. If you can imagine what it is like to live with rotten teeth, not being able to chew properly and with ulcers in your mouth, you would, I think, agree that the lot of such people—and they are the ones I am referring to—is pretty miserable.


The whole purpose of this scheme, which was introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for Health, Tony Abbott, was to provide a means by which elderly people in the community who needed dental and other oral health treatment could obtain that treatment through the Medicare system. I think it is quite outrageous that the government is seeking to stop this scheme and is alleging fraud against dentists when, in fact, it seems that the communication between the Department of Health and Ageing and the dental profession was very poor and that dentists very often innocently made mistakes for which they are now being charged with having created a fraud. This is just an absolute nonsense and I totally support the remarks of Senator Ronaldson in that regard.


The other thing I would say is that this government has a habit of curtailing debates on the health sector. For some reason the government feels very sensitive about health issues. Towards the end of the last sitting before the winter recess, I was to speak on the National Health Amendments (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2012. I say 'I was to speak' because I did not get the opportunity to do so. The government rudely guillotined the debate, preventing a number of my colleagues and me from making comments on that bill.


Today, we debate the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No.2] which is a bill based on a misconception that dentists were defrauding the scheme when, in fact, it seems the Department of Health and Ageing and the government were at fault for their failure to communicate the essential features and requirements of the scheme adequately to the dental profession.


This Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, introduced in the last months of the previous coalition government, allows eligible patients to claim up to $4,250 in Medicare benefits for dental services in any two consecutive calendar years. Over 17 million services have been provided to approximately one million patients since 2007. That speaks for itself in quantifying the specific need for a scheme like this to ensure that the mostly elderly patients who are in this cohort are able to obtain dental treatment so that their quality of life can be improved.


Dental care items were introduced in the Medicare Benefits Schedule in 2004 for patients with chronic conditions and complex care needs under the former enhanced primary care arrangements—again, an initiative of the Howard government. Sadly, as I have said, the need for this kind of service remains but this government appears to be determined to curtail it as much as possible.


In May 2007, significant changes to the EPC program were announced in the budget, to take effect from 1 November in the same year. Eligible patients under that scheme, introduced by the Howard government, could then claim up to $4,250 a year in Medicare benefits for dental services in any two consecutive years. The scheme has been a great success, as I have said, despite two attempts by the Rudd government to shut it down for purely political reasons. One must really question the motivation, the principles and the sense of responsibility of those in the Rudd government who sought to shut down this scheme, and which, fortunately, were rejected twice by the Senate. So, the scheme remains in place.


In June 2010, Labor established an audit task force after its initial attempts to close the scheme failed. These audits are primarily focussed on 'incorrect claiming'—which has also been described as fraud and which it is not—associated with legislative requirements found in section 10 of the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Determination 2007. The coalition supports a transparent and appropriate audit process to detect cases of fraud, misuse of taxpayers' funds or the provision of inappropriate services. However, under Labor's audit processes, dentists have been found to be noncompliant and action has been pursued against them for minor technical mistakes with paperwork, which has been misrepresented as fraud. In most cases, the dentists caught by the audit process have provided appropriate services to patients in need but merely did not comply fully with the technical requirement to provide medical general practitioners with copies of treatment plans and quotations for services prior to commencing treatment.


Why, one might ask, would the dentist not provide these treatment plans if that was a requirement? It seems that a lot of the responsibility for this lies with the government. It seems that consultation with the dental profession as such was almost nonexistent. Instead of sitting down with the dentists, who are not used to working with Medicare in the same way that doctors are, the government did not sit down and consult with the dental profession and make a point of the fact that there was a need to provide the referring general practitioner with a treatment plan. Dentists are certainly well versed in the Department of Veterans' Affairs system and very conversant with its requirements, but they have not had the same degree of exposure to Medicare and its requirements as medical practitioners. So it is not really surprising that many dentists inadvertently did not send copies of their treatment plans to the referring doctors.


An interesting comment from the Australian Dental Association is that, from the doctors' point of view, they wrote to the Dental Association saying that they saw no point in dentists sending them treatment plans because the medical GPs were not dentists and the treatment plans actually meant very little to them. In effect, the government says the dentists were guilty of fraud because they did not send treatment plans to the general practitioners and it seems the general practitioners really did not think these were particularly useful because they did not understand the treatments proposed.


More broadly, the education of the dental profession about this scheme was not comprehensive. When the CDDS was introduced, dentists did not in many cases pay due regard to the detailed requirements of this scheme. The only interaction between the profession was delivery of a letter, a copy of the Medicare benefits fee schedule and some reference to website information.


Clearly inadequate information was provided by the Department of Health and Ageing to the practitioners. As the Australian Dental Association noted, it was not until deficiencies in the education program provided by Medicare were recognised in early 2010 that any more detailed and clear information was provided. Since then, the Australian Dental Association have regularly updated its membership on compliance issues. Obviously, the ADA, as one would expect from a responsible, professional organisation, do not like to see its members accused of committing fraud, for very large amounts of money in some cases, when they were simply providing a much needed service to very needy patients under the Medicare system.


Some of the sums which have been stated to have been obtained by fraudulent means by some dentists under this scheme run into millions of dollars—extraordinary amounts of money. But I am advised by dental practitioners that the implication that individual dentists were charging these huge sums of money is quite wrong and that, in fact, these very large sums of money reflect the services provided by group dental practices, who naturally see a lot of patients and ran up very large accounts and submitted those to Medicare for payment, but not in any individual capacities. So they represent group practices—many dentists, not single dentists. 


Again, I come back to this issue of the lack of communication between the department of health and Medicare and the dental profession. As I understand it, the dentists have now sought to inform the Australian Dental Association of the compliance requirements of reporting back to the referring practitioner. That is a development in recent times and I think, if anything, it underlines the good faith of the Australian dental profession in seeking to remedy the flaws which existed in the information provided by the health department to the dental profession in the way this scheme was to be run. 


I think it is absolutely outrageous that the government have, in effect, sought to defame the dental profession for committing frauds within this scheme, when in fact the real faults were that there was very little consultation by Medicare with the profession and there was no attempt to hold educational seminars with dentists to explain the detailed reporting requirements of this scheme. For the government to go from there to claiming that dentists who provided services to people who have a very real and, if you like, a sad need for improvements in their dental and oral health were engaged in fraud is quite outrageous. The people affected here are mostly elderly and mostly could not afford dental treatment. They went to the dentist in good faith, had their treatment provided in good faith, and now the dentists who provided that treatment are accused of rorting the system.


The whole record of this Labor government has been to curtail medical services provided to the people of Australia through the Medicare system by restricting the listing of new drugs. Now we find they are trying to shut down a scheme which has provided a very important service to a very vulnerable group of people in our community. If I was on the Labor side of either the House of Representatives or the Senate, I would hold my head in shame. It is quite a disgusting thing from my point of view that the needs of these elderly people who have been provided with dental treatment under this dental services plan should now face the possibility that these services will be withdrawn. 


I hope that the Senate makes sure that this legislation is passed and that the government are made to feel guilty and ashamed of their attempts to restrict the service. It is a very good service. The flaws lie with the government and government departments, as I have said, in failing to communicate the key reporting requirements to referring general practitioners. The dental profession have never had a requirement to do that in the past, and the fault very much lies with the government. Their opposition to this bill is very, very hypocritical.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-08-23,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:35):  I rise to speak on the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No.2]. The bill requires the Minister for Health, in conjunction with such other ministers as may be necessary, to redress past and future inequities that have arisen from the operation of section 10(2) of the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Determination 2007. The bill describes the inequalities imposed on dental practitioners by the operation of the section of the determination and specifies five courses of action which the minister can take to redress those inequities. It also establishes a time frame in which action is to be taken and it requires a report to be tabled in both houses of parliament detailing the actions taken.


I would like to make note that the bill before us ensures there are some accountability measures in both houses of parliament and that things are actually transparent, as opposed to some of the legislation that has been coming before us where we are being asked to make decisions and to formulate what those decisions are going to be about at a later stage, giving ministerial discretion a whole new definition.


That being said, the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, introduced in 2007 by Tony Abbott as Minister for Health, provides $4,250 in Medicare dental benefits over two years for eligible patients with a chronic health condition. Over 17 million services have been provided to almost a million patients since the scheme began. That sounds like a fantastic story, but following special Medicare audits since 2010, 46 dentists have been hit with bills for incorrect Medicare claims totalling $21.5million—over small paperwork problems and issues relating to red tape, not to fraud.


Obviously where fraud is occurring, it is important to have it identified and dealt with appropriately. However, in these instances that does not seem to have been the case. An inquiry into this legislation revealed the depth of feeling across the community and within the profession, with 432 submissions received. Many, many dentists have contacted me and my colleagues right across the country to express their concern at the way this issue has been handled by the Labor government, a government which has been trying to do away with the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme for years, doing its best to undermine the only available option for those people who desperately need dental care but can least afford it.


It is astonishing to think that so many dentists stand accused of having done the wrong thing in relation to their Medicare claims. It seems dentists right across the country were effectively being persecuted as corrupt, as if involved in some vast conspiracy to defraud this scheme. Sixty-six out of 95 of the Medicare audits returned a non-compliant result, which surely suggests a structural or process issue rather than deliberate fraud. We know now that the great, great majority of these dentists were trying to do the right thing. They had made administrative errors as a result of being ill informed about correct process. 


It seems education and information, rather than financial punishment, would be more appropriate actions for Medicare to take in relation to these matters. Explanation and understanding would have made a significant difference all round, and yet education, information, explanation and understanding are concepts that this government struggles with across a range of issues in dealing with subsectors of our communities with which the government is not familiar. I think particularly of the regions and our agricultural industries—and obviously the dental service industry.


These were not problems related to the standard of care or to unethical practice. Even the Professional Services Review Board has indicated that these problems were not related to professional misconduct, saying at the Community Affairs Committee's Senate estimates hearing on 30 May 2012:


We have had no formal indication from Medicare that they are referring a dentist to us for inappropriate practice which goes beyond those, as I understand the sorts of issues that have been in the media lately.


And so these dentists were left under severe stress as Medicare hit them with enormous bills and demanded back payment of their treated—and might I say, very happy—patients, because they had been able to access the key dental services that they required. As usual the dentists involved were just trying to help disadvantaged patients with their dental healthcare needs.


For example, a dentist in my electorate in Victoria contacted me expressing his 'grave concern at the action of the federal government in insisting that Medicare demand full repayment of rebates paid to dentists for paperwork errors, when in fact they provided necessary treatment to patients appropriately referred to them by medical practitioners'. This dentist went on to explain that, with the introduction of the scheme, many dentists had no experience with the bureaucratic demands associated with publicly funded care and said: 'People with chronic diseases often have more dental problems than healthy people. Some publicly funded patients have been waiting years for access to care, and it is not surprising that there has been high use of the Medicare scheme given this pent-up demand.'


This is exactly what we were talking about. This program worked and was addressing a pent-up need within the community of disadvantaged people's dental concerns. Clearly there was an issue around the understanding of the profession of how to document and process these claims. But it was not about fraud. That is just one example. Another dentist got in touch to tell me that: 'The audits have placed myself in the unenviable situation of severe financial distress, and I personally know of some dentists facing bankruptcy or insolvency. I have six employees who will be severely affected by the repayment of such a large sum of money. This is an extreme action on Medicare's part that will take its toll on our young practice and there will be community backlash as the public will suffer as a result of reduced access to quality dental care.' So the outcomes are possibly severe. Dentists have had their reputations ruined, some are facing bankruptcy and professional trust in government funded dental schemes is being destroyed as a result of this process. It was a first step in the right direction when the minister agreed to have the department take a fresh look at the cases of those 46 dentists that were ordered to repay a total of $21.5 million.


But the minister has been awfully quiet on the issue since then. It may be suggested that he only acted when forced to—when this legislation was introduced by my good colleagues Senator Bushby and, in the other chamber, shadow minister the Hon. Peter Dutton. It is designed to redress past and future inequities that have arisen from the operation of subsection 10(2) of the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Determination 2007.


Then, just two days before the coalition's private member's bill was expected to pass the House without government support, Senator Kim Carr tabled a statement in the Community Affairs Committee's estimates hearings that the government would issue a retrospective determination to remedy the case and the issues. The minister said:


This retrospective change to the Determination would bring the compliance arrangements more closely into line with other parts of Medicare, and would allow for a more educative approach to be used by the Department.


I am all for an educative approach to be used by departments; however, the timing and the tabling of this retrospective determination smacks of political expediency. I am not sure why the compliance arrangements were not already in line with other parts of Medicare.


The government's change of heart has come about after years of lobbying by dentists and long-term inaction by the Labor government. They have admitted that they want to scrap the scheme. They have tried and failed to scrap the scheme. They have done everything they can to push poor, hardworking, honest dentists out of the scheme. This is a scheme that has provided much needed treatment to nearly one million people with chronic disease and those who can ill afford the cost of private dental care. One million people—I doubt you could call that anything other than a success, and Labor really could not have done anything more to make it collapse.


Any government funded dental scheme is going to require the participation and cooperation of the dental profession. Labor has eroded the trust of the dental profession through its inexcusable actions on audits. In addition to undermining the existing successful Medicare dental program, Labor has failed to deliver on its own promises on dental health. The coalition is the only side of politics that has delivered a Medicare dental scheme that provides for treatment within the public system. I commend this bill to the Senate and hope that it restores some faith for the dentists in our community who work with those most desperately in need of good oral health.


As we debate this bill brought on by Senator Bushby, it gives me the opportunity to discuss the issues of rural health, with the launch yesterday of the Community Affairs References Committee's report into rural services and medical professions in rural areas. We heard, when we were in Albury for one of the committee hearings, from the dental profession within Victoria. We heard about the concerns they have about young dentists heading out into the regions and setting up practice. The expense involved in the equipment to set up a dentistry practice is significant. Similarly, ensuring that young dentists have experience throughout their training of practice within rural and regional Australia is important. Those of us outside capital cities who love where we live and work still have teeth that need professional and considered care, and those disadvantaged among us need to be able to access a scheme which allows us to access the health care that we need in an appropriate way, and within our own communities. It is an issue that, I am sure, other speakers will address in their contributions, and I look forward to hearing about that.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (10:49):  I rise to address the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No.2] partly because of the importance of the dental health issue and partly because of the importance of the principles that underpin the approach that the current government takes to dealing with individuals versus their ideological aims.


By way of background, this bill was introduced by the coalition as an opportunity to provide dental services funded by Medicare for people who had chronic conditions. Some 966,000 people accessed the service. Some 17 million services were provided to people. Over 12,000 dental practitioners were involved—66 were found to be noncompliant in terms of some paperwork. As my colleagues have indicated their clearly throughout this debate, when that was investigated it became abundantly clear that the fault lay predominantly with a lack of education and awareness for the providers in terms of the kinds of paperwork and the sequence of things that were required. But, in fact, there was no fault with the quality of work or the fact that the services were delivered to people who needed them.


The issue here is not one of quality of service. It is not one of equity of access, because it was the people who had those chronic conditions and needed that support who were able to access it. The issue is about how the government chooses to prioritise its activities. Is it on service delivery? Is it on meeting the need? Or is it on the bureaucracy and the reporting? Is it about ideology?


Let us take ideology first. This current government was implacably opposed to the scheme when it was put forward by the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, when he was the health minister.


They indicated that it was their desire to close the scheme down, and this provided a convenient excuse for them to do so. Commentators who consider the philosophical approach to life indicate that often when respect for the individual is diminished in the interests of the state then we are moving towards a more totalitarian or authoritarian regime. I think it is disappointing in the extreme that individuals have been bankrupted in some cases, and some have had careers and reputations ruined because of an ideological pursuit by this government. It is interesting to note that none of the government's own proposed schemes have ever actually got off the ground and worked. I think we need to put on the record that this whole affair, which has ruined individual lives, has come about because of ideological and political purposes of the government. How do we rectify it?


The purpose of this bill is to make sure that the government puts in place appropriate remedies to recognise and address the inequity. The inequity is that dental practitioners who have legitimately provided a dental service and claimed a Medicare benefit as a payment have been required to repay the benefit when they did not provide a patient, before commencing treatment, with a written plan of their course of treatment and a written quotation or when they have failed to give copies of these documents to the referring doctor. The requirements this government has placed on providers introduces incredible inefficiencies in the system. Somebody comes in, they have got a chronic need, they have been referred by their doctor, the dentist looks at and knows what he needs to do—but what is he required to do? He must write a plan, give the person a quote, send it to the referring doctor, and then he can start treatment. Is it any wonder that around Australia, in capital cities and particularly in rural areas, there are waiting lists for people to access dental health care in the public system? Any approach which prioritises this kind of bureaucracy over the effective delivery of service is not effective use of taxpayers' money. 


The Productivity Commission have looked at the area of private hospitals and have indicated that the private hospital sector provides more effective health care than the public sector, with a 12 per cent lower realised expected mortality rate. Why? Because of increased productivity and effective use of available assets and people—cutting down on the red tape.


I am a great supporter of the fact that we need to have both the private and the public sector. I do not think, in Australia's situation, we should aim to have just one. The two can complement each other. It is interesting to see that, in this very area of dental health, the private sector has actually come to the rescue of the public sector. In Victoria, for example, a company that is based here in Canberra, Aspen Medical, was contracted to go around all the rural schools and complete the dental health checks for children. They did it so efficiently that they had capacity at the end of the program to include other sites. The same company was contracted, in the Northern Sydney and Central Coast regions, by the area health service to look at reducing the waiting lists so that they could actually meet their targets, which they were failing to do. This private company used the same facilities that were owned by the public purse, and they managed to reduce the waiting list by 1,500. Other health services were so impressed that around the state this company was taken on to reduce waiting lists and, by the end of their involvement, they had reduced the waiting lists by 5,500 people. We are not talking about a massive injection of new infrastructure; we are talking about efficient work practice, because the focus is on providing timely and effective service to the people who need it—not on the paperwork and the reporting—and particularly in a model and a method that makes the interaction between the clinician, the patient, the use of the facilities and the time so incredibly inefficient.


That is one of the reasons that the coalition, as we approach the coming election, are being very clear about the fact that we are making very deliberate efforts to reduce the red tape. It does not matter which sector you talk with, whether it is people in the community services sector or people in the aged-care sector, what consistently comes back to us is that people are spending increasing amounts of their time and resources in compliance reporting. When you chase those compliance reports back, quite often you cannot actually put your finger on anyone who uses those for a productive purpose. It appears that processes have been put in place that are absorbing more and more of people's productive time for no useful purpose in terms of good governance. 


Shadow minister Kevin Andrews was interviewed this week by Lyndal Curtis, and there were articles in the paper yesterday, and he talked about the approach the coalition will be taking to try to reduce the paperwork burden on providers in multiple service sectors. We are looking for a cooperative engagement with the states so that we can reduce duplication, which means that in some cases we would be asking the states to trust the Commonwealth to look at compliance.


But in other cases, we would say that we are happy to accept the state's oversight, such that we reduce the burden on the people who are delivering the services. We owe it to the taxpayers of Australia to make sure that their money—their taxes—is not supporting systems that exist for the purpose of the system. We owe it to the taxpayers of Australia to make sure that their money is used for the effective delivery of high-quality services.


So when I look at this dental scheme I see a service that provided support to 966,000 people—some 17 million individual services provided. Then when I see a government wanting to tear it down and prevent that service being provided, because in a few cases the practitioners did not follow a bureaucratic system that required multiple handling of plans and copies to referring GPs before the service could be provided, I think that government should hang its head in shame. We have a duty to the Australian people to be effective in our governance and in our use of the taxpayer dollar and, certainly, this is not an example of where that has occurred.


The government's predisposition to allow ideology to come in front of the benefit of individuals, or even sectors of the community, has been demonstrated again and again. I stand here as a senator for South Australia, the day after we have seen this government refuse to heed the warnings of BHP Billiton, one of Australia's largest companies, working extensively in iron ore and coal exports. It has been warning about the sovereign risk that has been introduced by this government in their ideological pursuit of penalising success and profit, in introducing a carbon tax purely because of their coalition with the Greens in an attempt to retain power and the flow-on effects that that is having for people in the community. Just like there were dentists harmed by their approach to this dental scheme, there are people across the sector in South Australia who are suffering now because of being laid off, or who are having contracts cancelled because of the lack of business confidence demonstrated by BHP Billiton in deciding that they could not build the business case to invest in South Australia.


Just last weekend I was speaking to a small business which employs draughtsmen supporting the construction and development of the mining industry. They were already having to lay off people because of the uncertainty. And now that this decision has come through the ramifications for individual people and their families in South Australia will be significant, and it was driven, in large part, by the ideological pursuits of this government.


Australians, thankfully, do not have that long to wait before they will have a chance to let their voices be known. I would encourage them when they cast their votes not to look at what is said but to look at what has been done, and to look to a side of politics—in this case, the coalition—which in the case of dental care actually put a plan in place. And it worked; it provided good services to many people. But it was cut down by this government, which has not been able to replace it with anything that has actually worked.


As the people of Australia make their choice, they need to look at the collapse in business confidence that has affected BHP Billiton and they need to look in South Australia at that other pillar of our economy, the defence industry, which has been curtailed, with many businesses on the brink of bankruptcy. In fact, there are some in Australia who have already closed their doors because of deferred and cancelled projects. They have made investments in infrastructure to support our national security endeavours, just to have the cash flow essentially cut off by deferred or delayed defence projects.


There are many reasons—this dental situation being just one of them—why the Australian people should hold this government to account. I am pleased to support this bill put forward by my colleague Senator Bushby, which seeks to address the inequities and unfairness that has been levied against dentists in our country—the very people who either side of politics will need to engage with if we are to build a dental system, both public and private, that will provide for our community into the future.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:04):  I rise to support the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2], and I congratulate Senator Bushby for his generosity on behalf of the Australian people to help the Labor government out yet again from a hole that it has dug for itself.


Originally, the legislation for the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was introduced by the coalition while in government by none other than the then very successful health minister—and probably last successful health minister we have had in this country—and that was Mr Tony Abbott. But what we have seen, as usual, is an effort by the Labor government to try and dismantle a scheme that was enormously successful, that was cost-effective for the Australian community and, amazingly enough, was not concentrated on bureaucrats and bureaucracy. It was actually concentrated on taxpayers with dental problems. But, needless to say, the efforts made by the Labor government to try and dismantle it—because it was ideologically driven, because it had been introduced by Mr Abbott—have come back to haunt them, and they have been unable to actually dismantle it.


That is why I congratulate Senator Bushby, because in this legislation he genuinely is helping the government out of a problem that they cannot get themselves out of. Needless to say, we see an analogy for this in the asylum seeker debacle that we see today, where the Labor government of today inherited a perfectly good solution to what had been a problem and, led by the now Prime Minister, they dismantled it only to find some years later that they have to go back and reinstitute what was a successful policy position. As others have said, we have a circumstance here where under this Medicare chronic disease dental scheme, initiated by then Health Minister Abbott, we had 17 million services delivered to one million people since 2007. Needless to say, it has been tremendously successful.


Now, I applaud the government for the move to want to audit public expenditure; only I wish that they would audit themselves when they misspend public moneys, such as on pink batts, school halls and failed green schemes. But, nevertheless, like everybody in the chamber knows, it is the role of the parliament to ensure that funds are wisely spent, and to root out—excuse the pun in terms of dentistry!—where there is rorting, where there is corruption and where there is failure.


But where there has not been rorting or corruption, there is not a role for the audit process to vilify dentists, as of course has happened in this circumstance. What has failed is the commonsense approach. What we have seen is the effort of using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut and the failure to ask: did in fact the peanut, or those represented by it, fail in the first place? As Senator Bushby has eloquently said in his contribution to this debate, 'Therein lies the problem.'


I refer to correspondence and communication from a colleague of mine in Fremantle in Western Australia, a very senior member of the dentistry profession, a very, very credible man of great integrity. When I asked him about this he said, 'The disappointment, Chris, was that the government made no attempt to consult with the dental profession on this whole question.' This is not a man given to rorting or to corruption. He simply made the point that as a profession 'we have not interacted with the Medicare system; we did not understand or know the rules of the Medicare system'. He said the disappointment now that this confusion has been created is that some of the very people who have been treated successfully under the scheme introduced by the coalition are now turning their backs on the chronic dental work that they so badly need. 


He mentioned cases to me, and I am going to refer to a second and even more distressing case in a minute where a GP referred a patient to the dentist and the dentist failed to write back in time to the GP, the very person who referred the patient. This is a circumstance in which very often people are disadvantaged. Fremantle is an example and there are many other areas around urban and rural and regional Australia where low socio-economic families or individuals, young people living on their own, and Aboriginal people suffer disadvantaged. As my colleague said to me, 'Chris, not only is it difficult to get these people into the dental service to start addressing some of the chronic dental problems they have, the great difficulty is in being able to predict the amount of work required.' 


This brings me to the second point: giving some sort of close indication, which you are then bound to, of what the costs of the treatment are going to be before you start the treatment. Any of us who have a clinical background would know—and particularly anyone from the dentistry profession where there is such an underservicing in this country and so many people who have not visited a dentist for a long time—it would be very, very difficult for a dentist to be able to predict what sort of work is required.


Can it be audited? Is there a process in which an independent auditor or scrutineer could go back afterwards and see whether or not they think that dentist has rorted the scheme, has actually instituted treatments that the patient never needed? Of course there is a process, and of course it can happen—it happens every day of the week. It does not need a whopping bureaucracy from Canberra to determine it. My colleague and friend Dr Colgan said, 'Chris, get the system right and then worry about the money. But let us go back to the centrality of who this is all about and what the system is in place for. It is for those people who have fallen through the gaps in the dental treatment process.'


Let me give you an indication of the stupidity of this legislation as it was attempted to be introduced by the Labor government, and the consequences of this audit process. This is an actual case. A medical specialist referred a patient to a dental specialist, a periodontal surgeon. This particular person had a history of a renal transplant, was using immunosuppressive medications and had a very, very severe necrotising ulcerative gingivitis—and if Senator Farrell would like me to repeat that so that he can get it down and understand it, I will do so. In other words, this was an acute emergency—should I refer this to Minister Kim Carr—referred by the doctor. What do you think that dentist did? Heavens above, what they actually did was commence emergency treatment of this patient, a highly acute patient, a renal transplant patient, one who was on immunosuppressive medication, now presented by the doctor because of the urgency of the case.


But this dental specialist regrettably fell foul of the Labor-led audit process. Why? There are two reasons. Firstly, they did not seek in writing the permission of the doctor who had referred the case as an emergency. They failed to write to the doctor in the first place to say, 'I am about to treat this patient—would you like me to?' And, secondly, with this patient in tremendous distress, they failed to give some indication of what the cost might be. So foolishly, one would think, they actually went ahead with the treatment, only to find themselves foul of the system and being vilified—this being a highly-credentialed dental specialist in the city of Perth.


What do you think they did? The practice manager wrote to the authorities outlining the circumstances and asking whether they could review it and meet the payment. That was a letter from the practice manager of the dental specialist. Lo and behold, there was a second letter, on this occasion from the referring doctor, an associate professor, writing to support the application because of the treatment given to this gentleman with necrotising ulcerative gingivitis. Where do you think it all went? It was refused because of the so-called failure of the bureaucratic process, which was doing nothing to help the patient who is surely the most important person in this triangle. So what was the endgame? The person was not paid. The dental specialist then was caused to reduce the account enormously so that they could at least get some of their cost back. This is the actual effect when you go and speak to people rather than trying to adopt a bureaucratic process or procedure.


What it does, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you and I well know, is that it destroys confidence from practitioners back to government back to the bureaucracy. And when that happens, what would be the next reaction by that dental specialist should they have a patient referred to them by that doctor in an emergency circumstance? How willing would they be to actually pick up their instruments, place the patient in their care and start treatment because they have not gone through these Sir Humphrey Appleby-like bureaucratic processes? So in May this year, a couple of days before this private senator's bill was to go through the house without government support, we had Senator Kim Carr, the minister, tabling a statement in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee estimates hearings that the government would issue a retrospective determination to remedy the issues, some of which I have explained here this morning and some of which of course go to  Senator Bushby's recommendations in the first place.


In her contribution Senator McKenzie spoke of dental services in rural Australia. I heard Senator McLucas retort to a comment made by Senator Boyce that there was no relationship between this discussion today and rural and regional Australia. Well, let me tell Senator McLucas—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—it goes straight to dental services in rural and regional Australia. It is hard enough now to get dentists to go to and stay in country towns without having this sort of threat of vilification in a circumstance where they may find themselves in default under the Medicare process. But what about patients under these circumstances? In the absence of a dentist in a country town, not only do we have the ultimate cost of dental services, but very often we have the cost of travel to get to the dentist and, if there is need for treatment over a couple of days, there are the overnight accommodation costs, often not just for the patient but for their carer or the person supporting them. And who are those most at risk in this circumstance, Mr Acting Deputy President? You guessed it: low socioeconomic people, singles very often, and members of our Aboriginal communities. It is vitally important that we have that level of confidence between government, the medical and dental associations and individual practitioners, and this sort of activity does nothing to encourage that level of confidence.


In Senate estimates this year I asked the Director of the Professional Services Review what interaction, if any, he had had with cases referred to him by Medicare in the circumstance of possible corruption or rorting. I will quote the words he said to me in estimates:


As I understand the current stories in the media around dentistry, and I am simply going on what I read in the media, I understand they are more to do with strict auditing processes, auditing of paperwork et cetera. That is not the sort of matter that comes to PSR. But we have found no formal notification from Medicare, although there have been some suggestions in the future there may be cases later this year—


So we have that threat hanging over their heads. The quote goes on:


But we have had no formal indication from Medicare that they are referring a dentist to us for inappropriate practice which goes beyond, as I understand it, the sort of issues that have been in the media lately. As I said, they are more to do with auditing. Inappropriate practice in terms of the actual professional decisions made by a dentist, which would be the type of matter that would be referred to PSR—we have not had any referrals and no formal notification.


I was very much a participant in a Professional Services Review Scheme review last year by a committee which I recall was chaired by Senator Siewert. We looked in great detail at the involvement of the PSR, its relationship with Medicare and its examination of doctors who, it was claimed, may have been rorting the system. So PSR very much is an organisation that would be central to this circumstance, should there be the level of corruption that is claimed. This has unfairly vilified the dental profession and, of course, it has been in many instances the first time that dentists have ever interacted with the Medicare process. How much better would it have been to have spent some education money and to have sat down with the associations to get information out to the dentists to say that these are the circumstances, but that there must be occasions—such as the emergency I spoke about with the necrotising ulcerative gingivitis—where a dentist can go ahead with emergency treatment and be able to fill in the innumerable bits of paper afterwards.


What we have seen from the Labor government, in its attempts to replace the Abbott initiative, has failed. The Commonwealth Dental Health Program introduced in 2008 failed, as it would indeed have to do because it delivered so little that it was scrapped in the 2012 budget. We saw the Teen Dental Plan, which one hoped might have been successful, but regrettably less than a third of children who could have accessed this service have done so. I see children in the public area here today and I can only recommend to them that prevention is always better than cure. Whilst many of us do not like attending the dentist, I do encourage them to get into the habit—which I myself have not done—of making sure that they have regular dental check-ups. Not only is the cost of prevention a lot less to your parents than treatment afterwards, it is also a lot less painful.


I come to the recommendations made by Senator Bushby in his contribution. Not only is his draft legislation spot on the money, but he went as far as to help the Labor government, because they need all the help they can get, with the options that they might take to try and redress the failure they have visited upon the dental profession and the Australian people. The first recommendation is that they should enact amendments, as laid out in schedule 1, which relate to quotations not being provided prior to treatment—and I will not labour that anymore because I have already given a very good example of why those amendments are necessary. 


A second option is for the government to waive its right to repayment under the Medicare scheme to try to build confidence again with the dental profession. His third suggestion, if the first two cannot be enacted, is to make act-of-grace payments to redress the inequality that has been visited upon them or alternatively to provide for the inequity to be addressed through the income tax system—although I hope that would not happen, simply because many dentists, as Senator McKenzie has told us, are now facing financial ruin—or to take some other action which might redress it.


I am pleased to speak to this bill. I support it strongly, and I particularly look forward to the support of the Greens through Senator Di Natale, because we are fortunate now to have in Senator Di Natale a medical practitioner who has had a lot of involvement in rural, remote and Indigenous communities and who is well and truly across issues associated with dental health and the need for it to be improved in Australian communities, particularly those in which he has worked. I have heard him speak in this chamber about dental services, and I look forward to his strong support of this legislation to right a wrong, to put dentists back where they have always been—and that is at a level of high confidence in the community.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:23):  Over the past year the Greens—and, in particular, Senator Di Natale—have been putting a lot of effort into reforming the nation's dental health services. We have made that one of our top priorities. In fact, as the former health spokesperson for the Greens, before being joined by my colleagues in the Senate, I worked very extensively on dental health as well. Through this process we have been fortunate to get to know many hardworking people in the dental profession.


Senator Di Natale, shortly after taking his seat in the Senate, was approached by some dental practitioners who were being audited for services provided through the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. The more he learned about this situation and the more dentists he talked to and met who were expressing similar concerns and having similar issues, the more he became convinced that something was seriously wrong—as many other people have been articulating in this chamber.


The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was the first step for most dentists into Medicare. What became apparent, as Senator Di Natale spoke to more dental practitioners and those who had taken part in the scheme, was that the entry into Medicare had not been managed well—and I think that has been very well highlighted in this debate. While the rest of the medical profession are, by and large, now of course very familiar with Medicare, this was not true for dentists and those involved in the dental profession. In those circumstances, the department had a responsibility—and we believe an ongoing responsibility—to make sure that these practitioners were properly educated. Over time we have been increasingly convinced that this was not done at all.


As a result, many dentists who, in good faith, took part in the scheme to ensure delivery of these services to eligible patients who, we must point out, were in urgent need of dental support and care—many of whom had not received it for many years, if in fact at all—have fallen foul of the administrative arrangements for the scheme. In subsequent audits, many of these well-intentioned practitioners were required to repay the entire amount of the benefit they received from Medicare, despite having already provided critical treatment to eligible patients and, in many cases, having spent considerable amounts of money in delivering these services and treatments. This has resulted in enormous stress and hardship for dentists and has in fact threatened the viability of otherwise thriving practices providing very necessary treatment to the community.


We have no sympathy for any medical practitioner who acts unethically and seeks to defraud the public—and I want to make that very clear. It is clear, however, that the vast majority of dental practitioners affected by these audits do not fall into this category. We have made repeated representations to government on behalf of the affected dentists, and we are pleased that we have finally seen some major progress on this front. During Senate estimates on 29 May this year, the Minister for Human Services, Senator Kim Carr, made the following statement:


It is our view that we need a retrospective change to the dental services determination within the near future that creates greater flexibility about the compliance arrangements, while still protecting important principles of public policy. This retrospective change to the determination would bring the compliance arrangements more closely into line with other parts of Medicare and would allow for a more educative approach to be used by the department.


This means that the government are seeking to change the regulation that will enable them to revisit all the audits and change the determinations made in those cases where a significant injustice has been done. The Greens will support this through the parliament and ensure that all dentists who have delivered genuine services are assisted with education rather than the recovery of benefits paid for services that have already been delivered.


The bill that we are debating now, the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2], which the coalition has brought into the parliament, would compel the minister to take action on this issue. Although we strongly support the intent of the bill, there are concerns that the bill is structured in a way that would not achieve its aims. In light of the minister's announcement and as a show of good faith we have been trying to talk to the government on their proposed solution. We understand that this is very close to a resolution and continue to believe that the government are acting in good faith on this issue. At the moment we are in the position where we believe that it is better to support the government in their ongoing resolution of this problem as we believe that they are very close to its resolution and we are in fact taking in good faith the government's commitment that they are very close to a resolution. If however they do not deliver this in the very near future, we believe that we will need to either revisit this bill with amendments so that it is structured correctly or in fact support the introduction of a new bill. This is putting the onus back on the government to resolve this issue in the very near future.


As we have always said, the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme is far from perfect.


However, we have voted in the past with the coalition to not support the destruction of this scheme and for the retention of this scheme because this has been the only scheme that has delivered dental services to the most vulnerable people in our community and has genuinely delivered change to people suffering from chronic disease. This is in some cases the first time these people have been able to access dental treatment. So we have very strongly demonstrated our commitment to this dental scheme and the support of the most vulnerable people in our community.


We have never said that this scheme is perfect. There have been some concerns with it. We remain committed to reform of dental care for Australians because, while this scheme was a step in the right direction, it has not gone to the full extent of the reform that is needed. We strongly believe that no scheme will succeed unless the dental profession is properly consulted, fully engaged and strongly supportive of any new scheme. Finding a way to fix this problem with Medicare and the CDDS is critical to maintaining a good relationship with the dental health profession. Although this cannot make up for the terrible months of stress and uncertainty that those in the dental profession and dentists who have been subject to these audit processes have been through, we hope that the move that the government has underway will resolve the issue and allow dentists to get back to what they do best, which is providing the necessary treatment to our community. We will not be supporting the bill. That is on the understanding—and I am very strongly eyeballing the government—that the government is in the process of resolving this most stressful situation for our dentists.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:31):  I am disappointed to hear that the Greens will not be supporting the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2]. I do acknowledge that in the past the Greens have been on our side, which is the correct side when it comes to remedying some of the deficiencies in dental health servicing. It seems that the Greens support for the Labor-Greens alliance has overridden what I previously understood was the strong support of the Greens for this program, acknowledging that it is not perfect. It was the Greens who helped us implement this and I am very disappointed that political considerations by the Greens have now interfered and have caused them to indicate they will not be voting with us.


It seems that the reason the Labor Party are opposed to this is purely the fact that it was a great scheme introduced by Tony Abbott and heaven forbid that the Labor Party should ever agree with anything that Tony Abbott should do. It was good to see the Labor Party backing down humiliatingly and agreeing with Tony Abbott on offshore processing. I just wish they would do that in relation to this bill before the chamber.


There are a number of others from our side who want to speak on this bill but we are very keen to bring this debate to a close so we can get a vote. I know Senator Bushby, who introduced the bill, has some comments he wants to make. So regrettably my comments will be very brief. I did want to refer to the contribution made by my fellow Queenslander, Senator Jan McLucas from the Labor Party. There was one thing in Senator McLucas's speech that I agreed with. That was when she praised the James Cook University dental school in Cairns on the great work it is doing in providing the support and tuition for those who will go out and help.


Senator McLucas talked about fraud amongst the dentistry profession. The coalition have made it very clear that there have been perhaps a couple of genuine cases but, as Senator Back has pointed out, there have been many cases where honest, god-fearing dentists who do a great job and make a great contribution towards their society have been penalised by an over-zealous Medicare police unit for things which—no matter which way you look at them—were simply minor omissions as to the red tape that Medicare imposes. Compare that with, for example, the four years that it took Fair Work Australia to investigate the member for Dobell. In that case, this government ensured that the investigation and prosecutions went on for years. Compare the alleged offences, the things that Fair Work Australia eventually found Mr Thomson had done, with some of the things that dentists have done—for example, the incident Senator Back raised. If Mr Thomson had been prosecuted with the same enthusiasm and vehemence as these dentists who have made some error in the clerical work, there would have been an election by now because Mr Thomson would have been out on his ear and a by-election would have meant that a full election was needed.


The duplicity of the Labor Party lies in how they treat prosecutions of almost innocent dentists on the one hand and how they deal with Mr Thomson' case on the other hand. Senator McLucas was accusing the dental profession of fraud. There were a couple of incidents but, if you go on that principle, do you say that Mr Thomson being a Labor Party MP has allegedly—according to Fair Work Australia—defrauded the country, defrauded his union? Does that mean that we should not allow into parliament any Labor Party parliamentarian who ever worked for a union? It is the same sort of convoluted logic that you get from this government. You talk about fraud. A dentist does not fill in the form properly and he is in real trouble with the authorities.


Ms Gillard gets up before Australians, promises to every Australian, 'You vote for me, you make me Prime Minister, and I will not bring in a carbon tax'. And you talk about fraud? What even the worst of the dentists have done cannot compare with that sort of fraudulent act. Again, last night Ms Gillard, in addressing the AMA, deliberately told untruths about breast screening and Queensland. Is that a worse offence than some dentist who does not fill in the forms correctly? The duplicity of the Labor Party in its approach to administration knows no bounds.


Mr Deputy President, I did have a lot of things I wanted to say on this bill, but unfortunately time has beaten me. I say on the record that I concur with all of the remarks made by colleagues on this side of the chamber, and I urge the chamber to support Senator Bushby's bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:38):  I start first by thanking senators on both sides of the chamber for their contributions to the debate on the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012 [No. 2], but I would like to express my disappointment at the contributions and the approach taken by both the government and the Greens on this matter. From the government's perspective, the minister himself has acknowledged that the treatment of some of the dentists involved under this scheme was unfair, and he has indicated as far back as during May estimates that he would be taking action to redress that. So there was a clear acknowledgement that there were problems, there were issues.


Presented today is a clear and easy way of fixing that. The fact that it has taken at least three months to try to address it in the way the minister is trying to do it, with still no resolution, no indication at all about how or what is going to occur, shows that the government is having some challenges in the approach it is taking to fix this. And yet here before us today we have the bill which will fix it. It will address the injustice that dentists across Australia have faced as a result of the appalling approach the government has taken to dealing with the minor transgressions that occurred in their administrative approach to the scheme.


From the Greens' perspective—Senator Di Natale has been a champion for these dentists. Here we have today an opportunity for the Greens to support a resolution that dentists around the country require urgently. There are dentists around the country who have faced issues that have led to them thinking about committing suicide. There are dentists around the country who have debts hanging over their heads, who are looking at bankruptcy, who are waiting for a resolution. They cannot sit around and wait for the government. As Senator Siewert has just said, they cannot take on faith that the government is going to do the right thing, because as of now the government has done absolutely nothing other than make a short statement through the medium of estimates. I am particularly disappointed that those on the other side of the chamber have used this debate as an opportunity to further perpetuate misinformation in relation to the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. They have failed to acknowledge the essence of what this bill seeks to achieve, and instead hijacked the debate to suit their own political agenda.


I introduced this bill into the Senate to redress the injustice that the government has inflicted upon the nation's dental health professionals. When I introduced this bill, I did so because I wanted the parliament to examine the wrongdoings perpetrated by this government against the many dentists in this country who have acted in good faith and provided dental services to Australians under the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. I did not introduce this bill seeking a debate on the pros or the cons of that scheme. Nor did I introduce this bill seeking a debate on who in this parliament has the best dental scheme. This is an issue that is now well beyond grubby political point-scoring, and now is not the time for one-upmanship. Now is the time to address this issue and reach a conclusive solution, and the opportunity is here today if the Greens join with us to make that happen.


In fact, the intentions of this bill are not entirely removed from Minister Kim Carr's own announcement in May that retrospective change to the legislation is required to address the issues in relation to the audit processes. But Labor clearly does not want to take this opportunity to redress their own wrongdoings against Australian dentists who have been penalised for unwitting mistakes that they have made when working under this program. That is blatantly obvious from Labor's total inaction, as I mentioned, since Minister Kim Carr's announcement in May.


Instead, Labor's senators have used the time for this debate to stand up in this chamber to try to trash the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and shamelessly promote their own dental policy. In her speech in this debate last sittings, Senator Urquhart went into great detail to outline the measures this government is planning to revolutionise publicly funded dental care, which would all be well and good if it were actually relevant to the issue we are here to discuss today—that is, their own incompetence and mismanagement of the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It is an issue that, if this government refuses to face up to it, will prove prohibitive to them implementing any further public dental schemes in the future.


The dental profession is rightly irate with this government over the handling of this scheme. Even Senator Moore conceded in her speech that dentists have withdrawn from practising under the scheme as a result of the audit process. If the Labor Party do not actively seek to engage with dentists now to address the profession's concerns and implement a legislative solution to this problem, they will struggle to find in future any dentist who will be willing to participate in any further government initiatives in this area.


But instead, during debate in the last sitting period, Labor senators spoke on anything but their own mismanagement of the scheme. Senator Bilyk said:


If we could free up the money for this flawed scheme, we could provide investment in dental services where it is really needed, because we all know that it is difficult for Australians in rural and remote areas to access dental services.


She went on to say that it was 'a scheme which is not targeted or means tested and which has not serviced Australians in need'.


This is not true. I urge Labor senators to check their facts. This scheme has been accessed by close to one million Australians. And as Senator Di Natale informed the chamber when he spoke on this bill, 80 per cent of those one million patients are concession cardholders. This does not really stack up with Labor's claims that the scheme is being used by millionaires. In fact, many patients of the scheme, on hearing of this government's desperate attempt to claw back from dentists moneys under this scheme, wrote to and phoned their dentists out of concern. I have had patients of the scheme phoning my office to tell me how upset they are by the way that their dentist has been treated. And patients of the scheme even went as far as making submissions to the Senate inquiry, writing in to tell the committee how much of the dental care they received under the scheme assisted in improving their overall health and lifestyle. Senator Bilyk and her colleagues are wrong; the scheme is assisting Australians in need and Australians in regional and rural areas.


Tasmanian dentist Dr Wilma Johnson was practising under the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme in the Huon Valley region, a rural area just over 30 kilometres from Senator Bilyk's own electorate office. Dr Johnson was prepared to work in a rural area that is notoriously difficult to staff. She showed me before and after photos of some of the work she has conducted, and I can assure Senator Bilyk that her patients, Senator Bilyk's constituents, were definitely in need of the dental services she provided for them under the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, dental services that undoubtedly contributed to the patients' greater overall health and less dependence on the public health system as a result, and services that the patients themselves would not have been able to fund. I am surprised that Senator Bilyk did not know this already and that she made those ill-informed statements in her speech last sittings, especially as that particular example is from her own constituency, less than a one-hour drive from her electorate office.


What has Dr Wilma Johnson received for her trouble and hard work? A bill from the Commonwealth in excess of $24,000—just because she failed to fill in a form prior to conducting the treatment. The treatment provided was necessary and completed to a high standard. The patients are happy, they received the services and, in fact, some of Dr Johnson's patients called my office to tell me so. None of her patients were financially disadvantaged as a result of their treatment. Indeed, in some instances, Dr Johnson provided additional work on a pro bono basis. So why is it that this government has been so relentless in pursuing Dr Johnson for over $24,000, a figure that represents more than three times her earnings as a part-time employee in a rural Tasmanian dental practice? There were hundreds of other cases just like this all over the country, and on each occasion the timing of the completion of paperwork has had no impact on patient care or financial outcomes. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the dentists who were found non-compliant in the audit process have provided legitimate care to patients in need entirely in accordance with the terms of the scheme but for minor and incidental requirements.


Presented today is a bill which gives this place an opportunity to redress those injustices, an opportunity to ensure that dentists like Dr Wilma Johnson and hundreds of dentists in a similar position, right across Australia, can have the concern, the worry and the imposition that has been placed upon them by unfair bills to claw back the money paid for services that they did deliver. We are not talking here about cases of people who are defrauding the Commonwealth. We are talking about cases where they would legitimately be entitled to claim these funds if only they had dotted the 'i' or crossed the 't' properly for services that they actually did deliver. It is not a case of fraud; it is a case of minor administrative mistakes. As a result, these people are suffering. We have the opportunity today to redress that injustice and I urge the Senate to support the bill.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:15):  by leave—The coalition has always supported horizontal fiscal equalisation of GST revenue. Indeed, without the coalition there would be no GST to distribute. That is not the issue. The issue for Labor is that its senators and ministers are voting in direct contradiction of its cabinet decision to hold a review of GST distribution—a review which, in paragraph 5 of their self-drafted terms of reference, countenances 'possible changes to the form of equalisation'. So Labor is either pre-empting its own review or defying cabinet solidarity by ruling out any changes.


The coalition, like Labor, is committed to horizontal fiscal equalisation. The coalition, unlike Labor, is committed to awaiting the outcome of Labor's own review.

  I understand that the government will support this amendment. I think that is a good idea, because it would have been quite peculiar if in the context of this inquiry there had not been the provision for any related matter, because that could well have given the Labor chair the opportunity to rule any questions in relation to a carbon tax as not being relevant to the terms of reference of the inquiry. That would have appeared, I think, as though the government was prepared to canvass each and every issue in relation to the cost of electricity except for the carbon tax. So I think it is a good thing the government is agreeing to support this. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that it was an oversight rather than a decision to consciously exclude discussion of the carbon tax.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (12:33):  I continue the comments that I was making last night on the Greens disallowance motion for the TACs for the small pelagic fishery.


When I was speaking last night, the last issue that I was talking about was the press release that the Greens member in Tasmania, Mr Kim Booth, their primary industries spokesman, put out subsequent to the passing of a motion in the Tasmanian parliament, and the fact that that press release completely misrepresented the motion that was passed through the house. In fact, that press release completely omits item (3) of the motion that passed the house, which says:


(3) Recognises the need for a balanced approach between the needs of a sustainable commercial fishing industry, access for recreational fishers and appropriate marine conservation outcomes.


The key point was completely missed off the press release that Mr Booth put out. In fact, the press release is headed, 'Greens secure tripartisan support to oppose the trawler', and the word 'opposition' does not appear in the motion that was passed through the house at all, and again goes to show the lengths to which the Greens are prepared to go to misrepresent not only the circumstances as to this fishery but also what is happening in the Tasmanian parliament.


I might add that the Greens member, Mr Booth, came into the Tasmanian house later in the evening, after all the papers had been put to bed, to make a correction, so I will give him the credit for that. But I must note that on reading through the Hansard and listening to what was said that it was all a bit of a joke. 'Oh, sorry—we made a mistake!' Do Greens make mistakes? 'Oh, yes, occasionally we might make a mistake.' It was treated very light-heartedly by the Greens, very offhandedly. Yes, they made the correction but the spirit of that correction, I have to say, needs to be questioned. And, of course, what happens in the media this morning? The misrepresented facts in the original press release appear in all the newspapers, because they had all been put to bed and stories had been written before the Greens came into the house during the adjournment last night—which they quite rightly did. Let us give them credit for that. They came into the house after the stories were written and the original press release was reported in all the newspapers in Tasmania this morning.


I go back to the concerns that I talked about that exist within the recreational fishing sector and the broader community in Tasmania. I said last night in my contribution that I did acknowledge those concerns. And one of the things that I think the government has completely failed to do is to talk to the community, provide some leadership and tell them how Australian fisheries management has changed in the last 10 or 15 years.


I spoke last night of the harvest strategies that have been put into place. One other thing that we need to consider is that those harvest strategies are subject to the conditions of the EPBC Act. We have a number of layers of protection for Australia's fisheries in Australia and a number of approaches to ensure that we do not mismanage Australia's fisheries because of the importance of seafood to our global food task. Twenty-five per cent of the globe's protein comes from fisheries. A full quarter of the protein that we consume around the globe comes from fisheries. If you were to replace that with grass-fed protein, you would have to cut down the globe's forests 22 times over to replace the protein that comes from the oceans. So it is an absolutely vital protein source. We need to make sure that we manage it properly and sustainably, and those approaches are built into the way that we manage our fisheries in Australia. 


So we have the EPBC Act. We have an umbrella harvest strategy across all fisheries subject to the EPBC Act and then we have sub-harvest strategies for individual fisheries as part of that process to make sure that we take into account all of the provisions that we need to as part of the management of our fisheries. So as I said last night, in the small pelagic fishery the maximum that you can take with the latest possible data is 20 per cent of the biomass, remembering that the latest ling fish report published in April this year said that you could fish it down to 40 per cent of the biomass with good information. 


Yet none of that is recognised and none of that has been put on the table by the government or the Greens. The Greens you would expect it from, but the government did not even put this information in front of the panel that was discussing with industry localised depletion. None of that information was put there. No wonder they walked out. They were asking for information and it was not made available to them. I really do not understand why the government has not been prepared to go out and seek information and to actually allow the community to have a better understanding of where this overall fishery stands and the precautions that are in place to ensure that we do not overfish and to make sure that this vessel does not—and I do not believe it will—cause any grief to the fishery. Minister Burke has talked about issues around seals. This company has video of seals swimming into the net through the seal excluder device, having a feed of fish and then swimming back out again. So the seals have actually learned how to interact with the vessel, and there is video of that. None of that was put on the table. These conversations should have been undertaken by the government with industry, yet they were not.


That is why this process is where it is now. That is why there is such a high level of community concern. That is why it is possible for the Greens to whip up a frenzy, concern and fear, as they are doing in our community at home. The government has not provided the leadership required, and it was very pleasing to hear two of the scientists who were authors of the report that was discussed yesterday on radio in Tasmania starting to allay those fears.


Mr Acting Deputy President, it is a real tragedy that we have got to this stage. I am pleased to see that the minister is coming down to say something about this. That is important. But there is a lot of information available and for those who are concerned, those who would like to get some of that information, I have a number of these reports—everything that I have been able to get hold of is on my website—and I invite people to have a look at those to allay their concerns.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:40):  I welcome the debate on Senator Whish-Wilson's motion to disallow the total allowable catch in the small pelagic fishery. I understand that there is significant community concern about this matter and some of that concern that has been raised does appear to be legitimate. Other concerns are informed by claims which are at best loosely connected to the facts and that is why I do welcome the debate on this matter. It is unfortunate that this debate is about disallowing the total allowable catch determined on advice from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, yet we have hardly talked about the process AFMA undertook to get to that capped limit. For the benefit of the Senate, I intend to outline how our fisheries are managed and also I will take the opportunity to provide advice on some of the facts that have been missing from the contribution so far. 


Australia has a world-class fisheries management system. Our fisheries are managed by independent experts and are based on the best scientific information available. An independent agency, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of our fisheries and it does so exceptionally well. AFMA was established in 1991 and is responsible for fulfilling several objectives concerning the ecologically sustainable management of Australian fisheries. In particular I take you to the management act itself, and it states that the minister and AFMA must ensure that the exploitation of fishery resources and the carrying out of any related activities are conducted in a manner consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development which include the exercise of the precautionary principle and in particular the need to have regard to the impact of our fishing activities on non-targeted and the long-term sustainability of the marine environment. Secondly, it goes on to say that it must ensure, through proper conservation and management measures, that the living resources of the Australian Fishing Zone are not endangered by overexploitation.


The AFMA Commission sets responsible and sustainable stock catch limits for 56 stocks across eight fisheries with another two still managed on effort. The commissioners are experts in the field and, by design, the commissioners cannot hold any executive position in a fishing industry association, neither can they have a controlling interest or executive role in any entity holding a Commonwealth fishery concession. 


Enforcing and managing those fisheries is AFMA. From all reports and from the experience I have had with them over the two years, AFMA is a truly tough cop on the beat. They make tough decisions to support the sustainability of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery and they took the tough decision to respond to unacceptable bycatch of sea lions in the Gillnet Hook and Trap Fishery. I have had many conversations with the commercial fishers who tell me almost unanimously of the strictness of AFMA, who base their decision-making on the science that is available to them.


I have remarked before that the role that AFMA plays is invaluable but, equally, unenviable. Australian fisheries management is world class and it can benefit all Australians now and into the future. Sustainable catch limits provide more resources for more users over a longer period. Our fisheries are consistently rated as amongst the best internationally. This is a reputation that has been hard fought for over many years of successive ministers and successive governments. Dr Daniel Pauly of the University of British Columbia has recently ranked Australian fisheries second out of—

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  The coalition have long supported the establishment of an investment manager regime as recommended by the Johnson report into Australia as a financial centre, and we support this bill. This investment manager regime will help facilitate Australia's world-class financial services industry to grow the export of their services to overseas investors, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.


This Tax Laws Amendment (Investment Manager Regime) Bill 2012 establishes an investment manager regime that provides clarity on the tax treatment of income derived by widely held overseas based funds where those funds use an Australian based fund manager to invest in overseas based assets. Such income would not be subject to Australian taxation solely because the overseas based fund chose to use an Australian based fund manager to manage its investments where the actual investment is made outside Australia. These changes will apply from 2010-11 onwards.


This bill also clarifies the tax treatment of income received for 2010-11 and previous income years by foreign funds that have not lodged a tax return in Australia and that have not previously had an assessment made of their income tax liability. This change is required to assist overseas funds to comply with the unintended consequences of recent changes to US accounting rules known as FIN 48. Without these changes the application of these US rules would create a potential tax liability in Australia for overseas based funds on income that was previously not considered to be taxable and had not been taxed in Australia.


This bill will provide clarity and certainty on the tax treatment of portfolio investment income of overseas managed funds. The changes will enhance Australia's attractiveness as an investment destination and will benefit Australian financial services businesses. These changes have some retrospective effect; however, the retrospectivity on this occasion is beneficial to the taxpayers concerned.


This bill introduces two elements of an investment manager regime in Australia. The third element required to fully establish the investment manager regime has yet to be announced by the government. The establishment of this investment manager regime was, as I said, one of the centrepieces of the Johnson report recommendations on Australia as a financial centre released in January 2010. The coalition has supported the recommendations made by the Johnson report, including the establishment of this investment manager regime.


Minister Shorten first announced that he would legislate to introduce this investment manager regime back in December 2010 and again in January 2011. It has taken some time, but we do congratulate the government for having finally brought this legislation forward, because for the past 18 months Australian fund managers have continuously told the government that overseas investors will only invest in Australia once this legislation has passed the parliament. The Johnson report highlighted that the sooner we act the sooner we will empower our financial services sector to access the growing markets on our doorstep and establish Australia as a genuinely world-class financial services hub.


The establishment of an investment manager regime is also strongly supported by Australia's financial services industry and, in particular, the Financial Services Council. It will be particularly beneficial to smaller, specialised and 'boutique' Australian fund managers. In the past, larger fund managers have been able to establish offshore operations in other financial centres such as New York, Luxembourg, Singapore or Hong Kong to get around export barriers of Australia's tax system. However, this has never been a cost-effective option for smaller yet highly sophisticated and very talented Australian fund managers. These smaller players will now be able to compete more effectively against both larger locally based competitors and overseas competitors, which of course will enhance choice and competition in the Australian market.


The coalition is very supportive of ongoing efforts to make Australia into a genuine financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific region. This is a very good step forward, but there is still much work to be done. The Johnson report did provide a very clear and positive road map for the way forward. I do hope that the government, in the time that is left between now and the election, will start prioritising the implementation of some of the other recommendations in that report. Having quite a high-quality, world-class financial services sector here in Australia, we are not fully tapping into that potential because we do actually have comparatively low levels of cross-border transactions and comparatively low levels of exports in financial services when compared to similar nations. These are the sorts of initiatives that will be required in order to grow that particular sector of the economy more strongly and, in the process, help to strengthen our economy moving forward. With those few words I commend this bill to the Senate.

This Tax Laws Amendment (Investment Manager Regime) Bill 2012 establishes an investment manager regime that provides clarity on the tax treatment of income derived by widely held overseas based funds where those funds use an Australian based fund manager to invest in overseas based assets. Such income would not be subject to Australian taxation solely because the overseas based fund chose to use an Australian based fund manager to manage its investments where the actual investment is made outside Australia. These changes will apply from 2010-11 onwards.


This bill also clarifies the tax treatment of income received for 2010-11 and previous income years by foreign funds that have not lodged a tax return in Australia and that have not previously had an assessment made of their income tax liability. This change is required to assist overseas funds to comply with the unintended consequences of recent changes to US accounting rules known as FIN 48. Without these changes the application of these US rules would create a potential tax liability in Australia for overseas based funds on income that was previously not considered to be taxable and had not been taxed in Australia.


This bill will provide clarity and certainty on the tax treatment of portfolio investment income of overseas managed funds. The changes will enhance Australia's attractiveness as an investment destination and will benefit Australian financial services businesses. These changes have some retrospective effect; however, the retrospectivity on this occasion is beneficial to the taxpayers concerned.


This bill introduces two elements of an investment manager regime in Australia. The third element required to fully establish the investment manager regime has yet to be announced by the government. The establishment of this investment manager regime was, as I said, one of the centrepieces of the Johnson report recommendations on Australia as a financial centre released in January 2010. The coalition has supported the recommendations made by the Johnson report, including the establishment of this investment manager regime.


Minister Shorten first announced that he would legislate to introduce this investment manager regime back in December 2010 and again in January 2011. It has taken some time, but we do congratulate the government for having finally brought this legislation forward, because for the past 18 months Australian fund managers have continuously told the government that overseas investors will only invest in Australia once this legislation has passed the parliament. The Johnson report highlighted that the sooner we act the sooner we will empower our financial services sector to access the growing markets on our doorstep and establish Australia as a genuinely world-class financial services hub.


The establishment of an investment manager regime is also strongly supported by Australia's financial services industry and, in particular, the Financial Services Council. It will be particularly beneficial to smaller, specialised and 'boutique' Australian fund managers. In the past, larger fund managers have been able to establish offshore operations in other financial centres such as New York, Luxembourg, Singapore or Hong Kong to get around export barriers of Australia's tax system. However, this has never been a cost-effective option for smaller yet highly sophisticated and very talented Australian fund managers. These smaller players will now be able to compete more effectively against both larger locally based competitors and overseas competitors, which of course will enhance choice and competition in the Australian market.


The coalition is very supportive of ongoing efforts to make Australia into a genuine financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific region. This is a very good step forward, but there is still much work to be done. The Johnson report did provide a very clear and positive road map for the way forward. I do hope that the government, in the time that is left between now and the election, will start prioritising the implementation of some of the other recommendations in that report. Having quite a high-quality, world-class financial services sector here in Australia, we are not fully tapping into that potential because we do actually have comparatively low levels of cross-border transactions and comparatively low levels of exports in financial services when compared to similar nations. These are the sorts of initiatives that will be required in order to grow that particular sector of the economy more strongly and, in the process, help to strengthen our economy moving forward. With those few words I commend this bill to the Senate.

I refer the minister to the repeated warnings of BHP Billiton about the effect on the viability of the Olympic Dam project of the government's policies and, in particular, the warning from the chairman of BHP Billiton, Mr Jacques Nasser, who said on 16 May:


I cannot overstate how the level of certainty about Australia's tax system is generating negative investor reaction. People don't know where they are going.


Given the government failed to heed the warnings about the disastrous impact of its mining tax and carbon tax on Olympic Dam, will the minister now apologise to the people of South Australia for costing them a $30 billion mining investment, the most significant in the state's history, and costing South Australia over 13,000 new jobs?

 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:01):  I am asked about Olympic Dam. As a South Australian I am very happy to talk about Olympic Dam. I am somewhat surprised that no South Australian Liberal senator wanted to ask me about Olympic Dam. We have a Queenslander asking. I am also asked about uncertainty. Let us be very clear that any uncertainty that is created in relation to the investment environment is because Mr Abbott is making clear he wants to remove a mining tax that the miners are prepared to pay.


But I want to go precisely to the issue of Olympic Dam because I, like every other South Australian, except perhaps some in the Greens, was deeply disappointed with the decision of BHP Billiton to defer investment. The only people who are cheering that decision are those opposite and Mr Abbott—a disgraceful attempt to use this decision to fuel their dishonest fear campaign.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, resume your seat. When there is silence on both sides we will proceed.




Senator WONG:
  I refer the good senator to the statement released by BHP Billiton in relation to this decision, the statement his leader could not be bothered reading before he stood up at a press conference with South Australians to talk about how dreadful it was that everything else had stopped Olympic Dam. The press release from BHP Billiton—a statement to investors, to shareholders and to the market; a statement that can be believed—says that:


… current market conditions, including subdued commodity prices and higher capital costs, has led to this decision.


There is no mention of the carbon price, no mention of the mining tax, which, if those opposite paid any attention, they would know does not apply to the output of Olympic Dam. Those opposite should be ashamed of the way they have dealt with— (Time expired)

But I am very happy to answer the question about the mining boom. Minister Ferguson is absolutely right when he says the mining boom, in terms of the commodity prices that we have seen, is over, which is why the government have factored that assumption into our budget. That is why the budget assumes the terms of trade will step down—because we understand that the elevated prices that we have seen for Australia's commodities over these last few years cannot continue. That is why we have factored that into the budget.


There is no suggestion that the investment pipeline is somehow turned off. We have half a trillion dollars of investment in the pipeline in the resources sector in this country. Over 50 per cent of that is at the advanced stage. The opposition do not want to hear that. They want to talk down the economy. They want to talk down South Australia. They do not like to defend Australian jobs. (Time expired)

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, to questions asked by Senators Brandis, Cormann, Birmingham and Bernardi in question time today relating to the Olympic Dam project.


There are times when one can be slightly embarrassed for their fellow senators—and today was one of those times for many South Australians. That is because during Minister Wong's bilious diatribe against the coalition side, who asked some genuine and probing questions with regard to Olympic Dam and the decision by BHP Billiton to delay or to stop any further investment in an expansion of that, she mocked and derided the fact that only two South Australian senators asked her questions about it. Well, let me just say this: not one, single Labor or Greens senator asked any questions about perhaps the most profound economic decision by a single company in my state's history.




Senator Edwards:
  In Australia's.




Senator BERNARDI:
  Probably in Australia's, as Senator Edwards said. You can perhaps excuse the Greens on some level because yesterday, as a $30 billion investment in South Australia—which would have generated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of proceeds to government and led to tens of thousands of jobs and 100 years of economic prosperity, according to the former Labor Premier of South Australia—the Greens cheered. They cheered at the delay of it. They cheered because it was not proceeding. It was one of the most nauseatingly self-serving cheers that I have ever heard in this place—followed only by Senator Wong's triumphant sneering that South Australians on this side of the chamber were not asking questions. Well, not one Labor senator did either—and that is a shameful fact for all South Australian senators on the other side of the chamber. I know there are two of them sitting here now ready to defend their minister—about whom they can secretly only be embarrassed about, as the rest of us are. And the embarrassment is compounded by the complete lack of a coherent, thoughtful or considered response by Minister Wong.


We on this side of the chamber have had four years worth of experience as Minister Wong has plodded through a number of portfolios—without distinction—but today was shameful. I asked a very simple question. I asked: will the minister simply confirm whether the carbon tax makes it cheaper for BHP Billiton to pursue the Olympic Dam expansion or more expensive? I only met with abuse. I only met with abuse because Senator Wong was not prepared to answer the question. This should concern all of us, because not only is this chamber meant to get answers to very straightforward and simple questions; it was a question that the minister has spent four years preparing herself for.


She went to Copenhagen as the climate change minister. She stood by as her Prime Minister told an abject and wilful lie to the Australian people before the last election and she defended the breaking of that promise that was made before the election. She scrapped the citizens assembly, the cash for clunkers and everything else. She stood by and celebrated as the head of the Australian Workers Union, Paul Howse, said that not one single job will be lost because of this carbon tax—and he put his house on the line. But we know all about houses and the Australian Workers Union, don't we, Mr Deputy President? We know all about that. It would not be his house; some poor flunky who has been paying his union dues for all these years would have been subsidising his house through one of these slush funds—and, according to the Prime Minister, whom I might say was young and naive when she said it, all union bosses have slush funds for their re-election. And we are about to hear from a couple in a moment. For a start, Senator Farrell, is going to get up. Maybe he can enlighten us about that and his credit card usage.



Senator Edwards interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  That is exactly right: Senator Farrell, have you ever had Bill the Greek come and do a fence for you? That is what we would like to know.


This is perhaps the most significant thing that has happened in South Australia. A lot of South Australians have got behind this project. But it was dismissed in such a cavalier manner, when this is so clearly an impact of Australia becoming a high-cost jurisdiction. No matter how polite BHP Billiton may want to be because they are scared of the retribution of this vindictive and nasty government, the fact is that if wage costs are going up and the cost of capital is going up and if you have got additional taxes, mineral resource rent taxes and carbon taxes, being imposed, the cost of the Olympic Dam expansion is going to go up as well. They have simply made a decision, with a limited amount of capital, and said: 'We will invest it where we will get the best return.' Unfortunately for all South Australians it is now going offshore thanks to this government.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2012-08-23,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (15:12):  I will just deal with that last point first—the high costs of mining that Senator Bernardi refers to in Australia. The fact of the matter is that the reason that wages have gone up in the mining industry is that there has been a mining boom. That is what has pushed up the cost of labour in the mining industry. We have had the largest mining boom in our history. That has been good for the country, but it does have an impact—and, of course, it has had some impact on the Olympic Dam development. What I am concerned about is the delight that Senator Bernardi appears to exhibit in the fact that this particular development has not been proceeded with at this stage.


He says that as a South Australian senator I should be embarrassed about the performance of Senator Wong. I have never been embarrassed about the performance of Senator Wong, and I certainly was not embarrassed about her performance today. She is a great minister.




Senator Bernardi:
  That says a lot about you!




Senator FARRELL:
  It does say a lot about me. If I were Senator Bernardi and Mr Abbott was my leader, I can tell you that I would have been significantly embarrassed about the performance that he delivered on the 7.30 program last evening.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  If anybody is going to be embarrassed in this debate, Senator Bernardi, it is going to be you and your party about Mr Abbott's performance. Let us go back to yesterday afternoon. What did Mr Kloppers say was the reason for not proceeding at this stage with Olympic Dam?



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  The fact that Senator Bernardi continues to interrupt—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Bernardi. You have had your turn. Senator Farrell, you have the call. 




Senator FARRELL:
  Thank you for that protection, Mr Deputy President. What did Mr Kloppers say was the reason? He talked about current market conditions including subdued market prices. One of the things he did not talk about as the impetus for not proceeding was the mining tax. The reason he did not talk about the mining tax was that he knew what Mr Abbott did not know when he gave that 7.30 interview last night. What sort of mine is Olympic Dam ? It is not a coalmine, it is not an iron ore mine




Senator Abetz:
  It is not a mine at all, thanks to you.




Senator FARRELL:
  I absolutely reject that. Olympic Dam is a great project in South Australia. It continues to be a great project and one of these days that project will continue to expand. The fact is that Olympic Dam continues to employ people in South Australia, it continues to pay royalties to South Australia and it will be one of Australia's great projects. What I do not understand—after what Mr Kloppers said very clearly yesterday afternoon—is why Mr Abbott went on 7.30 last night and when asked a very clear question if he had actually read BHP's statement, he said, 'No, I haven't.' Mr Abbott goes on national television last night to exploit the fact that we have had this disappointing news—




Senator Birmingham:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: I think Senator Farrell is at serious risk of misleading the chamber by very selectively quoting the Leader of the Opposition's answer to questions he was asked last night.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. That is debating the issue. 




Senator FARRELL:
  I will respond to that, Deputy President. I will read out the entire quote from last night:


LEIGH SALES: I'm going on the facts that Marius Kloppers said today when he was directly asked if the decision on Olympic Dam was affected by Australia's tax situation and I'm going on the facts that are outlined in their results statement that they've issued. Have you actually read BHP's statement?

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (15:18):  I rise to take note of the answers by Senator Wong to questions from Senators Brandis, Cormann, Birmingham and Bernardi. There has been a lot of talk about who said what and who has read what. I think it is important that we get some of the facts on the table. It is a fact that Marius Kloppers said that the government has created a higher cost environment. It is a fact that BHP in their statement yesterday said that one of the reasons for the pullback was the weaker outlook for commodity prices and rising costs. On 16 May Jac Nasser said, 'I cannot overstate the level of uncertainty regarding tax.' In the statement on 22 August regarding results, BHP said that development and construction costs had surged by some $2.7 billion and a third of that was the result of labour and industrial action.


As one of my colleagues highlighted, some 3,500 BHP workers on strike contributed to that. What that says to people looking at investment is risk. You have to price risk into your business plan. It is instructive to note what other people in the same sectors—copper and gold—are looking at. PanAust, an Australian company, has copper operations around the world. It has statements on its website looking at the feasibility of a program in Chile. The No. 2 factor that they list is the cost of electricity. They say the development of the Inca de Oro project depends on competitively priced power and water.


South Australia, as we all know, currently has the world's highest electricity prices and before members opposite jump up and say, 'That is all to do with infrastructure,' the Essential Services Commission of South Australia has said that 25 per cent of the price rise is due to the carbon tax. Importantly, that is currently at $23 a tonne. The government's own modelling, which BHP is well aware of, says that the carbon tax is going to increase to $350 a tonne. So if we currently have the world's highest electricity prices with a carbon tax of $23 a tonne that has driven 25 per cent of the increase and that tax is going up to $350 a tonne over the life of the project which is the kind of time frame that BHP will be looking at, then is it any wonder that they say the project was canned because of rising costs. The article in the Australian Financial Review says:


… the federal government should understand that mining ""super profits"" are not guaranteed. Australia is in a competition with other resource-rich countries, and the BHP decision is a timely warning that we have allowed our cost base to increase too far and too fast thanks to our overregulated labour market and overbearing environmental regulations.


BHP Chairman Jac Nasser warned earlier this year that uncertainty surrounding our tax regime could deter investment.


As BHP looks at the life of this program, it looks at the fact that we already have the world's highest electricity prices here and we see from other players in the global market that power costs are its No. 2 consideration in the feasibility of projects. Is it any wonder that BHP, in its statement, quoted rising costs as one of the reasons that that project would be canned when this government is on track to raise the price per tonne of carbon from $23 to $350 in the future? It is a shame that this government does not think more about the future of South Australia, about the future of our children and their jobs and our economy than it does about the future of their current parliamentary term in coalition with their alliance partners, the Greens.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2012-08-23,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:23):  I would like to point out one fact: I am in agreement with Senator Bernardi about the contribution from Senator Ludlam last night—exulting in the fact that this proposal will mean there will be less uranium mined and exported from Australia. But that is probably the only point of agreement.


Those who know South Australia realise that copper is in its DNA. If you go to the formative days of the state, the copper mines of Burra underpinned the economy—Moonta, Wallaroo, the copper coast. The simple facts are—and I visit these places—Pirie, Port Augusta, Whyalla and Roxby are vibrant communities whose mines are very valuable contributors to the South Australian economy. There are more than 600 kids at primary school in Roxby. There are more than 4,000 people living there. It is one of the highest postcode earners of South Australia. It is a vibrant and continuous contributor to the South Australian economy.


The fact that it was going to undergo a tremendous multiyear development stage was highly anticipated by all of the surrounding communities and all of the people in South Australia. To my view, it was a bipartisan project with the total support of all South Australians. And to see today people playing politics and trying to get a political advantage over what is a disappointing decision, something that is going to delay the further development of our great state, is quite dissatisfying. I see people taking a short-term political advantage over what should be a bipartisan approach to get this project up and over the line. The development phase was four years. It took four years to dig down up to 500 metres to expose the ore burden.


I suppose it is worth putting on the record some of the things that have been said. It is really important that BHP has recognised that the South Australian government has been fully supportive of the Olympic Dam project and has created an environment that is highly conducive to business investment. We have been very much encouraged by their attitude to business development and the Olympic Dam expansion project. I know that Tom Koutsantonis and Premier Weatherill made every effort and moved every obstacle in the path of BHP's decision. Let us be fair dinkum about this: this is about the future of South Australia. Let us be fair dinkum: there is not a politician representing South Australia who would not do anything in their power to make this project go ahead.


But if iron ore is US$113 a tonne and it used to be US$180 a tonne, if BHP has had a 34 per cent reduction in profit, if they have made some decision worldwide which has cast into doubt their ability to expand $80 billion worth of capital around this country and the world, then don't be coming in here and saying, 'It's Minister Wong's fault'. Don't be coming in here and saying, 'It's all the Labor Party's fault.' This is a global, multinational business that, quite frankly, makes its decisions independently and irrespective of most of the governments it deals with. It has a responsibility to its stakeholders and shareholders to define its longer term development plans. This is a unique, world-class ore body.


As I said at the outset, copper particularly is in South Australia's DNA. Burra mines underpinned the development of the state. They stopped it from going bankrupt at one stage. It is my view that this BHP decision is a dramatic setback, but it is not the end of the journey. The ore body is still there. It is world class. The statements about industrial problems are absolutely ludicrous. There have been no impediments to a 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week efficient operation at Olympic Dam.

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:28):  I rise to support the motion to take note of answers given by Senator Wong to questions asked by Senators Brandis, Cormann, Birmingham and Bernardi. Don't go, Senator Gallacher, as I want to refer to your comments about the Burra mine saving South Australia from bankruptcy. I hope those words are not prophetic about the current state of affairs because, as you well know, South Australia has a $13 billion debt. I am sure that Senator Farrell has now run out to ring up Peter Malinauskas to start giving him his riding instructions for the Premier and the Treasurer of South Australia about how they are going to recast their budget in light of this decision, which for some reason has come as some complete shock until yesterday.


This has been the worst kept secret in South Australia. I refer you to a breakfast radio program on FIVEaa this morning with Keith Conlon and John Kenneally. A note from a caller:


I work up at Roxby on the expansion—


And, to all the people out there listening, Roxby is where Olympic Dam is—


My crew was demobbed on 21 July. That's about a month now, and we were told that BHP are delaying the expansion. I tried to contact the local federal ALP member, Nick Champion, but his office fobbed me off and claimed that I didn't know what I was talking about; it was just speculation. I told the guy there, 'This was real. I was working there. I was happy there. I did nothing wrong and now I am unemployed.'


That is the sentiment of what we are hearing now. As you say, Senator Gallacher, you travel around South Australia, as I do, and I am hearing, as are you, that there have been 600 jobs lost in Roxby Downs over the last two months.


I must refer to Senator Farrell's comments. He talked about the cost of mining in this country—that the high costs have driven BHP away from this decision. As we know, profits are up, which has driven wages growth, so what is going to happen now? We have profits up and wages up. The scenario that Senator Farrell put to us is that that is what has driven BHP away from this project. What is next? Profits down; wages down? I do not think so. And what do we have? As Senator Fawcett and Birmingham raised earlier, we had 3,500 BHP workers on strike in the Bowen Basin as recently as May this year. You have to understand that this has been the worst-kept secret in corporate Australia.


The BHP share price, up until two weeks ago, was sliding down and down, until such time as the corporate market realised: 'Well, they're not going to go ahead with this. They've given us a nod and a wink in the marketplace that they are going to announce at this time that they're not going to go ahead.' What has happened to the share price since? It has gone up. Again, today, the share price of BHP has risen on the strength of this announcement. What you on the other side have to understand is that you have carbon pricing—we call it a carbon tax—going out from $23 to $350 in the longer term. What do you think these companies think when they are doing their forward planning? Do they have that in Chile, in Russia, or in all these other places where they have these business opportunities? No, they do not, and you wonder why the capital shifts.


The other reason they cannot do it is the cost of capital. Why? Because if they borrow money in Australia they are competing with the Australian government to borrow funds. The cost of capital has gone up, which is also putting pressure on other businesses. You cannot consider Olympic Dam in the silo of BHP. BHP pays carbon tax all across its business in this country. Just to single it out and say, 'Well, they won't be paying carbon tax there,' is like trying to say, 'I'll sell milk bottles and snakes in my confectionery store and we will put all those in a profit silo each.' You just cannot do it. You take the money out of the till at the end of the day and that is what it is all about.


I do not know how Premier Weatherill is now going to task this debt that he has got. I am sure that he will be calling on his Labor colleagues now. He should have done that well before now and he should have told all of you South Australian Labor senators that this tax is not sustainable and it is going to continue to bring down our economy.

The answer read as follows--





SENATOR CONROY: On 22 August 2012 during question time, Senator Madigan asked me three questions as Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities concerning the Bald Hills Wind Farm, Victoria.




QUESTIONS





Question 1



In light of the fact that there is Commonwealth approval for the construction of the Bald Hills wind farm in the midst of a high conservation value bird sanctuary and wetlands area, home to 296 species of birds, 45 of which are listed in the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement, 40 of which are listed in the China-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement and three listed in the Bonn convention, this means that Australia is now in breach of our international obligations to protect those birds, their environment and habitats as per the relevant articles in those agreements. Will the minister advise what actions are being taken to call in this project, remove Commonwealth approval and bring Australia into compliance with our international obligations?




Question 2



As the conditions of approval agreed to by the Commonwealth in 2006 focus on locating and counting birds killed by the turbines and require the stopping of the turbines and taking mitigation measures to prevent future kills if just three of the listed bird species are killed, what mitigation measures does the minister believe could realistically be taken to stop bird mortality by turbines located in the midst of a bird sanctuary, flyway and migration route other than not building the wind farm?




Question 3



Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Considering that the research underpinning the Commonwealth's approval was so bad that the 2004 Victorian assessment panel found:


... at this stage insufficient information to allow proper assessment against the criteria of no impact on species listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act or the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act.


On what basis does the Commonwealth continue to uphold its 2006 approval?




RESPONSE: 





Question 1



Responsibility for wind farm approvals rests primarily with state and local governments. The Commonwealth is involved only where wind farm proposals impact on matters of national environmental significance.


The Bald Hills Wind Farm was approved by the then Minister, Senator Ian Campbell, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 on 21 December 2006.


While construction of turbines has commenced, the wind farm is not yet operational. There have been no bird mortalities as a result of this wind farm and consequently no action is required.




Question 2



In accordance with the conditions of approval for this project, a Bat and Avifauna Management Plan was approved on 17 July 2012.


The aim of the approved Bat and Avifauna Management Plan is to ensure that the operation of the Bald Hills Wind Farm will not prejudice the survival of populations of bat and bird species of concern.


The Bat and Avifauna Management Plan utilises an adaptive management framework that includes:


Reporting impacts to listed species


Investigation, evaluation and risk assessment of behaviour and the likelihood of further collisions.


Mitigation strategies such as habitat modification, bird deterrence measures, and temporary turbine shutdown for high risk periods and locations.


A copy of the Bat and Avifauna Management Plan is available from Minister Burke's office.




Question 3



The conditions of approval contain strict conditions relating to bird mortality, and the monitoring and mitigation of impacts to avifauna that must be carried out after operations commence.


There have been no bird mortalities as a result of this wind farm.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:42):  As I was saying, Dr Daniel Pauly of the University of British Columbia has recently ranked Australian fisheries second out of 53 countries for environmental sustainability. A report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation also recognised Australia's effective fishing management, particularly our actions to rebuild overfished stocks. Australian fisheries are not the fisheries of Europe or of Africa, or even of those of New Zealand. Some of the comparisons that have been raised in this debate between the proposal of an Australian business and an Australian independent fisheries management with statutory obligation are, frankly, unnecessary and, to some degree, alarmist.


The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Science—ABARES—in a 2010 fisheries status report shows the results of a continuous effort we have taken to guarantee we have healthy fish stocks. The report shows that in 2005 24 stocks were classified as overfished and/or subject to overfishing. In 2010 that number had fallen to just 13 stocks. In addition, the proportion of stocks whose status is uncertain has nearly halved since 2007 as a direct result of the policies of this Gillard Labor government.


I turn now to the small pelagic fishery, which seems to have raised people's concerns. This is the fishery where Seafish Tasmania has said it intends to exercise its fishing entitlements. The setting of catch limits in the small pelagic fishery are based on strong precautionary principle. Under the harvest strategy for this fishery, the catch limit is capped at a maximum of 20 per cent of the estimated available biomass, which takes into consideration both the species' productivity and the broader ecosystem impacts. This is a very conservative limit when compared to similar stocks in international fisheries. Even with that cap, the current management plan sets the quota to less than 10 per cent of spawning biomass estimates, leaving 90 per cent in the ocean. These stock limits are based on science and assessed by the experts. The arrangements meet or exceed the most rigorous scientific requirements for an ecologically sustainable fishery of this kind and take the precautionary principle to the appropriate level.


Many speakers in this debate have noted a paper released this week by some of Australia's top fisheries scientists—from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, the South Australian Research and Development Corporation and the CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Research Flagship. In this report, the scientists make it clear that the settings in the small pelagic fishery are conservative by world standards and sustainable for the environment. For the issue of localised depletion, the report states that the measures in place in the fishery:


.. taken together give confidence that food-web impacts of the SPF on predators and the SPF species themselves, including through localised depletion, are unlikely.


AFMA manages fisheries in real time and AFMA has the powers to take immediate action if and when required. As I have already stated, I am frequently reminded by commercial fishers how seriously AFMA takes its responsibilities in all fisheries.


I turn now to the issue of the proposed mid-water trawler, the FV Margiris. It is helpful if the Senate understands that there are a number of steps involved in bringing a fishing vessel into Australia and using it in an Australian fishery. In the first instance, a ship must be recognised as an Australian vessel. Presently, Seafish Tasmania has begun an application with the Australian Marine Safety Authority for the FV Margiris to be flagged as an Australian vessel. There are a range of steps that AMSA is required to undertake to grant that status. Next, every Australian fishing vessel seeking to operate in Commonwealth fisheries is required to be approved by AFMA. To date, AFMA has not received an application from the company, Seafish Tasmania, for that vessel to operate in a Commonwealth fishery.


The FV Margiris would, should it ask, be required to adhere to the strict management arrangements of the SPF, including carrying AFMA observers on board to monitor fishing activities; and using bycatch mitigation equipment, such as seal-excluder devices, logbook reporting, satellite vessel monitoring systems and mandatory reporting of any interactions with protected species. Obviously, there are other regulations that apply to fishing in Australian waters, one being the enforcement of the Commonwealth's marine reserve regime.


The disallowance motion being moved by the Greens is misplaced and could harm fisheries across Australian Commonwealth waters. Last night, Senator Siewert stated that she could not remember a time when recreational fishers stood side by side with her on an issue. For the record, there was a time when the Greens and NGOs stood for output controls and a move away from gear restrictions in fisheries management. They wanted to move to ensuring that we had output controls—the controls that we now have in place which determine total allowable catches for fishers based on independent expert advice—rather than gear restrictions: the size of a boat, the gear it uses and the effort. Everyone recognised that that type of operation where you regulate the gear was no longer relevant for today.


This disallowance motion is a message that the Greens political party do not support sustainable catch limits based on science. It is a message that says the Greens want fisheries managed by politics, not qualified fisheries managers. And it says that the Greens do not support the commercial operators who fish in some of the world's best managed fisheries. That message should be well understood, because I have no doubt that the same disregard for the science and management of our commercial fisheries will be extended to the legitimate pursuit of recreational fishing. As minister for fisheries, I will not allow the emotive politics of the Greens political party to run fisheries management policy in this country. We will ensure that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is independent, that it makes independent decisions based on the science through its expert commissioners and on the facts that are presented to them. They will continue to make decisions based on sound judgement to ensure that fisheries are sustainable and meet all the ecological requirements—and, moreover, predicated on the precautionary principle so often espoused by the Greens. Why? Because AFMA will continue to apply sound policy to ensure that we will have sustainable fisheries now and into the future. For those reasons, the government oppose this motion.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:51):  As my colleagues Senator Richard Colbeck and Senator Nigel Scullion had enunciated, the coalition also opposes this disallowance motion. There would be hardly any senators in this chamber with a greater knowledge of matters fisheries than Senator Scullion, who was involved in that industry professionally, and Senator Colbeck, who was the coalition's spokesman on matters fisheries.


Those that are genuinely interested in the science around the small pelagic fisheries should go to the website richardcolbeck.com.au and they will find on that website postings of scientific papers by people such as professors Colin Buxton and Keith Sainsbury, individuals that I had the great pleasure of working with at close quarters whilst I was, amongst other things, Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation in the Howard government. If there is one thing Australia can be proud of, it is the international reputation and the high regard in which these gentlemen are held worldwide. They have worldwide recognition. Their science and analysis are recognised worldwide. Yet here we have the Australian Greens yet again coming into this place and trashing the reputation of these highly qualified, highly recognised home-grown scientists for their own political purposes.


In relation to the science, I particularly refer honourable senators to the paper the 'Commonwealth small pelagic fishery: General background to the scientific issues', which is co-authored by no fewer than seven highly respected scientists from IMAS, SARDI and the CSIRO. Of course, some of them are involved with TAFI, the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute which is associated with the University of Tasmania. These people are recognised worldwide. But their science is just thrown out the window and trashed in a bid for a political campaign. That should not surprise us. The Australian Greens do it each and every day in relation to forestry, in relation to tourism ventures, in relation to aquaculture extensions—you name it, they are in the business of denying economic viability to Australians and, in particular, my home state of Tasmania.


It would be fair to say that there are genuine concerns by many people, because it is quite confronting to see a large fishing vessel heading into local waters. It is right that questions are asked by people as to what all this actually means. Will fish stocks be decimated? I was able to build on the good work of my predecessors in the fisheries ministry whilst I was there, and my successors in title have also built on that good work to ensure that we have if not the most highly regarded then the second-most highly regarded harvest strategy in the world. Indeed, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority have been exceptionally conservative in relation to the take that they would allow.


The global standard for fishing is that you can fish down to 20 per cent of the biomass of a particular fishery—that is, harvesting 80 per cent. Lenfest Ocean Program, which is a group of about 13 globally recognised scientists, have said that the current situation should be catching down to 40 per cent—that is, harvesting 60 per cent. What is the harvest strategy for Australia? It is to go down to 80 per cent, which means you are only harvesting 20 per cent of the actual biomass, the exact opposite figures of the global standard. The global standard is you can harvest 80 per cent and leave 20 per cent. The Australian standard is harvest 20 per cent and leave 80 per cent. Despite such conservative parameters we have the Australian Greens telling us that is not good enough. One wonders, if you cannot take 20 per cent, where would the Greens actually draw the line? Would it be 19 per cent? Would it be 18 per cent? Would it be 10 per cent? I will tell you where it is drawn—zero per cent. That is where they would draw the line. That is their attitude to forestry in my home state and that is their attitude to every resource based industry.


But the Australian Greens have been somewhat clever in trying to get people concerned about the catch of the trawler that is coming to Australia, the FV Margiris. I would have thought that those that are genuinely concerned about pollution would be interested in ensuring that if you go out fishing you try and get the fish in one go with one boat rather than having, let us say, six boats going out with smaller nets trying to catch the same amount of fish. Make no mistake, the total allowable catch that the science fully supports will be caught irrespective of the size of the ship, other than for one reason—that is, the economies of scale. That is why the harvest strategy signed off in 2009 by the minister included this very important clause:


… there are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels.


This was contemplated three years ago and it is not surprising it has taken some time for industry and others to get the wherewithal to undertake the mission of obtaining a large-scale factory freezer vessel, because unless you have those economies of scale in this particular fishery it will not be viable.


Let us ask another question: where is the product destined? This product will be providing vital fish protein at a relatively cheap price to the people of Africa. If you make it nonviable either the price of fish in Africa will increase or the people of Africa will be denied this vital access to this important dietary supplement. Those that seek to preach social justice day after day have to look at the consequences of some of the manic green positions, because it will impact not only a couple of dozen fishermen in Tasmania who will lose their jobs—in fact, about four dozen—but also the people of Africa.


It is a wonderful thing that we can harness the bounties of nature to ensure that we have such a low catch rate of only 20 per cent, leaving 80 per cent of the biomass in the oceans; create jobs and wealth for Australians; and at the same time provide a cheap source of fish protein to the people of Africa. Surely, that is a triple bottom line that we should all be proud of, celebrate and seek to encourage. But no—the Australian Greens want to ensure that does not happen for Africa, for Australian fishermen and for the environment.


One of the arguments and furphies that has been thrown into this debate is that where this vessel or vessels of this nature have been the fisheries have been depleted. That may or may not be the case. What I say is this: whether a fishery is depleted or not is not dependent on the boat but on the management of the fishery itself. Australia has, by any world standard, the best management arrangements—I correct myself, I think we have the second-best, as in the country where I was born they do not even allow catch and release fishing anymore, and supposedly they have a higher standard. Apart from that, Australia has the second-highest standard. We should be proud of that and promoting our product accordingly.


But why does it not surprise me that the Greens and their fellow travellers celebrated the fact that they were able to stop Ta Ann timber from being used at the London Olympics? They celebrated the fact that regrowth and plantation forest product could not be used at the London Olympics because they had run a campaign against it. And do you know, Madam Acting Deputy President McKenzie, what was used instead of that Tasmanian product? Rainforest from Indonesia! In Australia our forest estate is growing; in Indonesia they are still deforesting at the rate of three million hectares per annum. Congratulations to the Australian Greens and their fellow travellers for providing a world market to Indonesian rainforests, which are being decimated at the rate of three million hectares per annum, instead of to regrowth timber from Tasmania where the forest estate is actually growing.


This is the result of manic Greens ideology which does not look to the outcomes of their policy and their determinations. Just as much as rainforests in Indonesia become the victims of green policy, so the people of Africa and the workers of Tasmania will become the victims of this sort of extreme green policy. This disallowance motion would seek to disallow the whole entitlement for small pelagic fisheries Australia-wide. There are small pelagic fisheries other than the one that the FV Margiris would be getting into and, as a result, other fishermen in areas where there is a sustainable small pelagic fishery would also be put out of business. Senator Scullion outlined this in his earlier contribution about the waters of South Australia. The Australian Greens never seek to just adjust a wing nut—they use a scorched earth policy to ensure that nothing is allowed to take place that might actually be sustainable or that might actually be profitable.


I say to the recreational fishing community in particular: be very careful when you join forces with the Australian Greens. If you reject the science for emotive reasons then you will undo the one strength that you have in opposition to the manic determination to have marine parks all over the place. I was involved in establishing the Commonwealth marine park around our home state of Tasmania, and I was able to achieve it with the support of green groups, recreational fishers and commercial fishers. It was a win for everybody. You can have sensible conservation, sensible recreational fishing and sensible commercial fishing all cohabiting if you set the policies right. And, with the south-east marine park that I was involved in, we achieved that result.


But the Australian Greens sought to determine, in the state waters of my home state, a marine park for all of D'Entrecasteaux Channel, right around Bruny Island, right through to Port Arthur—and it was the science and the nonsense of that that finally won out for the recreational fishers, as it should have done. But if you start getting into the business of rejecting the science just because you want a particular outcome, I say: be very careful in circumstances where that can then be replayed on the recreational fishers, and then marine parks of the sort that the Greens sought to impose on Tasmanians in southern Tasmania might occur. So be very careful who you play with and who you associate with in relation to these matters.


I am delighted that, when I was able to provide this most impressive scientific document from seven of the world's scientific fishing experts, people have said, 'That genuinely allays my concerns and my fears', because some of the matters raised by the Greens and promoted in the media have been able to be debunked. In particular, I refer to a paragraph on page 15 of the document. It is about the localised depletion, which is a matter of concern and which recreational fishers should be talking about and asking questions. Here are the answers that the Greens do not want to hear: 


Localised depletion is evaluated as unlikely with the proposed harvesting fractions applied in the SPF because most small pelagic species, and their predators, are highly mobile and local areas replenish quickly provided the overall stocks are not depleted. This has been the experience with small pelagic fisheries that have been similarly managed in Australia. 


However given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the SPF, it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


As I understand the situation, the FV Margiris and the company behind it would be fully agreeable to a condition of being moved on. This is how you come to sensible conclusions: you raise a genuine concern, you go to the company or the individual concerned, you raise it, and a sensible person would say, 'That's a fair enough concern. Why not have a move-on policy?' How can that move-on policy be enforced? As we heard from the minister, AFMA observers would be on board. 


I remember when I was minister and I was trying to get fishermen to agree to have a satellite system, a GPS system, fitted to their boats so that their movements could be monitored at all times, so AFMA knew exactly how long they would stay in any particular bit of water. Of course, if they were in one bit of water for three days on end, very close at all times, it would be fair to say that they were not engaging in the move-on policy, that they were throwing their net in time and time again in the same place. All these things are managed and when you explain them, people's genuine concerns are able to be genuinely relieved.


This is another way that the Greens do business. The only thing I say to those opposite is: what on earth are you doing in alliance with the Australian Greens? They are not your friends; they are not Australia's friends.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:11):  I rise today to support the disallowance motion put forward by my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson. I note with interest that the federal Liberals from Tasmania are now completely out of step with their Tasmanian counterparts. I note that the motion that was passed in the Tasmanian House of Assembly was supported by all three parties, and I particularly want to put on the record the statement of Mr Brooks, who is a Liberal member of parliament in Tasmania. He said: 'We, the Tasmanian Liberals, fully support recreational fishing, and that is why we wrote to the minister. That is why we heard the community concerns and we continue to stand up here and support this amendment. That is why it is going through: because the Tasmanian Liberals fully understand the needs that are being addressed.' The Tasmanian Liberals supported the motion that was put through the Tasmanian parliament, and the motion spells out very clearly at point 5 that both the Tasmanian Greens and the Tasmanian Liberal Party supported it. 


The people that, just a moment ago, Senator Abetz suggested that no-one should have anything to do with, the Greens in Tasmania, had to do with the Liberal Party and they have publicly voiced their respective opposition to this proposed supertrawler with the shared concern that the federal Labor minister, Senator Joe Ludwig, has failed to demonstrate that this commercial fishery activity will be sustainable and will not cause localised depletion off Tasmania. So the Tasmanian Liberals now obviously disown Senator Abetz and his other Tasmanian colleague, Senator Colbeck, or they do not—one way or the other. You cannot walk both sides of the street and have your Tasmanian Liberal members in the Tasmanian House of Assembly absolutely standing there saying that they are in unison with the Greens and saying that Minister Ludwig has failed to address the issues of local depletion and then have your federal counterparts here saying something entirely different. 


The fact of the matter is: if there are people in the Liberal Party who represent the scorched earth policy that is being talked about, it is people like Senator Abetz, who wants to see that scorched earth policy; it is what he has supported for years. He talked for a moment or two about the forest industry and I have to say that in Tasmania, if there was anyone who was responsible for manic maladministration in the forest industry in Tasmania, it occurred during the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement when Senator Abetz was the federal minister. To this day that is on the record at the National Audit Office.


We have had a lot being said by Senator Ludwig about the science, and we have had a bit of a spiel from Senator Abetz on that. Let me quote specifically what the scientific report had to say in relation to localised depletion. What has been left out and not repeated in this chamber of what the scientists said in the context of localised depletion was:


However given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the SPF, it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


There is nothing that the minister has said that actually gives anybody any comfort—scientists or fishermen and fishing communities—at all on localised depletion because there is no answer on the issue of localised depletion.


There is no answer because there is no management plan; there is nothing that says how you are going to stop this supertrawler, the FV Margiris, from actually sucking out the entire fishery in very specific places and depleting that fishery into collapse. There is no management plan. So if the minister and Senator Abetz are so confident that they have this under control, where is the management plan that addresses localised depletion?


What is more, where is the scientific research vessel that is going to go out and do the testing? I will tell you: the Tasmanians were so broke that they sold it and they got a whole $280,000 for it. It is in some bank account, and now they are wringing their hands saying, 'We don't have a vessel to do the scientific research. Instead, we have to contractually engage one for specific tasks.' This is ridiculous. If you are going to bring a supertrawler into Australian waters, you had better have a better argument than just saying, 'We just expect local depletion not to occur,' because the local depletion will occur.


As for Senator Abetz suggesting that on the basis of social justice one ought to allow depletion of the fisheries somewhere around the world to feed West Africa, the reason that the fish stocks collapsed off West Africa is because of supertrawlers. That is why we have a global campaign being run by several organisations against supertrawlers, because they have had such massive impacts. If you want to talk about social justice the tragedy now is that as a result of those supertrawlers having overfished the waters off West Africa, local fishing people and villagers who depend on those fisheries for their protein requirements are now being forced to buy frozen fish on the world market because they have lost their local sustainability. That is a tragedy, and it is a cruel irony that this has occurred. It should not be allowed to continue. What we are now going to see is this supertrawler hitting Australian waters; the minister does not have a management plan which addresses local depletion, he does not have a monitoring capacity which actually gives anyone confidence about local depletion and we have had some cherry picking of the science here today, which actually does not give anybody any confidence because the scientists have said that there is uncertainty about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted and therefore it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. That is what everybody has been saying.


And as for this suggestion that somehow the distress in Tasmania has been in some way orchestrated by the Greens, that is not so. I can tell you that all around Tasmania people are very concerned about this supertrawler turning up in Tasmanian waters and engaging in this fishery, because people are asking the significant question: why was the quota increased to facilitate the supertrawler? Why? Why did you need to increase the quota if it was not just to facilitate the supertrawler? Also in relation to this, one has to ask: what level of subsidies are being paid for this supertrawler to operate in Australian waters? I can tell you that the fees and costs in relation to fuel, in particular, for such supertrawlers are very, very substantial.


But when I come back to this issue of 'social justice', I note the idea that you would expect African communities who have lost their resource to now buy fish out of Tasmanian waters, and would somehow suggest allowing local depletion in these fisheries here in order to catch up with the smashing of the local fisheries in West Africa, is an absolute disgrace.


What we have here is the fact that the federal Liberal senators, the federal Liberal members and, indeed, the federal Labor members it seems are completely out of step. It is interesting that they are out of step with their Tasmanian counterparts, because in the House of Assembly the government, the Greens and the Liberals all said that they did not have confidence in this process, they did not have confidence in the minister, Senator Ludwig, and they did not have confidence that there was a management plan that was able to address this issue of local depletion, and that stands.


What I am interested in today is that the minister is saying that the Tasmanian government actually has the power to stop this supertrawler docking in Tasmania by closing the ports to it and not giving it port access. So now we will come back and see the extent to which the Tasmanian parliament actually will act on this. But, as for this business of walking both sides of the street, of pretending that it is okay to stand up at a public meeting and say, 'I am really worried about it; I am going to go and talk to the minister about it,' and of people on both the Labor and Liberal back benches who might have been talking to the minister, the fact is that the minister has decided that he is going to allow this and drive this. The coalition are going to support it and so, ultimately, the issue here is that all that talk of concern about localised depletion counts for nothing if you are not actually prepared to vote on it.


This is a serious issue because fisheries around the world are in a state of collapse; we are seeing it all over the place. And as for the suggestion that Australia has some sort of fabulous record for sustainability, you only have to have lived in Tasmania at the time when the orange roughy fishery was first brought on to note the excitement over this big commercial deal and then to see the total collapse that then followed not long after.


I can tell you, there is no proud record in terms of fisheries depletion, and around the world this is really a very serious issue. If you are serious, Madam Acting Deputy President McKenzie, about maintaining fisheries, then you support marine parks as nurseries and you act on global warming, because the increased global temperature is leading to higher levels of acidification and reduced nutrient levels. The warm current coming down Tasmania's east coast is nutrient poor compared with the Antarctic upwelling which is nutrient rich, and all those in the coalition who continue to try to reject acting on global warming had better think about the impact on the onshore fisheries and the recreational fishery that they talk about, because those global warming changes are making a significant difference in the marine ecosystems. 


But the Greens stand absolutely to say that this should be disallowed, that the science has not stood up in terms of this issue. More particularly, the minister has not explained the increased quota. Neither has he explained how he is going to address local depletion or where the management plan is to address that local depletion, and he had better do that before we get to this issue of what to do on disallowance.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:23):  If evidence were needed, you have just heard with the previous speaker on this motion just how the Greens political party will stop at nothing to advance some of the ideas which they, for their own purposes—and I can never quite understand this—want to put onto the Australian public. 


I must say that Australia had the most sustainable forestry industry in the world. It provided jobs and wealth for Tasmania, but the Greens over a period of time have ensured that that industry has just about collapsed and so we are left to import our timber from countries around the world that have nowhere near the sustainable management practices that had been implemented in Tasmania. I can only think that the Tasmanian Greens want to see the day when that lovely state of Tasmania is economically bankrupt and is only held together by federal and state government grants and federal and state government workers. Every single enterprise that could make Tasmania the great state it once used to be seems to be in the sights of the Greens political party. It just distresses me as an Australian to see the most sustainable forestry industry in the world now on its knees. The Greens think that is pretty good. They do not mind about all the people out of work. They do not mind about the fact that the Tasmanian economy continues to fail and falter. They are able then to roam around the world with all their other leftist greenie mates and say, 'Look how good we are in Tasmania. We have shut down every private business. We have made Tasmania totally dependent upon government funding.' 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What about the wineries?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Give the wineries a little time, Senator Whish-Wilson. You will regret the day when the Greens, having succeeded in shutting down the forestry industry and having succeeded in shutting down the fisheries industry, look elsewhere. What will they turn on next? Can I suggest to you that it will probably be the winery industry, 'Look, it is allowing too many sediments,' or 'They have got to use some chemicals that will destroy some made up creature.' Mark my words, Senator, I anticipate that your former industry will be the subject of the next Greens campaign.


The disallowance of the Small Pelagic Fishery Total Allowable Catch (Quota Species) Determination 2012 motion is about fisheries, but I cannot talk about that easily. I really get quite emotional about the forestry industry in Tasmania because it was a great industry; it was the most sustainably managed in the world and now it is just finished. I have to say that I played a part in it. I, along with the CFMEU and eventually the support of the Labor Party in 2004, had that plan well documented, supported by the voters of Tasmania. I was followed as the minister by Senator Abetz who carried through the arrangements that had been made with the CFMEU, the Labor Party, the Tasmanian government, and it looked like we had a bright future again for the timber industry in Tasmania.


But no, the Greens never give up. As is often said: give them 15 per cent and they will accept that this week, but next week they will want 20 per cent, and the year after they will want 50 per cent, and they will keep going until they shut the industry down. This is about a fisheries disallowance, but I get emotional whenever I think about the beautiful state of Tasmania, a state that had so much to offer as part of Australia's economy. To see it now on its knees—thanks to the work of the Greens political party, initiated by their former leader who, thankfully, has moved on from this place, and some of the ideas that through persistence they have continued to impose upon the Tasmanian people—makes me feel very emotional. But if they want to ruin their own state of Tasmania, I guess that is for them.


But now they come up to the Coral Sea, a fishery which only had a few hundred tonnes of fish ever taken out of it, and suddenly, thanks to the Greens political party and their influence on a weak and divided Labor Party, they are going to shut down the whole Coral Sea—for what purpose, I do not know. What is the purpose? There was never any substantial fishing there. The only fishing there was by the marlin boats that would go out and catch some marlin, tag them so you could get a bit of scientific data, throw them back and move on. It created jobs and wealth and international tourist numbers into Cairns and Port Douglas and the Coral Sea. 


Thanks to the Greens now, there is another industry in my state that is on its knees because of the work of the Greens political party. Don't worry about what support you have; if you say it often enough the Greens will get some loony group around the world—Pew or someone else like that—to fund them and keep funding them until they do it.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I hear the question: where is the science? I was just about to talk about that. I was just going to quote from Professor Keith Sainsbury from the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies. This report of 6 July 2012 is well known to everybody, including to the Greens, but they will not talk about it because they do not want to quote anybody who has some scientific knowledge.


In my four years as the fisheries minister in the Howard government I came to respect the science, the expertise and the commitment of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. It is recognised, world wide, as one of the best fisheries management authorities. That is why, as Senator Ludwig quoted earlier, Australian fisheries are seen as one of the best managed in the world. We have nothing to be ashamed of; in fact, we have everything to be proud of given the way the Australian Fisheries Management Authority has managed our fisheries.


I might say that it was the coalition government that had Australia's first-ever oceans policy. As a result of that, we decided to have marine bioregions, and the very first one was in the south-east of Australia. Through consultation that went over many months between conservationists, the fishing industry, the recreational industry—all the stakeholders—we eventually came to a plan which has worked in the south-east. It allows for recreational fishing, it allows for commercial fishing, it allows for conservation zones; it allows for the restoration of the orange roughy fishery, which was mentioned by the previous speaker. This is what you can do with good science and goodwill and an arrangement that works with all relevant stakeholders.


The Greens do not want to look at the scientific reports, and if I have time I will read some of these into the record. The Greens political party follow the Julia Gillard approach to life: promise something, make an untruth about it and then you can get away with it. So Senator Milne, the previous speaker, attacked Senator Abetz for quoting from a report by saying: 'However, he left out this crucial bit,' which she then quoted. If Senator Milne has a look at Hansard she will see that Senator Abetz actually did say that. But she got up straight after him and said he did not do it. That incident in itself means little, except that it shows the approach and the tactics of the Greens political party: don't worry about the truth, don't worry about scientific evidence, just keep ranting your left-wing, loony mantra and eventually you will succeed. Regrettably, they have succeeded, practically shutting down the forestry industry and being well on the way to doing the same for the fisheries industry here.


Need I bring a discordant note into this debate by actually quoting from the scientists about this fishery? Professor Sainsbury says:


I have no doubt that this fishery is an example of world's best practice and it meets or exceeds the most rigorous scientific requirements for an ecologically sustainable fishery on forage fish.


This is the one that the Greens say is about to be decimated by an arrangement that has been approved by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. Professor Sainsbury went on to say:


These requirements are designed to be ecologically safe, especially in relation to dependent predators in the food web, for all the known food webs in the world.


I could read on, but this is publicly available. The Greens know it is there—but that is Professor Sainsbury, he is a scientist, he actually knows what he is talking about, and that does not count when you come to Senator Milne, who dismisses people like Professor Sainsbury and brings her version of good science to this chamber. It is the same sort of thing as we saw with Senator Milne's good friend Professor Flannery, the guy who told us six-metre tidal increases were going to inundate coastal parts of Australia and then went out and bought a property on the banks of a river just north of Sydney.



Senator Milne interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You say, 'What's that got to do with the price of eggs?' I am saying he has the same sort of approach as the Greens political party, and Senator Milne in particular. I do not know some of the newer Greens senators and I often say Senator Siewert is the only genuine environmentalist in the Greens political party, but Senator Milne is just a political warrior. I congratulate you, Senator Milne, as you have been very effective in both the Tasmanian parliament and this parliament in shutting down the timber industry and in making Tasmania a completely mendicant state, and you are well on your way to doing it with the fisheries industry.


Fortunately, I have to say, the Labor Party understand about jobs in Tasmania and initially were with us on the forestry. They have wobbled a bit in recent times, but I am pleased to say the government on this occasion is recognising just what loony approaches you get from the ultra-left-wing political ideology driven group that call themselves the Greens political party.


In this instance I am delighted that Senator Ludwig has had the backbone and the fortitude to go with the science and ignore those who keep his government in power.


The mistruths peddled by the Greens in this particular debate even make Ms Gillard's promise that 'There will be no carbon tax under a government that I lead,' almost look truthful. The Greens tell you that this is a Dutch boat that is going to do it. The fact is that it is an Australian flagged vessel.




Senator Milne:
  No, it is not.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The vessel is to be operated by Seafish Tasmania, a business that has been catching and processing jack mackerel since the early 1980s.




Senator Milne:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is a Lithuanian flagged vessel.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McKenzie
):  There is no point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The vessel is to be based in Devonport, Tasmania. The crew will be principally Australian. It will fish outside the three-mile state limits and the catch is going to be frozen on board—which makes the whole exercise more productive. I do not say this in a scientific way, but my understanding is that the licences that were there for several fishing operations have been combined and are now being worked off this one vessel because it is more efficient and it is more ecologically sustainable. One of the owners said:


We are extremely confident our fishing operation will result in long-term employment and economic benefits for Devonport and the North-West Coast of Tasmania.


But why bother saying that to the Greens political party? The things they are least interested in are employment and economic benefits for Devonport, the north-west coast of Tasmania or indeed anywhere in Australia.


The fish targeted—redbait, jack mackerel and blue mackerel—live near the surface of the water column, not at the bottom of the water column. They continuously swim in open water and they tend to be nomadic. It is managed, as I said before, by AFMA under a statutory management place.


I heard Senator Milne talk about what I loosely describe as a 'move on' provision. As Senator Milne well knows, the operators of this boat, the Australians who make a living sustainably catching fish in this small pelagic fishery, have said that they are happy to do this. So I would have thought that Senator Milne would have been congratulating them for their agreement to do this—even though they are not required to and even though AFMA and the scientists say that it is not necessary. But, if there is a concern with the local recreational fishing people, they are very happy to do that, because they want to work with others.


Senator Milne indicates that only the Greens are interested in the recreational fishing industry. Well, anyone that knows anything about recreational fishing knows that the political party that has most helped recreational fishing in Australia over many, many years is of course the Liberal-National party. I remind senators—although you should not need reminding—that it was the Howard government that introduced a $15 million program to actually put some money into helping the recreational fishing industry.


In North Queensland and the Coral Sea, we understand what the recreational fishing industry is about. We understand how, as environmental managers, they are perhaps as good as the scientists and the fishery managers. Most recreational fishermen understand what it is all about—as do the commercial fishermen. When the recreational fishing people in the north, in the Coral Sea, are willing to string up any Green that they can find, it is interesting to hear Senator Milne say how the Greens are looking after recreational fishermen in Tasmania. I suggest that they should get the Tasmanians to have a talk to the North Queensland brethren, and they will realise that they are being duped by the words that flow out of the mouths of the Greens in Tasmania.


I conclude my remarks on this subject by again saying that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority has an enviable worldwide record for proper management of fisheries.




Senator Milne:
  What about the orange roughy?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The orange roughy is coming back, Senator, and I mentioned that. But this is typical—as was the case with Senator Abetz. He quotes something and you get up and accuse him of not even mentioning it. As I said before, the orange roughy fishery is coming back because of good fisheries management. A problem occurred and good fisheries management puts it back together. But you will never hear that from the Greens political party. You will hear from them all of the lies and all of the misrepresentation of facts—anything to pursue their whacky left-wing agenda that should be exposed to the people of Australia.


If it comes to proper management and proper science, do you believe the Professor Sainburys of the world, do you believe AFMA or do you believe a politician of the reputation of Senator Milne? I know where I will go for my science—and I know what the people of Australia will ultimately recognise about the Greens approach to these areas. All I can say is trust the scientists, look at the scientific approach to management of fisheries and go with the professional fisheries management people and you cannot go wrong.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (16:43):  I will freely admit that a month ago I would not have had a clue what a pelagic fishery was. If anyone had asked me I would have said that it perhaps had something to do with fossils and an archaeological dig. But, because of a number of actions that have occurred in the recent past, I have certainly come to understand a lot more about the fishing industry across Australia—and particularly in relation to my home state of Queensland. I have readily admitted to everyone I have discussed this issue with that I am by no means an expert on fishing or the fishing industry.


In fact, most of my attempts at being a recreational fisher have ended in failure at the very least to catch a fish.


I rise today to speak because I would like to ask the Greens to reconsider the position that they have adopted in this motion they are putting with regard to the Margiris. As a number of speakers have already pointed out, we have extremely well-managed fisheries. The Margiris will have a quota. They will take 20 per cent of the catch from the areas they fish when it has been recommended that up to 80 per cent would continue to be sustainable. There should be no concerns about the work that is being undertaken by the Margiris.


There is a quote from yesterday by Senator Whish-Wilson in today's papers where he says:


We've done it—


meaning the disallowance motion—


as a last-ditch attempt to have Parliament debate the issue and to get support for the members of the public who say the super trawler should not be allowed in Australian fisheries until key concerns have been addressed …


I am very pleased that Greens want key concerns addressed and I wish they would adopt that view in terms of the federal government's current move to massively extend marine parks throughout Australia.


Senator Whish-Wilson has talked about getting support from members of the public. This is an excellent thing to do, but only if the members of the public are properly informed. In my view, this is not what is happening. On this issue and the issue of more than doubling the number of marine parks in Australia, there is disinformation being spread by environmental groups, presumably with the full support of the Greens.


I draw to your attention, Madam Acting Deputy President, a very glossy little brochure that came into a mailbox recently with a very cute little clownfish on the front. Who would not want to save a cute little clownfish? Everyone would want to save a cute little clownfish. But the information in here could only be described as extremely selective. They paint a beautiful picture of the marine treasures in the Coral Sea: 'the tropical waters are home to threatened sea turtles, manta rays, dolphins and more than 25 colourful reefs teeming with marine life.' Of course, everybody would want to save something like that.


The fact that it currently exists and is teeming with marine life apparently is not any reason to think that what is happening currently is sufficient. What it requires is a whole new regime to protect this. They can go on with motherhood statements and soft little stories about clownfish as much as they like. But the one thing that I find somewhat concerning about this brochure is that it went into every letterbox in the federal electorate of Brisbane and it has on it, 'No stamp required if posted in Australia'. It also went into the letterboxes of numerous other electorates around the Brisbane area.


When you look at the cost of this campaign, we are not talking about some small group that is surviving on the work of volunteers and the smell of oily rags. We are talking about a campaign that is better funded than any campaign by the fishing industry itself to maintain the excellent fishery management system that we currently have. This brochure is produced by a group called protectourcoralsea.org. It has about 20 members, all of whom are environmental groups including Greenpeace, the Wilderness Society and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and a number of other Queensland organisations. By suggesting to people that somehow not declaring massive areas of Queensland as marine parks will decimate the fish populations, these groups are attempting to trick and manipulate the public into supporting their campaigns. They even have campaigns to encourage recreational fishers to support their work by making the suggestion that there will not be fish there to catch if their plans are not allowed to proceed.


To give you one idea of the manipulation of information that goes on, I was interested to see a media release from Greenpeace which was published on 21 February this year. It says:


Lets make history: 3 days left to protect Coral Sea


That is clearly wrong. Last time I looked the Coral Sea was still there and it was still functioning. It is protected by our fisheries management systems. It does not need the protection that these groups would have you put in place to undertake decent fisheries management. We do not need the number of marine parks in Australia increased from 27 to 60 without proper scientific and independent evaluation. The Liberal-National Party, as Senator Macdonald pointed out, have a very strong and proud history of creating national marine parks. The vast majority that currently exist were created by this government and when we are returned to government we will no doubt create more but only after independent scientific evaluation and after consultation with stakeholders.


I continue to be amazed at the attitude of some the green groups to the very legitimate concerns raised by the fishing industry regarding the Coral Sea and the expansions right along the Queensland coast of highly restricted areas for fishermen. They seem to take the attitude that the fishing industry should just read their propaganda, not have their own views, and just accept that the green groups know best. It is pompous at the very least.


The fishing industry is concerned because it was not adequately consulted by the minister when the Coral Sea programs were announced. I would imagine that the same concerns around the Margiris are based on the fact of lack of consultation, but then again it is something that this government is famous for. Someone recently referred to what was allegedly a consultation process as 'Well, they came and did show and tell, but they didn't consult us'. This is something this government is quite famous for—that is, its ability to do show and tell and claim it has undertaken consultation.


One of the groups backing Protect Our Coral Sea is a group known as the Ocean Elders. I find the Ocean Elders somewhat offensive as a title for a group of what appears to be overseas billionaires. We have the likes of singers Neil Young and Jackson Browne and that wonderful saviour of the world Richard Branson. The Ocean Elders come from every country but one in the world—all except Australia. But there they are, being very pleased that Australia is locking up its fisheries in marine parks—not their own fisheries, but locking up our own. You can see that because none of them rely on fishing or the fishing industry, they are quite happy about this.


One of the things that upset me about this was the fact that this group, clearly encouraged by the Protect Our Coral Sea organisation and the alliance of green groups in that, has taken on that term 'elders'—suggesting that in some way it is the protector of our fisheries, our seas, our lands. We can very easily turn to our own elders if we want to talk about managing the oceans and seas around Australia. The Indigenous elders of Australia, from the Torres Strait right around the entire coast, have been doing this for thousands of years. I was lucky enough that one of my staff was able to speak to Phil Rist, who is the executive officer of the Girringun Aboriginal Corporation, which is at Cardwell. Cardwell is halfway between Townsville and Cairns and has the Coral Sea on its doorstep. The Girringun Aboriginal Corporation represents six saltwater tribal groups: the Djiru, the Gulnay, the Girramay, the Bandjin, the Warrgamay and the Nywaigi. It was the first Indigenous group established in the country in partnership with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service to develop a traditional use of marine resources agreement—known as TUMRA.


Under the agreement, a steering committee has been set up with elders from the six saltwater tribal groups. These groups are startled—I suppose that would be the best word—and dismayed at the idea that others would choose to call themselves the Ocean Elders and to give the impression that they are somehow the custodians of our seas and the custodians of the fish and the sea life that live in those seas. Our elders have done a brilliant job of managing their resources, as have our fishing industries. I continue to be very, very concerned about the fact that many of the groups involved in the Protect Our Coral Sea organisation or alliance continue to try to mislead recreational fishers into thinking that somehow they should be different, they should see the commercial fishers as an opponent and not as an ally. 


In fact what is going to happen throughout Queensland will be the loss of thousands of jobs. The Cairns Regional Council recently decided to make a submission on Minister Tony Burke's proposal around the marine parks, and 10 September is the deadline for doing this. It has decided to make a submission based on an independent assessment that it had done which suggests that the cost of the changes Minister Burke is suggesting to Cairns and to the Far North Queensland area will be $1 billion. The environment department has decided that all it will cost the Cairns economy would be $1.1 million. But the Cairns council, which I would suggest knows Cairns a little better than the department of the environment, has looked not only at the effects on the Cairns local area, but also at the effects on the areas around Cairns and at the effects on the flow-on businesses. 


This is something that I think in almost every circumstance we have had a lot of trouble getting this government to understand. It still does not appear to understand the cumulative effect of the carbon tax on small business and on others when, time after time, the price of everything, every input that you have in your small business is affected—sometimes incrementally; sometimes seriously. Those are the costs that drive people out of business and that is what is going to happen across the fishing industry.


It will not just be the commercial fishermen who will be affected; it will not just be recreational fishermen who will be affected. It will be boat manufacturers, outboard motor distributors and manufacturers. It will be the bait and tackle shops. It will be the chandleries that create the anchors—and the list will go on, right through from fish and chip shops to the Australian consumer in the end. Right now, 72 to 75 per cent of our seafood in Australia is imported. That figure will rise if the government goes ahead with its plan, with Greens support, on the development of these marine parks.


We must do better in this area. We must use scientific evaluation. Senator Whish-Wilson wants to have key concerns addressed and evaluation carried out on the Margiris,because that is something that the Greens do not want. But, when we come to a proposal such as the marine parks, which will wipe out vast numbers of businesses that are related to and are in the fishing industry, the Greens do not want to know a thing about key concerns or about scientific evaluation. They simply want to produce pretty little brochures with clownfish on them. Of course everyone wants to protect them, but in this case they are dishonestly giving the impression that clownfish will be endangered if we do not go ahead with the marine parks—a complete and utter nonsense.


What is endangered and threatened—and this was mentioned at a rally that I organised in Brisbane two weekends ago to protest about Minister Burke's proposal—is a very, very successful business that has been established out of Cairns, collecting and selling 'Nemos'. This business has been established with the support and approval of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Fisheries Management Authority and others. It is a completely sustainable business and it is providing clownfish—'Nemos', as most people now call them—to aquariums worldwide. The business plan for this company was based on the view that they would be able to continue to collect clownfish in what was an approved and sustainable way. That now changes for them.


It is not just this one company that will be affected. It is dozens and dozens of companies up and down the Queensland coast, some of whom have even had calls from their bank managers, telling these companies that they want to reassess their risk profile on the basis of this. So I would really like to ask the Greens to be a little consistent here. If they want to not go ahead with the Margiris until it can be scientifically evaluated and until key concerns can be addressed, surely they should be applying exactly the same argument to the marine park proposal from Minister Tony Burke. We cannot just use pretty pictures and say that, because one is done by a company that is catching quite unattractive fish, they somehow are a lesser industry.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:03):  I rise to wrap up the debate on this motion for disallowance of the Small Pelagic Fishery Total Allowable Catch (Quota Species) Determination 2012. Yesterday we saw something historic happen here. I tabled a motion from the Tasmanian lower house, where all three parties got together and consistently said, in a unified voice, that they did not support the entrance of the supertrawler to Australian waters and they wanted the supertrawler stopped until key risks could be addressed. We have had the debate. Everyone is watching. Tasmania is watching; Australia is watching. Federal Labor and federal Liberal senators have turned their backs on their state counterparts and they have turned their backs on the Tasmanian people.


We have heard a lot about Professor Keith Sainsbury and the scientists at AFMA. We have considerable respect for the scientists. We have never questioned the veracity of their science or the good work that they have done. We have simply said that they have clearly said and acknowledged in their report, Commonwealth small pelagic fishery: general background to the scientific issues, which has been quoted ad nauseum by the Liberals today, that the idea of local depletion needs to be managed. The Greens moved this motion because we wanted to see a plan in place for that. It is easy to denigrate the debate, which is exactly what has happened today, and as a new senator to this chamber I would like to express my disappointment that what was a very genuine motion to address a problem has slipped into vitriol and negativity. That is exactly what people outside this chamber do not want to see from their elected representatives.


I would like to quote from a media release put out by TARfish, the key recreational fishing group in Tasmania, as to why they walked away from a working group with the government on this issue of local depletion:


… TARFish has come to the conclusion that there is a lack of detailed scientific knowledge surrounding;


1. the extent and rates of movement of each species of small pelagic fish


2. the amount of time it would take for local populations of small pelagic fish to recover from intensive localized fishing and


3. the size of the resident population of Jack Mackerel on the East Coast of Tasmania.


These are not the rabid, left-wing, loony Greens that the Liberals would have you believe are behind this fearmongering on the entrance of one of the world's biggest supertrawlers, which, like it or not, has been dogged with controversy everywhere it has gone. It is a fair thing to question the risks that this supertrawler poses without criticising the scientists.


We have never had a supertrawler in Australian waters before. It is a fair thing to question this and that is exactly what our disallowance motion has done today. It gave us the chance to support the lower House in Tasmania—Greens, Liberals and Labor—in an effort to step back until the checks and balances have been put in place. We have heard lots of noise about the science. From my understanding, and my meetings with Professor Keith Sainsbury, and my friends who work in the same areas as he does in Tasmania, he has done considerable work on the science behind marine protected areas. It is also my understanding that he is in favour of marine protected areas as one tool in the fisheries management box.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I am looking forward to you rolling out his science on this issue, just like you have on his very good work in the report that was released yesterday. Considering it is the only thing you have in your chest of ammunition, let us make it very clear once again that this report clearly says that world best fisheries practice is to manage local depletion issues.




Senator Colbeck:
  Don't misrepresent!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I will read it word for word exactly from the report. It is the final part of a paragraph in the conclusion of the report:


However, given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the small pelagic fisheries it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


So, we all agree on the science. We have a chance here tonight in front of the Tasmanian people to stand up for them. I would still urge coalition senators and Labor senators to support our disallowance motion, to take the time to get this right.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  The question is that the motion for disallowance be agreed to. I am advised that we cannot have a division. I remind honourable senators that if a division is called on Thursday after 4:30 pm the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned pursuant to standing order 57(3) until the next day of sitting at a time to be fixed by the Senate. Accordingly, the matter is adjourned.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:42):  As I was saying, Dr Daniel Pauly of the University of British Columbia has recently ranked Australian fisheries second out of 53 countries for environmental sustainability. A report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation also recognised Australia's effective fishing management, particularly our actions to rebuild overfished stocks. Australian fisheries are not the fisheries of Europe or of Africa, or even of those of New Zealand. Some of the comparisons that have been raised in this debate between the proposal of an Australian business and an Australian independent fisheries management with statutory obligation are, frankly, unnecessary and, to some degree, alarmist.


The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Science—ABARES—in a 2010 fisheries status report shows the results of a continuous effort we have taken to guarantee we have healthy fish stocks. The report shows that in 2005 24 stocks were classified as overfished and/or subject to overfishing. In 2010 that number had fallen to just 13 stocks. In addition, the proportion of stocks whose status is uncertain has nearly halved since 2007 as a direct result of the policies of this Gillard Labor government.


I turn now to the small pelagic fishery, which seems to have raised people's concerns. This is the fishery where Seafish Tasmania has said it intends to exercise its fishing entitlements. The setting of catch limits in the small pelagic fishery are based on strong precautionary principle. Under the harvest strategy for this fishery, the catch limit is capped at a maximum of 20 per cent of the estimated available biomass, which takes into consideration both the species' productivity and the broader ecosystem impacts. This is a very conservative limit when compared to similar stocks in international fisheries. Even with that cap, the current management plan sets the quota to less than 10 per cent of spawning biomass estimates, leaving 90 per cent in the ocean. These stock limits are based on science and assessed by the experts. The arrangements meet or exceed the most rigorous scientific requirements for an ecologically sustainable fishery of this kind and take the precautionary principle to the appropriate level.


Many speakers in this debate have noted a paper released this week by some of Australia's top fisheries scientists—from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, the South Australian Research and Development Corporation and the CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Research Flagship. In this report, the scientists make it clear that the settings in the small pelagic fishery are conservative by world standards and sustainable for the environment. For the issue of localised depletion, the report states that the measures in place in the fishery:


.. taken together give confidence that food-web impacts of the SPF on predators and the SPF species themselves, including through localised depletion, are unlikely.


AFMA manages fisheries in real time and AFMA has the powers to take immediate action if and when required. As I have already stated, I am frequently reminded by commercial fishers how seriously AFMA takes its responsibilities in all fisheries.


I turn now to the issue of the proposed mid-water trawler, the FV Margiris. It is helpful if the Senate understands that there are a number of steps involved in bringing a fishing vessel into Australia and using it in an Australian fishery. In the first instance, a ship must be recognised as an Australian vessel. Presently, Seafish Tasmania has begun an application with the Australian Marine Safety Authority for the FV Margiris to be flagged as an Australian vessel. There are a range of steps that AMSA is required to undertake to grant that status. Next, every Australian fishing vessel seeking to operate in Commonwealth fisheries is required to be approved by AFMA. To date, AFMA has not received an application from the company, Seafish Tasmania, for that vessel to operate in a Commonwealth fishery.


The FV Margiris would, should it ask, be required to adhere to the strict management arrangements of the SPF, including carrying AFMA observers on board to monitor fishing activities; and using bycatch mitigation equipment, such as seal-excluder devices, logbook reporting, satellite vessel monitoring systems and mandatory reporting of any interactions with protected species. Obviously, there are other regulations that apply to fishing in Australian waters, one being the enforcement of the Commonwealth's marine reserve regime.


The disallowance motion being moved by the Greens is misplaced and could harm fisheries across Australian Commonwealth waters. Last night, Senator Siewert stated that she could not remember a time when recreational fishers stood side by side with her on an issue. For the record, there was a time when the Greens and NGOs stood for output controls and a move away from gear restrictions in fisheries management. They wanted to move to ensuring that we had output controls—the controls that we now have in place which determine total allowable catches for fishers based on independent expert advice—rather than gear restrictions: the size of a boat, the gear it uses and the effort. Everyone recognised that that type of operation where you regulate the gear was no longer relevant for today.


This disallowance motion is a message that the Greens political party do not support sustainable catch limits based on science. It is a message that says the Greens want fisheries managed by politics, not qualified fisheries managers. And it says that the Greens do not support the commercial operators who fish in some of the world's best managed fisheries. That message should be well understood, because I have no doubt that the same disregard for the science and management of our commercial fisheries will be extended to the legitimate pursuit of recreational fishing. As minister for fisheries, I will not allow the emotive politics of the Greens political party to run fisheries management policy in this country. We will ensure that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is independent, that it makes independent decisions based on the science through its expert commissioners and on the facts that are presented to them. They will continue to make decisions based on sound judgement to ensure that fisheries are sustainable and meet all the ecological requirements—and, moreover, predicated on the precautionary principle so often espoused by the Greens. Why? Because AFMA will continue to apply sound policy to ensure that we will have sustainable fisheries now and into the future. For those reasons, the government oppose this motion.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:51):  As my colleagues Senator Richard Colbeck and Senator Nigel Scullion had enunciated, the coalition also opposes this disallowance motion. There would be hardly any senators in this chamber with a greater knowledge of matters fisheries than Senator Scullion, who was involved in that industry professionally, and Senator Colbeck, who was the coalition's spokesman on matters fisheries.


Those that are genuinely interested in the science around the small pelagic fisheries should go to the website richardcolbeck.com.au and they will find on that website postings of scientific papers by people such as professors Colin Buxton and Keith Sainsbury, individuals that I had the great pleasure of working with at close quarters whilst I was, amongst other things, Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation in the Howard government. If there is one thing Australia can be proud of, it is the international reputation and the high regard in which these gentlemen are held worldwide. They have worldwide recognition. Their science and analysis are recognised worldwide. Yet here we have the Australian Greens yet again coming into this place and trashing the reputation of these highly qualified, highly recognised home-grown scientists for their own political purposes.


In relation to the science, I particularly refer honourable senators to the paper the 'Commonwealth small pelagic fishery: General background to the scientific issues', which is co-authored by no fewer than seven highly respected scientists from IMAS, SARDI and the CSIRO. Of course, some of them are involved with TAFI, the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute which is associated with the University of Tasmania. These people are recognised worldwide. But their science is just thrown out the window and trashed in a bid for a political campaign. That should not surprise us. The Australian Greens do it each and every day in relation to forestry, in relation to tourism ventures, in relation to aquaculture extensions—you name it, they are in the business of denying economic viability to Australians and, in particular, my home state of Tasmania.


It would be fair to say that there are genuine concerns by many people, because it is quite confronting to see a large fishing vessel heading into local waters. It is right that questions are asked by people as to what all this actually means. Will fish stocks be decimated? I was able to build on the good work of my predecessors in the fisheries ministry whilst I was there, and my successors in title have also built on that good work to ensure that we have if not the most highly regarded then the second-most highly regarded harvest strategy in the world. Indeed, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority have been exceptionally conservative in relation to the take that they would allow.


The global standard for fishing is that you can fish down to 20 per cent of the biomass of a particular fishery—that is, harvesting 80 per cent. Lenfest Ocean Program, which is a group of about 13 globally recognised scientists, have said that the current situation should be catching down to 40 per cent—that is, harvesting 60 per cent. What is the harvest strategy for Australia? It is to go down to 80 per cent, which means you are only harvesting 20 per cent of the actual biomass, the exact opposite figures of the global standard. The global standard is you can harvest 80 per cent and leave 20 per cent. The Australian standard is harvest 20 per cent and leave 80 per cent. Despite such conservative parameters we have the Australian Greens telling us that is not good enough. One wonders, if you cannot take 20 per cent, where would the Greens actually draw the line? Would it be 19 per cent? Would it be 18 per cent? Would it be 10 per cent? I will tell you where it is drawn—zero per cent. That is where they would draw the line. That is their attitude to forestry in my home state and that is their attitude to every resource based industry.


But the Australian Greens have been somewhat clever in trying to get people concerned about the catch of the trawler that is coming to Australia, the FV Margiris. I would have thought that those that are genuinely concerned about pollution would be interested in ensuring that if you go out fishing you try and get the fish in one go with one boat rather than having, let us say, six boats going out with smaller nets trying to catch the same amount of fish. Make no mistake, the total allowable catch that the science fully supports will be caught irrespective of the size of the ship, other than for one reason—that is, the economies of scale. That is why the harvest strategy signed off in 2009 by the minister included this very important clause:


… there are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels.


This was contemplated three years ago and it is not surprising it has taken some time for industry and others to get the wherewithal to undertake the mission of obtaining a large-scale factory freezer vessel, because unless you have those economies of scale in this particular fishery it will not be viable.


Let us ask another question: where is the product destined? This product will be providing vital fish protein at a relatively cheap price to the people of Africa. If you make it nonviable either the price of fish in Africa will increase or the people of Africa will be denied this vital access to this important dietary supplement. Those that seek to preach social justice day after day have to look at the consequences of some of the manic green positions, because it will impact not only a couple of dozen fishermen in Tasmania who will lose their jobs—in fact, about four dozen—but also the people of Africa.


It is a wonderful thing that we can harness the bounties of nature to ensure that we have such a low catch rate of only 20 per cent, leaving 80 per cent of the biomass in the oceans; create jobs and wealth for Australians; and at the same time provide a cheap source of fish protein to the people of Africa. Surely, that is a triple bottom line that we should all be proud of, celebrate and seek to encourage. But no—the Australian Greens want to ensure that does not happen for Africa, for Australian fishermen and for the environment.


One of the arguments and furphies that has been thrown into this debate is that where this vessel or vessels of this nature have been the fisheries have been depleted. That may or may not be the case. What I say is this: whether a fishery is depleted or not is not dependent on the boat but on the management of the fishery itself. Australia has, by any world standard, the best management arrangements—I correct myself, I think we have the second-best, as in the country where I was born they do not even allow catch and release fishing anymore, and supposedly they have a higher standard. Apart from that, Australia has the second-highest standard. We should be proud of that and promoting our product accordingly.


But why does it not surprise me that the Greens and their fellow travellers celebrated the fact that they were able to stop Ta Ann timber from being used at the London Olympics? They celebrated the fact that regrowth and plantation forest product could not be used at the London Olympics because they had run a campaign against it. And do you know, Madam Acting Deputy President McKenzie, what was used instead of that Tasmanian product? Rainforest from Indonesia! In Australia our forest estate is growing; in Indonesia they are still deforesting at the rate of three million hectares per annum. Congratulations to the Australian Greens and their fellow travellers for providing a world market to Indonesian rainforests, which are being decimated at the rate of three million hectares per annum, instead of to regrowth timber from Tasmania where the forest estate is actually growing.


This is the result of manic Greens ideology which does not look to the outcomes of their policy and their determinations. Just as much as rainforests in Indonesia become the victims of green policy, so the people of Africa and the workers of Tasmania will become the victims of this sort of extreme green policy. This disallowance motion would seek to disallow the whole entitlement for small pelagic fisheries Australia-wide. There are small pelagic fisheries other than the one that the FV Margiris would be getting into and, as a result, other fishermen in areas where there is a sustainable small pelagic fishery would also be put out of business. Senator Scullion outlined this in his earlier contribution about the waters of South Australia. The Australian Greens never seek to just adjust a wing nut—they use a scorched earth policy to ensure that nothing is allowed to take place that might actually be sustainable or that might actually be profitable.


I say to the recreational fishing community in particular: be very careful when you join forces with the Australian Greens. If you reject the science for emotive reasons then you will undo the one strength that you have in opposition to the manic determination to have marine parks all over the place. I was involved in establishing the Commonwealth marine park around our home state of Tasmania, and I was able to achieve it with the support of green groups, recreational fishers and commercial fishers. It was a win for everybody. You can have sensible conservation, sensible recreational fishing and sensible commercial fishing all cohabiting if you set the policies right. And, with the south-east marine park that I was involved in, we achieved that result.


But the Australian Greens sought to determine, in the state waters of my home state, a marine park for all of D'Entrecasteaux Channel, right around Bruny Island, right through to Port Arthur—and it was the science and the nonsense of that that finally won out for the recreational fishers, as it should have done. But if you start getting into the business of rejecting the science just because you want a particular outcome, I say: be very careful in circumstances where that can then be replayed on the recreational fishers, and then marine parks of the sort that the Greens sought to impose on Tasmanians in southern Tasmania might occur. So be very careful who you play with and who you associate with in relation to these matters.


I am delighted that, when I was able to provide this most impressive scientific document from seven of the world's scientific fishing experts, people have said, 'That genuinely allays my concerns and my fears', because some of the matters raised by the Greens and promoted in the media have been able to be debunked. In particular, I refer to a paragraph on page 15 of the document. It is about the localised depletion, which is a matter of concern and which recreational fishers should be talking about and asking questions. Here are the answers that the Greens do not want to hear: 


Localised depletion is evaluated as unlikely with the proposed harvesting fractions applied in the SPF because most small pelagic species, and their predators, are highly mobile and local areas replenish quickly provided the overall stocks are not depleted. This has been the experience with small pelagic fisheries that have been similarly managed in Australia. 


However given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the SPF, it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


As I understand the situation, the FV Margiris and the company behind it would be fully agreeable to a condition of being moved on. This is how you come to sensible conclusions: you raise a genuine concern, you go to the company or the individual concerned, you raise it, and a sensible person would say, 'That's a fair enough concern. Why not have a move-on policy?' How can that move-on policy be enforced? As we heard from the minister, AFMA observers would be on board. 


I remember when I was minister and I was trying to get fishermen to agree to have a satellite system, a GPS system, fitted to their boats so that their movements could be monitored at all times, so AFMA knew exactly how long they would stay in any particular bit of water. Of course, if they were in one bit of water for three days on end, very close at all times, it would be fair to say that they were not engaging in the move-on policy, that they were throwing their net in time and time again in the same place. All these things are managed and when you explain them, people's genuine concerns are able to be genuinely relieved.


This is another way that the Greens do business. The only thing I say to those opposite is: what on earth are you doing in alliance with the Australian Greens? They are not your friends; they are not Australia's friends.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:11):  I rise today to support the disallowance motion put forward by my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson. I note with interest that the federal Liberals from Tasmania are now completely out of step with their Tasmanian counterparts. I note that the motion that was passed in the Tasmanian House of Assembly was supported by all three parties, and I particularly want to put on the record the statement of Mr Brooks, who is a Liberal member of parliament in Tasmania. He said: 'We, the Tasmanian Liberals, fully support recreational fishing, and that is why we wrote to the minister. That is why we heard the community concerns and we continue to stand up here and support this amendment. That is why it is going through: because the Tasmanian Liberals fully understand the needs that are being addressed.' The Tasmanian Liberals supported the motion that was put through the Tasmanian parliament, and the motion spells out very clearly at point 5 that both the Tasmanian Greens and the Tasmanian Liberal Party supported it. 


The people that, just a moment ago, Senator Abetz suggested that no-one should have anything to do with, the Greens in Tasmania, had to do with the Liberal Party and they have publicly voiced their respective opposition to this proposed supertrawler with the shared concern that the federal Labor minister, Senator Joe Ludwig, has failed to demonstrate that this commercial fishery activity will be sustainable and will not cause localised depletion off Tasmania. So the Tasmanian Liberals now obviously disown Senator Abetz and his other Tasmanian colleague, Senator Colbeck, or they do not—one way or the other. You cannot walk both sides of the street and have your Tasmanian Liberal members in the Tasmanian House of Assembly absolutely standing there saying that they are in unison with the Greens and saying that Minister Ludwig has failed to address the issues of local depletion and then have your federal counterparts here saying something entirely different. 


The fact of the matter is: if there are people in the Liberal Party who represent the scorched earth policy that is being talked about, it is people like Senator Abetz, who wants to see that scorched earth policy; it is what he has supported for years. He talked for a moment or two about the forest industry and I have to say that in Tasmania, if there was anyone who was responsible for manic maladministration in the forest industry in Tasmania, it occurred during the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement when Senator Abetz was the federal minister. To this day that is on the record at the National Audit Office.


We have had a lot being said by Senator Ludwig about the science, and we have had a bit of a spiel from Senator Abetz on that. Let me quote specifically what the scientific report had to say in relation to localised depletion. What has been left out and not repeated in this chamber of what the scientists said in the context of localised depletion was:


However given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the SPF, it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


There is nothing that the minister has said that actually gives anybody any comfort—scientists or fishermen and fishing communities—at all on localised depletion because there is no answer on the issue of localised depletion.


There is no answer because there is no management plan; there is nothing that says how you are going to stop this supertrawler, the FV Margiris, from actually sucking out the entire fishery in very specific places and depleting that fishery into collapse. There is no management plan. So if the minister and Senator Abetz are so confident that they have this under control, where is the management plan that addresses localised depletion?


What is more, where is the scientific research vessel that is going to go out and do the testing? I will tell you: the Tasmanians were so broke that they sold it and they got a whole $280,000 for it. It is in some bank account, and now they are wringing their hands saying, 'We don't have a vessel to do the scientific research. Instead, we have to contractually engage one for specific tasks.' This is ridiculous. If you are going to bring a supertrawler into Australian waters, you had better have a better argument than just saying, 'We just expect local depletion not to occur,' because the local depletion will occur.


As for Senator Abetz suggesting that on the basis of social justice one ought to allow depletion of the fisheries somewhere around the world to feed West Africa, the reason that the fish stocks collapsed off West Africa is because of supertrawlers. That is why we have a global campaign being run by several organisations against supertrawlers, because they have had such massive impacts. If you want to talk about social justice the tragedy now is that as a result of those supertrawlers having overfished the waters off West Africa, local fishing people and villagers who depend on those fisheries for their protein requirements are now being forced to buy frozen fish on the world market because they have lost their local sustainability. That is a tragedy, and it is a cruel irony that this has occurred. It should not be allowed to continue. What we are now going to see is this supertrawler hitting Australian waters; the minister does not have a management plan which addresses local depletion, he does not have a monitoring capacity which actually gives anyone confidence about local depletion and we have had some cherry picking of the science here today, which actually does not give anybody any confidence because the scientists have said that there is uncertainty about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted and therefore it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. That is what everybody has been saying.


And as for this suggestion that somehow the distress in Tasmania has been in some way orchestrated by the Greens, that is not so. I can tell you that all around Tasmania people are very concerned about this supertrawler turning up in Tasmanian waters and engaging in this fishery, because people are asking the significant question: why was the quota increased to facilitate the supertrawler? Why? Why did you need to increase the quota if it was not just to facilitate the supertrawler? Also in relation to this, one has to ask: what level of subsidies are being paid for this supertrawler to operate in Australian waters? I can tell you that the fees and costs in relation to fuel, in particular, for such supertrawlers are very, very substantial.


But when I come back to this issue of 'social justice', I note the idea that you would expect African communities who have lost their resource to now buy fish out of Tasmanian waters, and would somehow suggest allowing local depletion in these fisheries here in order to catch up with the smashing of the local fisheries in West Africa, is an absolute disgrace.


What we have here is the fact that the federal Liberal senators, the federal Liberal members and, indeed, the federal Labor members it seems are completely out of step. It is interesting that they are out of step with their Tasmanian counterparts, because in the House of Assembly the government, the Greens and the Liberals all said that they did not have confidence in this process, they did not have confidence in the minister, Senator Ludwig, and they did not have confidence that there was a management plan that was able to address this issue of local depletion, and that stands.


What I am interested in today is that the minister is saying that the Tasmanian government actually has the power to stop this supertrawler docking in Tasmania by closing the ports to it and not giving it port access. So now we will come back and see the extent to which the Tasmanian parliament actually will act on this. But, as for this business of walking both sides of the street, of pretending that it is okay to stand up at a public meeting and say, 'I am really worried about it; I am going to go and talk to the minister about it,' and of people on both the Labor and Liberal back benches who might have been talking to the minister, the fact is that the minister has decided that he is going to allow this and drive this. The coalition are going to support it and so, ultimately, the issue here is that all that talk of concern about localised depletion counts for nothing if you are not actually prepared to vote on it.


This is a serious issue because fisheries around the world are in a state of collapse; we are seeing it all over the place. And as for the suggestion that Australia has some sort of fabulous record for sustainability, you only have to have lived in Tasmania at the time when the orange roughy fishery was first brought on to note the excitement over this big commercial deal and then to see the total collapse that then followed not long after.


I can tell you, there is no proud record in terms of fisheries depletion, and around the world this is really a very serious issue. If you are serious, Madam Acting Deputy President McKenzie, about maintaining fisheries, then you support marine parks as nurseries and you act on global warming, because the increased global temperature is leading to higher levels of acidification and reduced nutrient levels. The warm current coming down Tasmania's east coast is nutrient poor compared with the Antarctic upwelling which is nutrient rich, and all those in the coalition who continue to try to reject acting on global warming had better think about the impact on the onshore fisheries and the recreational fishery that they talk about, because those global warming changes are making a significant difference in the marine ecosystems. 


But the Greens stand absolutely to say that this should be disallowed, that the science has not stood up in terms of this issue. More particularly, the minister has not explained the increased quota. Neither has he explained how he is going to address local depletion or where the management plan is to address that local depletion, and he had better do that before we get to this issue of what to do on disallowance.

",Senate,<title>REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS</title>,<title>Disallowance</title>,REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS,24,2,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:23):  If evidence were needed, you have just heard with the previous speaker on this motion just how the Greens political party will stop at nothing to advance some of the ideas which they, for their own purposes—and I can never quite understand this—want to put onto the Australian public. 


I must say that Australia had the most sustainable forestry industry in the world. It provided jobs and wealth for Tasmania, but the Greens over a period of time have ensured that that industry has just about collapsed and so we are left to import our timber from countries around the world that have nowhere near the sustainable management practices that had been implemented in Tasmania. I can only think that the Tasmanian Greens want to see the day when that lovely state of Tasmania is economically bankrupt and is only held together by federal and state government grants and federal and state government workers. Every single enterprise that could make Tasmania the great state it once used to be seems to be in the sights of the Greens political party. It just distresses me as an Australian to see the most sustainable forestry industry in the world now on its knees. The Greens think that is pretty good. They do not mind about all the people out of work. They do not mind about the fact that the Tasmanian economy continues to fail and falter. They are able then to roam around the world with all their other leftist greenie mates and say, 'Look how good we are in Tasmania. We have shut down every private business. We have made Tasmania totally dependent upon government funding.' 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What about the wineries?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Give the wineries a little time, Senator Whish-Wilson. You will regret the day when the Greens, having succeeded in shutting down the forestry industry and having succeeded in shutting down the fisheries industry, look elsewhere. What will they turn on next? Can I suggest to you that it will probably be the winery industry, 'Look, it is allowing too many sediments,' or 'They have got to use some chemicals that will destroy some made up creature.' Mark my words, Senator, I anticipate that your former industry will be the subject of the next Greens campaign.


The disallowance of the Small Pelagic Fishery Total Allowable Catch (Quota Species) Determination 2012 motion is about fisheries, but I cannot talk about that easily. I really get quite emotional about the forestry industry in Tasmania because it was a great industry; it was the most sustainably managed in the world and now it is just finished. I have to say that I played a part in it. I, along with the CFMEU and eventually the support of the Labor Party in 2004, had that plan well documented, supported by the voters of Tasmania. I was followed as the minister by Senator Abetz who carried through the arrangements that had been made with the CFMEU, the Labor Party, the Tasmanian government, and it looked like we had a bright future again for the timber industry in Tasmania.


But no, the Greens never give up. As is often said: give them 15 per cent and they will accept that this week, but next week they will want 20 per cent, and the year after they will want 50 per cent, and they will keep going until they shut the industry down. This is about a fisheries disallowance, but I get emotional whenever I think about the beautiful state of Tasmania, a state that had so much to offer as part of Australia's economy. To see it now on its knees—thanks to the work of the Greens political party, initiated by their former leader who, thankfully, has moved on from this place, and some of the ideas that through persistence they have continued to impose upon the Tasmanian people—makes me feel very emotional. But if they want to ruin their own state of Tasmania, I guess that is for them.


But now they come up to the Coral Sea, a fishery which only had a few hundred tonnes of fish ever taken out of it, and suddenly, thanks to the Greens political party and their influence on a weak and divided Labor Party, they are going to shut down the whole Coral Sea—for what purpose, I do not know. What is the purpose? There was never any substantial fishing there. The only fishing there was by the marlin boats that would go out and catch some marlin, tag them so you could get a bit of scientific data, throw them back and move on. It created jobs and wealth and international tourist numbers into Cairns and Port Douglas and the Coral Sea. 


Thanks to the Greens now, there is another industry in my state that is on its knees because of the work of the Greens political party. Don't worry about what support you have; if you say it often enough the Greens will get some loony group around the world—Pew or someone else like that—to fund them and keep funding them until they do it.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I hear the question: where is the science? I was just about to talk about that. I was just going to quote from Professor Keith Sainsbury from the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies. This report of 6 July 2012 is well known to everybody, including to the Greens, but they will not talk about it because they do not want to quote anybody who has some scientific knowledge.


In my four years as the fisheries minister in the Howard government I came to respect the science, the expertise and the commitment of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. It is recognised, world wide, as one of the best fisheries management authorities. That is why, as Senator Ludwig quoted earlier, Australian fisheries are seen as one of the best managed in the world. We have nothing to be ashamed of; in fact, we have everything to be proud of given the way the Australian Fisheries Management Authority has managed our fisheries.


I might say that it was the coalition government that had Australia's first-ever oceans policy. As a result of that, we decided to have marine bioregions, and the very first one was in the south-east of Australia. Through consultation that went over many months between conservationists, the fishing industry, the recreational industry—all the stakeholders—we eventually came to a plan which has worked in the south-east. It allows for recreational fishing, it allows for commercial fishing, it allows for conservation zones; it allows for the restoration of the orange roughy fishery, which was mentioned by the previous speaker. This is what you can do with good science and goodwill and an arrangement that works with all relevant stakeholders.


The Greens do not want to look at the scientific reports, and if I have time I will read some of these into the record. The Greens political party follow the Julia Gillard approach to life: promise something, make an untruth about it and then you can get away with it. So Senator Milne, the previous speaker, attacked Senator Abetz for quoting from a report by saying: 'However, he left out this crucial bit,' which she then quoted. If Senator Milne has a look at Hansard she will see that Senator Abetz actually did say that. But she got up straight after him and said he did not do it. That incident in itself means little, except that it shows the approach and the tactics of the Greens political party: don't worry about the truth, don't worry about scientific evidence, just keep ranting your left-wing, loony mantra and eventually you will succeed. Regrettably, they have succeeded, practically shutting down the forestry industry and being well on the way to doing the same for the fisheries industry here.


Need I bring a discordant note into this debate by actually quoting from the scientists about this fishery? Professor Sainsbury says:


I have no doubt that this fishery is an example of world's best practice and it meets or exceeds the most rigorous scientific requirements for an ecologically sustainable fishery on forage fish.


This is the one that the Greens say is about to be decimated by an arrangement that has been approved by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. Professor Sainsbury went on to say:


These requirements are designed to be ecologically safe, especially in relation to dependent predators in the food web, for all the known food webs in the world.


I could read on, but this is publicly available. The Greens know it is there—but that is Professor Sainsbury, he is a scientist, he actually knows what he is talking about, and that does not count when you come to Senator Milne, who dismisses people like Professor Sainsbury and brings her version of good science to this chamber. It is the same sort of thing as we saw with Senator Milne's good friend Professor Flannery, the guy who told us six-metre tidal increases were going to inundate coastal parts of Australia and then went out and bought a property on the banks of a river just north of Sydney.



Senator Milne interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You say, 'What's that got to do with the price of eggs?' I am saying he has the same sort of approach as the Greens political party, and Senator Milne in particular. I do not know some of the newer Greens senators and I often say Senator Siewert is the only genuine environmentalist in the Greens political party, but Senator Milne is just a political warrior. I congratulate you, Senator Milne, as you have been very effective in both the Tasmanian parliament and this parliament in shutting down the timber industry and in making Tasmania a completely mendicant state, and you are well on your way to doing it with the fisheries industry.


Fortunately, I have to say, the Labor Party understand about jobs in Tasmania and initially were with us on the forestry. They have wobbled a bit in recent times, but I am pleased to say the government on this occasion is recognising just what loony approaches you get from the ultra-left-wing political ideology driven group that call themselves the Greens political party.


In this instance I am delighted that Senator Ludwig has had the backbone and the fortitude to go with the science and ignore those who keep his government in power.


The mistruths peddled by the Greens in this particular debate even make Ms Gillard's promise that 'There will be no carbon tax under a government that I lead,' almost look truthful. The Greens tell you that this is a Dutch boat that is going to do it. The fact is that it is an Australian flagged vessel.




Senator Milne:
  No, it is not.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The vessel is to be operated by Seafish Tasmania, a business that has been catching and processing jack mackerel since the early 1980s.




Senator Milne:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is a Lithuanian flagged vessel.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McKenzie
):  There is no point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The vessel is to be based in Devonport, Tasmania. The crew will be principally Australian. It will fish outside the three-mile state limits and the catch is going to be frozen on board—which makes the whole exercise more productive. I do not say this in a scientific way, but my understanding is that the licences that were there for several fishing operations have been combined and are now being worked off this one vessel because it is more efficient and it is more ecologically sustainable. One of the owners said:


We are extremely confident our fishing operation will result in long-term employment and economic benefits for Devonport and the North-West Coast of Tasmania.


But why bother saying that to the Greens political party? The things they are least interested in are employment and economic benefits for Devonport, the north-west coast of Tasmania or indeed anywhere in Australia.


The fish targeted—redbait, jack mackerel and blue mackerel—live near the surface of the water column, not at the bottom of the water column. They continuously swim in open water and they tend to be nomadic. It is managed, as I said before, by AFMA under a statutory management place.


I heard Senator Milne talk about what I loosely describe as a 'move on' provision. As Senator Milne well knows, the operators of this boat, the Australians who make a living sustainably catching fish in this small pelagic fishery, have said that they are happy to do this. So I would have thought that Senator Milne would have been congratulating them for their agreement to do this—even though they are not required to and even though AFMA and the scientists say that it is not necessary. But, if there is a concern with the local recreational fishing people, they are very happy to do that, because they want to work with others.


Senator Milne indicates that only the Greens are interested in the recreational fishing industry. Well, anyone that knows anything about recreational fishing knows that the political party that has most helped recreational fishing in Australia over many, many years is of course the Liberal-National party. I remind senators—although you should not need reminding—that it was the Howard government that introduced a $15 million program to actually put some money into helping the recreational fishing industry.


In North Queensland and the Coral Sea, we understand what the recreational fishing industry is about. We understand how, as environmental managers, they are perhaps as good as the scientists and the fishery managers. Most recreational fishermen understand what it is all about—as do the commercial fishermen. When the recreational fishing people in the north, in the Coral Sea, are willing to string up any Green that they can find, it is interesting to hear Senator Milne say how the Greens are looking after recreational fishermen in Tasmania. I suggest that they should get the Tasmanians to have a talk to the North Queensland brethren, and they will realise that they are being duped by the words that flow out of the mouths of the Greens in Tasmania.


I conclude my remarks on this subject by again saying that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority has an enviable worldwide record for proper management of fisheries.




Senator Milne:
  What about the orange roughy?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The orange roughy is coming back, Senator, and I mentioned that. But this is typical—as was the case with Senator Abetz. He quotes something and you get up and accuse him of not even mentioning it. As I said before, the orange roughy fishery is coming back because of good fisheries management. A problem occurred and good fisheries management puts it back together. But you will never hear that from the Greens political party. You will hear from them all of the lies and all of the misrepresentation of facts—anything to pursue their whacky left-wing agenda that should be exposed to the people of Australia.


If it comes to proper management and proper science, do you believe the Professor Sainburys of the world, do you believe AFMA or do you believe a politician of the reputation of Senator Milne? I know where I will go for my science—and I know what the people of Australia will ultimately recognise about the Greens approach to these areas. All I can say is trust the scientists, look at the scientific approach to management of fisheries and go with the professional fisheries management people and you cannot go wrong.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (16:43):  I will freely admit that a month ago I would not have had a clue what a pelagic fishery was. If anyone had asked me I would have said that it perhaps had something to do with fossils and an archaeological dig. But, because of a number of actions that have occurred in the recent past, I have certainly come to understand a lot more about the fishing industry across Australia—and particularly in relation to my home state of Queensland. I have readily admitted to everyone I have discussed this issue with that I am by no means an expert on fishing or the fishing industry.


In fact, most of my attempts at being a recreational fisher have ended in failure at the very least to catch a fish.


I rise today to speak because I would like to ask the Greens to reconsider the position that they have adopted in this motion they are putting with regard to the Margiris. As a number of speakers have already pointed out, we have extremely well-managed fisheries. The Margiris will have a quota. They will take 20 per cent of the catch from the areas they fish when it has been recommended that up to 80 per cent would continue to be sustainable. There should be no concerns about the work that is being undertaken by the Margiris.


There is a quote from yesterday by Senator Whish-Wilson in today's papers where he says:


We've done it—


meaning the disallowance motion—


as a last-ditch attempt to have Parliament debate the issue and to get support for the members of the public who say the super trawler should not be allowed in Australian fisheries until key concerns have been addressed …


I am very pleased that Greens want key concerns addressed and I wish they would adopt that view in terms of the federal government's current move to massively extend marine parks throughout Australia.


Senator Whish-Wilson has talked about getting support from members of the public. This is an excellent thing to do, but only if the members of the public are properly informed. In my view, this is not what is happening. On this issue and the issue of more than doubling the number of marine parks in Australia, there is disinformation being spread by environmental groups, presumably with the full support of the Greens.


I draw to your attention, Madam Acting Deputy President, a very glossy little brochure that came into a mailbox recently with a very cute little clownfish on the front. Who would not want to save a cute little clownfish? Everyone would want to save a cute little clownfish. But the information in here could only be described as extremely selective. They paint a beautiful picture of the marine treasures in the Coral Sea: 'the tropical waters are home to threatened sea turtles, manta rays, dolphins and more than 25 colourful reefs teeming with marine life.' Of course, everybody would want to save something like that.


The fact that it currently exists and is teeming with marine life apparently is not any reason to think that what is happening currently is sufficient. What it requires is a whole new regime to protect this. They can go on with motherhood statements and soft little stories about clownfish as much as they like. But the one thing that I find somewhat concerning about this brochure is that it went into every letterbox in the federal electorate of Brisbane and it has on it, 'No stamp required if posted in Australia'. It also went into the letterboxes of numerous other electorates around the Brisbane area.


When you look at the cost of this campaign, we are not talking about some small group that is surviving on the work of volunteers and the smell of oily rags. We are talking about a campaign that is better funded than any campaign by the fishing industry itself to maintain the excellent fishery management system that we currently have. This brochure is produced by a group called protectourcoralsea.org. It has about 20 members, all of whom are environmental groups including Greenpeace, the Wilderness Society and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and a number of other Queensland organisations. By suggesting to people that somehow not declaring massive areas of Queensland as marine parks will decimate the fish populations, these groups are attempting to trick and manipulate the public into supporting their campaigns. They even have campaigns to encourage recreational fishers to support their work by making the suggestion that there will not be fish there to catch if their plans are not allowed to proceed.


To give you one idea of the manipulation of information that goes on, I was interested to see a media release from Greenpeace which was published on 21 February this year. It says:


Lets make history: 3 days left to protect Coral Sea


That is clearly wrong. Last time I looked the Coral Sea was still there and it was still functioning. It is protected by our fisheries management systems. It does not need the protection that these groups would have you put in place to undertake decent fisheries management. We do not need the number of marine parks in Australia increased from 27 to 60 without proper scientific and independent evaluation. The Liberal-National Party, as Senator Macdonald pointed out, have a very strong and proud history of creating national marine parks. The vast majority that currently exist were created by this government and when we are returned to government we will no doubt create more but only after independent scientific evaluation and after consultation with stakeholders.


I continue to be amazed at the attitude of some the green groups to the very legitimate concerns raised by the fishing industry regarding the Coral Sea and the expansions right along the Queensland coast of highly restricted areas for fishermen. They seem to take the attitude that the fishing industry should just read their propaganda, not have their own views, and just accept that the green groups know best. It is pompous at the very least.


The fishing industry is concerned because it was not adequately consulted by the minister when the Coral Sea programs were announced. I would imagine that the same concerns around the Margiris are based on the fact of lack of consultation, but then again it is something that this government is famous for. Someone recently referred to what was allegedly a consultation process as 'Well, they came and did show and tell, but they didn't consult us'. This is something this government is quite famous for—that is, its ability to do show and tell and claim it has undertaken consultation.


One of the groups backing Protect Our Coral Sea is a group known as the Ocean Elders. I find the Ocean Elders somewhat offensive as a title for a group of what appears to be overseas billionaires. We have the likes of singers Neil Young and Jackson Browne and that wonderful saviour of the world Richard Branson. The Ocean Elders come from every country but one in the world—all except Australia. But there they are, being very pleased that Australia is locking up its fisheries in marine parks—not their own fisheries, but locking up our own. You can see that because none of them rely on fishing or the fishing industry, they are quite happy about this.


One of the things that upset me about this was the fact that this group, clearly encouraged by the Protect Our Coral Sea organisation and the alliance of green groups in that, has taken on that term 'elders'—suggesting that in some way it is the protector of our fisheries, our seas, our lands. We can very easily turn to our own elders if we want to talk about managing the oceans and seas around Australia. The Indigenous elders of Australia, from the Torres Strait right around the entire coast, have been doing this for thousands of years. I was lucky enough that one of my staff was able to speak to Phil Rist, who is the executive officer of the Girringun Aboriginal Corporation, which is at Cardwell. Cardwell is halfway between Townsville and Cairns and has the Coral Sea on its doorstep. The Girringun Aboriginal Corporation represents six saltwater tribal groups: the Djiru, the Gulnay, the Girramay, the Bandjin, the Warrgamay and the Nywaigi. It was the first Indigenous group established in the country in partnership with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service to develop a traditional use of marine resources agreement—known as TUMRA.


Under the agreement, a steering committee has been set up with elders from the six saltwater tribal groups. These groups are startled—I suppose that would be the best word—and dismayed at the idea that others would choose to call themselves the Ocean Elders and to give the impression that they are somehow the custodians of our seas and the custodians of the fish and the sea life that live in those seas. Our elders have done a brilliant job of managing their resources, as have our fishing industries. I continue to be very, very concerned about the fact that many of the groups involved in the Protect Our Coral Sea organisation or alliance continue to try to mislead recreational fishers into thinking that somehow they should be different, they should see the commercial fishers as an opponent and not as an ally. 


In fact what is going to happen throughout Queensland will be the loss of thousands of jobs. The Cairns Regional Council recently decided to make a submission on Minister Tony Burke's proposal around the marine parks, and 10 September is the deadline for doing this. It has decided to make a submission based on an independent assessment that it had done which suggests that the cost of the changes Minister Burke is suggesting to Cairns and to the Far North Queensland area will be $1 billion. The environment department has decided that all it will cost the Cairns economy would be $1.1 million. But the Cairns council, which I would suggest knows Cairns a little better than the department of the environment, has looked not only at the effects on the Cairns local area, but also at the effects on the areas around Cairns and at the effects on the flow-on businesses. 


This is something that I think in almost every circumstance we have had a lot of trouble getting this government to understand. It still does not appear to understand the cumulative effect of the carbon tax on small business and on others when, time after time, the price of everything, every input that you have in your small business is affected—sometimes incrementally; sometimes seriously. Those are the costs that drive people out of business and that is what is going to happen across the fishing industry.


It will not just be the commercial fishermen who will be affected; it will not just be recreational fishermen who will be affected. It will be boat manufacturers, outboard motor distributors and manufacturers. It will be the bait and tackle shops. It will be the chandleries that create the anchors—and the list will go on, right through from fish and chip shops to the Australian consumer in the end. Right now, 72 to 75 per cent of our seafood in Australia is imported. That figure will rise if the government goes ahead with its plan, with Greens support, on the development of these marine parks.


We must do better in this area. We must use scientific evaluation. Senator Whish-Wilson wants to have key concerns addressed and evaluation carried out on the Margiris,because that is something that the Greens do not want. But, when we come to a proposal such as the marine parks, which will wipe out vast numbers of businesses that are related to and are in the fishing industry, the Greens do not want to know a thing about key concerns or about scientific evaluation. They simply want to produce pretty little brochures with clownfish on them. Of course everyone wants to protect them, but in this case they are dishonestly giving the impression that clownfish will be endangered if we do not go ahead with the marine parks—a complete and utter nonsense.


What is endangered and threatened—and this was mentioned at a rally that I organised in Brisbane two weekends ago to protest about Minister Burke's proposal—is a very, very successful business that has been established out of Cairns, collecting and selling 'Nemos'. This business has been established with the support and approval of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Fisheries Management Authority and others. It is a completely sustainable business and it is providing clownfish—'Nemos', as most people now call them—to aquariums worldwide. The business plan for this company was based on the view that they would be able to continue to collect clownfish in what was an approved and sustainable way. That now changes for them.


It is not just this one company that will be affected. It is dozens and dozens of companies up and down the Queensland coast, some of whom have even had calls from their bank managers, telling these companies that they want to reassess their risk profile on the basis of this. So I would really like to ask the Greens to be a little consistent here. If they want to not go ahead with the Margiris until it can be scientifically evaluated and until key concerns can be addressed, surely they should be applying exactly the same argument to the marine park proposal from Minister Tony Burke. We cannot just use pretty pictures and say that, because one is done by a company that is catching quite unattractive fish, they somehow are a lesser industry.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:03):  I rise to wrap up the debate on this motion for disallowance of the Small Pelagic Fishery Total Allowable Catch (Quota Species) Determination 2012. Yesterday we saw something historic happen here. I tabled a motion from the Tasmanian lower house, where all three parties got together and consistently said, in a unified voice, that they did not support the entrance of the supertrawler to Australian waters and they wanted the supertrawler stopped until key risks could be addressed. We have had the debate. Everyone is watching. Tasmania is watching; Australia is watching. Federal Labor and federal Liberal senators have turned their backs on their state counterparts and they have turned their backs on the Tasmanian people.


We have heard a lot about Professor Keith Sainsbury and the scientists at AFMA. We have considerable respect for the scientists. We have never questioned the veracity of their science or the good work that they have done. We have simply said that they have clearly said and acknowledged in their report, Commonwealth small pelagic fishery: general background to the scientific issues, which has been quoted ad nauseum by the Liberals today, that the idea of local depletion needs to be managed. The Greens moved this motion because we wanted to see a plan in place for that. It is easy to denigrate the debate, which is exactly what has happened today, and as a new senator to this chamber I would like to express my disappointment that what was a very genuine motion to address a problem has slipped into vitriol and negativity. That is exactly what people outside this chamber do not want to see from their elected representatives.


I would like to quote from a media release put out by TARfish, the key recreational fishing group in Tasmania, as to why they walked away from a working group with the government on this issue of local depletion:


… TARFish has come to the conclusion that there is a lack of detailed scientific knowledge surrounding;


1. the extent and rates of movement of each species of small pelagic fish


2. the amount of time it would take for local populations of small pelagic fish to recover from intensive localized fishing and


3. the size of the resident population of Jack Mackerel on the East Coast of Tasmania.


These are not the rabid, left-wing, loony Greens that the Liberals would have you believe are behind this fearmongering on the entrance of one of the world's biggest supertrawlers, which, like it or not, has been dogged with controversy everywhere it has gone. It is a fair thing to question the risks that this supertrawler poses without criticising the scientists.


We have never had a supertrawler in Australian waters before. It is a fair thing to question this and that is exactly what our disallowance motion has done today. It gave us the chance to support the lower House in Tasmania—Greens, Liberals and Labor—in an effort to step back until the checks and balances have been put in place. We have heard lots of noise about the science. From my understanding, and my meetings with Professor Keith Sainsbury, and my friends who work in the same areas as he does in Tasmania, he has done considerable work on the science behind marine protected areas. It is also my understanding that he is in favour of marine protected areas as one tool in the fisheries management box.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I am looking forward to you rolling out his science on this issue, just like you have on his very good work in the report that was released yesterday. Considering it is the only thing you have in your chest of ammunition, let us make it very clear once again that this report clearly says that world best fisheries practice is to manage local depletion issues.




Senator Colbeck:
  Don't misrepresent!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I will read it word for word exactly from the report. It is the final part of a paragraph in the conclusion of the report:


However, given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the small pelagic fisheries it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


So, we all agree on the science. We have a chance here tonight in front of the Tasmanian people to stand up for them. I would still urge coalition senators and Labor senators to support our disallowance motion, to take the time to get this right.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  The question is that the motion for disallowance be agreed to. I am advised that we cannot have a division. I remind honourable senators that if a division is called on Thursday after 4:30 pm the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned pursuant to standing order 57(3) until the next day of sitting at a time to be fixed by the Senate. Accordingly, the matter is adjourned.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:10):  I rise today to speak in favour of the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2010. I also point out to the senators in the chamber and, of course, to those who may be listening to this debate that this also includes amendments that have been circulated since this bill went through a very thorough Senate inquiry. The report of that inquiry determined, in order to put at ease some of the concerns in relation to religious freedom, that the bill be strengthened in that area. That would ensure that for those who want to make sure churches and religious groups can continue to marry those whom they feel they would best like to are able to do so without being impinged upon by any of the changes that this bill would inflict on the Marriage Act. The ability has always been there for religious organisations to determine who they marry and who they do not. We have churches making that decision on a daily basis. The circulated amendments suggest that there is no doubt that that is the case under this bill.


The main purpose of this marriage equality bill is to remove the current discrimination in the Marriage Act so as to clearly allow for two people, regardless of their gender, regardless of their sexuality, the legal right to marry. This is a campaign for true equality within the Australian law. It is something that has been fought long and hard, not just here in Australia but also around the world. We know that country after country continues to take up this very, very important cause, putting truth behind the belief for equality for all.


If this parliament were to agree to this bill and to pass it into law, we could take advantage of the strong opportunity that we know exists for same-sex couples in the Australian community who desperately want the right to marry under law. The parliament could take the opportunity by both hands to make a reform that the majority of Australians believe in. The majority of Australians now agree that marriage equality's time has come. Poll after poll has proven that there has been a shift in the mindset of the Australian community to accept that true equality must include the amendments to the Marriage Act to allow equality to reign in love. That is what this bill proposes to do.


I spent this morning with the Hinton family, a local family here in Canberra. Ivan Hinton and Christian Teoh desperately want their love and their relationship recognised under law. This lovely couple, surrounded by their mums and dads, their brothers and sisters, and even their aunts, were in Parliament House today advocating for their right to have their marriage legally recognised under Australian law. They had to go to Canada to marry and when they arrived back in Australia their marriage was no longer valid. They would have loved to have been able to marry in the country that they love, but because of the current discrimination another couple have had to go overseas to be accepted for who they are. This is the reason that we need to amend the Marriage Act.


I had someone send me a message this morning. They asked: 'Why is this even a matter of debate? This should be a matter of love. This should be a matter of equality. Why is it that in 2012 we are still debating the true essence of equality?' A very good question. The answer is that this place has taken so long to catch up with the will, the compassion and the desire for equality that already exists in the Australian community. The key in this debate is this: how would allowing same-sex couples the same rights as everybody else diminish the institution of marriage? Clearly it would do nothing to diminish the institution of marriage. In fact, if anything it would strengthen the institution of marriage. When we see such questions from opponents of true equality who point to what this would do and how this would undermine people's marriages, the truth is that it will not do that, will it? This is about allowing couples to marry each other, to have their love recognised under federal law and to ensure that our parliament and our federal legislation treat all people equally. Cupid does not discriminate and neither should the law.


Marriage is about two people in a committed and loving, lifelong relationship that has nothing to do with their sexual orientation or their gender identity. It is now time for this parliament to recognise that removing this discrimination that currently exists is not just long overdue but inevitable. We know that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, continues to block his members from having a free vote on this matter. I hope that in the weeks and months to come, those within the Liberal-National coalition who I know support removing this discrimination will be able to have their voices heard and their desires for equality realised, and be able to voice the opinions of their constituents.


We also know that the Prime Minister, despite her own party's policy on this, continues to lag behind and sit on the wrong side of history, despite the fact that other world leaders have taken the great step to accept that it is time for marriage equality to be realised. We have seen it with the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. Prime Minister David Cameron says that he supports marriage equality, that he wants to see the love and relationship of a committed couple recognised in his country's law. He says that he supports marriage equality not despite being a Conservative but because he is a Conservative. He believes that the strength of the institution of marriage, the strength that it gives and the importance that it gives to community must be something that is inclusive of all couples. 


We have seen Barack Obama, the President of United States, who was once a staunch opponent of marriage equality, change his view. He has seen the desire of the community and the acceptance of the next generation to ensuring that equality for all must be real. You cannot just pretend it exists; you must deliver it. Barack Obama has been very open and upfront about the fact that his view has changed. That is the type of leadership that we should be seeing from our leaders here in Australia. 


Rather than being left on the wrong side of history, rather than lining up with the Tea Party of America, Tony Abbott should line up with members of his own party in supporting marriage equality. Julia Gillard has the opportunity to show what a progressive leader in this country looks like. She has the opportunity to not be the last Prime Minister in Australia to block such an important social reform. Marriage equality is inevitable. It is simply a matter of time. Those of us in this place and outside this place who have fought long and hard for these reforms would prefer not to have to waste more time because our leaders are so staunch in their opposition to marriage equality and so blinded by the desire for change from our communities. I am reminded of the very serious and harmful message that is sent to the young people in our communities when the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition say that because of someone's sexuality they are second-class citizens. That is the reality of the message that is being sent. 


Every time our Prime Minister is on national television saying that marriage is between a man and woman, her view will not change and everybody else should get over it, that negative message comes through. But that message is wrong and should not be allowed to exist in 2012, in modern Australia. It is time we got rid of it. What is most important is that as elected representatives in this place, the custodians of justice under the law, we fight for equal rights regardless of who a young man or woman happens to love. The message that we need from our leaders is that young gay and lesbian Australians' love is equal. They are equal under the law, and their families understand that they are considered just as everybody else is. These are young people, older people and in-between people who defend our country, who care for us, who clean for us, who teach us, who entertain us, who pay the same amount of tax as the rest of us, and yet this piece of law as it currently stands says that they are not equal.


I put it to the Senate that it is time we rid Australia of his outdated and archaic discrimination. There are 12 countries in the world which have moved to take hold of this important reform and there are many more soon to follow: the United Kingdom, Brazil, France, even our Kiwi brothers and sisters in New Zealand. The Conservative Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, said that he backs marriage equality and it will become law in New Zealand.


I want to remind us of a little bit of history. In the 1960s in the United States, a brave black woman appropriately named Mildred Loving and her white husband, Richard, launched a class action against the state of Virginia. Mr and Mrs Loving had been tried for and convicted of inter-racial marriage and they decided to take a stand. The case went to the US Supreme Court, and in 1967 the court ruled that the laws were discriminatory. They were overturned, and Mildred's and Richard's prison sentences were overturned. 


It is little known that in Australia we had very similar laws where we discriminated against the love of two people because of their race. Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland once had Aboriginal protection acts that included provisions allowing state officials to determine who Aboriginal people could marry and who they could not. On 13 August 1959, in the midst of debating Australia's first national Marriage Act, the House of Representatives erupted in furore at the news that an Aboriginal woman had been denied permission to marry. In Darwin, the Protector of Aborigines had refused Gladys permission to marry her fiancé who was white—his name was Mick. In response to questions from the opposition, the Menzies government promised that such discrimination would never be written into Australia's federal marriage law.


We have been here before. We have seen reform properly legislated for in this place and an acceptance of and trust in and compassion for and belief in the strength of love. This is a chance to do it all again for the right reasons, to rid legislation of discrimination that does exist and to allow people in Australia, regardless of their sexuality, their gender or their cultural background, the right to marry the person they love. We know that we can move on from the dark days of history and we can correct mistakes of the past. This is an opportunity to take the things we know are right and put them into practice. The Australian community overwhelmingly supports this reform. Senators in this place and MPs in the other place have been inundated with letters, phone calls, emails and visits from many, many Australians—those who are in homosexual relationships, those who are in heterosexual relationships, those who are mums and dads of adult children and who want to have their sons' and daughters' rights recognised in law.


There is huge support for marriage equality in Australia, and the parliament that gets it right, the parliament that can take hold of this need and desire for and belief in equality, will be a parliament that the Australian public congratulates wholeheartedly. We know that support for this reform crosses all boundaries—cities, suburbs, regional areas, the bush, as well as the various political parties. The majority of coalition voters support marriage equality. The majority of Christian Australians support marriage equality. We have had representatives from various religious organisations and churches walk the halls of this place asking us to give all Australians a fair go by ensuring that the institution of marriage can be strengthened for evermore and that the strength that marriage gives families can be recognised by this parliament.


The importance of allowing two people's relationship to be understood and defined by the universal language of marriage and love is something that MPs in this place should grab hold of; they should stand tall and accept that we are doing a good thing. The majority of Australians believe that this is the right thing to do, and more and more people agree that this change should happen.


The fight for marriage equality is not going to be won and lost in this place; it has already been won out there in the Australian community. It is now up to this place to recognise that, unlike some issues, where we are leading the way, in this one, unfortunately, we are following. But we can turn that around and accept that if Cupid does not discriminate neither should the law. Love is love and equality does matter.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:31):  Let me very briefly state to the Senate the coalition's position on the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2010. The coalition made an undertaking to the Australian people at the 2010 election that we would support the existing definition of marriage and, having made that undertaking to the Australian people, we are not going to act at variance to it. The Labor Party has changed its position, because Julia Gillard gave a similar undertaking to the Australian people at the 2010 election but subsequently facilitated arrangements within the Labor Party to allow that undertaking to be vacated. When we in the coalition give an undertaking to the public we stick by it, whether it be on the carbon tax, private health insurance, or any issue, and this is one such issue.


After listening to Senator Sarah Hanson-Young's speech I am bound to say that one would have thought there was only one available view. Senator Hanson-Young, I have to tell you that yours is not the only view. Much as those who advocate your view do so, I am sure, in good faith, you will not win this argument by seeking to silence alternative views. People are entitled to have their own views about marriage, as you have yours. People who have a more conservative view than yours about marriage are as much within their rights as you are.


To me, your bill is a bill about marriage but it is not a bill about equality. Equality for same-sex people was won in this parliament, in this Senate, with the support of all parties, including mine, by the amendments that were made to a suite of Commonwealth statutes in 2008. I said at the time that it had been too long in coming. I had myself, within the Howard government, been agitating for that for years, as many of my colleagues had been. But after those bills were passed with the support of all parties there was no Commonwealth law which treated same-sex people in relationships any differently than opposite-sex people in a relationship.


But your bill is not about equality, Senator Hanson-Young, even though you claim that it is; it is about marriage. Marriage is an institution defined by custom, religion and law, or at least by some of those things. For you to have discovered that an institution which has been understood to mean one particular thing for the entire history of humanity is, all of a sudden, a fundamentally unjust institution, as it is understood according to its traditional conception, is an extraordinary impertinence. When you use the phrase, 'Let us put behind us the dark pages of history,' do you really think, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, that history began with you? Do you seriously think that the human conscience began with you? Or do you not allow for the fact that, just as you have your views, which I am sure are held in good faith, other people have their views which are also held in good faith. Those views reflect the entire understanding and the entire course of human history of what a marriage is, and you should, if I may say so, pay a little more respect to those who do not agree with you.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
): I remind all senators who are participating in this and other debates to address their remarks through the chair.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,25,1,speech
"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-08-23,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (17:35):  I stand in this place as one of many strong supporters for marriage equality in the Labor Party. Marriage equality for many in our party fits with our values of fairness, equality, family and compassion, as well as reason, logic and progress. Values of fairness include fairness to all in our community, fairness for all those in our society who are doing it tough for many reasons, fairness to those who have a disability, fairness to those who are less fortunate, and fairness to have the opportunity to succeed regardless of circumstance. Values of equality include equality to all those in our society regardless of gender, religion, race, sexual orientation and age; and equality for those in our society about how they live their lives and the opportunities they should receive.


Values of family stand whatever the make-up of that family is. Families today are very different to what history would define a family to be. Regardless of how a family is made up, the support from a family unit is now as important to individuals and to the community as ever.


A close, caring, loving, respectful family network is something that we should all support and foster regardless of what a family's makeup is. It is about values of compassion, respect and tolerance. If a friend or a stranger stumbles in the street, we do our best to help them out but we always respect their choices and decisions—not prejudging people for whatever reason. I believe in respecting people for what and who they are, not what others like them to be. I respect people based on their actions unto others and values of reason, logic and progression. I endeavour to approach issues with reason and logic. Prejudice consistently results in poor outcomes. Attempting to use reason and logic to progress our society for the betterment of our grandchildren and their grandchildren is at my core.


Australians now overwhelmingly want our parliament to amend the Marriage Act: to allow any two adults, regardless of sex, sexuality or gender identity, the honour and privilege of standing in front of their family and friends and making a commitment to each other; to allow the children of people in same-sex relationships the stability of knowing that their family is just as special as all other families; to allow the community to celebrate the love and commitment of two Australians who are no doubt good citizens who pay their taxes and abide by the law of the land.


I read for senators a motion passed at the 2009 Tasmanian state Labor conference supporting marriage equality:


This Tasmanian state Labor conference believes that all couples who have mutual commitment to a shared life should have their relationships treated equally and without discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation. The conference believes in equal access to marriage under Australian law, regardless of the sex of the parties. The government should reform the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples the right to marry, therefore fully recognising their relationship and removing discrimination. The conference believes the government should recognise the change in the community attitudes regarding this issue and bring full equality to the law.


That motion was passed in 2009. It was the first of its kind from a state Labor conference. Tasmania, a state that in 1997 amended its criminal code to remove homosexuality, is also the first state where a major party clearly voted in favour of marriage equality. It is testament to the values of our Labor members in Tasmania that they wanted to continue the long and proud history of delivering change—a proud history of giving effect to the principle of equality and ensuring that inequality is not sewn into the fabric of our community. It was Labor governments that introduced the first land rights legislation, introduced the Racial Discrimination Act, recognised native title through the Mabo legislation, enacted the Sex Discrimination Act, repealed the ban on gays and lesbians serving in our armed forces, introduced the Disability Discrimination Act, and will soon amend the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency to become the improved and more encompassing Workplace Gender Equality Agency.


Tasmanian Labor has led the nation with progressive change, upholding values of equality and fairness. Tasmania is the only state to provide compensation to the stolen generations and was one of the first states to apologise. It is the state with the most progressive anti-discrimination laws in the country, it was the first state to introduce a relationship register, and it was the first state to recognise same-sex marriages recognised in other jurisdictions. Just recently, at our state Labor conference, Premier Lara Giddings passionately moved a motion, and I quote: 


This state Labor conference believes that in the event the federal parliament fails to end discrimination in the Federal Marriage Act, the state of Tasmania should step in to do the right thing and pass a state based gender-neutral marriage act. The conference believes that this will provide fair and equitable access to marriage to all Tasmanians and urges the Tasmanian government to act immediately to draft legislation in the event a vote to change the Marriage Act fails in the federal parliament.


The conference believes the state of Tasmania should allow marriage licenses to be granted to couples outside of Tasmania and notes the economic boon this would provide to the state. 


In just three years, our state went from being the first to support national marriage equality to being the first to support state based marriage equality. I congratulate Premier Giddings for her courage in taking on this challenge and I urge all members of the Tasmanian parliament to support fairness and marriage equality.


I thank the Rainbow Labor Network in Tasmania for their phenomenal lobbying work to put marriage equality on the agenda in Tasmania; to keep us, as a state branch of the ALP, reaffirming our commitment to marriage equality; and to push for state based marriage equality in the event of failure at a federal level, because marriage equality marries so well with so many Labor values. 


At last year's Tasmanian state conference, there was a contribution in support of marriage equality from a man who formerly looked upon homosexuality as wrong. He spoke of his struggle when his son 'came out'. It was a struggle to comprehend his son's sexuality that soon turned to how he could best support his son. As his son is now in a loving relationship, he spoke of his wish for his son to be able to marry the partner that he loves in front of his family and friends. The tide has turned in Tasmania. A survey conducted by Senator Carol Brown in 2011 of over 1,000 Tasmanians, a clear majority of 55 per cent supported marriage equality. 


In 2008, in one of our first actions as a new government, Labor amended over 85 pieces of Commonwealth legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex de facto couples. These amendments provide financial equality, assisting with the day-to-day financial security issues that were faced by same-sex de facto couples in Australia. Some Labor state governments have also provided fair access to assisted and reproductive technology such as IVF and have made same-sex couples eligible for adoption. These are great achievements. 


We must celebrate Labor achievements that have comprehensively removed discrimination towards same-sex de facto couples, making their day-to-day lives easier and opening opportunities that all Australians should have the right to access.


I follow the logic that if we can recognise and accept a couple as a couple and provide all couples with equal access to legal and financial benefits then we must also be able to support the symbolic and ceremonial recognition of same-sex couples by amending the Marriage Act. With regard to relationship recognition, the key issue here is no longer the ability to access legal or financial benefits; it is primarily a symbolic issue and is, as can be seen from the fierce debate it elicits, an extremely important one.


Same-sex couples want the same public, symbolic and ceremonial recognition of their commitment to each other. For those who say there can be state based registers—and I clarify that I mean those who say state based registers and not marriage—most relationship registers are intended as a non-ceremonial certification of same-sex couples. This fails to encompass one of the most important elements of relationship recognition. We can see this evidenced in Queensland, where the newly elected Liberal National government watered down the relationship register to such a degree that some marriage equality advocates have described it as like registering a pet or a car. To do anything but amend the Marriage Act continues to deny rights to members of our community and says to our community at large that same-sex couples are not equal. It says to our community that their relationships are of lesser value. It says to some young Australians that they are lesser members of our community—and for no good reason. Same-sex couples are not looking for any special treatment. They are not looking for anything more than anyone else. They are just asking for the same rights and to be treated as everyone else. They are just asking for their kids to have a fair go.


A child in my home town does not tell his friends about his mum's relationship. Although this nine-year-old boy should be worried about the games he will play with his mates and how to pass his tests at school, he is burdened with a fear that he will be bullied if his mates find out about his mum, who is in a loving relationship and does everything for him. Not being able to marry is very sad for her, but what is sadder is that her son cannot tell his peers about her relationship, because even at his young age he realises that he will be bullied. He does so many amazing and exciting things with them like camping, birdwatching, hiking and boating, just like any family, but it concerns him that he has to censor his life. It is so sad that a little boy already knows and has to live with discrimination.


Marriage equality can help to put an end to this for this boy and many others in the same situation. He is a boy whose childhood should be about instilling in him the skills and dreams that will see him become a good Australian. He is a boy who should be worried about the games to play with his friends, about what he needs to do for his next school assignment and about whether he got a few kicks in his last footy game—a boy who should not be burdened with the fear of bullying if he shares stories of his weekend with his mum and her partner.


Opponents of marriage equality use the pretence of protecting children as one of their major arguments. I challenge them to look a child like this brave boy in the eyes and say that the current laws are protecting him. I challenge them to move beyond their belief of what they see as a traditional family unit to accept that our society comprises so many family structures and that we must enshrine in our laws a safe environment for all of them.


Changing the Marriage Act will give us a future where all people are treated equally with dignity and respect, but it needs to be amended in a comprehensive and thorough fashion. There are currently a number of bills before the parliament on this issue. Labor members have moved to co-sponsor a comprehensive marriage equality amendment bill that addresses some technical concerns with this bill before us today. I understand that the bill will be given substantial time for debate during the September sitting period. I will support that bill when it comes to this place. It reflects that the party with the majority of supporters for marriage equality in this place should be the party that introduces the bill. It reflects that this bill as it stands will need to be amended, as all votes on marriage equality bills are the subject of conscience votes as lobbied so vigorously for by the Greens.


The Labor Party has a different value set from that of the Greens political party—values built over the past 200 years from our working-class base, values built through the trade union movement, values that stem from a base that reflects all that we are and all that we do. The Greens political party say they support action on climate change but twice voted against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They say they support refugees but they oppose population growth. They say they support science and fact based policy but with a sniff of opportunity jump straight on the fear bandwagon. What if we could look to transparency? No, the Greens political party conferences are all done behind closed doors. What about democratic internal party structures? Senator Thorp was elected by a vote of hundreds of rank-and-file members of the Tasmanian Labor Party. As far as I am aware, rank-and-file members of the Greens political party do not have the same opportunity. When many in the Labor Party were calling for a binding caucus vote on marriage equality, where were the Greens political party? They were out there demanding a conscience vote that would highlight divisions in the two major parties for political purposes. Today they have brought forward debate on this bill. What for? To pass it through parliament today. The Greens party must be judged by their actions on this issue.


I will share the story of a transsexual Tasmanian. If this woman were not honest with herself, she would be allowed to marry. She told me that twice she has been in love—once as a man and once since transitioning as a woman. Both relationships were exactly the same: both had highs and lows and both were founded on love. The first of these relationships was able to be celebrated publicly. They married, and the relationship thus gained society's blessing. After the death of his wife, who was the only person he had previously told of his struggles with his gender, he decided to transition. Since transitioning she has found love again, and again with a woman. But, no matter how this relationship is valued by her family, friends, colleagues and community, it is somehow less valued.


She explained that she is still the same person she was when she was married many years ago but that she is now more honest with herself and with her community. If the first relationship deserved recognition as a marriage it is only just that the second one does too. The only difference is her gender. In her current life, she has chosen to be more honest with society about who she is. Remarkably, if she had not undergone transitioning therapy and legally changed her sex she would be legally allowed to marry. This great country rewards people for their honesty. We must remove this barrier that prevents decent people from being fully honest with themselves and their community.


As Australians we pride ourselves on our ability on the sporting field. I have learned of the discrimination that a Tasmanian couple faced at their local golf club—a club that is always looking for new members—when they decided to join as partners. One was a successful golfer, and her new partner was keen to join as she knew quite a number of the members and thought it would be fun. The behaviour from some of the club members who had previously known her partner when she was a married straight woman was extremely hurtful to them both. Although they acted no differently to any other couple at the club, her partner was never welcomed as a new member. The club has a membership discount for married couples but, of course, these women could not qualify for that discount. They told me that it was not the money that hurt; it was the attitude that they were lesser members of the club. Even though one had been a club champion many times and the other was known and liked by many members outside of this setting, as you might expect, the burden of continual exclusion and snide remarks resulted in the women resigning from the club. This provides another example of how continuing to deny marriage equality instils discrimination within our society.


But attitudes change with time. Polls consistently show there is a majority support for marriage equality, and many countries around the world have recognised same-sex relationships. In Australian law there has always been a clear distinction between civil and religious marriages. People are able to be wed in a civil ceremony and a religious body is able to choose not to wed a couple and should remain free to have this choice. People of different religions are able to be wed and not all forms of marriage are permissible under law, even if they are allowed in a religious context. In recent years, two-thirds of marriages have been conducted in a civil ceremony with no involvement or mention of religion.


However, people are currently not free to have a wedding without discrimination. A marriage celebrant must, regardless of the wishes of the bride and groom, include in the monitum the Marriage Act's current definition of marriage. Without these words a marriage cannot be solemnised. A marriage celebrant highlighted to me the growing dissatisfaction from brides and grooms that these words must be used on their special day. That a phrase which a majority of our society feel is discriminatory and should be repealed must be recited in order for a marriage to be solemnised is so unfortunate. Is it not enough that same-sex attracted people are prohibited from marriage in this country? I acknowledge that this debate is difficult, that the community is divided and that, for many, overcoming long-held prejudices is tough. That is why I approach this debate with my Labor values at the fore, using values I derive from our Labor base. One of the Labor Party's great strengths is in fighting to promote equality, fairness and dignity for all. We must comprehensively move to end all legislated discrimination in this country.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  Before you commence, Senator Waters, I advise you that debate on this bill this evening will conclude at 6 pm.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (17:55):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is an honour to have the opportunity to be debating whether to amend legislation that is blatantly discriminatory, whether to take the radical stance that all citizens deserve the same rights. Freedom of sexuality and gender identity are fundamental human rights, and the acceptance and celebration of diversity are essential for social justice and real equality in our society. I am proud to stand with my Greens colleagues as a member of a party that has been fighting for equality for two decades. It is time that other senators face the fact that, when it comes to equality, there is no room for compromise.


I would like to congratulate the tireless activists who have been taking their case to the public, holding rallies, speaking at forums and talking to their neighbours. Their perseverance and patience in the face of an uphill battle has paid off. Polling has consistently shown that a majority of Australians, now 64 per cent of people, support the rights of same-sex couples to marry. In 2004, this chamber passed an amendment to the Marriage Act, making specific the implied discrimination that marriage is between one man and one woman. Greens and Democrats senators sat on one side of the chamber while Labor and coalition senators sat on the other. Only eight short years ago, each and every vote cast by the two old parties was cast in favour of entrenching discrimination. It is fantastic to see that, now, some senators have recently become champions for same-sex marriage within their parties and within their communities. The Greens and the LGBTI community and their friends and families have been waiting for the big parties to catch up, and it is really good to finally have you on board. Thank you for standing up for what is right.


It is important that this legislation passes the Senate. The Greens Marriage Equality Amendment Bill has the strongest cross-party support and the Senate inquiry reported back with a clear recommendation that the law should be changed. This report was endorsed by senators from all sides in this chamber. Whilst the leaders of the two old parties are busy loudly opposing same-sex marriage, with references to 'tradition' and 'the way it's always been', the community has slowly but surely been changing their mind. A quiet desire for improvement to the law is now a full-throated cry for complete equality. I join my fellow Greens senators and the LGBTI community in calling on the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to make a choice: get on board, or get out of the way. It is not acceptable for the Prime Minister and the opposition leader to impose their views on the entire Australian community and ride roughshod over both their voters and their parties. Prime Minister Gillard, let your members champion a reform they support. Mr Abbott, with polls now showing that 52 per cent of coalition voters support marriage equality, it is time to allow a conscience vote.


It is now up to senators to choose. Have they bought the line that same-sex marriage will destroy the institution of marriage? Will senators maintain their position that the definition of marriage is fixed? It used to be that the wife was the chattel, the human property of the husband, but, thankfully, long ago the community's perception of that being acceptable changed. That is the point: as a community's values change so do its social institutions.


Will senators stand up for Australia's reputation as a country where a fair go and equality before the law are valued? Or will they tarnish our reputation as a tolerant and accepting country?


Will senators demonstrate their belief in the importance of marriage by extending its benefits to all couples who love each other or demean the value of the institution of marriage by using it as a vehicle for prejudice and discrimination? Will senators turn down the $161 million—and that is a conservative estimate—that marriage equality would generate through expanding the profitable marriage economy to everyone?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:10):  I rise today to speak in favour of the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2010. I also point out to the senators in the chamber and, of course, to those who may be listening to this debate that this also includes amendments that have been circulated since this bill went through a very thorough Senate inquiry. The report of that inquiry determined, in order to put at ease some of the concerns in relation to religious freedom, that the bill be strengthened in that area. That would ensure that for those who want to make sure churches and religious groups can continue to marry those whom they feel they would best like to are able to do so without being impinged upon by any of the changes that this bill would inflict on the Marriage Act. The ability has always been there for religious organisations to determine who they marry and who they do not. We have churches making that decision on a daily basis. The circulated amendments suggest that there is no doubt that that is the case under this bill.


The main purpose of this marriage equality bill is to remove the current discrimination in the Marriage Act so as to clearly allow for two people, regardless of their gender, regardless of their sexuality, the legal right to marry. This is a campaign for true equality within the Australian law. It is something that has been fought long and hard, not just here in Australia but also around the world. We know that country after country continues to take up this very, very important cause, putting truth behind the belief for equality for all.


If this parliament were to agree to this bill and to pass it into law, we could take advantage of the strong opportunity that we know exists for same-sex couples in the Australian community who desperately want the right to marry under law. The parliament could take the opportunity by both hands to make a reform that the majority of Australians believe in. The majority of Australians now agree that marriage equality's time has come. Poll after poll has proven that there has been a shift in the mindset of the Australian community to accept that true equality must include the amendments to the Marriage Act to allow equality to reign in love. That is what this bill proposes to do.


I spent this morning with the Hinton family, a local family here in Canberra. Ivan Hinton and Christian Teoh desperately want their love and their relationship recognised under law. This lovely couple, surrounded by their mums and dads, their brothers and sisters, and even their aunts, were in Parliament House today advocating for their right to have their marriage legally recognised under Australian law. They had to go to Canada to marry and when they arrived back in Australia their marriage was no longer valid. They would have loved to have been able to marry in the country that they love, but because of the current discrimination another couple have had to go overseas to be accepted for who they are. This is the reason that we need to amend the Marriage Act.


I had someone send me a message this morning. They asked: 'Why is this even a matter of debate? This should be a matter of love. This should be a matter of equality. Why is it that in 2012 we are still debating the true essence of equality?' A very good question. The answer is that this place has taken so long to catch up with the will, the compassion and the desire for equality that already exists in the Australian community. The key in this debate is this: how would allowing same-sex couples the same rights as everybody else diminish the institution of marriage? Clearly it would do nothing to diminish the institution of marriage. In fact, if anything it would strengthen the institution of marriage. When we see such questions from opponents of true equality who point to what this would do and how this would undermine people's marriages, the truth is that it will not do that, will it? This is about allowing couples to marry each other, to have their love recognised under federal law and to ensure that our parliament and our federal legislation treat all people equally. Cupid does not discriminate and neither should the law.


Marriage is about two people in a committed and loving, lifelong relationship that has nothing to do with their sexual orientation or their gender identity. It is now time for this parliament to recognise that removing this discrimination that currently exists is not just long overdue but inevitable. We know that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, continues to block his members from having a free vote on this matter. I hope that in the weeks and months to come, those within the Liberal-National coalition who I know support removing this discrimination will be able to have their voices heard and their desires for equality realised, and be able to voice the opinions of their constituents.


We also know that the Prime Minister, despite her own party's policy on this, continues to lag behind and sit on the wrong side of history, despite the fact that other world leaders have taken the great step to accept that it is time for marriage equality to be realised. We have seen it with the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. Prime Minister David Cameron says that he supports marriage equality, that he wants to see the love and relationship of a committed couple recognised in his country's law. He says that he supports marriage equality not despite being a Conservative but because he is a Conservative. He believes that the strength of the institution of marriage, the strength that it gives and the importance that it gives to community must be something that is inclusive of all couples. 


We have seen Barack Obama, the President of United States, who was once a staunch opponent of marriage equality, change his view. He has seen the desire of the community and the acceptance of the next generation to ensuring that equality for all must be real. You cannot just pretend it exists; you must deliver it. Barack Obama has been very open and upfront about the fact that his view has changed. That is the type of leadership that we should be seeing from our leaders here in Australia. 


Rather than being left on the wrong side of history, rather than lining up with the Tea Party of America, Tony Abbott should line up with members of his own party in supporting marriage equality. Julia Gillard has the opportunity to show what a progressive leader in this country looks like. She has the opportunity to not be the last Prime Minister in Australia to block such an important social reform. Marriage equality is inevitable. It is simply a matter of time. Those of us in this place and outside this place who have fought long and hard for these reforms would prefer not to have to waste more time because our leaders are so staunch in their opposition to marriage equality and so blinded by the desire for change from our communities. I am reminded of the very serious and harmful message that is sent to the young people in our communities when the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition say that because of someone's sexuality they are second-class citizens. That is the reality of the message that is being sent. 


Every time our Prime Minister is on national television saying that marriage is between a man and woman, her view will not change and everybody else should get over it, that negative message comes through. But that message is wrong and should not be allowed to exist in 2012, in modern Australia. It is time we got rid of it. What is most important is that as elected representatives in this place, the custodians of justice under the law, we fight for equal rights regardless of who a young man or woman happens to love. The message that we need from our leaders is that young gay and lesbian Australians' love is equal. They are equal under the law, and their families understand that they are considered just as everybody else is. These are young people, older people and in-between people who defend our country, who care for us, who clean for us, who teach us, who entertain us, who pay the same amount of tax as the rest of us, and yet this piece of law as it currently stands says that they are not equal.


I put it to the Senate that it is time we rid Australia of his outdated and archaic discrimination. There are 12 countries in the world which have moved to take hold of this important reform and there are many more soon to follow: the United Kingdom, Brazil, France, even our Kiwi brothers and sisters in New Zealand. The Conservative Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, said that he backs marriage equality and it will become law in New Zealand.


I want to remind us of a little bit of history. In the 1960s in the United States, a brave black woman appropriately named Mildred Loving and her white husband, Richard, launched a class action against the state of Virginia. Mr and Mrs Loving had been tried for and convicted of inter-racial marriage and they decided to take a stand. The case went to the US Supreme Court, and in 1967 the court ruled that the laws were discriminatory. They were overturned, and Mildred's and Richard's prison sentences were overturned. 


It is little known that in Australia we had very similar laws where we discriminated against the love of two people because of their race. Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland once had Aboriginal protection acts that included provisions allowing state officials to determine who Aboriginal people could marry and who they could not. On 13 August 1959, in the midst of debating Australia's first national Marriage Act, the House of Representatives erupted in furore at the news that an Aboriginal woman had been denied permission to marry. In Darwin, the Protector of Aborigines had refused Gladys permission to marry her fiancé who was white—his name was Mick. In response to questions from the opposition, the Menzies government promised that such discrimination would never be written into Australia's federal marriage law.


We have been here before. We have seen reform properly legislated for in this place and an acceptance of and trust in and compassion for and belief in the strength of love. This is a chance to do it all again for the right reasons, to rid legislation of discrimination that does exist and to allow people in Australia, regardless of their sexuality, their gender or their cultural background, the right to marry the person they love. We know that we can move on from the dark days of history and we can correct mistakes of the past. This is an opportunity to take the things we know are right and put them into practice. The Australian community overwhelmingly supports this reform. Senators in this place and MPs in the other place have been inundated with letters, phone calls, emails and visits from many, many Australians—those who are in homosexual relationships, those who are in heterosexual relationships, those who are mums and dads of adult children and who want to have their sons' and daughters' rights recognised in law.


There is huge support for marriage equality in Australia, and the parliament that gets it right, the parliament that can take hold of this need and desire for and belief in equality, will be a parliament that the Australian public congratulates wholeheartedly. We know that support for this reform crosses all boundaries—cities, suburbs, regional areas, the bush, as well as the various political parties. The majority of coalition voters support marriage equality. The majority of Christian Australians support marriage equality. We have had representatives from various religious organisations and churches walk the halls of this place asking us to give all Australians a fair go by ensuring that the institution of marriage can be strengthened for evermore and that the strength that marriage gives families can be recognised by this parliament.


The importance of allowing two people's relationship to be understood and defined by the universal language of marriage and love is something that MPs in this place should grab hold of; they should stand tall and accept that we are doing a good thing. The majority of Australians believe that this is the right thing to do, and more and more people agree that this change should happen.


The fight for marriage equality is not going to be won and lost in this place; it has already been won out there in the Australian community. It is now up to this place to recognise that, unlike some issues, where we are leading the way, in this one, unfortunately, we are following. But we can turn that around and accept that if Cupid does not discriminate neither should the law. Love is love and equality does matter.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:31):  Let me very briefly state to the Senate the coalition's position on the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2010. The coalition made an undertaking to the Australian people at the 2010 election that we would support the existing definition of marriage and, having made that undertaking to the Australian people, we are not going to act at variance to it. The Labor Party has changed its position, because Julia Gillard gave a similar undertaking to the Australian people at the 2010 election but subsequently facilitated arrangements within the Labor Party to allow that undertaking to be vacated. When we in the coalition give an undertaking to the public we stick by it, whether it be on the carbon tax, private health insurance, or any issue, and this is one such issue.


After listening to Senator Sarah Hanson-Young's speech I am bound to say that one would have thought there was only one available view. Senator Hanson-Young, I have to tell you that yours is not the only view. Much as those who advocate your view do so, I am sure, in good faith, you will not win this argument by seeking to silence alternative views. People are entitled to have their own views about marriage, as you have yours. People who have a more conservative view than yours about marriage are as much within their rights as you are.


To me, your bill is a bill about marriage but it is not a bill about equality. Equality for same-sex people was won in this parliament, in this Senate, with the support of all parties, including mine, by the amendments that were made to a suite of Commonwealth statutes in 2008. I said at the time that it had been too long in coming. I had myself, within the Howard government, been agitating for that for years, as many of my colleagues had been. But after those bills were passed with the support of all parties there was no Commonwealth law which treated same-sex people in relationships any differently than opposite-sex people in a relationship.


But your bill is not about equality, Senator Hanson-Young, even though you claim that it is; it is about marriage. Marriage is an institution defined by custom, religion and law, or at least by some of those things. For you to have discovered that an institution which has been understood to mean one particular thing for the entire history of humanity is, all of a sudden, a fundamentally unjust institution, as it is understood according to its traditional conception, is an extraordinary impertinence. When you use the phrase, 'Let us put behind us the dark pages of history,' do you really think, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, that history began with you? Do you seriously think that the human conscience began with you? Or do you not allow for the fact that, just as you have your views, which I am sure are held in good faith, other people have their views which are also held in good faith. Those views reflect the entire understanding and the entire course of human history of what a marriage is, and you should, if I may say so, pay a little more respect to those who do not agree with you.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
): I remind all senators who are participating in this and other debates to address their remarks through the chair.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,2,speech
"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-08-23,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (17:35):  I stand in this place as one of many strong supporters for marriage equality in the Labor Party. Marriage equality for many in our party fits with our values of fairness, equality, family and compassion, as well as reason, logic and progress. Values of fairness include fairness to all in our community, fairness for all those in our society who are doing it tough for many reasons, fairness to those who have a disability, fairness to those who are less fortunate, and fairness to have the opportunity to succeed regardless of circumstance. Values of equality include equality to all those in our society regardless of gender, religion, race, sexual orientation and age; and equality for those in our society about how they live their lives and the opportunities they should receive.


Values of family stand whatever the make-up of that family is. Families today are very different to what history would define a family to be. Regardless of how a family is made up, the support from a family unit is now as important to individuals and to the community as ever.


A close, caring, loving, respectful family network is something that we should all support and foster regardless of what a family's makeup is. It is about values of compassion, respect and tolerance. If a friend or a stranger stumbles in the street, we do our best to help them out but we always respect their choices and decisions—not prejudging people for whatever reason. I believe in respecting people for what and who they are, not what others like them to be. I respect people based on their actions unto others and values of reason, logic and progression. I endeavour to approach issues with reason and logic. Prejudice consistently results in poor outcomes. Attempting to use reason and logic to progress our society for the betterment of our grandchildren and their grandchildren is at my core.


Australians now overwhelmingly want our parliament to amend the Marriage Act: to allow any two adults, regardless of sex, sexuality or gender identity, the honour and privilege of standing in front of their family and friends and making a commitment to each other; to allow the children of people in same-sex relationships the stability of knowing that their family is just as special as all other families; to allow the community to celebrate the love and commitment of two Australians who are no doubt good citizens who pay their taxes and abide by the law of the land.


I read for senators a motion passed at the 2009 Tasmanian state Labor conference supporting marriage equality:


This Tasmanian state Labor conference believes that all couples who have mutual commitment to a shared life should have their relationships treated equally and without discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation. The conference believes in equal access to marriage under Australian law, regardless of the sex of the parties. The government should reform the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples the right to marry, therefore fully recognising their relationship and removing discrimination. The conference believes the government should recognise the change in the community attitudes regarding this issue and bring full equality to the law.


That motion was passed in 2009. It was the first of its kind from a state Labor conference. Tasmania, a state that in 1997 amended its criminal code to remove homosexuality, is also the first state where a major party clearly voted in favour of marriage equality. It is testament to the values of our Labor members in Tasmania that they wanted to continue the long and proud history of delivering change—a proud history of giving effect to the principle of equality and ensuring that inequality is not sewn into the fabric of our community. It was Labor governments that introduced the first land rights legislation, introduced the Racial Discrimination Act, recognised native title through the Mabo legislation, enacted the Sex Discrimination Act, repealed the ban on gays and lesbians serving in our armed forces, introduced the Disability Discrimination Act, and will soon amend the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency to become the improved and more encompassing Workplace Gender Equality Agency.


Tasmanian Labor has led the nation with progressive change, upholding values of equality and fairness. Tasmania is the only state to provide compensation to the stolen generations and was one of the first states to apologise. It is the state with the most progressive anti-discrimination laws in the country, it was the first state to introduce a relationship register, and it was the first state to recognise same-sex marriages recognised in other jurisdictions. Just recently, at our state Labor conference, Premier Lara Giddings passionately moved a motion, and I quote: 


This state Labor conference believes that in the event the federal parliament fails to end discrimination in the Federal Marriage Act, the state of Tasmania should step in to do the right thing and pass a state based gender-neutral marriage act. The conference believes that this will provide fair and equitable access to marriage to all Tasmanians and urges the Tasmanian government to act immediately to draft legislation in the event a vote to change the Marriage Act fails in the federal parliament.


The conference believes the state of Tasmania should allow marriage licenses to be granted to couples outside of Tasmania and notes the economic boon this would provide to the state. 


In just three years, our state went from being the first to support national marriage equality to being the first to support state based marriage equality. I congratulate Premier Giddings for her courage in taking on this challenge and I urge all members of the Tasmanian parliament to support fairness and marriage equality.


I thank the Rainbow Labor Network in Tasmania for their phenomenal lobbying work to put marriage equality on the agenda in Tasmania; to keep us, as a state branch of the ALP, reaffirming our commitment to marriage equality; and to push for state based marriage equality in the event of failure at a federal level, because marriage equality marries so well with so many Labor values. 


At last year's Tasmanian state conference, there was a contribution in support of marriage equality from a man who formerly looked upon homosexuality as wrong. He spoke of his struggle when his son 'came out'. It was a struggle to comprehend his son's sexuality that soon turned to how he could best support his son. As his son is now in a loving relationship, he spoke of his wish for his son to be able to marry the partner that he loves in front of his family and friends. The tide has turned in Tasmania. A survey conducted by Senator Carol Brown in 2011 of over 1,000 Tasmanians, a clear majority of 55 per cent supported marriage equality. 


In 2008, in one of our first actions as a new government, Labor amended over 85 pieces of Commonwealth legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex de facto couples. These amendments provide financial equality, assisting with the day-to-day financial security issues that were faced by same-sex de facto couples in Australia. Some Labor state governments have also provided fair access to assisted and reproductive technology such as IVF and have made same-sex couples eligible for adoption. These are great achievements. 


We must celebrate Labor achievements that have comprehensively removed discrimination towards same-sex de facto couples, making their day-to-day lives easier and opening opportunities that all Australians should have the right to access.


I follow the logic that if we can recognise and accept a couple as a couple and provide all couples with equal access to legal and financial benefits then we must also be able to support the symbolic and ceremonial recognition of same-sex couples by amending the Marriage Act. With regard to relationship recognition, the key issue here is no longer the ability to access legal or financial benefits; it is primarily a symbolic issue and is, as can be seen from the fierce debate it elicits, an extremely important one.


Same-sex couples want the same public, symbolic and ceremonial recognition of their commitment to each other. For those who say there can be state based registers—and I clarify that I mean those who say state based registers and not marriage—most relationship registers are intended as a non-ceremonial certification of same-sex couples. This fails to encompass one of the most important elements of relationship recognition. We can see this evidenced in Queensland, where the newly elected Liberal National government watered down the relationship register to such a degree that some marriage equality advocates have described it as like registering a pet or a car. To do anything but amend the Marriage Act continues to deny rights to members of our community and says to our community at large that same-sex couples are not equal. It says to our community that their relationships are of lesser value. It says to some young Australians that they are lesser members of our community—and for no good reason. Same-sex couples are not looking for any special treatment. They are not looking for anything more than anyone else. They are just asking for the same rights and to be treated as everyone else. They are just asking for their kids to have a fair go.


A child in my home town does not tell his friends about his mum's relationship. Although this nine-year-old boy should be worried about the games he will play with his mates and how to pass his tests at school, he is burdened with a fear that he will be bullied if his mates find out about his mum, who is in a loving relationship and does everything for him. Not being able to marry is very sad for her, but what is sadder is that her son cannot tell his peers about her relationship, because even at his young age he realises that he will be bullied. He does so many amazing and exciting things with them like camping, birdwatching, hiking and boating, just like any family, but it concerns him that he has to censor his life. It is so sad that a little boy already knows and has to live with discrimination.


Marriage equality can help to put an end to this for this boy and many others in the same situation. He is a boy whose childhood should be about instilling in him the skills and dreams that will see him become a good Australian. He is a boy who should be worried about the games to play with his friends, about what he needs to do for his next school assignment and about whether he got a few kicks in his last footy game—a boy who should not be burdened with the fear of bullying if he shares stories of his weekend with his mum and her partner.


Opponents of marriage equality use the pretence of protecting children as one of their major arguments. I challenge them to look a child like this brave boy in the eyes and say that the current laws are protecting him. I challenge them to move beyond their belief of what they see as a traditional family unit to accept that our society comprises so many family structures and that we must enshrine in our laws a safe environment for all of them.


Changing the Marriage Act will give us a future where all people are treated equally with dignity and respect, but it needs to be amended in a comprehensive and thorough fashion. There are currently a number of bills before the parliament on this issue. Labor members have moved to co-sponsor a comprehensive marriage equality amendment bill that addresses some technical concerns with this bill before us today. I understand that the bill will be given substantial time for debate during the September sitting period. I will support that bill when it comes to this place. It reflects that the party with the majority of supporters for marriage equality in this place should be the party that introduces the bill. It reflects that this bill as it stands will need to be amended, as all votes on marriage equality bills are the subject of conscience votes as lobbied so vigorously for by the Greens.


The Labor Party has a different value set from that of the Greens political party—values built over the past 200 years from our working-class base, values built through the trade union movement, values that stem from a base that reflects all that we are and all that we do. The Greens political party say they support action on climate change but twice voted against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They say they support refugees but they oppose population growth. They say they support science and fact based policy but with a sniff of opportunity jump straight on the fear bandwagon. What if we could look to transparency? No, the Greens political party conferences are all done behind closed doors. What about democratic internal party structures? Senator Thorp was elected by a vote of hundreds of rank-and-file members of the Tasmanian Labor Party. As far as I am aware, rank-and-file members of the Greens political party do not have the same opportunity. When many in the Labor Party were calling for a binding caucus vote on marriage equality, where were the Greens political party? They were out there demanding a conscience vote that would highlight divisions in the two major parties for political purposes. Today they have brought forward debate on this bill. What for? To pass it through parliament today. The Greens party must be judged by their actions on this issue.


I will share the story of a transsexual Tasmanian. If this woman were not honest with herself, she would be allowed to marry. She told me that twice she has been in love—once as a man and once since transitioning as a woman. Both relationships were exactly the same: both had highs and lows and both were founded on love. The first of these relationships was able to be celebrated publicly. They married, and the relationship thus gained society's blessing. After the death of his wife, who was the only person he had previously told of his struggles with his gender, he decided to transition. Since transitioning she has found love again, and again with a woman. But, no matter how this relationship is valued by her family, friends, colleagues and community, it is somehow less valued.


She explained that she is still the same person she was when she was married many years ago but that she is now more honest with herself and with her community. If the first relationship deserved recognition as a marriage it is only just that the second one does too. The only difference is her gender. In her current life, she has chosen to be more honest with society about who she is. Remarkably, if she had not undergone transitioning therapy and legally changed her sex she would be legally allowed to marry. This great country rewards people for their honesty. We must remove this barrier that prevents decent people from being fully honest with themselves and their community.


As Australians we pride ourselves on our ability on the sporting field. I have learned of the discrimination that a Tasmanian couple faced at their local golf club—a club that is always looking for new members—when they decided to join as partners. One was a successful golfer, and her new partner was keen to join as she knew quite a number of the members and thought it would be fun. The behaviour from some of the club members who had previously known her partner when she was a married straight woman was extremely hurtful to them both. Although they acted no differently to any other couple at the club, her partner was never welcomed as a new member. The club has a membership discount for married couples but, of course, these women could not qualify for that discount. They told me that it was not the money that hurt; it was the attitude that they were lesser members of the club. Even though one had been a club champion many times and the other was known and liked by many members outside of this setting, as you might expect, the burden of continual exclusion and snide remarks resulted in the women resigning from the club. This provides another example of how continuing to deny marriage equality instils discrimination within our society.


But attitudes change with time. Polls consistently show there is a majority support for marriage equality, and many countries around the world have recognised same-sex relationships. In Australian law there has always been a clear distinction between civil and religious marriages. People are able to be wed in a civil ceremony and a religious body is able to choose not to wed a couple and should remain free to have this choice. People of different religions are able to be wed and not all forms of marriage are permissible under law, even if they are allowed in a religious context. In recent years, two-thirds of marriages have been conducted in a civil ceremony with no involvement or mention of religion.


However, people are currently not free to have a wedding without discrimination. A marriage celebrant must, regardless of the wishes of the bride and groom, include in the monitum the Marriage Act's current definition of marriage. Without these words a marriage cannot be solemnised. A marriage celebrant highlighted to me the growing dissatisfaction from brides and grooms that these words must be used on their special day. That a phrase which a majority of our society feel is discriminatory and should be repealed must be recited in order for a marriage to be solemnised is so unfortunate. Is it not enough that same-sex attracted people are prohibited from marriage in this country? I acknowledge that this debate is difficult, that the community is divided and that, for many, overcoming long-held prejudices is tough. That is why I approach this debate with my Labor values at the fore, using values I derive from our Labor base. One of the Labor Party's great strengths is in fighting to promote equality, fairness and dignity for all. We must comprehensively move to end all legislated discrimination in this country.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  Before you commence, Senator Waters, I advise you that debate on this bill this evening will conclude at 6 pm.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,2,speech
"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2012-08-23,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (17:55):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is an honour to have the opportunity to be debating whether to amend legislation that is blatantly discriminatory, whether to take the radical stance that all citizens deserve the same rights. Freedom of sexuality and gender identity are fundamental human rights, and the acceptance and celebration of diversity are essential for social justice and real equality in our society. I am proud to stand with my Greens colleagues as a member of a party that has been fighting for equality for two decades. It is time that other senators face the fact that, when it comes to equality, there is no room for compromise.


I would like to congratulate the tireless activists who have been taking their case to the public, holding rallies, speaking at forums and talking to their neighbours. Their perseverance and patience in the face of an uphill battle has paid off. Polling has consistently shown that a majority of Australians, now 64 per cent of people, support the rights of same-sex couples to marry. In 2004, this chamber passed an amendment to the Marriage Act, making specific the implied discrimination that marriage is between one man and one woman. Greens and Democrats senators sat on one side of the chamber while Labor and coalition senators sat on the other. Only eight short years ago, each and every vote cast by the two old parties was cast in favour of entrenching discrimination. It is fantastic to see that, now, some senators have recently become champions for same-sex marriage within their parties and within their communities. The Greens and the LGBTI community and their friends and families have been waiting for the big parties to catch up, and it is really good to finally have you on board. Thank you for standing up for what is right.


It is important that this legislation passes the Senate. The Greens Marriage Equality Amendment Bill has the strongest cross-party support and the Senate inquiry reported back with a clear recommendation that the law should be changed. This report was endorsed by senators from all sides in this chamber. Whilst the leaders of the two old parties are busy loudly opposing same-sex marriage, with references to 'tradition' and 'the way it's always been', the community has slowly but surely been changing their mind. A quiet desire for improvement to the law is now a full-throated cry for complete equality. I join my fellow Greens senators and the LGBTI community in calling on the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to make a choice: get on board, or get out of the way. It is not acceptable for the Prime Minister and the opposition leader to impose their views on the entire Australian community and ride roughshod over both their voters and their parties. Prime Minister Gillard, let your members champion a reform they support. Mr Abbott, with polls now showing that 52 per cent of coalition voters support marriage equality, it is time to allow a conscience vote.


It is now up to senators to choose. Have they bought the line that same-sex marriage will destroy the institution of marriage? Will senators maintain their position that the definition of marriage is fixed? It used to be that the wife was the chattel, the human property of the husband, but, thankfully, long ago the community's perception of that being acceptable changed. That is the point: as a community's values change so do its social institutions.


Will senators stand up for Australia's reputation as a country where a fair go and equality before the law are valued? Or will they tarnish our reputation as a tolerant and accepting country?


Will senators demonstrate their belief in the importance of marriage by extending its benefits to all couples who love each other or demean the value of the institution of marriage by using it as a vehicle for prejudice and discrimination? Will senators turn down the $161 million—and that is a conservative estimate—that marriage equality would generate through expanding the profitable marriage economy to everyone?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2012-08-23,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (18:03):  I rise to take note of document No. 1. This is the tabling speech which I had been hoping to present earlier this week when the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the activities of the Australian Securities Investment Commission was tabled. 


The Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services continually scrutinises the activities of ASIC. We are responsible, as senators would be aware, under section 243 of the ASIC Act, to inquire into and report on ASIC's activities and to bring those to the attention of parliament. To fulfil this statutory duty, the committee now holds four oversight hearings a year and routinely directs matters of interest for parliament's attention. So, as deputy chair of the committee, I am very pleased to report on our most recent inquiry into ASIC. 


Our report starts with the regulatory response to the collapse of Trio Capital. Notably, the hearing provided the committee with the opportunity to formally inquire into the commission's activities in response to our inquiry into the collapse of Trio Capital. We had tabled our report on the collapse of Trio in May this year. While the government's response to the report has not yet been tabled, the committee obtained an overview of ASIC's ongoing response in relation to the lessons of Trio Capital. 


The Trio Capital inquiry highlighted the need for effective communication between all regulatory agencies supervising Australia's financial market. We were in fact less than impressed with the rigour of the pursuit of the alleged fraudsters involved in the Trio Capital scam. We were highly critical of communication gaps between ASIC and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. I would like to report that we believe both ASIC and APRA have taken the committee's concerns seriously. 


We were certainly surprised by the lack of rigour in some cases in exploring options to actively pursue people who had defrauded hundreds of Australians of billions of dollars. The committee learned that ASIC and APRA were both exploring options to improve the information sharing between the two agencies. We will continue to monitor the coordination between ASIC and APRA and look forward to getting a more detailed overview of the measures that the regulators are going to take to improve communication.


The adequacy of the threshold requirements regulating access to an Australian financial service licence, which is issued by ASIC, is a recurring topic of committee discussion with the financial services regulators. It was raised again at our June oversight hearing. ASIC has advised that a person banned from holding an Australian financial services licence can still meet the requirements to be qualified to act as the director of a financial services company, a rather strange situation in the view of the committee. There appears to be a marked disconnect between the qualifications required to be an adviser in a company providing financial advice and the qualifications required to be a director of that same company. I draw the Senate's attention to the comments by the ASIC chair, Mr Greg Medcraft:


An ordinary person would probably think that if somebody is banned from financial services they ought to be banned from being a director of financial services company.


The committee would agree with any ordinary person who held that view. We note that the duties applying to Australian financial service licence holders under Australia's Corporations Law include an obligation to:


… do all things necessary to ensure that the financial services covered by the licence are provided efficiently, honestly and fairly …


This, of course, is not only a legal requirement but a very reasonable community expectation.


Having considered the circumstances surrounding the collapse of Trio Capital as outlined in our report, the committee concluded that there appeared to be a strong case to establish a register of employee representatives from the financial services industry. We look forward to the tabling of the government's response to our report into the collapse of Trio, and we will continue to monitor ASIC's activities addressing the pressure points in Australia's financial services system as identified in the Trio Capital inquiry.


I would also like to bring the Senate's attention to ASIC's advice regarding the pressures and potential risks associated with the continuing growth of Australia's superannuation pool. ASIC advised that the continuing growth of superannuation is a key pressure area for Australia's financial markets over the coming 12 months and, indeed, the coming decade. Of course, ASIC does not oversee industry super funds, but ASIC told us that the pressures are particularly acute with regard to the growth of self-managed superannuation funds and increasing SMSF investment in managed investment schemes.


The collapse of Trio Capital highlighted the areas of potential weakness within Australia's superannuation industry. I would suggest that there are others, particularly in the industry super fund area, but we are talking here about the self-managed area. Many investors who suffered losses as part of the Trio Capital collapse were self-managed superannuation fund investors. Further, they have not been eligible for compensation. The committee is pleased that ASIC have advised that this is an area of high focus for them. Given its significance to the wellbeing of Australians, particularly Australians approaching retirement, the committee will continue to closely monitor ASIC's activities in this area and will draw relevant matters to parliament's attention.


One other area of concern to the committee is the level of resources available to our sick and the level and effectiveness of ASIC's expenditures. They continue to be a strong focus for the committee. In response to the committee's questions, the commission did not provide an assessment of the adequacy of current budgetary appropriations and own-source revenue. However, we were advised that the commission seeks to optimally use all available resources. We would note that ASIC's areas of responsibility have been very significantly expanded in recent years, and we would be concerned if the expansion of the commission's responsibilities resulted in a reduction in the quality of regulatory service that ASIC provide because they are not being adequately funded or resourced to undertake this work. In fact, in almost every instance that I am aware of where ASIC's responsibilities have been expanded, their funding has not been expanded.


The committee was also advised that the commission is committed to proactive engagement with the market and that this commitment is a key driver in the allocation of its resources. I have been critical in the past of the development of literate consumers and have said that financial education is a requirement of ASIC, but ASIC have certainly developed strongly in the past five or six years a commitment to proactive engagement with Australia's financial markets and with consumers. The committee also considers that it is appropriate for ASIC, when prioritising its resource allocations, to consider not only the current but the emerging needs of Australia's financial markets. We will continue to monitor ASIC's resources.


In concluding, I would very much like to thank the secretariat, as always, for their assistance in putting this report together. I notify the Senate that our next oversight hearing will be held on 12 September this year, and we will be focusing on market integrity issues.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (18:41):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


Audit report No. 48 addresses the administration of mental health initiatives to support younger veterans. To those who have worked hard to protect our nation by serving in our armed forces we owe a profound duty of care. It is a sad reality that we live in a dangerous world, and this has been brought home to Australians again over the last decade, ever since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The need to respond to those attacks and to fight terrorism in other places has meant that we now have a whole generation of service personnel who have been exposed to the horrors of armed conflict. Of course, that is part of the job and part of the risk that anyone takes when they join the RAAF, the Navy or the Australian Army.


The psychological impact of war has always been there. For too long it was an unmentionable subject and generations of returned servicemen suffered in silence. That point was made very, very clear to me and others who attended the Battle of Long Tan commemorative ceremony in Albany last weekend. Mr Peter Aspinall, a very distinguished member of the Albany RSL, said that all wars extract a psychological price from all who are involved.


During the 20th century those who served in the military and were confronted by the psychological barrier were variously labelled as 'lacking moral fortitude' or suffering 'shell shock' or, later, 'battle fatigue'. Summary capital punishment was not an infrequent consequence, but the stigma and shame associated with these labels effectively swept the sufferers under the carpet once the war was over. It was in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and, regrettably, far too long after the return of the last service men and women that the condition now known as post-traumatic stress disorder was recognised as the truly terrible condition that it is—a condition that can affect anyone confronted by severe trauma, not just war related.


Thankfully, since the end of the Vietnam conflict our society has been more willing to acknowledge that not all war wounds are physical and we need to pay more attention to the mental health of those serving in our armed forces. Regrettably, although we may have had the best of intentions, this report makes it clear that when it comes to delivery we are falling well short. The report finds that the Department of Veterans' Affairs has over the last decade offered 'a small suite of disparate mental health programs'. It also finds that these have been 'of limited effectiveness'. Younger veterans are either not aware of the programs or disinclined to use them as they are currently designed. The Department of Veterans' Affairs 2010 survey of younger veterans found only 41 per cent of eligible veterans had accessed the transition management service.


Of course, not everyone needs the same level of assistance when moving back into civilian life. But the fact that almost 60 per cent of veterans are not getting and not seeking assistance should be troubling.


Forty per cent of service related disabilities relate to mental health. Fifty-four per cent of ADF members report experiencing some form of mental health disorder at some point. If almost 60 per cent are not accessing services there clearly must be a gap. The report also finds that the availability of support services is being inadequately communicated to younger service personnel, with no mention made of the transition management service on the ADF's transition website or in its handbook.


This report makes it plain that our younger veterans are not getting the support they need and deserve. Given the stigma attached to mental health issues, which is still more of a problem in the ADF than it is in the general community, far more attention must be paid to ensuring service personnel are made aware that help is available.


More worrying still, the report found that younger veterans forced to leave the service for mental health reasons feel that they are discharged with unseemly haste and ultimately abandoned by the Australian Defence Force. We owe far, far better to those who have risked their lives in the service of our nation and we owe better to their families.


This report makes it clear that we have a long way to go in ensuring that younger veterans get the mental health support services to which they are entitled. I urge the government and the ADF to pay close attention to the report's recommendations and to act quickly to implement them.


Question agreed to.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:46):  I rise tonight to speak about a wonderful program, run by the Bedford group in South Australia, entitled Abilities for All. The Bedford group supports 4,000 people across South Australia who are living with disability or disadvantage. Further, the Bedford group employs over 800 people with disability in our state. Abilities for All is a jobseekers program. Led by Bedford and funded by the South Australian Department of Further Education, Employment, Science and Technology, the program negotiates the use of community centres directly with the centres and forms partnership agreements with them.


Across a number of community centres throughout the state, training at Certificate II level is available to Abilities for All participants in business, customer contact, community services, horticulture and retail. In June this year, I was lucky enough to have been invited to attend the Abilities for All graduation ceremony. I was able to see firsthand the pride these graduates had in their achievements. The ceremony was attended by their trainers, mentors, families and friends.


I was eager to arrange a meeting with one of the Abilities for All trainers and mentors, Tricia Murphy, to learn more about the program and her role there. Tricia works from the Taperoo Community Centre. She currently teaches a class in community services, which has 19 people enrolled in it, and a Certificate II in business, with 17 enrolments. She spent 14 years working part time in community services, running her own literacy programs within other community centres, before she was offered a position at Bedford training. She has been an Abilities for All trainer and mentor since January 2009.


The Abilities for All Program aims to provide a very important pathway for jobseekers living with disadvantage or disability. It targets individuals who are currently disengaged from school or work. The age range of the participants is 16 to 60. The role of a trainer and mentor can be challenging, but it is often a very rewarding role. One of the biggest rewards, in Tricia's own words, is: 'Actually seeing people change. They turn their lives around 360 degrees from the beginning of the training to the end.' Through this program some people who may have lost all direction find their way again. That is an invaluable gift that Abilities for All gives them.


Of the challenges of being a mentor, Tricia notes that what they do often goes above and beyond their job descriptions, simply because it has to. Many of the participants need that extra bit of support at the end of their training. Unfortunately, the program is not funded for this. Tricia says that this is obviously a problem, because a lot of these people come from a background where they have had absolutely no support and they come into the program with a lot of personal issues. They come into the program needing to develop their motivation and to develop trust in and a rapport with their trainer. They then need the training; often they require follow up once they have finished the official part of the program. That is quite a lot to fit into a course which lasts between 14 and 16 weeks.


Many of Tricia's graduates from the program will call her for extra support at the end of the program. She will often receive phone calls from past participants who have questions about how to fix up their resumes or for advice on what to say at a job interview. She often spends half an hour or more on phone calls like this. Alternatively, some past participants will arrange a time to come and see Tricia at the community centre. With these kinds of meetings she can spend up to an hour helping them with job applications, resumes, cover letters and interview tips, face to face. Tricia believes that the link with the community centre is what has seen the program run so well. Tricia says:


We find that it's a link with the community that participants make. It just works so well. People connect with each other and they make friends.


In Tricia's classes in the last year, she says that approximately 80 per cent completed their Certificate II and about 85 per cent went on to further study. Very importantly, around 60 per cent went on to find part-time employment. Around 85 per cent do an educational work placement and Tricia says that aspect of it is an essential part of the program because, quite often, that may be the only thing that they have to put on their resume. It gives them that push that many of them so desperately need.


The Abilities for All graduation ceremony is held every June and is a very big deal for the participants, their families, friends, trainers and mentors. Tricia says it is a big deal because there are a lot of people with disability and disadvantage who have never completed anything in their whole lives. So for them to be able to participate in such a ceremony is an absolutely huge thing, and they feel so proud of themselves that they bring their family and their friends. It is huge. It is all over Facebook the next day.


Taperoo Community Centre is a welcoming place. Many of the people who visit there feel safe and as though they belong. A lot of the students stay around at the centre even when they have finished class for the day and sometimes on days when they do not even have classes. That is really saying something about how the place makes people feel. The centre started out as a shell but has been transformed into a thriving and welcoming place thanks to a lot of hard work put into it by workers and volunteers—who are often ex-participants of Abilities for All—and of course current participants get involved as well. The gardens have been transformed. There are murals, mosaics and an array of other artworks by participants and volunteers inside the building. It has become a vibrant and colourful place.


I would like to read parts of a case study of a graduate of the Abilities for All program. Daron's story has been told in the Bedford newsletter this month:


My name is Daron and I am a 43 year old father. Before starting my Certificate II in Community Services I was not sure what direction my life was going. I have been suffering several health problems in recent years and have been homeless for the past two years.


I was getting more and more depressed with life in general and had visited some very dark places in myself I didn't know existed. I had no home, my health was getting worse, I couldn't take my kids for access and had no qualifications. A future for me was not something I could see at this time...well not a good future anyway.


After talking with my job network, my case manager arranged for me to meet with Tricia at the Taperoo Community Centre. My transformation had begun and I enrolled in the Abilities for All course. I wasn't sure what to expect from it and was a little nervous about whether this was for me. Turns out my concerns were soon eradicated by the welcome I received from the TCC family.


I have renewed faith in my outlook towards the future for myself and my family and I'm hoping that I can do a Certificate III in Community Services next. I am still Daron, a 43 year old father but now I have faith, more confidence, a new sense of hope and know I will have a future my family and I can be proud of. I am now a volunteer mentor at Taperoo Community Centre. Without the Bedford Abilities for All Program I would be still standing on the station watching the train go past. Now I'm on the train and excited about the journey.


Abilities for All is a program which should be celebrated and encouraged. I applaud Bedford, the organisers of the program, and the many trainers and mentors like Tricia who work hard and go above and beyond their job descriptions to make this program work and to make each and every one involved in this program feel that they can make something of their lives, no matter what their background or setbacks up until now.

(c) ASIC became aware that Goldsmiths did not have a financial services licence soon after the first complaint was raised. 


(d) ASIC commenced ex-parte action against Goldsmith in the Federal Court to preserve investor funds and prevent further funds being obtained. These orders were obtained on 13 December 2011 and restrained the company from carrying on a financial services business via its website, and from transferring or disposing of any funds in connection to the advertised financial services or products. ASIC also obtained orders that the website, and any related websites of Goldsmiths, be deactivated until a court determination.


(e) ASIC issued a media release highlighting its actions and reminding consumers about scams and the importance of remaining vigilant when investing money on 21 December 2011, following further Court orders. ASIC also wrote to the complainants on this day, enclosing a copy of the media release. Further contact has been made with the complainants as part of ASIC’s investigation.
