Overview



The United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is a specialised multilateral organisation of the United Nations. It is based in Rome and dedicated to eradicating rural poverty in developing countries.


Seventy-five per cent of the world's poorest people—1.4 billion women, children and men—live in rural areas and depend on agriculture and related activities for their livelihoods. IFAD projects help poor rural people improve their food security and nutrition, raise their incomes and increase their access to financial services, markets, technology, land and other natural resources.


Around the world, IFAD is a valued international development partner. It has an ongoing portfolio valued at US$10.3 billion (inclusive of cofinancing). With the funding replenishments made in 2011, it has a target of lifting 80 million people out of poverty between 2013 and 2015.


IFAD focuses on:


agricultural production and productivity; 


rural finance; 


support for women and indigenous peoples; and


building institutions. 


Australia was a founding member of IFAD but in 2004 Australia decided to withdraw as a member due to a misalignment with the then government's geographical and sectoral development priorities, as well as internal governance issues. Australia's withdrawal came into effect in 2007.


Since Australia left the fund, IFAD has gone through a major reform, making it a highly regarded development partner by donor countries around the world and by the developing countries in which it works.


It is now timely that Australia renews its membership of IFAD.


Australia's membership of IFAD will:


complement and strengthen Australia's existing support for food security, rural development and poverty reduction;


provide for direct engagement with smallholder producers who are disproportionately represented among the poor and vulnerable—consistent with the fundamental purpose of the Australian aid program of helping people overcome poverty;


address poverty issues in rural areas where IFAD is focused and where Australia has an interest but limited current engagement;


offer in-depth country and technical knowledge in regions and sectors where Australia wishes to expand but lacks expertise; and


offer expertise and experience in rural development in fragile and conflict affected areas where Australia has a strategic interest but may not be able to directly engage.




Reasoning





Importance of food security/needs of the poor



We cannot overestimate the critical importance of food security to every human being—the physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food is surely a fundamental human right. 


But tragically, for nearly a billion people in the world, this is not the case.


The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that nearly one billion people go hungry every day. Two-thirds of these people live in the Asia-Pacific region. They are our neighbours.


In Sub-Saharan Africa almost one in three people suffer from chronic hunger. 


Climate change, drought, conflict, and lack of resources and land to grow food all shape this gross inequality. 


The impact of these challenges is compounded by the high cost of food, higher even than the 2008 levels when the food crisis was at its peak.


We can attribute the high cost of food largely to the failure of global food production to keep pace with growing demand. Population growth, income growth, changing diets and climatic variability are just some of the critical factors in this trend.


Forecasts by the United Nations and World Bank indicate that this trend of high food prices is likely to continue for at least the next 10 years. 


The magnitude of this challenge cannot be underestimated.


The world is asking why we didn't foresee the current food crises in the Horn of Africa or the Sahel earlier. We did. It isn't a matter of foreseeing; it's a matter of doing something about it.




Australia's approach to food security



Australia has long been at the forefront of global efforts to improve food security. We as a nation are very fortunate to enjoy food security ourselves. 


At the same time we have had to grapple with issues like climate, water management and natural disasters that plague less food secure nations. And as a wealthy country, we developed world-class research and expertise in these issues. This is something we can share.


Food security is integral to Australia's aid program.


Our approach to food security focuses on:


lifting agricultural productivity through agricultural research and development; 


improving rural livelihoods by strengthening markets and market access; and


building community resilience with social protection programs. 


These three elements will together increase the food available in markets and poor households, and increase the incomes and employment opportunities of poor men and women. 


Right now Australia is:


responding to the emergency food needs of people in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel;


increasing funding for rural development; and 


pursuing trade policy reforms to open up markets and allow more free and fair access to food. 


IFAD's approach to food security marries with our own. As I have said, IFAD is dedicated to enabling poor rural people to improve their access to food and nutrition , increase their incomes and strengthen their resilience. 


IFAD also works in regions of importance to Australia, including Asia, the Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa.


Developing countries value IFAD's work. 


This was made clear during the most recent replenishment of the fund in 2011—Argentina increased its pledge by 300 per cent, Indonesia by 100 per cent, Brazil by 25 per cent and India by 20 per cent—all during a time of economic hardship. 


IFAD has reformed its organisational structure to increase efficiency, align human and financial resources with strategic objectives, and expand its role as a knowledge institution.


For every $1 contributed, IFAD mobilises another $6 for rural development.




AusAID's 2011 review of IFAD



In 2011, AusAID conducted a review of IFAD. We found that IFAD had implemented significant reforms and that it was now considered by donors and developing countries to be an increasingly effective, results-focused, value-for-money partner. 


The review recognised IFAD's clear mandate to reduce rural poverty and hunger through working with smallholder farmers who are disproportionately represented amongst the poor, vulnerable and food insecure. 


IFAD projects currently work with more than 36 million poor men and women, supporting them to become food secure through increasing productivity, access to markets including microfinance, and business development. 




Australia's national interest



Renewing our membership of IFAD is clearly in Australia's national interest. It will allow Australia to expand existing support for food security and help the world's most vulnerable to fight hunger. 


IFAD's senior management values Australia's unique technical expertise in tropical and dryland farming, fisheries, biosecurity and quarantine. We are considered to have attractive policy and regulatory approaches in these areas.


Membership will also allow Australia to draw on IFAD's considerable experience to strengthen Australia's own approach to food security and rural development in our aid program.


Australia's priorities for engaging with IFAD are:


improving food security, raising incomes and strengthening resilience of smallholder producers in priority countries for Australia;


continued commitment to reform to improve governance and management of the organisation, including strengthened focus on results and value for money; and


ensuring disability inclusiveness and gender equality across all of IFAD's programs.


Investment in IFAD would not detract from existing support for food security programs. Financial contributions to IFAD will be decided through the Australian government's annual budget process. The 2011 review of IFAD conducted in-depth analysis of alternative additional food security funding mechanisms, and found that re-joining IFAD would be the best option for additional Australian support in this sector. 


Finally, membership of IFAD would allow Australian firms and individuals to be engaged with or employed on IFAD projects. Only citizens of member states can work on IFAD projects. 


With the increasing urgency of our global food security challenges and obligations, this bill to enable Australia to re-join IFAD will have considerable benefit for not only our national interest, but for the billions of people world-wide who remain acutely vulnerable to food shortages, and whose lives would be immeasurably improved if they could achieve the basic human right to food security.


I commend this bill to the House.  


Debate adjourned.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (13:45):  Sadly, it is my melancholy duty to advise the chamber and small businesses in Australia that yet another Labor broken promise is being inflicted on the engine room of the Australian economy. In this parliament, the coalition worked very collaboratively and quite cooperatively with the government to put in place the Australian National Business Names Registration System. It was, in fact, an initiative instigated during the Howard government years—something that, to the government's credit, they did pick up.


What we tried to do, after saving the government from itself where consequential provisions were actually going to be introduced before the main bill itself had taken effect, was work through a number of concerns that have been raised with us. Those concerns were very legitimate and reflected the small business community's experience with the state based registers. Some of the concerns arose out of the transition to a single national registration scheme.


We were particularly assured for home based businesses that their privacy would be protected—that there would be measures put in place to make sure that their place of work, which was also their private home, would not be disclosed to the full world. We have now found that that assurance has not been met. I met yesterday with ASIC to work through a number of issues. This was one of them, and there were also issues in relation to the transfer of businesses and concerns about like names and the use of locator descriptors. There is much work to be done there, but it is sad that the small business community could not count on the government's word. We will try to work effectively to deal with the concerns— (Time expired)

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:00):  I want to make some remarks on the Paralympians, who returned from London just this morning. I had the pleasure, along with the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Disability Reform and a number of other MPs, to be there this morning to welcome the team. It was a great honour. It was great to see so many of their family and friends there and to see how excited they were, because the success of the Paralympians in these games was truly spectacular—85 medals in the games, fifth overall in the medal tally, and, of course, we beat the USA when it came to gold medals. This team was particularly excited. The swimming team in particular did very well. There were some absolutely remarkable individual achievements. They wowed the crowds in London, but here the ratings were the highest the Paralympic Games have ever had in domestic Australian television. So this was one of the best teams ever. There were a record number of countries taking part in the games, and for us to come fifth in the medal count means that these Paralympians are well and truly Australia's golden team. They left these shores a few weeks ago with high hopes. They did not just realise those hopes; they exceeded them by far. They blew them right out of the water. It was just so pleasing to see all of the Paralympians there today, the years of hard work and discipline and dedication paying off for so many of those athletes this morning. On behalf of everyone in this House, I think, I can truly say we are proud of each and every one of them.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:02):  It is dreams that inspire people to reach for the skies, dreams of representing our country at sport and dreams of being acknowledged as among the best athletes in the world. Many of us have such dreams as young children, but very few of us reach such lofty heights of achievement. Those that do represent our country are an inspiration to the entire nation, as we marvel at the spirit that drives our athletes to greater heights, faster times and longer throws.


The Paralympic Games are among the most inspiring sporting events in the world. Our Paralympians are outstanding athletes who have overcome additional challenges to those that confront all elite athletes. Many of us spent hours watching our Paralympians compete against the best in the world. We cheered, whether they won gold and set world records or not. We are all equally proud of all our athletes, as we know they have given their all. Australians watching the games were taken on the same roller-coaster ride of emotions that we saw so clearly on the faces of our Paralympians. We shared their hopes and expectations, their triumphs and disappointments, but most of all we were overjoyed at their efforts. This is a triumph of the human spirit. Australians are united in our pride at the efforts of our wonderful athletes. We welcome them home.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:18):  Whilst the member for Hunter is in the House, I will note that the photograph was published on the web on Fairfax's site. That was the source of the photo.


The parlous state of the government's budget is obviously back in the headlines—and so it should be. We all know the story—the four biggest budget deficits in modern Australian history, totalling $174 billion; a massive blow-out in spending, with the government this year spending $100 billion more than the last year of the coalition government; a massive increase in debt, with the $70 billion the coalition left in net assets being turned into a projected $145 billion of net debt; and an interest bill on gross debt of $12 billion a year.


Madam Deputy Speaker, if the member for Lyne and the minister want to negotiate, they are perfectly entitled to do so outside this place.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I would ask the minister to stop his negotiations in the corridor—and everybody else, now that I have set the precedent, better take note when they do it the next time too.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The next parliament the ministers will negotiate, I am sure.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney better not to tempt fate if he wants to get through his MPI.




Mr HOCKEY:
  This government has left us with an interest bill of $12 billion a year. This would be enough to fully fund the Gonski education reforms, to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme and to build 12 new teaching hospitals.


The government has staked its economic credentials on delivering an underlying budget surplus, but already there are private sector bodies such as Access Economics raising doubts about whether a surplus can actually be achieved this year. We will wait and see if it is achieved. The government has shuffled the money around. They have shuffled expenditure from one year to the next. They have shuffled revenue from one year to the next. They have engaged in accounting tricks. The numbers will be heavily massaged. But whether they get there or not, what matters is the sustainability of the budget and whether budget borrowings will continue to climb. The whole idea behind a desire to have a surplus is to reduce the burden of debt. The Treasurer knows this. On the day after this year's budget he claimed the reason to achieve a surplus was to pay down debt. He said, 'It is very modest. That is why you come back down to surplus. That is why you pay down your debt.'


Yet the budget papers show that the Labor Party will continue to increase borrowings until 2015. This year alone the Labor government will be borrowing $24 million a day to fund just its off-budget initiatives. Next year they will be borrowing $19 million a day. So every day this government has been in power debt has been increasing. Nothing changes.


Labor has now sought to increase the limit on the government's debt ceiling on four separate occasions, to increase the credit card limit. It was originally $75 billion. Then it went to $200 billion, and then $250 billion. This year the government said, 'Don't worry—we're paying down the debt. But, just in case, we want to go to $300 billion.' Just in case!


Total government debt on issue is currently $240 billion, but with all the spending for an uncosted National Broadband Network and a $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who knows where we will be in three years time. Most concerning of all, it does not include all the announcements this government has made over the last few weeks—all targeted, dare I say, not at the electorate but at Kevin Rudd. The government has announced $120 billion of new spending initiatives to put off the leadership challenge of the member for Griffith. That is what it is about. If anyone thinks it is seriously about people with disabilities, then why isn't the government allocating serious money to it? If it is seriously about submarines, then why isn't the government allocating the money to it? If the government is really serious about dental health care, where is it going to find this money?


Of course, there are also the Gonski reforms. Remember it was the member for Griffith—whose predecessor had 'noodle nation'—who said he would deliver the education revolution. That is why this Prime Minister is determined to have a Gonski plan with no money. But still, they have given the commitment. This is about building monuments to Julia, as everyone in the Labor Party seems to be doing, to fend off Kevin. The bottom line is—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney will refer to members by their appropriate titles. 




Mr HOCKEY:
  Yes, I understand. Sorry. The Prime Minister is building monuments to herself to fend off the member for Griffith.




Dr Leigh:
  Point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker: the member for North Sydney wrote the MPI but seems unable to retain relevance even to the MPI he wrote himself. I ask you to ask him to remain relevant to the MPI he wrote.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Fraser will resume his seat. The member for North Sydney has the call.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Let's go through them. There is the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which will cost $10½ billion a year when it is operational. There is an extra $3.7 billion for aged care and an extra $1 billion which the government says is going to $3 billion for low-paid workers. There is offshore processing. Gee, that's gone well! So far there is $2.1 billion for reopening Nauru and Manus Island. There is an increase in the refugee intake to 20,000. That is going to cost an extra $1.4 billion. For Defence there is $36 billion for submarines and $16 billion for joint strike fighters. The Greens dental care program, which the government has taken credit for, is $4 billion. Then, of course, there is Gonski, at least $6½ billion a year. Where is this money coming from? These are huge announcements. Where is it coming from?




Mr Champion:
  A growing economy.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Listen, old sunshine: it is not your money; it is the taxpayers' money. It is the taxpayers' money out there, not yours. That is the problem with Labor. They think it is their money, but it is the taxpayers' money—the same poor old taxpayers who have to pay for the $900 cheques that go to dead people, for the pink batts that go into people's roofs and burn down people's houses, for the massive overspend on school halls. That is the same Labor Party and you know it is the same taxpayers who have to pay those horrific bills.


We know that it can only come from one of two sources. It can come from increased taxes, and Lord knows the Labor Party is pretty good at that. There have been 26 new or increased taxes since the Labor Party was elected, some of them real crackers, like the carbon tax and the mining tax. The carbon tax has had six different versions and is over $8 billion a year. Gee, that's gone well for you guys! That is terrific. That has done great things to the Australian economy. Then there is the mining tax, which now raises less than one per cent of Commonwealth government revenue. The Labor Party has been so diligent in its application to delivering a simple mining tax that there are mining companies spending up to $1½ million a year on accountants, complying with the mining tax, and they have no liability to pay it. They have no liability to pay the tax, but the paperwork of the tax is costing $1½ million a year for some mining companies, half a million dollars for most of the others.


I would say to you that the coalition is absolutely determined to get rid of the carbon tax. We are absolutely determined to get rid of the mining tax. We are absolutely determined to have smaller government than Labor. We are absolutely determined to empower taxpayers to have more control over their own hard-earned money. That is what we do. But it is in the DNA of the Labor Party to have increased spending and increased taxation. That is what the Labor Party does.


I always love referring to Doug Cameron. We love Doug Cameron. Dougie, with the Scottish accent over in the Senate, is a truth teller for the Labor Party. He said, 'We need Kevin Rudd to campaign for us at the next election.' Damn right they need Kevin Rudd to campaign for them at the next election. It would be a welcome change from Kevin Rudd campaigning against the Labor Party at election. So yes, they do need Kevin. But Doug Cameron said about the $120 billion of new commitments that it was:


… inconceivable that this amount of government expenditure on building a good society could be funded from existing revenue.


That makes everyone a little bit nervous. What tax is next?


The Labor Party is refusing to release the costings undertaken by the Treasury on the Greens policies. Let's just get this right. The Greens, who are the coalition partners of the Labor Party, went to the Commonwealth Treasury and said, 'Can you cost our policies?' Then the Labor Party gives us a lecture and says, 'You should do that and then everyone can see what the numbers are.'


But the thing is: the government are refusing to release the Treasury costings of Greens policies. They are claiming they are cabinet-in-confidence. I been around this place a while, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, as have you—not nearly as long as me, but you are showing your age very well!—and I have never seen a Green in the cabinet. I do not think they are there. So how is their deliberation actually in confidence to cabinet? They do not sit in the room. So we will be looking at the information office's deliberations on this very carefully. 


What we do know is that the Greens want to see company taxes increased to 33 per cent. We know the Greens want to reintroduce death duties to Australia—and the Labor Party struggles to answer the questions. The Greens want to increase taxes on superannuation. You might say, 'That's the Greens.' Well, the last time the Greens had a policy costed by the Treasury, it was changes to FBT on company cars. The Greens came out and said, 'This is our policy,' and then the government announced it. I thought at the time, 'Gee; I've heard that before.' What other policies do the Greens have? The Greens went to the last election promising a $23-a-tonne carbon tax. Wow! What does this government do? 'We're going to have a $23 a tonne carbon tax.' So now we know. 


The Labor Party have a $120 billion black hole, in an attempt to make the Prime Minister more popular with the Australian people. They have had a huge raft of announcements over the last few weeks, and now they will not tell the Australian people where the money is coming from. It is a magic pudding. But you know what? At the end of the day, there is only one taxpayer, the poor soul. Labor are hoping that everything is going to be okay, that the economy is just going to choof on. They are ignoring what is happening in Europe. They are ignoring the challenges in the United States. They are ignoring that China is coming off what seems to be quite a peak. They are ignoring that, in the last national accounts, the government sector contributed 0.5 per cent to the 0.6 per cent growth. They are ignoring that, in the June quarter results, without their cash handouts household disposable income would have been in trouble, because the economy is not performing as well as was expected. They are ignoring that company profits are coming down, according to the national accounts. They are ignoring that investment in dwellings continues to slump. They are ignoring that the terms of trade continue to decline. They are ignoring that the June quarter accounts predate the introduction of the carbon and mining taxes. They are ignoring that retail sales fell by nearly one per cent in July. They are ignoring that ANZ job advertisements declined by nearly one per cent in July and two per cent in August. They are ignoring that the Sensis Business Index showed that confidence of small and medium businesses declined in the September quarter, and consumer confidence remained pessimistic for the seventh consecutive month. These are the stats. 


What does the Labor Party do? In response to the general malaise across the Australian community, the Labor Party says: 'Don't worry. We're going on a big-spending, big-taxing binge.' You know what? The Labor Party are hypocrites for this. They criticise for Campbell Newman for job cuts. They are cutting 3,000 jobs this year out of the Public Service in Canberra, and they are trying to give us a sanctimonious lecture about who cares about jobs. Typical Labor—all hypocrisy.

 (Gorton—Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (15:33):  I am not sure what planet the member for North Sydney has been living on or what country he thinks he was referring to, but he is certainly not representing the state of our economy, including our debt, in any accurate way. What we just heard from the member for North Sydney was a delusional attempt to suggest that our economy is in some way weak when compared with other advanced economies. The facts are that all economic indicators say otherwise. 


I would like to say this on behalf of the government. The government is not interested in taking lectures from an opposition so lacking in fiscal rectitude that they came to the last election without satisfying their own Charter of Budget Honesty. As we all know now, when they eventually provided those details, after the election, after there was proper scrutiny of the details of those costings, they were found to have a very significant black hole. So we do not really need any lessons from those on the other side in relation to the economy and the way in which we should handle the global financial crisis. 


We all remember that, when this government made a decision to stimulate the economy, to replace the contraction of private capital, to ensure that small businesses and workers across the country kept their jobs, those opposite voted against those initiatives. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition slept, both metaphorically and literally, through the legislation that was passed in this place to provide support to our economy. As a result of those initiatives, in partnership with businesses and with workers across this country, we came through the global financial crisis as well as any other country in the world.


In relation to debt, there is no doubt that the member for North Sydney is delusional. Let me just turn to his references about tax. He says that this is a high-taxing government. Let us just be very clear and ensure that we place on the record in this place in this debate which government was the biggest taxing in the history of Australia. It was not the Whitlam government. It was not the Fraser government. It was not the Hawke government or the Keating government. It is not this government. It was the Howard government that was the highest-taxing government, when tax was compared to our gross domestic product as a ratio. It does not matter what the member for North Sydney says—he can bluster all he likes; he can distract us with all sorts of other references—but the fact is, when you look at the most important indicator to illustrate the extent to which a government taxes its people, the Howard government is left exposed as the highest-taxing government in this nation's history.


This debt delusion of the member for North Sydney is all just a further example of the alarmist, scaremongering nonsense that we have been hearing from the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and other members on the other side in relation to our economy—an attempt to scare people into believing that our economy is in some way in bad shape, an attempt to talk down our economy, which adversely affects businesses in this country. It is a shameful act that, for their own self-interest, they choose to misrepresent the facts and create a problem with consumer and business confidence. It is a shameful and irresponsible act.


Just have a think about what we would expect to find in the Australian economy if there were any merit to the arguments of the member for North Sydney. If it were true that the government was flooding the place with government debt, what would you expect the consequences to be? The answer is quite straightforward. Either the price of government bonds would be collapsing because of all the bonds being issued, or the interest rates in the economy would have to go up to influence people to hold extra debt. Are either of these scenarios true? They are not true. The reality is in fact the opposite.


Just in relation to debt—and the Acting Prime Minister referred to this, of course, when asked in question time today—net debt peaks as a percentage of GDP at 9.6 per cent in 2011-12. That is on average one-tenth of the level of the major advanced economies in the world—one-tenth—so by any measure the debt in this country is very, very low. As a result of that, and for other reasons, the rating agencies have given our economy a very big tick indeed. For the very first time, all three major rating agencies have given our economy a triple-A rating. Fitch referred to our economy thus:


Australia's low general government debt-to-GDP ratio … is already a standout ratings strength, having given it a demonstrable capacity to absorb fiscal and economic shocks.


As a result, Fitch upgraded Australia to AAA from AA+ in November last year.


Moody's, on 8 May this year, said:


… by demonstrating continued commitment to fiscal discipline, the Australian budget presented on May 8 is consistent with the government's Aaa rating.


And of course we maintained that triple-A rating.


S&P on the same day, in relation to the budget, said:


Restoring the government's strong fiscal settings through a forecast return to surpluses over the cycle and maintaining low debt will provide flexibility to respond to large economic and financial shocks, and is consistent with maintaining the 'AAA' rating on Australia.


For the very first time in our history, this government has received a triple-A rating from all three rating agencies when they are comparing us with other economies. We could not have a better evaluation from independent bodies than that.


But we do have more. We have more people commending our efforts. Very recently, the former Prime Minister, in a moment of candour—a rare moment of candour, perhaps, when it comes to praising this government—said:


When the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say that the Australian economy is doing better than most, they're right. I agree with them. There's no doubt that the Australian economy is doing better than most.


Our unemployment is remarkably low; our debt-to-GDP is converged very favourably; and by all the measurements, our inflation is low. I won't bore you with the statistics; you've heard them all before.


Well, we were not bored by that, because the former Prime Minister is right in saying that we have very low debt, very low inflation, very low unemployment and, as a result, a very strong economy—which of course makes this MPI quite absurd. The proposition upon which this whole debate is based is that somehow we have a debt problem, but we do not have a debt problem.


I will tell you what we do have. We have an economy that is 11 per cent larger since Labor came to office, despite going through the worst global economic conditions since the Great Depression. We have growth running at 3.7 per cent up to this year. We have low unemployment of 5.1 per cent, less than half the rate seen in Europe and significantly below that of other advanced economies. We have an exceptional job creation record of 800,000 jobs that we have created since we came to office, despite our watching 27 million jobs disappear globally in that same time. We have had inflation at 13-year lows, with underlying inflation at the bottom end of the RBA's target band. We have a low official cash rate at 3.5 per cent—350 basis points. We have seen a reduction of 125 basis points in that official cash rate since November last year and, indeed, an official cash rate lower than was the case at any time under the Howard government. And of course we have hundreds of billions of dollars in a huge investment pipeline. We have healthy consumption of four per cent through the year. We have very low debt, as I have said before. We are of course returning the budget to surplus. These are the facts—



Mr Truss interjecting—




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  if the opposition want to listen to them. These are the facts confirmed by rating agencies and confirmed by the former Prime Minister of this country, John Howard, in a recent discussion that he had.


That being so, you wonder: why is it that the member for North Sydney chose to suggest that we have a debt problem? Why would he posit a view that we somehow have a debt problem in this country? There must be some rationale. The only conclusion I can draw from the opposition and the Liberal shadow Treasurer suggesting that we have a debt problem is that he needs to have a bogus rationale to cut services. He needs to advance the argument that we have a major debt problem to justify the cuts to essential services across this country if the opposition were ever to be elected to government. That is the basis upon which this whole argument that we somehow have a debt problem is being run. Nobody else believes it other than the Liberal Party. They say we have a debt problem, and as a result they want to find a case, find an argument, find the rationale, to cut jobs—front-line job services and essential services—in the same way that the Premier of Queensland, the Premier of New South Wales and indeed even the Premier of Victoria have been doing in recent times.


You might wonder: 'Is it fair to say that? Would it be true to say that the federal Liberal opposition are supportive of the approaches taken by the Queensland, New South Wales and Victorian governments?' I think it is fair to say that they are indeed supportive. Premier Newman himself has said that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer are supportive. He said:


I talk regularly to Mr Abbott … He is very understanding, he and people like Joe Hockey have been incredibly supportive.


Of course they have been incredibly supportive!


Just last Friday, the shadow Treasurer praised Queensland Premier Campbell Newman as he cut 2,745 health jobs—with more to come. The shadow Treasurer said:


Campbell Newman, all strength to his right arm, is showing incredible courage …


That is the view of the member for North Sydney on the cuts in Queensland. It is also the view of the Leader of the Opposition, who is supporting the cuts being made by Liberal governments in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and other parts of this country. 


What does all that mean? It means it has been a very bad week for Queenslanders—reckless cuts to front-line services which will impact on patient care; cuts to breast-screening services; cuts to nurses in Townsville, the Darling Downs, Charters Towers and West Moreton; cuts to the flu vaccine for health workers; and cuts to counsellors who help grieving relatives at the morgue. The Queensland Tuberculosis Control Centre is being closed and 12 full-time jobs are going from Donate Life, effectively shutting down this organ donation agency. 


This is what the Liberals do. This is in their DNA. They do this as a matter of reflex. But they know they must dress it up—they have to be able to pretend there is a need to do it. That is why we have this MPI—they want to pretend we have a debt problem so that in future, if they are ever elected, they can justify announcing cuts. Just recently we have seen the South Australian Leader of the Opposition announce a keenness to slash the public sector. She is keen to swing the axe on the public sector just as her colleagues in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have done. That is what you get from Liberal governments. They do not say anything before the election, but once they are in they are after you. They have been cutting services throughout regional Queensland—Townsville, Mackay, Cairns, Rockhampton. These places are being decimated by a rampant government with a callous disregard for people who need education and health services.


We do not need any lecturing from those opposite .We do not need any pretence that there is a debt problem in this country. We know that is their way of giving themselves a pretext for announcing cuts in essential services—education, health and other areas which ordinary Australians rely upon for a good quality of life. 


What we do need before the next election—and we need it soon—is a direct explanation to the Australian people from the Leader of the Opposition of what he is looking to do. We know he supports Campbell Newman's approach, we know he supports Premier Barry O'Farrell's approach, we know he supports the cuts in Victoria and I am sure he will support the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, but we need to know—and the people of Australia deserve to know—what Tony Abbott is going to do in relation to cutting essential services if he gets elected. He needs to tell people the truth. In the last week he has said nothing. He owes the Australian people an explanation. He needs to tell them the truth.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2012-09-13,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:48):  The MPI before parliament today is one of very great importance—our worsening debt position and rising government debt. If anyone needed any further convincing that they should despair of this Labor government, they would have had their views totally reinforced by the response we have just heard from the minister. This is a matter of public importance about Australia's worsening debt position. In spite of a $145 billion black hole, in spite of $174 billion worth of deficit racked up by this government, in spite of repeated demands for increases in their credit card borrowing limit, this government says we do not have a debt problem. Their attitude is: 'This is nothing to worry about. It is only a $145 billion black hole. It is only $174 billion worth of deficits. We do not have a problem.' 


The minister just said that it is only a pretend debt. You go and tell your bank manager that your house mortgage is only a pretend debt—you don't have to pay it back; it doesn't matter. This is the irresponsible approach this government are taking towards debt. Their response to being racked with debt is to spend, spend, spend. Their attitude is: 'Spend your way out of debt. Spend your way out of the country's troubles. The credit limit doesn't matter—raise it again. Keep on spending.' 


Labor have no appreciation of the crisis. They are leaving this country with a level of debt which just grows and grows. They have learned no lessons from the Hawke-Keating government, which left behind $96 billion worth of debt, debt which took a decade to repay. This government is already way beyond that—$145 billion worth of debt—and they have no plan to repay it. The minister's attitude is: 'It does not matter; it is only pretend. Who cares about the debt? Just keep on spending.' 


Today and on previous days Labor have criticised the Queensland government, the New South Wales government and the Victorian government for having to cut expenditure. This is a further reflection of the way Labor believe debt should be dealt with. The Queensland LNP government does not want to cut expenditure. They would like to keep going on spending—as all of us would like to keep on spending. They are not doing this because they want to do it; they are doing it because they have to do it. 


Labor has spent the state into a $70 billion debt, rising much higher as time goes by. The state has lost its credit rating under Labor.


Queenslanders are paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they should because of the higher interest rates caused by Labor spending irresponsibly—and, again, it had no plan to ever pay that money back. Now the South Australian Labor government has had its credit rating downgraded. What is Labor's response? Keep on spending—spend your way out of debt. This is the kind of illogical economic policy that has given that state so much trouble over the years. 


Every Labor government leaves behind a legacy of debt. It is quite clear from the minister's recent comment that they do not care. The mantra of the government has been heroic announcements. They revel in rhetoric and big-vision type announcements full of carefully crafted speeches, but with no plan ever to pay for them. They are big on overcooked promises but they are hopeless on delivery. The cost blow-outs, along with commodity prices in freefall, mean that any hope Labor ever had of achieving its $1.5 billion surplus is long gone. The budget was never honest. There was never any likelihood that it would return to surplus. The Gillard and Rudd governments have never delivered a budget surplus. This is not the first time they have promised one—they promised it in their very first budget. After Kevin Rudd had promised the Australian people that he was a fiscal conservative, Labor delivered their first budget, promising a $22 billion surplus. We all know that that turned into a $27 billion debt. The $70 billion that was in the bank and that they inherited has now gone and they are way into the red. Our national debt is at a record—a staggering $145 billion. 


But they have not stopped the promises. They are still out there with these big announcements that are simply not funded. That is what has delivered a $120 billion black hole, on top of the existing debt that Australians are going to have to fund. There is a whole array of announcements. There is to be $10 billion a year for the National Disability Insurance Scheme—a project that everyone would like to see put in place, but Labor have not provided the money. They have even boasted that they have delivered the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but it is unfunded. There is $4 billion for a new dental health package. They are not telling the Australian people, who are despairingly starting to wake up to this, that as of last week they have actually cancelled the previous government's billion-dollar dental scheme. 


No-one can now get any government funded dental treatment, because the government have cancelled the previous government's billion-dollar scheme. The new program does not start until 2014—after this financial year, when they are trying to deliver some kind of fake budget surplus. It is a long wait to get your tooth filled, but that is where the government are going with their overblown rhetoric. 


There is $6.5 billion a year on the Gonski education program not funded. There is $3.7 billion for aged care, but there has been no new money for a long time and even when the program is fully implemented most of it will come from older Australians themselves—it is not a government program. There will be $2.2 billion for mental health, but they are actually cutting expenditure for mental health this year. 


They are up to their old tricks. We have seen these grand plan announcements before—big promises but they are not delivered on. There was GroceryWatch; Fuelwatch—it did not even get off the ground; cash for clunkers, abolished before it started; the green loans scheme, which has left so many people out of pocket; $2.4 billion for the pink batts that went up in smoke, with 250,000 botched installations and a thousand electrified roofs; and then there was the Building the Education Revolution, which delivered overpriced school halls, and the computers that were supposed to go to every child between years nine and 12, costing $900 million. It cost $2.3 billion and ran years late. Labor is out there just cynically trying to buy votes. They are talking up the rhetoric, but everyone needs to remember that the money is not there to pay for any of these programs. 


Labor's $120 billion black hole is not just on paper—it has a direct effect on families. It is not pretend money, as the minister suggested. There will be an ongoing cost for Australian households and Australian businesses. As a result of this great black hole, as a result of this debt, there will be less money to be spent on health, education, roads, defence and all the important things that governments must do, because money will first have to be paid as interest to the bankers. They are the people who are going to demand interest on this debt, the people who will decide whether even the federal government can maintain its credit rating if it keeps on spending, spending, spending with no plan whatsoever to pay the debt back. Is it any wonder that countries around the world are observing Australia and wondering whether this is a place they should invest in—we have a government that cannot be trusted, that does not understand economics, that does not care about debt. 


The Treasurer has been asked over recent days about what he proposes to do about this debt and what new taxes are going to be introduced. There are 26 new ones already and another 20 at least are being talked about, including the horrors of death duties, which the Treasurer was not willing to rule out yesterday. The reality is that Labor continues to deliver record deficits, record expenditure and record incompetence. Australians are paying for this at the rate of $20 million a day in interest and they will keep paying for it for generations. (Time expired)

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (15:59):  If you want to know what the member for North Sydney thinks about debt, don't listen to what he says in this House. You know what those opposite say in this House is not to be taken as gospel truth. Listen to what he said on 17 April, when he travelled to London to give a speech and talked about the debt that Hong Kong held. He said that the debt that Hong Kong held was 'moderate'. How much debt does Hong Kong hold? It holds debt that is 34 per cent of GDP in gross terms. That is about twice Australia's gross debt, which will peak at 18 per cent. So the only reasonable way the member for North Sydney could characterise Australia's debt would be 'low'. Australia's net debt will peak at 9.6 per cent. So, if you want to find what those opposite really think about the economy, look at what they say when they go to London. When the member for North Sydney went to London, he noted that Hong Kong's debt was moderate; therefore, ours would be low. When the Leader of the Opposition went to London last year, he said:


… Australia has serious bragging rights … Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable.


The opposition get the economic truth-telling gold when they go to London! The trouble is that, when they get back to Australia, they do not make the medal ranks because they cannot be honest with the Australian people and tell them that Australia's debt levels are around a 10th of those of the major economies. Nine point six per cent of GDP is like someone earning $100,000 a year owing a modest $9,600.


If you want to know what those opposite really think of debt, again, don't listen to what they say in this place; listen to what they tell the Register of Members' Interests. If they really believed what they said, that debt is a bad idea, then you would not expect to find that any of them personally held debt, would you? You would think that, if debt is bad for the country, then it must be bad for them. You would think, for instance, that the member for Aston would not have a mortgage. You would think you would not see a mortgage for the member for Forde, the member for Mitchell, the member for Boothby and the member for Casey. The member for Paterson and the member for Mackellar also hold mortgages, as do the member for Dunkley, the member for Sturt, the member for Wannon, the member for Canning, the member for Herbert, the member for Flinders and the members for Groom, Mayo, Ryan and Gilmore.


I note in passing that the member for North Sydney himself has a mortgage. He thinks it is worth taking on some debt for his own future, but he thinks it is a bad idea to save the jobs of some poor people. The member for Bennelong, the member for Kooyong, the member for Pearce, the member for Curtin, the member for Higgins, the member for Hasluck and the members for Macquarie, Cowan, Stirling, Dickson, Berowra, Bonner, McMillan, Wright, Cook, Indi, Swan, Moncrieff and Leichhardt all hold mortgages, as does the member for Warringah. His mortgage was a little late in coming on to the Register of Members' Interests, but it did get on there eventually, with a story in June 2010 over his failure to declare a $710,000 mortgage. 'What's that as a share of income?' I hear you ask. 'If he's worried about this country's debt levels being 9.6 per cent of GDP, I bet he's got a small mortgage.' Well, no; in fact, his mortgage was then about 300 per cent of his annual income. There is nothing wrong with that. It is perfectly fine for the Leader of the Opposition to take out a mortgage because he thinks that is a good way of securing his future. I would just like to see him have the same commitment to securing the future of low-income Australians, because they are the ones that get wiped out in recessions.


Let's be very clear about what the opposition's anti-debt strategy means. When the global financial crisis hit, the revenue write-downs were two-thirds of the total debt we took on. So, if you take the view that we should not have taken on debt, what you are saying is, 'Bring on the firings; if only the government had cut back at the same rate as the private sector when the global downturn hit, everything would have been all right.' But we have a historical example of just that: Herbert Hoover, in the teeth of the Great Depression, as the member for Wakefield was reminding me earlier, cut back on government spending as the Great Depression hit. But the impact of doing that here would have been brutal to young Australians and low-skilled Australians, who are the first to be hit when a downturn strikes. 


So, really, those opposite are just playing politics with debt. They do not really believe it. They carry debt themselves; they take out mortgages. But they come in here and rail against Australia's debt. If you take them to London, they might tell you the truth; but bring them in here and they will angrily rail against debt. I am reminded of one of the most awful Lenin quotes:


It would not matter a jot if three-quarters of the human race were destroyed; the important thing is that the remaining quarter should be Communist.


Those opposite seem to be taking a leaf out of Lenin's book. They would rather see the Australian economy suffer than see Labor succeed. That is the Leader of the Opposition's modus operandi. As David Marr's Quarterly Essay reminded us:


There was always the Santamaria way: when you haven't got the numbers, be vicious. It's called minority politics. Abbott would come to play them superbly, having learnt in the Democratic Club how small constituencies can cause big trouble.


Mr Marr talks about how the Leader of the Opposition pursued that strategy, first through 'don't know, vote no' in the referendum on the republic, and then in minority parliament. As the then tyro journalist writing for the Bulletin, now the member for Wentworth, wrote of the Leader of the Opposition—this is well before either of them entered politics, but you can imagine some of it is still there today—




Mr Tudge:

(

):  The member for Aston will resume his seat.




Dr LEIGH:
  Malcolm Turnbull wrote:


The leading light of the right wingers in New South Wales is twenty-year-old Tony Abbott. He has written a number of articles on AUS in the Australian and his press coverage has accordingly given him a stature his rather boisterous and immature rhetoric doesn’t really deserve.




Mr Tony Smith:
  Mr Deputy Speaker Murphy, on a point of order—and I follow on from the member for Aston's—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:   What is the point of order, Member for Casey?




Mr Tony Smith:
  The point of order is that what the member is saying should bear some relationship to the topic of this MPI, which is debt—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Casey will resume his seat. He knows that an MPI debate is a wide-ranging debate and there is a lot of licence given to what is contributed in this chamber.




Dr LEIGH:
  The destructive politics on debt are characteristic of the way in which this opposition does business. In a piece entitled 'Small target, big letdown' Peter Hartcher, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, talked about the opposition's strategy as being in the vein of Achilles: they rage against everything in front of them. My friend Macgregor Duncan has noted, similarly, that the opposition seem to be behaving like an Achilles rather than like a Hector. The opposition are out there to attack, to criticise to condemn. They are not there to build and to create. I will end there.

I spoke to the rationale for these amendments during the substantive debate so I will keep my remarks short. 


If there is a reason for banning this supertrawler, as has now been accepted there is, there is a reason for banning supertrawlers permanently. That is especially so if, as appears to be the case, as a result of further amendments this bill is going to be weakened even further. There is a very strong argument for preventing a situation where we have one supertrawler coming in in a short period of time and then another one after that and then another one after that. We do not want to be coming back here having these kinds of debates every time one of these industrial sized fishing vessels comes in, so the simplest solution is to accept these amendments and ban supertrawlers altogether.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (16:37):  I know there may be several amendments and one statement. All week I have been raising a very simple point: we either believe the science and the processes by which that advice makes its way to government or we do not. All week it has seemed that the response from government was that there was no problem with the processes, the science and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority—that is, until question time today. For me the response from the minister that there were some problems with the processes was significant. The second thing that I report to the House is that today, finally, we have got the terms of reference for a root and branch inquiry into the Fisheries Management Act. In progressing this issue through the House this week three things have occurred. First, we now have in question the issue of quota management and sustainable fisheries. I accept the advice from the government that there are doubts about how quotas are formed and how the science is formed.


Secondly, there will be a short time line for a review of the Fisheries Management Act. That will have a status that it should have had already. The ministers have been saying that the Fisheries Management Act does not deliver, that they are getting poor advice and that the science is not allowing them to do their job. I accept now that the Fisheries Management Act will be gone through root and branch, that this inquiry will matter and will have a short time frame and that we can expect a new fisheries management act, preferably this year.


The third part is that the powers that have been given to the minister today will not last. The legislation will include a sunset clause when it is passed today. I have had great concerns about the unintended consequences there would have been, with two ministers having full discretion over social, economic and environmental concerns at the end of the process. We either beef up the process and make it matter and give the minister for fisheries those powers or we do not. I am pleased that we are now going to tidy up the science and make it and the process matter so that in the future we do have happen weeks like the one we have had this week.

390SM  Sunsetting of this Part



      New declarations under this part may not be made 12 months after the day the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Commercial Fishing Activities) Act 2012 commences.


Of the two amendments in front of us, one relates to an outcome which was sought by the opposition during debate, which was that 'social' and 'economic' be removed and that we simply deal with environmental considerations only. Since the Water Act I have constantly been asked: why can't social and economic always be included when environmental is? We thought the opposition would like it; they did not. We are taking it out. The second amendment, referred to by the member for Lyne, is that new declarations under the amendment we are dealing with today will not occur after 12 months time. By that time the root-and-branch review of the fisheries management processes should be in place, but we will have this legislation to be able to fill that gap in the interim.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-09-13,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:48):  I will just address briefly this question of social and economic considerations. It was very important that this found its way into the bill in the first place. It is a core argument which has been made by the people who have concerns about this supertrawler—and rightly so. The environment is not separate from people. The EPBC Act contains a general requirement for the minister to consider social and economic impacts when making decisions. The social and economic considerations in relation to environmental decisions are not just legitimate but essential. For example, in approvals of coal seam gas wells the impact on local communities as well as the environment are legitimately taken into account. In fact, if the minister did have the power and did more often take into account social impact we would see a lot less disruption of the environment.


But essentially this first amendment shows that those who support it do not have the same level of concern about the impact of the supertrawler on local fishing communities, the viability of the local fishing industry or the jobs impact. Fishing is an important industry for many small communities. For some communities, it is a major source of employment. The impact of the supertrawler could potentially devastate a small local economy. Ministers should be required to take into account the potential social and economic impact their decisions could have.


Fishing Party attacks on the Greens at the last election, which came thick and fast, now have a great degree of irony because here it is the Greens who are the only party standing up for recreational fishing by opposing these amendments. The effect of these will be to open the door to the supertrawler in two years time, and what we share with recreational fishers is an understanding of the environment, of the need to maintain fish stocks and of the damage massive commercial fishing operations can do not just in relation to the amount of fish that they take but to the ocean. Massive commercial fishing operations like the supertrawler catch much, much more than the fish that they intend to take for consumption. They also catch other fish of interest to recreational fishers. This activity disturbs the ocean's ecosystems to the detriment of all who enjoy the ocean.


So the social and economic interests should be taken into account. They were the basis of the concern about the supertrawler and the reason this bill was being introduced. It is hypocritical to now remove them from that very legislation.

As I referred to in my closing remarks in the second reading debate, these are the amendments that guarantee that all existing commercial fishing activity which had been engaged in before 11 September, when this bill was introduced, remains not subject to interim declarations, and that recreational fishing, whether it be purely recreational or whether it be charter recreational activity, is clearly not part of the bill before the House.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:57):  Despite these overdue amendments, this bill is still fatally flawed for the very simple reason that any small family fishing operation can still be terminated by arbitrary powers if it begins after 11 September. So any small family fishing operation is still subject to arbitrary closure. This has been chaos from start to finish and the minister should hand in his notice.


Question agreed to.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-09-13,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (09:30):  I rise to raise the issue of excessive waiting times in my constituents' experience when attempting to phone Centrelink. The issue affects a huge proportion of my electorate, particularly elderly residents receiving the age pension, who often utilise Centrelink's phone services. Customers receiving Centrelink payments such as the age pension and disability support pension are frequently required to contact Centrelink to report changes to their income or to inform them of overseas travel.


Reporting this information is a legislative requirement for payment receipts; otherwise, their payments will be cancelled. However, my office has been inundated with constituents informing me that they have not been able to get through to Centrelink on the phone and reporting being kept on hold from anywhere between 30 minutes and up to four hours. In desperation, these people often contact my office in the hope that I may be able to pass on their message to Centrelink.


Mrs Dale Ward, a pensioner from Armadale, first contacted me late last year reporting her difficulties getting through to Centrelink and sought assistance in trying to contact them before she left on a holiday. She has since reported the same problems a number of times throughout this year. Mr Peter Pavlinovich and Mr Joseph Sutherland are in the same boat.


Most of my constituents who are trying to contact Centrelink are relying on these payments as their main source of income. In many cases, these people are elderly and vulnerable and are frightened of the ramifications of not reporting to Centrelink. They are simply trying to do the right thing and feel that they are being treated as second-class citizens. One local resident told me that, although he is retired, he has better things to do than spend the whole day on the phone.


In the light of the vast number of complaints that I have received, on 1 June 2012 I wrote to Senator the Hon. Kim Carr, the Minister for Human Services, in order to raise this issue, and I received a response—which I have here—on 28 August 2012. This was a poor response which was a standard in every sense of the word and even managed to repeat paragraphs. Furthermore, the minister fails to effectively acknowledge the problem and simply offers other alternatives to getting in touch with Centrelink. Whilst I have informed my constituents of the online services, the option of visiting an office or mailing Centrelink, these are not suitable alternatives for most people.


Many people that receive the pension or other payments are elderly or disadvantaged and do not have the ability to access online services. A large majority are also unable to drive and cannot get to a Centrelink office to report their information. In addition, most that are able to get in to an office are also met with huge queues and significant delays.


I do not seek to criticise the excellent work of Centrelink staff, and I can confirm that staff in the Centrelink offices in my electorate are extremely helpful. However, they are significantly understaffed and underresourced and simply cannot deal with the huge increase in demand for their services. My constituents are trying to assist Centrelink by reporting their incomes or overseas travel but are continually being punished and are at risk of having their payments cancelled unless this issue is addressed urgently. I seek leave to table the minister's letter to me.


Leave granted.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:01):  29 August 2012 was a dark day for our whole nation. The loss of one soldier is always one too many. On Monday we remembered the loss of three Australian soldiers who were murdered by a member of the Afghan military and now we also mourn the loss of two Special Operation Task Group members who were killed when their helicopter crashed in Afghanistan. Not since the battle of Nui Le in Vietnam on 21 September 1971 has Australia lost five men in a 24-hour period.


Australian Special Forces soldiers Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald and Private Nathanael Galagher, from 2nd Commando Regiment, were killed when an ISAF helicopter crashed in Helmand province. The Australian Special Forces and their partnered Afghan National Security Force unit were participating in a targeted mission at the time of the incident.


Thirty-year-old Lance Corporal McDonald was on his sixth tour of Afghanistan. Lance Corporal McDonald was quick-witted and brought a positive energy to both his unit comrades and all those who served with him.


A dedicated and enthusiastic professional soldier, he was always willing to come forward with ideas and solutions. He was a highly professional soldier, but his quiet nature and humility meant he always deflected credit back onto fellow members of his company.


I wish to express my sincere condolences to his fiancee Rachael; his mother Myrna and stepfather Bernie; and brothers Percy, Roger and Gary.


I am told that his 23-year-old colleague Private Galagher idolised Lance Corporal McDonald. Private Galagher always put 110 per cent into everything he did. He had a 'can-do' attitude, always wanting to get the job done and taking everything in his stride. He was an enthusiastic, young soldier who was very well respected by his mates in the regiment.


I wish to express my sincere condolences to his partner Jessie; parents Wayne and Sally; and sister Elanor.


During the parliamentary recess I spent 10 days in Afghanistan with our troops and during this time I met with members of the 2nd Commando Regiment. They were frank and open about their mission, about the challenge it presented and indeed the pressure of achieving their objectives before Australia is scheduled to leave Afghanistan.


We have lost two very special soldiers—two men trained to an exceptionally high level, both physically and mentally; two quick-thinking and innovative men who could keep a cool head in difficult and complex situations all over the world. Their commitment to their chosen career as soldiers and to our mission in Afghanistan was unwavering, as was their loyalty to their mates and their love for their own families and their Army family. On behalf of the Ryan electorate, I offer my sincere condolences to Lance Corporal McDonald's and Private Galagher's families, friends, colleagues and loved ones. Lest we forget.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:05):  A sombre ceremony is being held today at Pilliga, a village a long way from anywhere in the north-west plains of New South Wales. You get a sense of the isolation—some would say desolation—of this community by the fact that the 1981 award-winning regional history about the area, a work by Eric Rolls, was entitled A Million Wild Acres. Although far away, Pilliga is very much at the heart of the nation at the moment, as the people of this tiny speck on the map farewell one of their favourite sons. Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher called Pilliga home. He was just 23 years of age when he was killed during operations in Afghanistan. Also killed in the same helicopter crash was Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald, 30, from Carnarvon in Western Australia.


We have now lost 38 gallant soldiers in Afghanistan—a terrible loss of young life, but by no means a waste. They have helped to secure a better future for a troubled country, a nation which, by and large, seeks the same ideals of peace that we hold so dear and which we almost take for granted here in Australia. They helped drive the Taliban into hiding, if not total submission. The price of peace is a heavy one. It is measured in the blood of brave soldier from far-flung places—freedom fighters sent to do a job in the deadliest of situations. Private Galagher and Lance Corporal McDonald exemplified all that is good and great about the Anzac spirit.


Nate Galagher's partner, Jessie Feeney, is expecting a son—a boy who will grow up without the benefit of having his father around, but who will understand the wonderful man his dad was. That is Jessie's pledge. As she said, 'There is no trait of Nate's that I wouldn't want his son to inherit.' Nate idolised Lance Corporal McDonald, who was also killed alongside him on that fateful 30 August flight. Jessie recounted:


Merv was generous with his experience and shared it with the other boys in the team, especially Nate. I last saw Nate at the airport when he departed Australia in July. As they were about to walk off to the gate together, Merv turned to me and said, 'Don't worry Jess, I'll bring him home.' While it's under the most tragic of circumstances, Merv is honouring his promise.


Nathanael is also survived by his parents, Wayne and Sally, and sister, Elanor. Born in Wee Waa, Private Galagher joined the Army in 2007, was posted to the 2nd Commando Regiment in November 2011 and was on his second tour to Afghanistan. The Australian Defence Force said:


He had a 'can-do' attitude, always wanting to get the job done and taking everything in his stride.


Lance Corporal McDonald is survived by his fiancee, Rachael Sprigg-McKinnie, his mother, Myrna, stepfather, Bernie, and brothers, Percy, Roger and Gary. He enlisted in 1999 and at the time of his death was on his sixth tour of duty to Afghanistan. The ADF paid tribute to Lance Corporal McDonald's quick wit and positive energy. According to the ADF:


A dedicated and enthusiastic professional soldier, he was always willing to come forward with ideas and solutions. He was a highly professional soldier, but his quiet nature and humility meant he always deflected credit back on to fellow members of his Company.


Highly decorated during his career Lance Corporal McDonald was, according to his fiancee:


… the warmest guy you'd ever meet. You could see it in his eyes, they had a special sparkle. He was a real Aussie bloke with a passion for his country, especially its natural splendour.


Nate and Merv were real Aussie blokes, but they were much more as well. They were courageous in the midst of an enemy sometimes impossible to see. They were inseparable mates then, now and forever. They were Anzacs. They were heroes. They may be gone but they will not be forgotten. Let us mourn them today and remember their selfless bravery, their supreme sacrifice, as long as the last post is played each Anzac Day.


Their grieving families will remember their love each and every day. May they rest in peace. Lest we forget.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:09):  Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the most thoughtful and touching contributions by those who have spoken before me on both sides of this House. We are in this chamber today to pay our respects to Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald and Private Nathaniel Galagher and to offer our condolences to their colleagues in the 2nd Commando Regiment and their respective families and friends.


The motto of the 2nd Commando Regiment is foras admonitio, or without warning, and the brave soldiers of the regiment live and serve by this motto. Australian commandos are respected around the world for their skill, professionalism, dedication, discipline and strong determination. The 2nd Commando Regiment has been awarded the unit citation for gallantry and the meritorious unit citation for their role in Afghanistan. It is in this noble and brave vein that these two young Australians served.


Lance Corporal McDonald was an experienced soldier and on his sixth deployment to Afghanistan, while having completed four deployments in East Timor between 2001 and 2007. He was generous with his experience and someone that his younger colleagues looked up to. Among them was Private Galagher. Private Gallagher was a young solider who gained entry into the elite commando unit within four years of joining the Army. He has been described as someone with a 'can-do' attitude who always put 110 per cent into everything he did, and there is no doubt that this is why he was so well thought of by his colleagues.


The loss of any soldier serving overseas is a tragedy and one felt right across our community, and it is heightened when they are our much respected neighbours stationed at Holsworthy. Today, I am particularly struck by the stories of these two young men, and I have a deep sympathy for their families and their partners. These brave young men have made the ultimate sacrifice: giving their lives in defence of the principles in which they believed—the principles of freedom, democracy and mateship. These men, like all those who join our defence forces, did so out of a love for their country, a love for freedom and a love for the Australian way of life. Both these men travelled to the other side of the world to defend those who could not defend themselves, to give hope to a population that, for so long, has had none. These men are true heroes and will be remembered forever for their sacrifice and their service.


Given some recent comments in the media, it is worth recounting the absolute evil that our troops are fighting against in Afghanistan and the evil for which Lance Corporal Mervin McDonald and Private Nathaniel Galagher gave their lives fighting against: the evil of the Taliban. This is a group so evil that it commits systematic massacres against its own civilians. This is a group so evil that it has denied UN food supplies to tens of thousands of starving civilians, with the UN confirming that the Taliban had starved civilians for their own military agenda and were using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war. This is a group so evil that it conducts a scorched earth policy, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of family homes. This is a group so evil that a report by the Physicians for Human Rights said:


To PHR's knowledge, no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest, prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment … 


This is a group so evil that it has issued edicts forbidding women the most basic human right of being educated, forcing girls to leave schools and colleges. Again, I quote the same report by the Physicians for Human Rights. It said:


The extent to which the Taliban regime has violated the human rights of Afghan women is unparalleled in recent history.


…   …   …


It is difficult to find another government or would-be government in the world that has deliberately created such poverty by arbitrarily depriving half the population under its control of jobs, schooling, mobility and health care. Such restrictions are literally life threatening to women and to their children.


This is a group so evil that it has planted improvised explosive devices in girls' schools. This is a group that dynamited the famous sixth century archaeological masterpieces of Buddha statues at Bamiyan. This is a group so evil that it outlawed sports, denying children the right and the joy of kicking a ball, and turned sports stadiums into public execution grounds, shooting people, hanging them from goalposts and chopping off their limbs. This is a group so evil that it seeks to deny people the joys of music and, only recently, took knives and beheaded 17 people for simply playing music at a party.


We should never forget the words of Edmund Burke, who once famously said, 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.' Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald and Private Nathanael Galagher were good men. They were prepared to stand up and to fight evil to ensure that it will not triumph. Australia, and the world, is a better place for their sacrifice and their service, and their efforts should never be forgotten. Lest we forget.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:16):  It is with great sadness that I rise today to support the condolence motion to honour Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher. Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher were both members of the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan. Tragically they both lost their lives when their helicopter crashed on 30 August 2012. This has been a very tough time for the family and friends of Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher and their mates still serving in Afghanistan. However, I would like them to know that our thoughts and prayers are with them.


Lance Corporal McDonald was on his sixth tour to Afghanistan. He served in Operation Slipper in Afghanistan, as well as Operation Astute in Timor-Leste and Operation Citadel in East Timor. By all accounts Lance Corporal McDonald was noted for his quick wit and positive energy. He has been described as a dedicated, wholehearted and highly professional soldier and a credit to his company. The moving words of Lance Corporal McDonald's fiancee, Rachael Sprigg-McKinnie, paint a picture of a loving family man with an infectious personality who was passionate about the Army and serving his country. Rachael's touching tribute to her fiance brings to the fore the tragic loss of this young soldier.


I also want to offer my condolences to the family and friends of 23-year-old Private Galagher, who was serving on his second tour to Afghanistan. Private Galagher, known as Nate to his family and mates, was deployed as part of the operation. I have spoken before about meeting soldiers of the calibre of Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher when I travelled to Afghanistan. In my short time in Tarin Kot, Kandahar and Kabul, I saw firsthand the determination and focus of the Australian troops and the passion that they have in their mission to eliminate terrorism from the region and create a peaceful and safe country for the people of Afghanistan. I also got to see the loyalty and the camaraderie of these soldiers, and I can only imagine what they are feeling and what they are experiencing at the moment at the loss of two of their own, because they are a very tight-knit and loyal group, and they are very close. It is like a brotherhood.


They operate in an environment that is unimaginable to most people. Our troops face unique hardships and risks. They share the satisfaction of serving in an operation that is designed to bring freedom from oppression, and they share the loss of their fellow soldiers very deeply. In my visit I met with those soldiers and commandos and got a sense of the conditions and challenges they endure, because the environment in Afghanistan is difficult and it is difficult to describe. When I was there I was told of life in winter, when the temperature can drop to minus 20, and of life in the summer months, when the temperature can rise to 50 degrees. Within a year the people of Afghanistan experience freezing conditions and boiling hot and dusty days that test the most highly trained and experienced soldiers.


So I have tremendous admiration for the people of Afghanistan, who endure these extreme conditions while under the constant threat of war and terrorism, and I hold in great admiration our service men and women who are there to help the Afghani people as they work towards building their own resilience and stability. Our service men and women are there to assist the people in Afghanistan. They want and need our help, and there are overwhelming sacrifices being made on all sides.


What impressed me about the soldiers there was the incredible dignity and respect that they have. Of course, the soldiers being Australian, I also saw a lot of humour and larrikinism, which is very much a trait of Australian soldiers. I have previously described our service men and women in Afghanistan and those serving in other operations as being like a brotherhood, as I mentioned before. As in a brotherhood, if one of their brothers dies or is injured then they are commemorated, often with bracelets bearing their names. There are many ways we can honour and pay tribute to our soldiers. While I did not know these soldiers personally, I can understand the incredible loss their mates are experiencing.


Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher were bravely serving their country with distinction and honour. The tributes we have heard today are a recognition on behalf of the parliament that we honour their commitment to our Defence Force and the operations they engage in. I extend my sincere sympathies to the family of Lance Corporal McDonald—his fiancee, Rachael; his mother, Myrna, and stepfather Bernie; and his brothers, Percy, Roger and Gary—and to the family of Private Galagher—his partner, Jessie; his parents, Wayne and Sally; and his sister, Elanor. Lest we forget.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (10:22):  I note before my remarks that I am following the condolence motion for Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher. I would like to identify with the remarks made in that condolence motion.


It's all about looking after your mates. Some are not travelling so well, so we're there for each other. The main thing is they are not alone.


These are Dave Rackett's words. Dave is a constituent and a friend and has been awarded the Meritorious Service Medal by the RSL. When Dave Rackett returned from World War II, his father encouraged him to continue his service to others by joining the Returned and Services League. Sixty years later, he has now been awarded another service medal that he will wear with pride. Dave Rackett was presented with the Meritorious Service Medal at the RSL's annual state conference on Wednesday, 4 July. The Meritorious Service Medal is an honour over and above life membership. It is awarded to those already holding life membership who have had 30 years continuous membership and who have given 25 years outstanding service.


When Mr Dave Rackett moved to Warragul from Darwin more than 30 years ago, one of his first priorities was to be active in the Warragul RSL branch. Many in the community would know Mr Rackett for his commitment to RSL appeals. He is regularly seen in the lead-up to Anzac Day and Remembrance Day selling badges and poppies. For Mr Rackett, it is all part of the ongoing service he committed to as a 20-year-old in World War II.


Mr Rackett served with the Royal Australian Air Force in the south-west Pacific between 1944 and 1946. When he returned home at just 22 years of age, his father immediately took him to the local RSL. His father was also a returned serviceman. Dave says in his own words


I thought, what is all this about. But my father (a returned serviceman from both World War I and World War II) told me it was a way to continue my service to others.


In the early days, following the war, Mr Rackett joined other returned servicemen to visit veterans in hospitals and institutions. He said there were many sad cases, many men who had returned from battle still shellshocked and struggling to get back to life. 'Little has changed', says Dave. He becomes emotional now, speaking of other young men he has come into contact with as a welfare officer—a 22-year-old, just like he was, who recently returned from Afghanistan. 'It is tough', he says, shedding a tear, 'It never gets any easier and the wars keep going. It will never end; mankind can be so bitter to others.'


Dave Rackett has held many positions within the RSL. For 16 years he has been secretary of the Warragul Branch and is also a past treasurer. But it is service he is happy to continue. There is a lovely photo in the local paper of Dave holding his framed certificate, and up on the honour board behind him, in the corner of the photo, is Dave Racket's name in the secretary's position. I think that is a lovely catch in the photo—it was great that the local paper's photographer got that. Dave says:


We have a dedicated team of hospital visitors to people at home who can't get out. That is the beauty of having a local RSL. It has been a rewarding part of my life. It's a real privilege to go into people's homes, talk to them and see what we can do to make their lives easier. But if it wasn't for the support of the community through Anzac and poppy appeals, we wouldn't have the money to do that.


Mr Rackett said he had never provided his service to RSL to be recognised. But he admits, 'when recognition does come along, it is very sweet'.


Dave is a special personality, and I want to pay tribute—from Maranoa to McMillan, which is from the bottom to the top, there are people like Dave Rackett serving our returned services community. I want to praise every one of them today for the work they do on behalf of our returned servicemen. Here's to you, Dave Rackett, and congratulations on a well-deserved citation.
