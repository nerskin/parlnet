"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 46—Treaties tabled on 12 March 2002, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Today I present a report to the parliament which contains the results of an inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into 13 treaties tabled in the parliament on 12 March 2002. Specifically, the report deals with:
·	the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER);
·	a status of forces agreement with the Kyrgyz Republic;
·	a treaty to amend an existing agreement with New Zealand on joint food standards;
·	a protocol to the double taxation agreement with the United States of America;
·	an agreement on customs law with the Netherlands;
·	an agreement with France on the employment of dependants of mission officials;
·	a social security agreement with the United States of America and amendments to an existing social security agreement with New Zealand;
·	agreements with Egypt and Uruguay on the promotion and protection of investments;
·	a child protection convention;
·	a convention on the recognition of higher education qualifications; and
·	a convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings.
In the view of the committee, it is in the interests of Australia for most of these treaties to be ratified, and the committee has made its recommendations accordingly. More specifically, the committee considers that:
·	the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) will ensure Australia's trade interests are not disadvantaged when island states in the region begin to negotiate free trade agreements with other countries;
·	the status of forces agreement (SOFA) with the Kyrgyz Republic will protect Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel deployed there to support coalition forces' operations in Afghanistan;
·	amending the existing agreement with New Zealand on joint food standards will update the joint Australia-New Zealand food standards system and give effect to food regulatory reforms which will have health benefits for Australians;
·	the agreement on customs law with the Netherlands will facilitate the exchange of intelligence and information to help the Australian Customs Service combat terrorism and transnational crime;
·	the agreement with France on the employment of dependants of mission officials will address what has been a significant disincentive for people interested in applying for overseas postings and thus enable the Australian government to have the best possible representation overseas;
·	the social security agreement with the United States of America and amendments to the existing social security agreement with New Zealand will enable Australian residents to move between these countries, confident in the knowledge that their entitlements to benefits will be recognised in each country and that each country will contribute fairly to support for which they are eligible;
·	the promotion and protection of investments agreements with Uruguay and Egypt will benefit Australian investors by providing them with a range of guarantees relating to non-commercial risk;
·	the child protection convention will help resolve a number of problems encountered by Australian authorities and parents embroiled in international child custody cases;
·	the Lisbon convention will facilitate the recognition of Australian academic qualifications overseas and help Australians wishing to work in countries that are parties to the convention; and
·	the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings will enhance the security of our citizens by placing an obligation on Australia to aid investigations and prosecutions of convention offences by other states and, where appropriate, to investigate, prosecute and punish alleged offenders within our jurisdiction.
In the case of the proposed protocol to the double taxation agreement with the United States of America, the committee has decided not to recommend ratification of the proposed treaty action pending the receipt of better information concerning its net benefit for Australia. With regard to this particular treaty proposal, the committee has recommended further that the Australian Taxation Office consult with the Australian Treasury and other interested parties to develop an effective methodology to quantify the economic benefits of double tax agreements. I commend the report to the House.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—Thank you for that indulgence, Mr Speaker. I am pleased to make some brief comments in support of report 46 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties which relates to 13 proposed treaties for ratification by the Australian government. These 13 treaties cover a range of different areas, as has already been mentioned by the member for Curtin. There are three about which I would like to address some remarks.
First is the protocol to the double taxation agreement with the United States. The overall effect of this agreement is to update the double taxation agreement between Australia and the United States, as the existing arrangement reflects positions agreed to in the 1970s. It is suggested that this agreement will assist with strengthening bilateral commercial relationships between Australia and the United States, which should ultimately benefit our economy through increased trade and investment. However, the committee's concerns about the loss of taxation revenue to Australia, projected to be in the order of $190 million per year, must be noted. These concerns are particularly important given that the committee saw little evidence of the potential benefits derived from forgoing this revenue. It is on this basis that the committee declines to support binding treaty action until it receives additional and more detailed evidence of the overall benefit to Australia.
The child protection convention facilitates international cooperation between state parties in the interest of protecting children. Just as we should support measures to deal with war crimes, so should this parliament support measures which afford greater protection to children. This convention will achieve that through the elimination of potential conflicts of jurisdiction between different countries and the provision of international recognition of measures to protect children. Subject to clarification of any potential conflict between proposed Queensland state government legislation and Commonwealth government legislation, this convention deserves the full support of the parliament. The committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department consult with state and territory departments to ensure harmonisation of proposed legislation and effective implementation of the convention.
Finally, there is the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. All Australians were outraged by the events of September 11. The Australian Labor Party recognise the need for effective legislation to deter future acts of terrorism and punish those responsible for these heinous crimes. We continue to support effective legislation that achieves these objectives. However, it must be noted that the government is yet to produce such legislation, despite several attempts. I again add my voice to those on this side of the House to implore the government to get its act together in this regard.
This convention will increase the effectiveness of existing Australian legislation relating to acts of terrorism. The committee noted that there were some concerns about the terminology and definitions used in the convention, but it is believed these are outweighed by the high degree of consensus within the international community that the actual wording will be appropriate. The committee is satisfied that the convention and associated legislation will not put at risk human rights or civil liberties in Australia. In addition, it places on Australia the obligation to aid investigations and prosecutions of relevant offences, both domestically and internationally. For these reasons, the committee supports this convention.
The report tabled today demonstrates the ongoing importance of Australia participating in international treaty measures. Through the treaties committee and the parliament, we are able to assess the costs and benefits of these treaties openly and honestly and then determine if it is appropriate to support them.
I want to make some comments regarding the treaty report that we tabled last time in relation to the International Criminal Court. I would again call on the government to bring forward the implementing legislation this week so that it can be passed through both houses of parliament to enable ratification on 2 July. At this stage we have not received any advice that this legislation is to be brought forward, but I would urge the government to do so. Government members know that we cannot ratify unless the enabling legislation has been passed by the parliament.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—Normally, to become an Australian citizen a person must have lived in Australia for two years out of the previous five, with at least one year being in the two years immediately before the application was made. Section 13(9) of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 provides that a person may apply for citizenship if the person is a permanent resident and is the spouse, widow or widower of an Australian resident. The residence requirements may then be waived at ministerial discretion if the applicant is the spouse of an Australian citizen and will suffer significant hardship or disadvantage if made to wait. The department has interpreted `spouse' in the Citizenship Act to apply only to legally married spouses and not de facto spouses. Social security legislation, in contrast, has a definition of being `a member of a couple', which includes both married and de facto couples. In migration law, the definition of a spouse includes both married and de facto couples. Provision is made for same sex interdependent couples.
The Australian Citizenship for Eligible De Facto Spouses Bill 2002, the private member's bill which I present today, would make access to ministerial discretion available on the same basis for both legally married couples and de facto couples—heterosexual and same sex. My bill has the support of my Labor colleagues. I have written to both the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to ask that the government consider also supporting the legislation. I believe that the discrimination in the current Citizenship Act, which allows ministerial discretion only in the cases of legally married spouses, is an oversight and can easily be fixed. The original bill was passed in 1948, when the government did not generally recognise any rights for de facto partners and certainly made no provisions for same sex partnerships.
This issue came to my attention when a constituent approached me. His de facto partner, with whom he had been living for very many years, wanted to visit her sick mother in Indonesia. The woman's Indonesian travel documents had expired some time ago, because she had been a permanent resident of Australia for a number of years. However, because her citizenship had not yet been granted, she was not eligible for an Australian passport. Of course she was in quite a difficult situation, wanting to visit her sick mother. It was her case that brought this anomaly to my attention, but since the drafting of this bill a number of other cases have come to my attention. Australian citizenship may be required for some jobs, and of course it is also required if you are a person born overseas who wishes to represent Australia in the international sporting arena. In cases such as these it certainly seems to make sense to give the minister discretion to speed up the process of granting citizenship.
This power would always remain at the discretion of the minister; I am not suggesting that the power should not be discretionary. What I am asking is that, where the minister has discretion in the cases of legally married couples, that discretion should also be extended to de facto couples—both heterosexual and same sex de facto couples. I believe that because the power remains discretionary the chances of it being misused or opening a new pathway to Australian citizenship are minimal. In addition, I think it is worth considering that this legislation, if it remains unamended, is likely to contravene the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which has a specific prohibition on discrimination on the grounds of marital status. I would certainly like to have the government's support, as I have the opposition's support, in seeing this bill come to fruition.

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises the invaluable contribution that immigrants have made to Australia's development;
(2)	believes it is appropriate to recognise this through the construction of a monument in the National Capital;
(3)	supports the efforts of those who have established the National Monument to Immigration Fund which seeks to achieve this goal; and
 (4)	remains informed of the progress of this project.
The genesis of this motion comes from the real birthplace of Australia's diverse culture. I refer to Cooma and the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, which are in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. Last year I was approached by a number of people from the Cooma district—including Gianni `Johnny' De Bortoli, Geoff Bowland, Dugald Mitchell, Vin Good and Renee Burns—seeking my support for a project which would appropriately recognise the great contribution that immigrants have made to the development of Australia. The many speakers that will follow me in speaking on this motion will probably talk about great examples of that input into Australia's development from a diverse range of people from various parts of the world.
The reaction from colleagues to this motion has been extraordinary. We could have had significantly more people standing to talk on this motion. In fact, a number of my colleagues expressed frustration that they missed out on an opportunity to speak on this motion. I should particularly mention that Phil Barresi and Teresa Gambaro were very keen to speak on this motion but unfortunately were not quick enough in informing the whip's office and have missed out.
—The member will refer to members by their electorates.
—Sorry. The member for Deakin and the member for Petrie are now on the record as having supported this motion. I want to concentrate on the Snowy scheme to some extent, because this is where this motion has come from. It was a nation building project because of the infrastructure and the diversity of people who came to Australia to work on that scheme.
A couple of years ago, in 1999, we had the 50-year anniversary of the Snowy scheme. Many thousands of people came back from various parts of Australia—from wherever they had gone after the scheme was completed—to celebrate that 50-year anniversary. One of the great scenes I recall was down in Cooma, where we have an avenue of flags of all the countries that participated in the building of the Snowy scheme. In fact, we had a presentation of additional flags, because some of those countries that were involved in the original scheme are now several countries. So now we have flags of those new countries in the avenue of flags.
In the order of 100,000 people came from more than 30 countries to work on that scheme, over 25 years. When you think about that, it is quite remarkable—over that 25-year period, about 100,000 people came from various parts of the world, from more than 30 countries. That scheme was a great investment in Australia. Those people, after working on the scheme—some of them for a short period, some of them for many years—then moved on to other parts of Australia. But many of them stayed in that Cooma region, and their families are in that region. Today we still have that very broad range of representation from so many parts of the world.
That representation is increasing. Now we have the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, which was the consulting arm of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. It is now a private company. With its headquarters still in Cooma, it is working all over the world and bringing people from other parts of the world to Australia. Engineers from Korea and India and those sorts of countries are now working with the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. They are countries that were not involved in the original Snowy Mountains scheme, so the diversity is becoming greater.
My personal connections with it go back to when I started university. My very first lecturer in Surveying 1 at the University of New South Wales was Henry Werner. He came to Australia to work on the Snowy Mountains scheme, and after working on the scheme he went on to become a lecturer at the university. Jack Freislich was a surveyor from South Africa who came to work on the Snowy scheme and then ended up at the university. Some years later, when I was working in Darwin, one of the surveyors that I had to deal with from the Northern Territory government was Brett Hochman, who had worked for the Commonwealth government at Woomera and places like that after leaving the Snowy scheme. You find these people spread all over the place in different areas. They brought fantastic technical skills of the day—skills that were not here in Australia—and helped build Australian skills from that point on.
This project came about, firstly, because of Johnny De Bertoli, who I mentioned before. Johnny is an example of the kind of person of that era that we hear about so much, and we also hear about the country he came from. On 7 August 2001, the Cooma-Monaro Express said:
Johnny arrived in Australia from Italy in 1957; he returned to Italy to marry Rosetta and the couple spent their honeymoon on the boat bound for Australia. They settled in Berridale—
which is just out of Cooma—
in 1959, Johnny having worked firstly in the Victorian Alps, Sydney, Cooma, Canberra and Berridale. He joined the SMA as a model maker (he made the two models in the Visitors Centre) and also worked as a building contractor, security guard and taxi operator.
So he has provided a diverse amount of input for the region and he is one of the people involved in this project. He had written to the National Capital Authority about the prospect of building a memorial in the national capital, and they came back to him in very supportive terms. They said:
The Authority considers the creation of ... a steering committee essential for the successful completion of any memorial project.
They also commented that he might wish to approach an eminent Australian with an interest in the contribution of immigrants to be the project's patron. The letter from the National Capital Authority also went on to say:
The Authority would work with your committee to identify a suitable site for such a monument.
After a number of meetings with various people, a public meeting was held on 10 September 2001—of all dates—to progress this project. Out of that a steering committee was formed. Geoff Bowland has taken on the role of chairman of the steering committee, Johnny De Bertoli is the vice-president and Dugald Mitchell agreed to be the secretary of that committee for the National Monument for Immigration Fund—the subject of this motion. 
They have put a statement of purpose for this project and I will go through that. The proposal in that statement is:
To utilise the fund to build a national monument in Canberra which aims to recognise the contribution to Australia of the many migrants from around the world who have made Australia their home and who have enriched our country through their presence. 
Why? The statement says:
It is important to enhance the understanding of the Australian people of the benefits which migration has brought to our national community. 
By partnering with the National Capital Authority in Canberra, they hope to secure a site of lasting prestige in our national capital. As I said, the steering committee for the fund has been established. I also mentioned that the National Capital Authority said that they should have an eminent Australian as a patron. In fact, they have the Snowy hydro as the patron of this organisation. It is intended that the committee will work closely with the National Capital Authority to capitalise on the expertise of the authority in managing projects of this type. It is intended that the successful design of the monument be decided by a group of eminent persons after the conduct of a national design competition. Construction of the monument will be managed by the National Capital Authority. Fundraising is now something which is a major issue that we have to address.
Congratulations must go to Johnny De Bertoli, Geoff Bowland and Dugald Mitchell along with other committee members for what they have done so far. It is a very appropriate project for the national capital, and I commend them for their vision. It is a national project and therefore I think that it is appropriate that with this motion we challenge all members of this House to promote the project in their electorates, have input into it and help raise the funds that will be necessary to put together a wonderful memorial to the contribution that immigrants from all over the world have made to the development of Australia. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I strongly support the motion recognising the significant contribution of immigration to Australia's development. Given the strains to community harmony that we have experienced over the past year, I only regret that we are not doing so through a formal government motion. Today's debate is timely for two reasons. Three months ago we saw the arrival in Sydney of Australia's six millionth migrant since the Chifley Labor government inaugurated our world renowned postwar immigration program. Then last week the Bureau of Statistics released the first results of the last census. They revealed that over 4.1 million Australians were born overseas, more than a fifth of the entire population. In my own electorate in Western Sydney, the figure is more like 48 per cent of the population.
More significantly, the census provides fascinating data on the self-reported ancestry of Australians. It provides a vital snapshot of our collective family history. Over 6.7 million respondents describe their ancestry as being Australian; nearly 6.4 million describe themselves as English; nearly two million answered that they were Irish; and 800,000 spoke of Italian ancestry. Also, 740,000 said that they were German; 560,000, Chinese; 540,000—very importantly—Scottish; and 375,000, Greek. The census shows that many of those who describe their ancestry as English, Irish or Italian not only were born in Australia but also have parents who were born here.
This demonstrates the far-reaching impact that immigration has had on the demography of our nation. These findings demonstrate both the historical achievement and the continuing challenge of Australian nationhood—that is, to achieve unity in diversity; to respect the cultural, ethnic and religious diversity of our peoples; and, simultaneously, to accept the common obligations of citizenship and of English as our national language. It also emphasises that multiculturalism has relevance to all Australians, not just first- or second-generation migrants. It is in this context that I am happy to support the concept of a national monument to immigration. We can hold different views about the name, the location or the design, but the concept itself has great value. 
It is interesting to observe how the coalition have once again come full circle on such matters. In the wake of the shocking events of September 11 last year and the Tampa affair, they have cleverly exploited anti-immigrant and, more particularly, anti-Islamic feeling for base political reasons. Now re-elected, they seek to portray themselves as the `living in harmony party'. In relation to whether Muslim-Australians can integrate as successfully as Asian-Australians, the Prime Minister told the Australian on 4 May:
`I'm confident, yes, but it needs a community effort and it needs leadership from me ...
He also said:
Some of the attitudes towards people of Islamic or Arab descent, yes I'm worried about that ... 
This doublespeak is now becoming an accepted pattern. A perceptive article in the Age by Tony Wright argued that Mr Howard is a practitioner of `dog whistle' politics on immigration and indigenous issues. This refers to his tendency to simultaneously send contrasting messages to different audiences, with a bland and seemingly benign surface message being accompanied by a `dog whistle' message pitched at those who are wedded to less sophisticated and less tolerant approaches. Needless to say, this is yet another electoral stratagem that the coalition have imported from American Republican friends.
We first saw the pattern in Mr Howard's August 1988 comments that the rate of Asian migration should be slowed down `so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater'. Last month on 4 May he grandly and publicly attempted an abject apology, telling the Australian:
My instinct is that Asian-Australians are very much part of the community now. I think it—
their integration—
has been quicker. I just don't hear people talking about it now, even as much as they did five years ago, and I have an electorate that is very Asian.
I think that is a very interesting factor in his conversion. An important point in relation to this apology is that at the time he made those remarks he actually denied that his comments were anti-Asian. And now, a decade or so later, we are seeing an apology.
I warmly welcome the motion by the member for Eden-Monaro. We are indeed a nation of migrants. It is fitting that we make greater efforts to acknowledge the very significant contribution that immigration has made to our economic, cultural and social development. It has had a very big impact on our national psyche. I was at the 23rd Conference of the Ukrainian Federation of Australia at the weekend where former Senator Jim Short recounted his own family history of his father going down to Bendigo Station to meet incoming migrants and of the impact that that had upon him in getting to know the people of the Baltic countries and of Eastern Europe. We are a settlement country like Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. Immigration has had a deep impact on our nation. I very much commend the motion. It follows the US practice at Ellis Island. It is a very overdue motion.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>National Monument to Immigration Fund</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—I can only observe—and I think it is a very great shame—that on a motion as important as this, on a motion that is of such great value, the member for Reid seeks to politicise it. Those in the gallery who listened to that speech just a moment ago would have been thinking to themselves, when the member for Reid talked about what the government did in relation to the Tampa, that the main support for the government's position came from migrants who came here legally. I think that shows the politicisation that the member for Reid has attempted to bring to this motion.
According to the census, 28 per cent of Australians were born overseas—that is, one in four of us. Look at the gallery: perhaps one in four of the people there were born overseas. We come from 200 different ancestries, the chief being English, Irish, Italian, German, Chinese, Scottish and Greek. I think it can be fairly said that Australia is the most culturally and ethnically diverse country in the world today. What a proud heritage we as Australians all have—that is, to be the most culturally and ethnically diverse community in the world. That underlines why it is important to be considering at this time a national monument.
A national monument is certainly something that the parliament should be very seriously considering, and I know that it will. The member for Eden-Monaro referred to members of the House who want to speak on this motion because they feel passionately about it, as I do. My electorate certainly strongly supports the concept of a national memorial. I think that the National Capital Authority, whose duty it will be to find an appropriate site, to secure that site and to choose an appropriate design, will be easily convinced that that is the way this project should proceed.
I am very mindful of the benefits that migration has brought to this country. In my mind, there are three outstanding benefits that have occurred because of migration—culture, business and science. In relation to culture, I can think of no better example than Favardin Daliri, who is the current manager of the Townsville-Thuringowa Migrant Resource Centre. Farvardin fled Persia—he calls himself a Persian; but these days the country is called Iran—and is of the Baiha'i faith. He and his family are among some of the most delightful, energetic and thoughtful persons you could wish to meet. He has brought his culture to this country and, because of his religion, he has brought his stories of persecution. It enriches our country to know exactly what has occurred in his country. He has not lost the links with his culture; he has brought his culture to our country. I have spent many enjoyable hours in his company talking about Iran.
The Koreans who have come to Townsville have brought Korea's largest business investment in this country—a half a billion dollar zinc refinery. That has just been marvellous and has allowed all sorts of cultural exchanges. If I might just digress and make a prediction, I think Korea will win the World Cup in soccer—and good luck to them, if they do. In the short time I have left, I would like to pay tribute to the six million migrants who have come to this country since 1945. There has been a bit of an imbalance in the number of males and females who have arrived in Australia: about 3.1 million males and 2.8 million females. Almost 600,000 people have arrived under humanitarian programs, initially as displaced persons and more recently as refugees. I support Australia's migration program, and I support a lasting and fitting tribute to immigrants in the nation's capital.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I would like to support the honourable member for Eden-Monaro's motion, as I believe that it is indeed time to consider some form by which we mark and celebrate the foundation stone of Australia's contemporary society. I say `contemporary' because this great country of ours has a very ancient history and has evolved from a land with an Indigenous past to a land which, after having experienced the onset of European settlement some 200 years ago, has grown into a vibrant, contemporary democracy with a society of people that is multicultural in nature.
I suppose it is timely to begin thinking about recognising and honouring the fact that Australia is a product of an active and ongoing immigration system. The immigration process that has been taking place in the last 200 years has built and established contemporary Australia. It is important to acknowledge that every single Australian, except our Indigenous Australians, hails from some corner of the world. We have come here at various stages of our history from Great Britain, Ireland, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, the Baltic States, Asia and, in more recent times, the Middle East and Africa. These immigrants, who are now various generations of Australians, built this country piece by piece, stage by stage. They came here bringing their youth and their dreams, their hopes and their aspirations, their energy and their drive and their skills and their labour. They built this country literally from the ground up. In addition to this, and more importantly, they brought with them a rich cultural and linguistic inheritance, with customs and traditions that would add to a tapestry that almost 200 years later has evolved into a rich and dynamic identity—an evolving contemporary, multicultural identity that makes Australia a unique place in the world.
When we turn our thoughts to how we may celebrate or commemorate immigration as the driving force of our development, it is appropriate that Canberra, our national capital, be the place where a monument stands. However, I must say that I have some reservations about referring to it as a `monument' because the connotation is that we are honouring something that has ceased to be. The reality is that immigration has not ceased, and as more and more new immigrants join our Australian family, the more this country will benefit from their contribution now and in future years.
I would like to suggest that, in contemplating how we commemorate our immigrants, we consider the Immigration Museum in Melbourne, as it is an outstanding commemoration of our immigrant history. The museum was established during the term of the former Victorian Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett, who is himself a great advocate for multicultural Australia. The museum not only serves to recognise the invaluable contribution that immigrants make to Victoria but it does so in a creative, visually dynamic and evolving manner.
Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to meet Mr Gianni De Bortoli, who, I understand, initiated this very important concept, so I am not fully aware of what progress has been made regarding this matter. However, I have read the correspondence sent to Mr De Bortoli by the National Capital Authority, and it certainly appears that a lot of time, money and effort are required to achieve this end. Naturally, one worries about the prospects of success, especially where a great deal of money is concerned. I would like to suggest that the federal government consider becoming a major stakeholder in this project. In fact, we should congratulate Mr Gianni De Bortoli for his initiative but, if this parliament is really serious about commemorating and recognising the contribution of immigration to the development of contemporary Australia, we should not only support Mr De Bortoli's efforts but embrace his idea and make it a Commonwealth government project, funded and coordinated by the Commonwealth government. I am certain that taxpayers would like to see the fruits of their labour go into building a national symbol, but not too grandiose a symbol. Perhaps one could be built along the lines of Ellis Island in New York or maybe we should look to the Immigration Museum in Melbourne as a place or a symbol that marks the single most important foundation stone of contemporary Australia—immigration.
My personal view is that an Australian Republic will just as easily serve as the perfect commemoration of contemporary Australian society because it will enshrine in our political system an equality of status for all Australians, no matter where they migrated from or when. But, in the meantime, we on this side of the House will take an active interest in the progress of Mr De Bortoli's proposal and will press the government to consider taking this opportunity to build on this initiative, because it is time for such recognition in the national capital.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>National Monument to Immigration Fund</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—I wish to support the private member's motion proposed by the member for Eden-Monaro for a fund for a national monument to immigration and I note that the proponents of the project are now in the gallery. 
I welcome the opportunity to both recognise the contribution that Australian migrants have made to the development of this nation and support the proposal to construct a national monument with this purpose in mind.
Since the Second World War this country has taken in almost six million migrants from over 130 countries and has created a uniquely cohesive society. There have always been problems—there have always been pain, hardship and controversy—and there always will be. But transcending all of this is the overwhelming reality that our postwar experience with migration has been uniquely successful because of our migrants' contributions to our nation, and not just to our economic prosperity but to all aspects of Australian life.
In acknowledging the contribution of migrants it is essential to acknowledge the importance of multiculturalism. As I have long said, the fact is that the massive wave of postwar migrants to Australia committed to our legal and democratic institutions. At the same time they created schools, religious institutions and voluntary associations to preserve the components of the distinct heritages they valued. This commitment and these institutions were the basic ingredients of multiculturalism. They were not concocted by politicians or bureaucrats. They were not imposed by some elite. They were not the artefact of some so-called ethnic industry. Multiculturalism was made possible because of the commitment of our grandparents and of our parents.
I also believe that Australia owes an enduring debt of gratitude to Malcolm Fraser for having the courage, foresight and statesmanship to institutionalise multiculturalism and demand that government departments, statutory authorities and services respond to the needs of our ethnically diverse population. I can do no better in illustrating Malcolm Fraser's historic insight than to quote from his seminal 1981 speech on multiculturalism, in which his starting point was:
... the recognition and appreciation of the fact that the Australian population is derived from a wide variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and that these backgrounds are important to the way Australians see themselves. The sheer duration and magnitude of immigration into this country, the plain facts of the composition of Australia's population, mean that even if we wished otherwise ethnic and cultural diversity can neither be ignored nor readily extinguished.
We know that the attempt to enforce conformity holds high costs both for the individual and the society. It denies people their identity and self-esteem. Ultimately it poses a real threat of alienation and division. We cannot demand of people that they renounce the heritage they value, and yet expect them to feel welcome as full members of our society.
Multiculturalism is concerned with far more than the passive toleration of diversity. It sees diversity as a quality to be actively embraced, a source of social wealth and dynamism. It encourages groups to be open and to interact, so that all Australians may learn and benefit from each other's heritages.
Multiculturalism is about diversity, not division—it is about interaction, not isolation. It is about cultural and ethnic differences set within a framework of shared fundamental values ... Insisting upon a core area of common values is no threat to multiculturalism but its guarantee.
Not least, multiculturalism is about equality of opportunity for the members of all groups to participate in and benefit from Australia's social, economic and political life. No society can long retain the commitment and involvement of groups that are denied these rights. If particular groups feel that they and their children are condemned whether through legal or other arrangements to occupy the worst jobs and housing, to suffer the poorest health and education, then the societies in which they live are bent on a path which will cost them dearly.
The prevalence of these views and the understanding of multiculturalism articulated and implemented by Malcolm Fraser as Prime Minister have meant that Australia is a more tolerant, just, open and prosperous society—a society based on the best of Australia's values. 
The sailing has not always been smooth but I am perpetually optimistic about the character of Australia and the strength of our best values: the belief in basic rights and social justice, the respect for other points of view, and the commitment to equality of opportunity and support for those experiencing tough times. A monument in the national capital is a fitting way to recognise the enormous contribution of migrants to Australia. It will also serve as an important reminder of what we as a nation are capable of.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—There is no doubt in my mind that the greatest part of Australia's post World War II history is our immigration and the enormous benefits that migrants have brought to the Australian nation. Australia changed forever after World War II. We became a different nation. We are a different nation today from what we were before we had six million or so migrants come to our shores and build a new life here for themselves and for their families. In the electorate that I represent, in particular the Latrobe Valley, we have benefited enormously from migration. We had people from all around the globe come to the Latrobe Valley. They came from Italy, Greece, Germany, Malta, Ireland, Wales and other parts of the United Kingdom—from many different countries around the world. They came to work and they made an enormous contribution to our state and to our nation. People did not come to Australia to loaf around, sit around and do nothing. People did not come to freeload; they came to work. This was the great part of the Latrobe Valley migrant experience.
We never had any room for any of that redneck or racist attitude which exists in some elements of our society where people say, `Migrants don't fit in. They don't mix. They don't get along. They don't work. They don't do anything.' We never had time for that in the Latrobe Valley, because the migrants we had were too busy working with everyone else. It is pretty hard for you to have that view about people when you are working alongside migrants from other countries and they are bending their backs and working just as hard as you are; when they are living in your street and their kids are playing with your kids; when they are sending their kids to the same school that you are sending your kids to; when you are going to each other's birthdays and to holy communion and confession together. This has been a great part of the success of multiculturalism in the Latrobe Valley. Migrants came to work, and they worked hard. They made an enormous contribution to not just the Latrobe Valley but the state of Victoria, whose manufacturing base is so much built on the low-cost, efficient electricity which is produced in the Latrobe Valley and which was really built through the hard work of that new migrant work force which arrived in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.
We often make the mistake, when we talk about migrants and multiculturalism, of talking about how we have to be a `tolerant' people and how we have to `tolerate' someone speaking another language next to us or `tolerate' looking at someone wearing clothes other than a suit and a tie or traditional European dress, as if `tolerating' is the best we can do. I think we get it fundamentally wrong when we start at that point—because that is all about barely being able to repress your hostility towards a group of people or a person. That is not how I feel. I think multiculturalism is a celebration: a celebration of who we are and how we see ourselves as a society; a celebration of what people bring to our society; a celebration of who they are, how they treat their families, how they worship, how they live their lives and how they conduct themselves. We have so much in our nation to be proud of. We have so much to be proud of in the effort and contribution migrants have made to Australia and to the way that we live today: in food, culture, music and literature—in so many different areas.
People from all walks of life and from different parts of the world have come to Australia, knowing that the thing that will differentiate them, the thing that will define whether they are successful in Australia or whether they will make a great or an exceptional contribution, is how hard they work, their efforts, the love they give people and the genuineness they give to our nation. It will not be based on whether they are black or white, Muslim or Christian, or any of those other things. That is something which sets us apart from just about any other country in the world: the great acceptance we have in Australia that you define yourself by the work you do and the type of person you are, not by any other stereotype or label. In the Latrobe Valley we have long said that we were practising multiculturalism long before the phrase was ever coined, and I think that is true. The great differential for us has been that migrants came to work and worked hard. Migrants came to make a contribution and they did just that. Migrants came and changed the Latrobe Valley and made it a better place, and they made our nation a better place too.

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—I am very pleased and honoured to support my colleague the member for Eden-Monaro in his private member's motion for a fund for a national monument to immigration. It is particularly pleasing to me that the initiative for this national monument comes from Cooma. Cooma is a place I remember fondly. As a young fellow I came to Canberra in the early sixties to go to university, and I played rugby league for Canberra. Cooma and other teams from around that area were in the competition, and I distinctly remember the first game I played. It was on a very cold day in a little town called Dalgety when we played against Utah Island Bend. Apart from a sprinkling of Kiwis and maybe one or two Australians, the teams list on the board in the local pub looked like a page out of a telephone book from Warsaw or Prague. It was very significant that the integration of the migrants who worked in the Snowy had led to them adopting rugby league as their game on weekends.
I represent this parliament on the National Archives Council. I was at a meeting about a fortnight ago when, over lunch, one of the staff said to me, because my parents had migrated here back in that era, `Would you like me to dig out your migration file?' I had never thought of doing that, and they produced it for me. Some of the documents in that file are very interesting. I would like to read into the Hansard some words on migration during the 1940s following World War II and Australia's role in accepting those migrants. Under the heading `Displaced Persons Scheme', it reads:
At the end of the Second World War many thousands of people who had been brought to Germany from occupied countries to labour in German industry were unable or unwilling to return to their homelands because of the occupation by the army of the USSR (mainly Poland and the Baltic countries—Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia—as well as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, etc.) These people came under the care of the International Refugee Organization (IRO); they were screened, given the status of Displaced Person and housed in camps in Germany, Italy and Austria.
On 21 July 1947, the Commonwealth Government entered into an agreement with the IRO covering resettlement of European Displaced Persons (or `DPs' as they were commonly referred to) in Australia.
Under this agreement, the IRO undertook responsibility for provision of transport and the care of the Displaced Persons until their disembarkation in Australia. The Commonwealth undertook selection in Europe and responsibility for reception in Australia, placement in employment and care after arrival.
Eligibility for selection was initially based on standards of age, physical fitness and the ability to do manual work. At first, Australia was only interested in accepting single Baltic people, however restrictions on nationality were relaxed as the scheme progressed. As Australia's annual quota increased the Department of Immigration accepted other nationalities which included Czechoslovaks, Yugoslavs, Ukrainians, Hungarians and Poles.
The scheme was extended. The document continues:
All applicants within the worker age limits under this scheme undertook to remain in the employment found for them by the Commonwealth for a period of two years from the date of their arrival, ...
Then it says:
To ensure suitable arrangements for the reception of the DPs and their absorption into the community, the Commonwealth set up Reception and Training Centres principally at Bathurst and Greta in NSW, Bonegilla in Victoria, and Northam in WA.
My parents were actually in Bathurst. It goes on:
When the IRO wound up its activities in 1951, the Commonwealth agreed to receive those Displaced Persons already accepted for migration whose passages had still to be arranged. This continued until 1954, bringing the total number of arrivals under this scheme to approximately 170,700.
This was at a time when Australia's population was barely seven million. The integration of these people into the Australian community and their contribution to the culture and history of Australia should be, I believe, celebrated by a national monument in Canberra.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I am happy to support this motion, the core of which is to set up a national monument to immigration in Canberra, the very heart of the nation. It would be a potent, practical recognition of the importance and power of immigration in Australia's history, particularly in the last 50 years. I come from an electorate that was started in 1949, an electorate that in fact was built on postwar migration. The Bankstown that I grew up in after my birth in 1951 was only of about 2,000 people, growing to about 5,000 people, and was effectively a rural area of Sydney based on an Anglo-Celtic heritage. There was not much variation and there was not much diversity, and the dominant culture was absolutely that.
Make your way back in time over 100 years to the Australia of the gold rushes, when Australia was an entirely different place. People from all over this planet were drawn to both the goldfields in New South Wales—near Oberon and Bathurst and out through western New South Wales—and the goldfields in Victoria—around Ballarat and Bendigo—and Australia had an extremely diverse community of people who worked hard to win wealth for themselves and, in doing so, for the country. But at the end of the 1850s most of those people left. Most of the groups of people went elsewhere—some to the United States, some returning to Europe and some going to China. Australia was increasingly left, during the great period of development from the 1860s through to the end of the 1880s, with what we had before, a dominant Anglo-Celtic culture, and so it was in Blaxland in 1949. The people who came to the migrant camps in Villawood and Chullora included my sister-in-law, Ursula, her brother, Martin, and one of their parents—their mum, who was in the camp in Chullora; their dad was in Bonegilla. It was not just a two-year stint that people had to do when they came to Australia and when the fathers signed up, in large part, to go and work on the Snowy Mountains scheme or to do any job that was required of them. In the case of Ursula and Martin, it took more than eight years for that family to actually come together to live as a family.
An immigration monument in Canberra needs to recognise not just the diversity of the population but the toughness of Australia's history and how hard the people working on the Snowy and the other migrants who came to help build Australia in the fifties and sixties did it, because they did not come to a country that welcomed them, in the same way that the people who came to the gold rushes were not greatly welcomed by the existing population. People who came in that period understand the unwillingness of the population. What they met was misunderstanding, a lack of recognition of where they came from, what their importance was and what they were doing.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—Hurlstone Agricultural High School, a selective government school at Glenfield in my electorate, is one of Australia's greatest schools—a school of uncommon excellence, heritage and morale. Last Friday I was privileged to attend Hurlstone's assembly in honour of its post World War II veterans—old boys who served our nation in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. I congratulate all those involved in the ceremony, especially Mr Douglas McGrath, a Vietnam veteran, a great Hurlstonian and a member of the legendary 1964 First XV that won the Waratah Shield. Doug gave one of the best speeches I have ever heard—a speech that captured the enduring spirit and courage of this wonderful school. It was a moving and inspirational presentation.
The post World War II veterans have lived up to Hursltone's motto, `Pro patria'—For our country. They remain an inspiration for us all, now permanently remembered at the school through the unveiling of an honour board in Hurlstone's hall of honour. I am proud not only to have attended Hurlstone as a student but to now represent the old school in the seat of Werriwa in this House of Representatives. If all our schools were as good as Hurlstone, all our problems and worries as a nation would soon be over. It was a wonderful ceremony at a wonderful place of learning.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—I am pleased that the member for Griffith has raised this issue, because it does need the attention of the House. He has raised a concern that has been expressed by people in the community who are worried about the prospect of upgrades to cochlear implants. There are two establishments within my electorate of Mitchell which care for people with impaired hearing. I wish to acknowledge the splendid work done by St Gabriel's School for Hearing Impaired Children and also the work that is done by the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children. Both of these organisations have a strong record of support and assistance to young people, to children in particular, with impaired hearing. This motion gives the House an opportunity to look at some of the wrong and perhaps mischievous comments made in the community about this issue, particularly in relation to upgrades of equipment—comments which are perpetrated to disturb parents and children.
The cochlear implant was developed in Australia with great success and it has had a massive world wide impact. The government, in its policy on hearing impairment, developed a voucher system which commenced in 1997. This system improved the way in which people are entitled to receive benefits for hearing problems. There are 139 providers around Australia and, under the voucher system, 340,000 people receive benefit, assistance or support of one kind or another. Within the voucher system there is a community service obligation which applies specifically to young people under the age of 21. This program protects 35,000 children and it costs around $119.8 million per year. So this government gives significant support to hearing impairment services, particularly to young people under the age of 21. There is also a community service obligation which applies to a special needs group, which covers 11,000 special needs people. The community service obligation also requires the National Acoustic Laboratories to continue its brilliant worldwide research. Last year, the government spent a total of $156.54 million on hearing impairment services.
The government's role in the measure under discussion today lies in two parts: firstly, the provision of cochlear services; and, secondly, the implementation of new equipment. The new equipment comes within the Australian Hearing Services Act, and that new equipment has to be assessed as part of an ongoing assessment of new prostheses. That review is expected to be concluded by the end of the year but, whether or not that review is concluded on time, young adults under the age of 21 and their parents should have no fears about the government's ongoing commitment to the provision of upgrade processes and the assessment of new equipment. I thank the member for Griffith for raising this issue. It has been a valuable issue for us to discuss. Schools such as St Gabriel's and the institute for those who have a hearing impairment and those who are blind have no need to be concerned, because the government has the situation covered. It will look after young people with a hearing impairment and it will continue to expand the hearing program, as it did last year, as part of a five-year program, when it introduced upgraded funding for the program.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Cochlear Implants</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—In supporting the motion moved by my colleague the member for Griffith, I am pleased to speak about cochlear implants. It is an appropriate time to discuss this issue, as this week, which runs from 23 to 29 June, is Deaf-Blind Awareness Week. Members will be interested to know that Deaf-Blind Awareness Week is the lead-up to the sixth Australian National DeafBlind Conference, `Touching the World', which is to be held in Sydney from 12 to 15 July 2002. Conference details and information about issues of interest to that community can be found on their website: www.dbansw.org.au. This motion is an opportunity for us, in a bipartisan way, to focus on issues of interest and debate within the deaf community.
We need to be mindful that it is estimated that one in 10 Australians—that is, approximately 200,000 people—have a hearing loss. In Western Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that in 1993 approximately 93,600 people had some degree of hearing loss. The bureau also points out that hearing loss is frequently under-reported. The issue of cochlear implants as a new technology developed in Australia is of great interest to the community of deaf people in Australia. The community supports cochlear implanting into late-deafened adults who research for themselves the advantages and disadvantages of implants. It is generally accepted that cochlear implants may improve the quality of life for late-deafened adults. Besides that, adults usually are empowered to make their own decisions according to their specific life circumstances.
The deaf community have concerns about implanting deaf children according to decisions made by their parents. The main controversy is about implanting children who cannot decide for themselves. The community are also concerned that parents may put too much focus on the strategies supporting implants and insufficient focus on supporting strategies around children learning AUSLAN and other communication strategies. They are also concerned that funding and resources are being diverted away from services for deaf children and adults and into new and expensive technologies. I ask the government to listen to and work with the deaf community about these concerns.
Cochlear implants and replacement parts are covered by the government via Australian Hearing Services for children up to the age of 21 years. I want to focus on the issues for adults who choose cochlear implants. Firstly, adults who do not have private health cover generally get their upgrades and replacement speech processors through hospital inpatient services. Secondly, adults who have private health cover are covered for upgrades and replacement speech processors by their private health fund. I note with alarm the recommendations of the Private Health Industry Medical Devices Expert Committee to remove speech processors from appendix A of schedule 5 of the National Health Act 1953. What would that mean? It would mean that private health insurance companies would no longer be required to reimburse recipients of cochlear implants for the cost of upgrading or replacing their speech processors, which are the machines that are worn externally by a person with a cochlear implant. These processors need to be upgraded for a variety of reasons. The most common reasons occur when the processors become technologically obsolete or when they are worn out through damage or wear and tear.
Why did PHIMDEC recommend that the upgrades be removed? The argument is that upgrades and replacements be removed from schedule 5 on the basis that they occur in an outpatient setting rather than as part of an episode of hospital treatment. Medicare covers the original cochlear implant as it occurs as part of an episode of hospital treatment. However, under the new arrangements proposed by the minister, the upgrades may be covered by private health funds through their ancillary tables. That can put people out of pocket, as we all know that ancillary items, even with top cover, will not cover an $8,000 bill. Although PHIMDEC has recommended their delisting, the decision to move on that advice has been deferred. However, this has put the issue into limbo, and people who might be directly affected by the decision to remove the items from the schedule are extremely concerned.
Some people in the deaf community are asking, `Are the government and the committee going to organise some community consultation, especially with the deaf community, about the implications of this decision to delist upgrades and replacement processors?' I ask the government to take this concern on board and to work with the deaf community for a mutually beneficial outcome. I ask also that the government provide a telephone typewriter for every parliamentarian's office to improve deaf people's access to their members of parliament and senators. It is very badly missed in our repertoire of equipment provided by the parliament and by the Department of Finance and Administration.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Cochlear Implants</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—As chair of the health and ageing committee, I too am very happy to speak on this motion on cochlear implants in Deaf-Blind Awareness Week. The invention and development of cochlear implants, or bionic ears as they are sometimes called, has for many people been a modern miracle. A cochlear implant is an artificial hearing device designed to enable deaf people to hear by electrically stimulating nerves inside the inner ear.
An essential component is the speech processor, which is worn on the body, often in the person's pocket. The function of the speech processor is to convert the electrical impulses from a microphone into a signal or set of signals which the implant converts into recognisable words or sounds. As with so many of the inventions and developments within the area of health, the monetary cost of cochlear implants and the associated speech processors is high. Private health insurance funds are required to fully fund cochlear implants and speech processors for privately insured patients. This is guaranteed by the fact that they are included in the Commonwealth prosthesis schedule under the National Health Act 1953.
As the member for Griffith stated in his motion, the Private Health Industry Medical Devices Expert Committee has recommended that speech processors be removed from the schedule. The reason for this view is that speech processors are not provided as part of hospital treatment. Had the opposition supported the government's attempts to provide health insurance cover to outpatient services, this would not be an issue, but we all know that the opposition would rather engage in scare campaigns than improve health services to the Australian people.
The member for Griffith would be aware that, despite the committee's recommendation, the government has not removed speech processors from the schedule. The member may also know that there is currently a review of the private health insurance regulation under way and that the government has stated that there will be no decision on the committee's recommendations until the finalisation of this review. Whatever the outcome of the review, Australian Hearing Services, under the department of health and family services, will continue to provide replacement cochlear speech processors to every Australian under the age of 21 who is in need of such devices. I am advised that there is currently no waiting list for this service. Families can rest assured that the Howard government is committed to ensuring the equitable provision of hearing services and devices to the hearing impaired.
Government members are well aware of the importance of cochlear implants. On a previous occasion, the member for Mitchell spoke about the great work being undertaken by the St Gabriel's School for Hearing Impaired Children in his electorate and the importance of providing children with effective hearing devices as early as possible so that they gain maximum advantage. The members for Leichhardt and Longman have also spoken on this, and the government will continue to provide cochlear implants and speech processors to all Australian children who need them. This commitment is not dependent on any review or any decision of the committee. It is a non-negotiable commitment to Australian families.
Many in this House would already know that the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman supports the continued full coverage of cochlear implants and speech processors, and that several funds have already stated their support for this. There is no need for this motion, other than to satisfy the opposition's need to scare people.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Cochlear Implants</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I strongly support the motion moved by the member for Griffith, Mr Kevin Rudd. My electorate of Lowe is home to a significant number of disability services for the deaf and for people with other hearing disabilities. I am indebted for the advice given to me by one of my constituents, Mr Peter Kerley, of the Deafness Council of New South Wales Inc. The Deafness Council is an organisation that has led the way in advocating both technological and non-technocentric solutions for meeting the communications needs of people with a deafness disability. The Deafness Council advises me that there are about 2,000 Australian cochlear implantees, and there are 900 children who are eligible for cochlear implants. I am advised that a surgical cochlear implant costs approximately $40,000. This cost is covered almost entirely by Medicare and private insurance. The total cost is in the order of $18 million, with a cost recycling every eight to 10 years. The costs include the surgery, the speech processor upgrade and repeat surgery at approximately 15 years.
That being said, a more typical profile of a cochlear based technocentric solution for hearing restoration may include up to six operations and up to 12 speech processor upgrades over the whole life of the person. I urge this House to reject the recommendations of the Private Health Industry Medical Devices Expert Committee to withdraw private health funding for upgrades and replacements for cochlear implants. If the government decides to accept the committee's recommendations, the government will be succumbing to the corporate world by acceding to the desire of the private health insurance lobby to socialise the losses and costs of these medical upgrades and replacement procedures.
Children growing up with these implants require further surgery and replacements. The child turned adult will remain dependent on that cochlear technology. The child requires listening skills to obtain and retain employment and for the basic necessities of life. You cannot give the child a cochlear implant and then make it unaffordable by denying upgrades in later life. I ask the committee and this House: has the committee considered all of the consequences of transferring the burden of the cost of a speech processor onto the taxpayer, rather than through private health insurance, by simply calling it a prosthesis?
Prospective consumers of further cochlear upgrades will have an overhead of approximately $3,500 per year per implanted person. If this expense is not compensated through private health insurance, most will find the technology unaffordable. The consequence of this will be that these people, for the most part, will be unemployed or unemployable with a concomitant increase in social security costs. Either way, the government, the taxpayer and—most importantly—the person with the deafness disability lose. It would appear that the government has created a smokescreen to hide the fact that it has capitulated to the private health insurance industry. I certainly hope not.
Finally, I turn to the issue of solutions that will keep cochlear implantees within the insurance bounds of private health insurance policy. I recall a few years ago the Commonwealth government introducing a system to compensate health insurers who had insurance risk exposure from having too many elderly clients. So I ask, in anticipation of the costs and the numbers of existing and potential cochlear implants candidates being established, that a similar system of cost spreading among private health insurers for those using cochlear implants also be considered. I condemn the committee's recommendation and support Mr Rudd's very worthy motion.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Cochlear Implants</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1
"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—Cochlear implants consist of three linked components: a microphone, placed behind the ear; a speech processor, which can be worn on the belt and which converts sound to electrical signals; and a surgically implanted receptor, which stimulates neurons in the cochlea. This is an Australian innovation and it is a marvel. There are figures which now show that 80 per cent of deaf people can get improvement from a cochlear implant, and children who are born deaf may be able to hear because of this technology. Cochlear speech processors are included in the 8,900 items listed on the prostheses schedule under the National Health Act. The government requires private health funds to pay 100 per cent of the cost of these items. Some items on the prostheses schedule cost thousands of dollars—several items cost more than $15,000 and one item costs $40,000.
What this motion is all about—and I believe this is an unnecessary motion—is the all too familiar scaremongering by members on the other side of the House. At present, private health insurance funds are required to pay for cochlear speech processors listed on the prostheses schedule. They will be required to pay for the cochlear speech processors for the foreseeable future. I find the motion by the member for Griffith puzzling. As technology has improved, some items that were an inpatient procedure are now an outpatient procedure. That is what we are actually debating today. What has happened is that procedures that were normally done in hospital, which were covered by private health insurance, are now done as outpatient procedures, which are not covered by private health insurance. Cochlear speech processors are one of these procedures. Private health insurance funds are only allowed to cover items which are provided in hospital. The reason the cochlear speech processors and other items have been listed for review is that the prostheses schedule is for items provided in hospital.
If the opposition are suggesting that they would like to see private health funds cover outpatient procedures, I am sure the government would welcome that. In 1998, the government introduced legislation to allow health funds to cover outpatient procedures; the Labor Party voted against that legislation. Instead of just scaremongering, if the opposition are concerned about continued access to cochlear speech processors by private health insurance funds, then they will support the reintroduction of a bill to allow private health insurance to cover outpatient procedures.
As previous speakers have said, at the moment there is a review into private health insurance regulation, which will include the topic of whether to fund these items. The Minister for Health and Ageing has said that no decision will be made, pending the outcome of this review. She has also said that children and young adults under 21 will automatically be covered by Australian Hearing Services. But more than that, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman has stated that, as the funds have always provided for cochlear speech processors, they should continue to do so. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman has committed to working with the funds to continue funding these procedures. The funds have also indicated that they are likely to keep them on. So, at the moment, this rests on the goodwill of the funds and also on the pressure coming from the government and the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. But, if you want to stop this sort of situation in the future, you should support our legislation, which allows for private health insurance to be used to cover outpatient procedures, because, as technology changes and as practice changes, that is what is happening. If the member for Griffith is serious about wanting private health insurance funds to continue to provide benefits to cover cochlear speech processors, he will support the government in allowing funds to cover outpatient procedures—or is he just scaremongering?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Cochlear Implants</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I am pleased to support the member for Griffith, and my other Labor colleagues, in speaking on this motion about cochlear implants. As someone who knows personally how disabling it is to suffer hearing problems, I have much sympathy for the deaf, and especially for young people who are deaf. As we have heard from others, the cochlear implant—or bionic ear, as it is popularly known—is an Australian invention. It is another example of Australian ingenuity which has the potential to assist thousands of people in the world. Unlike some other Australian inventions which have been ignored in this country, this invention was picked up and developed here—an Australian company dominates the market for its production. How ironic that we have an Australian invention, an Australian product and a market for the product but that we have a real problem in making the product affordable for those who want it.
There are a number of players involved in this issue: the government; Australian Hearing Services, which is funded by the government; Cochlear Ltd, who are the manufacturers; the private health industry; the Private Health Industry Medical Devices Expert Committee, which was appointed by the previous minister for health to assist with determining items for listing on the schedule for private health benefit funding of prostheses; and—everyone seems to have forgotten—those who are profoundly deaf, who benefit from the fitting and maintenance of cochlear implants.
It seems that there are real anomalies in the way that cochlear implants are treated by the various players. Australian Hearing Services provides them, but has limited funds provided by the government to do this and suggests people contact Cochlear Ltd or their private health fund. Cochlear Ltd advises people to lobby the government; private health funds also suggest lobbying the government. Meanwhile, the profoundly deaf are waiting for help, and you cannot blame them for thinking that they are being given the run-around. Imagine how distressing it is, especially for those who have young children, who cannot understand why they are unable to access the product that will make a difference to their lives.
Gayle and Gary Wharton wrote to me about the circumstances of their son Matthew. They wrote:
An apparent loophole in the current Schedule 5 legislation shouldn't be the reason why private health funds be allowed to reneg on their responsibilities.
They continue:
They—
that is, the government and the funds—
seem to be focusing on informing people that the upgrades/replacements will continue through Australian Hearing, but as you are no doubt aware, this ceases at the age of 21 and doesn't start again unless you are on an aged pension or a disability pension.
They go on to say:
I don't hear our Government making any mention of what happens to the cochlear implant recipients after the age of 21, or are they presuming that hearing impaired people won't be able to find a job and will go on a disability pension. Matthew, for one, can't wait to find a job and be independent. How independent can he hope to be, when on a 21 year old's wage, he'll have to be saving up for his next speech processor upgrade so he can hear better?
I sympathise with them. To reiterate the situation, earlier this year it seemed that private health companies were no longer required to reimburse recipients of these implants for the cost of upgrading or replacing their speech processors which are worn externally. Recipients who were privately insured could claim the cost of a new processor but not the cost of upgrades or replacements. This is where a big problem arises. The processors need to be upgraded or replaced after a certain time. The initial processors do not last forever. To make it even more complicated, it would seem that the reason given for why the upgrades or replacements were not to be covered was that they did not fit the legislative definition of what should be supported. That is hardly surprising when you consider that the legislation predates the technology of cochlear implants. I am sure it was not the intention of the drafters of the original legislation that such devices would not be supported.
Fortunately, this unsatisfactory situation has been recognised. I am pleased to note that the current minister for health has deferred reaching a decision on whether speech processors are to be removed from the list of items for which benefits are payable. I can only hope that this is a good sign but, after hearing what the previous government speaker said, I am not quite sure about that. I hope that the minister is listening to the needs of the cochlear implant community and that she will see that the replacement processors remain on the ancillary tables of the private health funds for the sake of the profoundly deaf, and especially children, who hope that they will be able to progress through life and work with the ability to hear. I hope that we have heard what those children have had to say today and that they will be able to get some relief soon.

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—I would like to thank the honourable member for Griffith for raising an extremely important issue of the status of speech processors for cochlear implants and the possible delisting of processors from schedule 5. In April 2001 the Private Health Insurance Medical Devices Expert Committee, PHIMDEC, recommended the removal of replacement speech processors from schedule 5 of the National Health Act 1953. The removal of replacement speech processors from schedule 5 will allow private health insurance companies to cease reimbursement to the recipients of cochlear implants for the cost of upgrading or replacing their externally worn speech processors. It should be noted that Cochlear Ltd's new processor is not listed because it has not yet been assessed. The cost of these speech processors can be up to $8,000. Children under 21 years of age who are not privately insured can access the replacement speech processors through Australian Hearing Services, who provide replacement processors free of charge. Australian Hearing Services are funded for $1.4 million over four years to 2004-05. They have a large pool of funds up to $28 million that they can direct by internal decision making. The $1.4 million is allocated to fund upgrades and damaged or lost processors. 
Australian Hearing Services anticipate increased demand for their free service in the event of the removal of replacements from the schedule. PHIMDEC has based its possible withdrawal on targeting prosthetic items in the schedule that would not be implanted during an episode of hospital treatment. These speech processors are replaced in an outpatients setting, whereas the initial processor is provided as part of the surgical in-patient management and would normally be covered by state or private funds. As previous speakers have said, this discussion has been deferred pending further negotiations. No action will be undertaken until this review is completed, and certainly no change will occur before February 2003. The Ombudsman, as mentioned, vows to pursue the funds to keep processors on their list of prosthetic items. I am hoping that this and other pressures on the funds will assist them in seeing the wisdom of not deleting the processors from the list of approved prosthetic items. There are approximately 1,000 cochlear implant recipients under the age of 21 who would be covered regardless of what the funds decide.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—The Minister for Employment Services answers all criticisms of the Job Network by saying it is a work in progress. It is not. It is an established government program that, after five years, is showing fatigue—and, I must say, a considerable amount of fatigue, with a lot of intensive assistance clients going through it for the second, third and fourth times without getting satisfactory outcomes. The reason they are not getting satisfactory outcomes is that the program has serious structural and policy defects. These defects were exposed in the draft report of the independent inquiry into the Job Network conducted by the Productivity Commission. 
The Job Network is a creation of the Howard government and, after five years, the government is accountable for these failings. As a result of the draft report of the Productivity Commission, the government has been forced to make some modifications to the Job Network for the next round of contracts. These were announced in the budget. As is typical of the Howard government's approach to policy development, these changes were announced in advance of the completion of the Productivity Commission's final report, which was handed to the government on 3 June. But three weeks later we are still waiting for its release. The main defects exposed by the Productivity Commission relate to the incentives structure provided by the government to Job Network providers in their contracts. The principal defect in those incentives structures under the current contract is the high outcome payments for intensive assistance.
A Job Network provider receives a commencement fee of about $2,122 for each client referred to them. If they can place that job seeker in employment that lasts 13 weeks, the Job Network provider receives an interim outcome payment of $4,953. If the job lasts for 26 weeks, the Job Network provider receives a final outcome payment of $2,144. The government's theory was that Job Network providers would take financial risks to achieve outcome payments by spending significant amounts of money to make eligible job seekers job ready. With $9,219 per job seeker guaranteed or in prospect, superficially that might have seemed likely. But, not surprisingly, Job Network providers in a competitive environment focus on achieving as many of those $4,953 interim outcome payments as they can at the least cost. The consequence is what the Productivity Commission refers to as `parking'. As the commission said:
There is evidence that a substantial proportion of job seekers are `parked'—that is, receive a minimal level of service. This is a problem, as active participation by the job seeker in job search or training appears to be positively correlated with service levels.
Job Network providers quickly identify the job seekers who are most disadvantaged and give them the least service. This is the antithesis of what intensive assistance is supposed to do. Instead, the government's incentive structure encourages Job Network providers to focus upon what the Productivity Commission calls `creaming'—that is, they `only handle job seekers for whom a job can be found easily and cheaply'. The potential return on an intensive assistance client who is already job ready, as many are, is around $9,000. Job Network providers can achieve 77 per cent of that potential with the interim outcome for a 13-week placement. Hence, the rather commercial promotional schemes for employers such as Mission Employment's flat screen TVs, DVDs and golf clubs as rewards for keeping a job seeker in work up to the point of the interim outcome payment.
On the other hand, the incentives for achieving secondary outcomes, such as placing a disadvantaged job seeker in training, are much smaller. The commencement fee of $2,122 is the same but both the interim and final outcome payments are each only $536. The total return for assisting a disadvantaged job seeker who is unlikely to find work is only $3,195. This is the mismatch between needs and price signals. The less assistance the job seeker needs, the higher the reward for the Job Network provider. The more disadvantaged the job seeker and the more they need, the lower the reward. Obviously, some Job Network providers provide disadvantaged job seekers with more than a minimal level of service, but there is no doubt that the incentive structure provided in Job Network contracts does not encourage this. The disadvantaged get parked; the job ready provide the cream.
Publicly, the Minister for Employment Services prefers to ignore the Productivity Commission's findings. Instead he likes to make a financial comparison between the cost of the Job Network and the Working Nation program it replaced. According to the government's own submission to the independent review of Job Network, it is an explicit intention of government `to return labour market assistance expenditure to pre-Working Nation levels'. What does that mean? The government has certainly cut spending on labour market programs, averaging expenditure of $1.35 billion per year over its first four years compared to an average annual expenditure of $3.7 billion over the first two years of Working Nation. I do not think either the Howard government or the opposition should disagree on the fact that Labor gave a higher priority to active labour market programs.
The comparisons the Minister for Employment Services likes to make are between the average cost per job seeker under the two sets of programs because they have declined under the Job Network. The minister's own departmental submission to the independent review of Job Network provides a useful comparison between intensive assistance and Working Nation. According to these figures, the average cost of getting a job seeker off benefits on Working Nation was $35,100 compared with $22,010 on intensive assistance. The average cost per employment outcome was $12,075 on Working Nation and $6,200 on intensive assistance. The average cost per participant on Working Nation was $3,320 and $2,260 on intensive assistance. But while intensive assistance is cheaper than the Working Nation program it replaced, this is a set of comparisons that requires qualification. In particular, unlike intensive assistance, Working Nation guaranteed every eligible job seeker a place in either a training program or a work placement with a wage subsidy. A large part of the cost differential between Working Nation and intensive assistance was that Working Nation gave every long-term unemployed person real assistance to get a job; there was no `parking'.
The changes to the Job Network address the `parking' problem with the job seeker account. This is intended to create the impression that job seekers will be guaranteed a level of support. The problem is that the provider's job seeker account will only be credited with, firstly, $11 and then $953 to pay for assistance for each eligible job seeker. That is recognition that job seekers are not even getting a minimal level of assistance under the current contract. Nor is any job seeker guaranteed access to even that minimal level of assistance under the new arrangements. The provider can pool that money and spend more on one job seeker and none on another. So much for the proposed so-called service guarantee. The job seeker account simply contains some money the provider must spend on eligible types of assistance for some job seekers or return it to the government.
The definition of eligible expenditure is broad— for example, Mission Employment's promotion giving golf clubs and television sets to employers to place a job ready applicant could be paid for out of a provider's job seeker account. At the same time, a disadvantaged job seeker needing some specific training to make them job ready might get no support through the job seeker account. Obviously, but in contradiction of current government policy, incentives to employers ought to be paid out of outcome fees and the use of job seeker account money for expensive gifts to employers ought to be prohibited.
More generally, the incentive structure has not been changed sufficiently to guarantee disadvantaged job seekers the support they need. Under the new arrangements we will not see an end to the problems of `parking' and `creaming'. There needs to be a real rebalancing of the incentive structure in Job Network contracts. The level of risk for providers in spending on support for the most disadvantaged unemployed needs to be reduced so that they will be guaranteed the kind of help they need to make them job ready.
Obviously, if the risk is reduced, the rewards—currently taken as profit from creaming—must also be reduced. At the moment, the taxpayers' employment services dollar is being used inefficiently. Large profits are taken by some providers for placing people who need little assistance. Those scarce dollars are not being spent on the disadvantaged—those whom the program is supposed to have been designed to help. The providers who are not making supernormal profits because they are providing an appropriate level of assistance to disadvantaged job seekers would not be adversely affected by such a rebalancing of risk and reward.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—In rising to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002, I note that we will be moving a second reading amendment and also amendments in detail in the committee stage of the bill. In his second reading speech on presenting the bill, the minister acknowledged the significance of enterprise negotiation. That phenomenon has been vitally important—and, in fairness to the minister, I think he recognises that—in terms of Australia's current economic position. The evolution of enterprise negotiations arose firstly very much under the encouragement of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. As part of the accord process for trade unions to secure wage rises on behalf of their members, they had to convince the commission that they had provided enough productivity offsets by way of work practice changes, award restructuring or other productivity improvements during the various processes of the accord and national wage case decisions which reflected those outcomes.
I can give first-hand account that on numerous occasions I appeared in those proceedings and the parties were literally sent away because the commission was not satisfied that the productivity offsets justified the wage increase. In other words, that process itself instilled in the parties the recognition that productivity improvements and the development of best practice production and management techniques were essential not only from the point of view of simply self-interest in obtaining higher wages but also from the point of view of developing Australian industry. Indeed, many trade unions and employers took work force representatives overseas with them to see what was happening in other countries and to show managers and work forces the grade they had to play in to compete in what was becoming, and what is certainly now very much here, a global marketplace.
That period of time saw a significant education, if you like, of both Australian management and the Australian work force as to the standard and the pace of the game that we had to play, in terms of both quality and flexibility. By way of analogy, it is like watching a modern game of rugby league compared to a game 15 years ago. It is much faster, much more flexible and in many ways far more skilled. That is the level of the game. What is frequently overlooked by this government are those tremendous improvements in productivity techniques, flexibility and generally the development of best practice models which, if not implemented with the consent of the trade union movement, in many instances were implemented as a result of the initiatives of the trade union movement in going along to workplaces and saying, `In order to obtain these second-tier increases, we've got to improve productivity. This is what is being done in other enterprises. How about sitting down with our members to work through whether this is appropriate for your enterprise?'
There is no doubt that that whole process, the evolution of that process, brought a great number of businesses from a system where they were producing for a domestic, fragmented market to a sophisticated model where they are producing for the rest of the world. We have heard today in debates, for instance, about the car industry. Fifteen years ago it was an industry under real stress, with tariff walls essential to protect us from going under in the face of international competition. We are now very much competing on that first-grade field, on the international field, and we are doing very well, if not winning. We are exporting about $7 billion a year in the automotive industry—the automotive industry being topical, of course, because of recent debates and the current industrial relations events occurring with so many enterprise agreements coming up for renewal on the one hand and, on the other hand, the Productivity Commission looking at the future assistance which the industry should receive, and I hope will receive, from the government.
The Labor Party very much supported the development of enterprise negotiations. I think it is fair to say we were stewards of that change till we got to 1993, when the parties themselves were able to negotiate enterprise agreements without arbitrated outcomes through the commission. That was the final step in the equation. Quite frankly, I think it is unfair of this government not to acknowledge the tremendous contribution that Australian workers have made to the development of the productivity of this nation. When I say Australian workers, I mean Australian workers and their elected representatives. It is regrettable and offensive to see that the government are constantly playing the political card of bashing the trade unions. Why do they do it? Because historically and in actuality trade unions are affiliated with the Labor Party. So attacking the trade union movement generally is seen as attacking the Labor Party. We are big enough and tough enough to cop attacks on our own. The member for Banks beside me is well-equipped indeed to counterthrust against any attack on him, and I think the frontbench are also quite prepared to accept and return political attack, but what is inexcusable is the denigration—for the purpose of what is literally a propaganda campaign—of trade unions, which are of course made up of Australian workers and their elected representatives.
Having said that, as I have said publicly on a number of occasions there is a small minority of trade unionists who I believe have not always acted in the interests of their members or in the national interest. But you do not approach your response to an industrial relations framework on the basis of the activities of a minuscule minority of people. That is my criticism of the government's approach. They are focusing on the activities of that minuscule minority for the purpose of blowing up disputation rather than developing systems that harness the tremendously constructive contribution that Australian workers, and Australian workers through their elected representatives, have made to this whole concept of enterprise negotiations. 
I give that introduction to put into context the position which the Australian Labor Party take in response to the bill, which is titled the `genuine bargaining' bill. The bill essentially recycles, if you like, two earlier proposals introduced in the House and the Senate in 1999 and 2000. It must be acknowledged that this bill is a more moderate version of those earlier proposals, but nonetheless we believe it is misguided and, on that basis, we will be opposing it. In particular, we think it is misguided because it focuses on blocking activity rather than facilitating genuine bargaining through empowering the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to make orders and give directions to parties to facilitate enterprise bargaining in good faith. As I say, we strongly support enterprise bargaining but we take a much broader approach rather than this one, which we believe is a ham-fisted response.
In particular, there is a whole range of actions that are required before protected industrial action can occur. There have to be resolutions of the relevant officials of the union, appropriate notice provisions and attempts to negotiate. The trouble is that when the system breaks down—and sometimes it can, it must be conceded—those procedures are seen more as rituals rather than activities of substance. We want to empower the commission to enable them to direct parties to negotiate in good faith so that they insist on each of these being activities of substance and not simply as part of a ritual. We do not want negotiations getting to the stage of the laws of the jungle where both sides kick into each other—with the unions taking industrial action, on the one hand, or employers embarking on lockouts in other regrettable instances, on the other hand. We say that the role of the umpire is a fundamental role and one which we will continue to press for. Indeed, we believe that, when the expertise of the commission is used by giving it a role as a facilitator of good faith bargaining, you are more likely to get agreements more quickly and more far-reaching agreements. 
The government keep on saying they want to take third parties out of the enterprise relationship—taking third parties out of the relationship between employees and employers is their philosophy. To do so, however, they fail to appreciate the tremendously constructive role that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has played and can still continue to play even in these more flexible times of enterprise negotiations. There are two excellent recent examples. One involved BHP Western Port where there had been 23 days of stoppage before the commission became involved, and the matter was resolved within 24 hours of that occurring. The minister referred to the fact that common-law proceedings had been commenced. I think it is fair to say that the gateway, at least, for those common-law-proceedings was a good five days before that. That is not consistent with the actual events that occurred. Clearly, the commission played a very constructive role in the resolution of that dispute.
Another example is the resolution—or, at least, a means to the resolution—of a potentially crippling dispute in the airline industry involving air traffic controllers. Again, the good offices of the commission were able to prevail upon the parties to agree to a timetable of negotiations and a method for resolving those by way of arbitration at the end of it if no outcome was achieved. Because of the absence of powers of the commission to direct parties to negotiate in good faith, they were only able to achieve that by prevailing upon the good faith of the parties. Again, that was after there had already been actual industrial disputation, which caused quite significant disruption, I recall, for one day about a month ago to the airline industry. So the opposition will be moving amendments in consideration in detail with a view to restoring the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to direct parties to negotiate in good faith.
But talking about the actual provisions of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002, for instance, proposed section 170MW(2A), as the explanatory memorandum states, purports to provide `guidance' to the commission as to how they should approach enterprise negotiations when there is a commonality of claims across an industry. In fact, they refer to a significant decision of Justice Munro in the metals case of 2000. That case involved a situation where generally across the metal industry a number of enterprise agreements were terminating at the same time—a situation which we are now coming up to in 2002.
But, if you read that decision, guidance is not what is needed. Justice Munro was clearly able to set out what he regarded as factors indicating whether a party was genuinely negotiating. As we keep repeating, what is needed is the empowerment of the commission to enable the commission to be a facilitator to direct parties to negotiate in good faith. In fact, in that metals case Justice Munro used current section 170MW(1) to terminate a bargaining period of 33 employees because he was not satisfied that they were actually bargaining in good faith in respect of that enterprise. It is worth referring to the key finding of Justice Munro where he said:
Does it follow that, if in truth the respondent negotiator is trying to secure agreement with all, or an entire class of negotiating parties in an industry—all or none—the respondent negotiating party is not genuinely trying to reach agreement with any individual negotiating party in the industry or class? In my view, it does. But in a particular case, a finding to that effect is dependent upon matters of fact and degree.
In other words, there is no black and white prescription, as this legislation is attempting to impose. In explaining what he meant by `fact and degree', he said:
Such questions of fact and degree obviously need to be answered by reference to evidence and details of particular facts. The more the negotiation conduct can be categorised as evidencing a refusal to allow agreement other than on an all or none basis, the greater the likelihood that it should be found to fail the genuinely try to reach agreement with the other negotiator test. However, there are variations and permutation of demands, conduct, and character of negotiating parties that must be assessed.
So he approached it in a pragmatic way, looking at what was actually occurring—not on the basis of any ideological assumptions but on the basis of a genuine balance. Indeed, the government itself has now withdrawn reference in the legislation to pattern bargaining, but it is still used in the debate. That is, again, a flawed assumption. There will be many industries where a degree of commonality is essential from the point of view of practicality for all involved. Good examples would be in the retail grocery industry, in the retail hardware industry and, indeed, in respect of nursing homes. A commonality of enterprise negotiations will be necessary and, if you take the nursing home industry, probably desirable so that the standard of care provided to senior citizens in nursing homes is not dependent upon nursing homes trying to undercut or achieve productivity outcomes by reducing the terms and conditions of their professional staff. The fact that there is a commonality of bargaining does not mean that there is an absence of bargaining in good faith. That is the flaw, we believe, of the government's legislation. Indeed, Justice Munro, in the case to which I have referred, commented on that. As he said:
A common set of demands for conditions of employment, or for timing of negotiating rounds and outcomes is not sufficient in itself to establish that a negotiating party is not genuinely trying to reach agreement with the counterpart party. I do not use the expression pattern to describe such demands. The notion of pattern demands or pattern bargaining lacks precision. It also has a partisan pejorative content.
So he was alive to this concept, this expression, used by the government in trying to condemn that process. He noted that the process of attempting to obtain commonality of outcomes was quite frequently used from the employer's perspective as much as from the trade union perspective and you could not adopt this blanket assumption that this legislation presumes. Indeed, if you look at how the federal government itself approaches negotiations you will see there is very much a pattern to what the government does in this regard. As the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee found in its October 2000 report:
Rhetoric about the decentralised environment of the Workplace Relations Act in which agency heads have flexibility to negotiate terms and conditions to suit their workplace has been misleading. The reality is that, while agencies have greatly increased flexibility, the Government is the ultimate employer and has in place policy parameters and guidelines to protect its policy interests.
So it is quite hypocritical of the government to condemn this concept of a commonality of processes in circumstances where it is still doing that. Indeed, by way of policy parameters and guidelines, which one would think are essential for the orderly administration of the Public Service, it is engaging in that very process. An example is an edict from the minister's department on 7 June 2002 which revised the government's policy in respect of retrospective increases in remuneration for public servants. The policy now dictates that, other than in exceptional circumstances, pay increases are to apply prospectively. That is an edict that applies to negotiations which will take place, but that is a commonality. We can understand why the government may well give that edict, but, again, you cannot say that because that edict has been given the government must necessarily be not bargaining in good faith. You need much more precision to look at the facts, as Justice Munro said in his decision. The fact that this government has taken such a ham-fisted approach, we believe, prevents that occurring.
Another example is the way in which the government approaches negotiations for Australian workplace agreements within the department. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee recently revealed that when Senator Sherry asked the departmental representative, Dr Boxall:
Has the department begun negotiations with individual employees or will it be commencing negotiations with individual employees about the terms of their AWA?
Dr Boxall—We have already processed some AWAs. So that you have a complete picture, all the AWAs in the department, which were in place before I arrived, expire on 30 June so the department faces quite a large task, because not only do the certified agreements expire on 30 June, so do all the AWAs currently in place.
Senator Sherry—It sounds like pattern bargaining to me. They all come out at the one time.
Dr Boxall—It is a statement of fact.
It is, quite clearly, a statement of fact that there will be a commonality of policies in place. There will be a commonality of expiration dates. That in itself does not mean there is an absence of good faith bargaining. You need to be much more precise in determining that. As I have indicated, Justice Munro gave guidance and indicated that the commission is quite capable of determining that. The commission needs the ability to direct parties to negotiate in good faith. In other words, it needs to be empowered.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—In the short time that I have left I should focus some little time on the opposition's counterproposal, if you like, to what the government is talking about. Before doing so I should note that one of the proposals of the government is to provide for cooling-off periods as set out in section 170MWB. Indeed, I note that the Australian Industry Group has recently called for cooling-off periods and for the commission, in imposing a cooling-off period, to have regard to how third parties would be affected by industrial action. We see the reasoning in trying to limit the damaging effects of industrial disputation. Indeed, to the point where we are concerned that those proposals presuppose the occurrence of industrial action, what we would like to see instituted is a system where the commission literally is empowered to get amongst the processes to prevent that industrial disputation arising in the first place.
Our concern is also that simply directing a cooling-off period without any requirement being imposed on the parties during that cooling-off period as to how they should conduct themselves and, indeed, not act to the prejudice of either of the respective parties that are limited by that very order necessarily requires the commission to have a role in how those negotiations will take place. For that reason we are proposing, as an amendment to this bill, re-empowering the commission to direct parties to negotiate in good faith—to actually get into the picture before disputation occurs. Those factors from a number of jurisdictions that are commonly adopted are: a requirement that parties agree to meet face to face; that they attend meetings that have been organised; that they comply with negotiating procedures that have been agreed to; that, subject to confidentiality provisions, they disclose relevant information to allow the negotiations to be informed; that they state their position on various issues; that they explain their position on issues; that they consider and respond to proposals made by the other side; and, of course, that they adhere to commitments given to the other negotiating party as to how they would progress matters. They are all important issues.
We also propose in our amendments that a requirement be included that the parties dedicate sufficient resources and personnel to ensure that genuine bargaining occurs. From the point of view of the employer, that is obvious. Indeed, from the point of view of an industry-wide approach, clearly just having a scattergun approach without the capacity for unions to even send officers to a particular enterprise would not be, in our view, genuine bargaining because of the inability to achieve an agreement with the resources that are applied. We also propose giving the commission powers to ensure that a negotiating party negotiates with another party and that they do so in good faith, and to make orders in respect of the efficient conduct of those negotiations.
I will explain these amendments during the consideration in detail stage of the bill, but at this stage I wish to move a second reading amendment. I move:
That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
`whilst not denying the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:
(1)	unreasonably emasculating the powers of the AIRC to resolve industrial disputes in the interests of the parties;
(2)	interfering with the AIRC's discretion to deal with industrial disputes in the most appropriate way; and
(3)	failing to put forward constructive proposals to enable the Commission to direct parties to bargain in good faith'.
The emphasis is against the blocking approach that this government is taking because of its ideological position. Instead, we propose an empowering approach where the commission is actually given powers to get amongst the procedures and to use its expertise to assist and facilitate the parties in reaching an agreement in respect of the particular enterprise concerned. Clearly, the commission has expertise, and it should be recognised as having a legitimate role, which this government is not doing. (Time expired)

—I second the amendment.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—It is my pleasure this evening to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002. This bill sets out to address the threat to jobs in this country caused by pattern bargaining campaigns instituted generally by militant rogue unions. For this reason there need to be better guidelines and more direction placed in this legislation so that the sort of practice where workers are affected to the extent that they are through the campaigns of these unions today cannot continue.
Every time I get on my feet in an industrial relations exercise, I must reiterate that the Labor Party does not stand for the workers; it stands for the elite and the vested interests of its party. It does not represent the workers of this country; it uses them as fodder for its own special interests. It is not interested in the general good of the workers in this country. If it were it would be making sure that, for the greater good of workers in this country, workers were paid more. In trying to take away enterprise bargaining from individual workers in the work force it is trying to take away just that—enterprise, where you can actually do better for yourself.
Let us put this in context and make the linkages which must always be made in case people in the great wide expanses out there do not understand the connection. As we know, the unions have at least 60 per cent control over the preselections of the members of the Labor Party who are placed in this House. Yet, as reported in the Australian the other day, only something like 19 per cent of people in this country are members of a union. In 1986, 46 per cent of the work force belonged to a union. You have to ask yourself: why has this fallen so dramatically between 1986 and 2002? It is because they have done such a poor job of representing the workers. They have done such a poor job of representing the workers that the workers themselves have said, `We don't need this; we can do better on our own. The coalition government has given us some tools to get a better deal for ourselves, so this is what we intend to do.' So they seek enterprise bargaining in their individual workplace agreements. 
The Labor Party do not want this, and their union mates do not want this either. They tell Labor members, `We put you here, and you had better make sure we get our agenda up or else you won't stay—we will replace you with somebody more compliant.' I will not go much further into the backgrounds and work histories of members in this House, but we do know that the vast majority of them have worked in a union organisation. So at the end of the day, this is all about the unions saying to their people in this House, who they control, `You make sure this doesn't happen, because if it does we will lose control of the work force and we do not want that to happen.' In a recent Internet survey, out of the 19 per cent of people in the work force who are members of a union today, 51 per cent of the respondents said that they would not vote Labor in any case. Here we see a further delusion about the sort of representation these people are trying to bring to the House.
I will now address some of the detail of this bill. Genuine bargaining to get a better deal really should happen in the work force, but it is not happening. This is because the union hierarchy in this country, with the support of the Labor Party, do not want people going off on little sorties of their own, because that would ultimately lead to the unions not being able to control the work force. During discussion of a previous bill here recently, the member for Brisbane interjected something like, `What are you talking about? You say only 19 per cent of the people in the work force are members of a union. How can that stop a country? How can that hold anyone up?' It can do so very easily, as we have seen just recently. If you stop the steel components going to a car yard, or stop the flight controllers at Sydney airport or other airports, you stop the whole industry. So let us not be fooled about what a small component of the work force can do to the whole work force. This is about levering upaction so that the Labor Party can get their own way on these bills.
The main parts of this bill will force unions to try to reach genuine agreements with employers before they can strike—and particularly before they can start pattern bargainingexercises—and will help the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to order cooling-off periods where there is a protracted dispute. What is the matter with legislation that tries to get people to produce better outcomes—that tries to get people to genuinely reach agreement? The unions that oppose this bill forget that many people in the work force now are subcontractors employing one or two people or are self-employed. If these people go to a work site and negotiate a better deal because they are more productive and have the opportunity to work longer hours without all the conditions that go with that just to get the job done and make sure that at the end of the day they can move on to their next job or get a success fee for having finished earlier, what is the matter with that? They are getting a better deal.
A militant union, the CFMEU, is out of control in the building industry in Perth. It is run by the great Kevin Reynolds,who said at the weekend that the member for Hotham was the worst opposition leader that he had seen. By the way—this is just an aside, but it should be widely known—Laurie Oakes on the morning show the other day said that this is the worst opposition he has seen in 40 years. What is the matter with trying to get a better deal for individuals in the work force? Strikes do cost jobs. The CFMEU—the rogue union in Perth—and Joe McDonald quite willingly say, `We are militant and we will take any measures we can to get our way.' 
The Cole royal commissionin Perth recently found some very bad workplaces in terms of intimidation, threats and lock-outs—`no ticket, no start'. These sorts of leverage arrangements used by unions to try to get their own way on work sites in the building industry are a disgrace. The opposition would say, `The Industrial Relations Commission can address all this.' But we have seen recently that they do not. The Industrial Relations Commission has put orders on companies—for example, in the recent strike by the car workers which included BHP moving steel from its yards—and the unions have ignored the commission. They have blatantly thumbed their noses at the Industrial Relations Commission and said, `We are not going to follow your directive. You can fine us if you like et cetera.' Basically they have given the middle-finger salute, which is just inappropriate in these circumstances. That is how weak and ineffectual the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has become. Even though it could take measures to enforce orders, it does not.
We are saying that there need to be stronger legislation and stronger measures to ensure that the amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 go ahead. The bill will guide the IRC when it considers whether a party is genuinely trying to reach agreement with other negotiating parties, particularly in cases involving, as I have said, pattern bargaining. The bill will also add to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and empower the commission to make orders preventing the initiation of a new bargaining period or attaching conditions to any such bargaining period where a bargaining period has been withdrawn. In addition, the amendment will empower the commission to order cooling-off periods in respect of protected industrial action to facilitate resolution of issues in dispute. That is what the bill aims to achieve.
The Australian Labor Party cannot deny that when they were last in government they limited the right to strike. Strikes were intended as a means of last resort to reinforce a genuine claim for wages and working conditions—one thing in government, another thing in opposition. I thought the flip-flop Mr Beazley had gone, but no, we are back; we are being opportunistic. As is described here on a daily basis, we have cheapjack opportunism just for the sake of opposing. We have seen that with a raft of bills, whether they relate to pharmaceutical benefits or disability services. The public are getting sick of it. Out in the electorate they say to me: `What are these people doing? They didn't win the last election. They don't want to see this country go forward, be more productive and work more efficiently. They're just going to oppose you at every step of the way. They really don't care about the consequences. In this case they really don't care about the workers, because if they did they would allow them to have individual workplace agreements whereby they can bargain for a better deal.'
The unions of this country are hell-bent on extending the right to strike, and that is why the Australian Council of Trade Unions opposes this bill. I do not disagree with the right to strike in the right circumstances, but the right to strike in relation to a genuine bargaining exercise involves their putting on bogus strikes to win a political and philosophical argument under the guise of things like safety. How many times do you hear them argue a case and then, when they are not winning, suddenly say: `It's a safety issue now; everybody out the gate and off the site. We're not winning and we'll find some way of arguing a safety issue.' For example, recently in Perth, in my home state, it was very coincidental that three or four cranes on work sites in the CBD suddenly toppled over. The Australian Labor Party, through the unions, were saying: `Shock, horror! Look at all this! What's going on? These crane companies are a disgrace. There is a safety problem here. The crane drivers are a problem.' Guess what happened? When it was realised that a union front trained the crane drivers, they suddenly stopped. That was one of the bogus safety exercises that they went through to win a political point on the work site.
The unions claim that the bill will deny workers the right to strike. It will not do so, but it will put a serious dent in the side of irresponsible campaigns like the AMWU's so-called Campaign 2000 and Campaign 2003. I heard the member for Barton say, `Look, this is terrible because this legislation really only aims at a very small percentage of ratbags in the industry.' The whole industry is basically a ratbag. It is very unproductive. We have seen investment and jobs associated with it dry up, and that is costing progress in that industry. The member for Barton says, `It is overkill because we are really hitting just a small percentage of people.' That is quite bizarre, because it is like saying, `We won't have any laws on the road now because we will only target those bad speeding drivers and the people who do not do the right thing on the road, so why not cancel most road rules because they apply only to the rotten few?' It just does not gel—it just does not have any resonance. The member for Barton is a good fellow and so on but we know that he is reluctantly in here endeavouring to hold up his end with this argument because he is one of the few opposition members who do not have a great union pedigree.
Another aspect is that the unions, particularly the AMWU, advocate pattern bargaining because it gives them control over entire industries. They do not want to control the workers they have in an industry—that is, the small percentage of people who belong to a union; they want to create pattern bargaining to control a whole industry. We now need to address the bargaining fees that unions even want to charge non-union workers. It does not apply only to registered members of a union; they want to control everyone on the work site whether or not they are union members. It is control-freak stuff. We know that the AMWU's web site declares that it is pursuing an industry-wide agreement for all manufacturing workers, not just the ones who belong to that union. We know that the great old Australian-born Dougie Cameron and Craig Johnston of the AMWU have made it clear that it is their intent to use pattern bargaining to end enterprise bargaining within the manufacturing industry. They actually want to end it. They do not want it to go any further. They cannot have a dual system or a compliance system. They want to end it totally. In fact, Craig Johnston, the chief policy officer of the Labor Party and a member of the Victorian branch of the AMWU, cannot be trusted with the sort of power the unions are seeking with the blessing of the ALP.
In the past year alone, members of this branch of the union have held out on paying a $20,000 contempt of court fine for holding illegal stop-work meetings. This fine was eventually paid by an anonymous businessman. That poor old businessman was probably blackmailed into paying it because he wanted his job finished. This branch of the union has been the subject of allegations over two run-throughs causing several hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage to two Melbourne businesses—in other words, standover tactics by these thugs.
Craig Johnston was seen running through Parliament House in the 1996 riot. He has been publicly rebuked by the Victorian Premier, Steve Bracks, who realises that the AMWU are driving investment and jobs from his state. Last year, Premier Bracks wrote to Doug Cameron complaining of allegations of violence, property damage, physical assault and intimidation against employees, employers and even fellow union officials. We also have reports from employers that some AMWU officials do not comply with the industrial agreements and understandings once they have been entered into. Where is the genuine bargaining there? It is nonexistent. These provisions have to be brought in to give greater strength and direction to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
These thugs are writing the ALP policy. They are the ALP's think tank. What is the connection between Johnston and Darren Nelson, the Assistant Secretary to the AMWU in Victoria? Over the past six years, the AMWU has donated over $3 million to the Australian Labor Party. It's not bad, is it! I would not mind some of that for my election campaigns! The AMWU have made it clear what they expect in return. They do not give away money for nothing; they expect some sort of compliance in return.
The Australian of 27 October last year reported that Mr Cameron would not rule out disaffiliation from Labor as a result of the review—again, a bit of leverage and blackmail if they did not get their own way. Five days after Doug Cameron's threats—after the Leader of the Opposition's closed-door confessional meeting with the ACTU—Cameron proudly declared, `I am more relaxed after a commitment that Labor will not go down the path of the Blair-ite third way agenda.' In other words, he got his deal. He threatened the Leader of the Opposition into it and eventually won the day. You pay the piper. That is what is happening in this case.
This bill endeavours to address the trade union campaigns of industrial action where a union relies on the protected action provisions of the Workplace Relations Act in support of industry-wide pattern claims. This weakens the focus on enterprise bargaining and empowers unions to achieve common outcomes with regard to local productivity arrangements. Local productivity arrangements are good for everybody: they are good for this country, they are good for the national interest and they are good for individuals' wages.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 ought to be seen by the Australian electorate and by working people, whether or not they be unionists, for exactly what it is. This is the Howard government's latest attempt to drive the boot into Australian workers. I must reflect a little on the contribution of the member for Canning. He went through what he saw as a litany of grievances against the AMWU and other trade unions in this country. I encourage the honourable member to reflect on the contribution and the record of his own government.
Let us pause for a minute and reflect on the Howard government's industrial relations record. The honourable member for Canning obviously does not see anything wrong with training mercenaries in a foreign country to come back to Australia to engage in thuggery on the Australian waterfront—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: the member for Corio is blatantly bringing the issue of mercenaries before this House, which has nothing to do with this bill. He draws a very long bow to try to extrapolate it. It is a stunt. He should address the detail of the bill, which is genuine bargaining.
 (Mr Hawker)—Order! I am sure the honourable member will come to the bill.
—I have seen some precious little things in this parliament, but the member for Canning takes the cake. He has just spent about 10 minutes of his own speech time talking about violence in the trade union movement—he talked about thuggery and violence in the trade union movement—yet when I get up in this place to point out to the Australian people and to the member for Canning that his own government was involved in training mercenaries to break a strike against some of the workers—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
—Here he is: the precious little thing is on his feet again. Is he a sook or what!
—I find the language inappropriate. Besides that, he must not mislead the House by saying the government trained mercenaries. It is not true, and he knows it not to be true.
—Order! There is no point of order.
—If the honourable member is so precious about the Howard government's training of foreign mercenaries and the sooling of Dobermans on the wharves in Melbourne against members of the Maritime Union, I am quite happy to accommodate the tears that the honourable member for Canning is shedding on this occasion. But let it show on the Hansard record that the member got up here, drove the boot into the AMWU and talked about thuggery and violence yet the moment I got on my feet to point out the thuggery and violence associated with previous Howard government actions on the Australian waterfront the honourable member got a bit precious.
But I am quite happy to move on to the contents of this bill. This Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 is simply the latest instalment of the Howard government's attempt to get at the union movement in this country. Every worker in Australia, be they a union member or be they not, will see this for what it is: another attempt by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to engage through the legal process the pursuit of their agenda, which is simply to get at Australian workers.
I take particular exception to the reference to the federal secretary of the AMWU by the honourable member for Canning, who has now left the House. You do not have to come into this House and talk in disparaging tones about one of your political opponents. Doug Cameron happens to be an elected official of one of the largest groupings of workers in this country, and I think he deserves a little more respect for the position that he holds than what the minions on the Howard backbench give him.
—What about the views of the frontbench?
—The honourable minister who is interjecting talks about the views of the members of the frontbench. We know that, because it is enshrined in this legislation—this rather pernicious piece of legislation—designed to get at Australian workers yet again. Can I take you back to the Prime Minister, because we know that this particular legislation comes from the Prime Minister himself. The Prime Minister has three major elements of his own personal political agenda, which he has pursued since he came into the federal parliament. He is not the father of the House—I do believe that is now the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs—but of course the Prime Minister has been here for quite a long time. If you want a very simple explanation of the Prime Minister's political agenda, it falls into three categories: the first is the GST, which he wanted to introduce, and he has. He did that when the Democrats ratted on the commitment that they gave to the Australian people that they would not be a part of it, and the Prime Minister himself ratted on the `never, ever' promise that he made to the Australian people. So you could say that this particular introduction of the GST was a policy-child born in rather difficult circumstances.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of relevance. This is not a tax bill; this is an industrial relations bill. It is now patently obvious that the member for Corio has no opportunity to attack the provisions of the bill, so he now wants to give us a lecture on the GST. I ask that he be brought back to the detail of the bill.
 (Mr Hawker)—I am sure that the member for Corio will come back to the bill.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I defer to your ruling on this matter. The minister at the dispatch box—the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government—is my opposite. He believes, of course, that there are more reds under the beds in 2002 than there were in the Menzies era. Be that as it may, let me put my comments about the Prime Minister's political agenda in context. 
I said that there were three major elements to the Prime Minister's political agenda, if you distil his views down through the years: the first element was that he wanted to introduce a GST; the second element was that he wanted to stab Medicare in the stomach—those are not my words; those are the Prime Minister's own words—and the third element of his personal political agenda was industrial relations, and that is the subject that we are debating here today. The latest instalment in the Prime Minister's personal political agenda is this smokescreen called the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002. The Prime Minister has not been able to demolish Medicare and he has not been able to get his way in industrial relations. Of course, one out of three is not a very good political record. Be that as it may, we have to deal with the bill that is currently before the House.
Can I say from the outset that the primary motivation for this particular bill is not industrial peace. This legislation is designed to once again nobble a significant section of the work force and prevent them from obtaining in the industrial marketplace, through the collective bargaining process, what they consider are just wages for the work they do. I really have to mention this, because we know how hard the former minister for industrial relations, Peter Reith—one of the sponsors of previous bills that have been brought into this parliament in various forms—worked for his money. The former minister, Peter Reith, got a big $45,000 discount on a penthouse at the Crown Casino. That was supposed to be—
—The minister is really precious tonight. We are very sensitive tonight, aren't we?
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of relevance again. Of course, I have had great training at question time in the last few days when the glass jaws of the Labor Party have been squealing about this. Let me say—
—Sit down! I haven't finished. Go on! Until the other speaker is recalled, he will sit down.
—The minister across the table should get on the list with the clerk and have a say. If you don't, sit down. Get on the speaking list—
—The member for Corio will resume his seat. I call the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government on a point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I just point out to you that this is a detailed amendment and it is reasonable in the circumstances—because the member for Corio has breached the rules by speaking outside the details—that you now ask him to deal only with the detail of the bill.
—The member for Corio will come back to the bill and its amendments.
—I can understand the sensitivity of the minister, because he comes time and time again—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. To use the words oft used at question time: this speaker is defying your ruling.
—I will listen to the member for Corio, but I believe he is coming back to the bill and its amendments.
—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. Can I suggest to the minister: if you want to have your say on this, get on the speaking list like everybody else. Don't act like a chump in this House, getting up and moving spurious points of order to prevent a person from having their say.
We have made the point in this debate that the government in this legislation is not really interested in getting solutions to industrial relations problems. We have seen an example of this in relation to the recent dispute in the Australian car industry. The minister for workplace relations went out of his way to inflame that particular dispute. And let me tell Minister Tuckey at the table that every time he enters the public arena with that attitude my vote goes up. I have something like 2,000 car workers in my electorate, their families and their extended families, who know exactly where this Liberal government is coming from on the industrial relations issue. Here we have a minister in the car industry dispute seeking to provoke it and seeking to extend it for his own political agenda, which is the same as the Prime Minister's. However, when the parties were brought together and they sat down, we quickly had a resolution of this particular dispute. Doesn't that tell you something about this piece of legislation and the government that is sponsoring it? Because here we have a divisive piece of legislation—one that is not designed to resolve industrial disputes in a timely and opportune manner for the benefit of the company, the workers, and the Australian economy. 
What we have here, yet again, is the workplace relations legislation that was sponsored by the former minister Peter Reith, broken down by the current minister into what he thinks are digestible pieces for the Australian electorate and to be rammed through this parliament again. We have made two points in this debate: one is that this legislation will not contribute to the resolution of industrial disputation in this country. To talk about genuine bargaining, this is simply an attempt to stop larger unions in larger industries from bargaining in a certain manner which the government finds particularly objectionable. We have put before the parliament and the Australian public on many occasions what we think are good principles that ought to be pursued by both parties, employers and employees, when there are industrial disputes. 
Let us face it, we are in a sensitive area of economic and human endeavour. There are always going to be disputes about the carve up of the economic pie. But what we want is a structure and a mechanism that is going to resolve those particular disputes in a timely—and dare I say—sensitive manner that gives some justice to the work force, honours the position of the companies and is in the interests of the Australian people. We have put that proposition forward to the Australian people and to this parliament in terms of encouraging the partners in the industrial relations process, the employers and the employees, to bargain in good faith. 
Bargaining in good faith ought to be enshrined in legislation. It simply means that the parties agree to meet face-to-face. They follow a set negotiating procedure. They are bound to disclose relevant information. They must respond in good faith to proposals that are put by the other side, and they are required to adhere to their commitments. I ask members opposite: why are you opposed to a concept of bargaining in good faith? When the partners in the industrial relations process sit down together and negotiate an issue of contention between them and thrash through the issues, and when they are compelled to do it by the independent umpire, we get a resolution. You do not get a resolution in the industrial relations arena by this sort of punitive legislation, designed to merely advantage one side of the industrial relations equation. You certainly do not get it by training mercenaries in foreign places, and you do not get it by bringing Dobermans onto Australian wharves. That is unAustralian, and this legislation is merely a reflection of an agenda that can only fail. Honourable members need to appreciate that fact—this can only fail.
One of the problems we are now seeing, with state and territory Labor governments all over the country that are pursuing a rational industrial relations agenda, is that the Howard government finds itself isolated—as it has always been—on this particular issue. I can understand the frustration of the minister at the table, and the member for Canning, and the member who will follow me now on the government side, because at the end of day you just want to bully these things through. I am sorry, but you are not going to be able to do that. You are going to have to sit down and do what we tell you to do. We are going to tell you to negotiate. You do not bring in this sort of legislation in bits and pieces or we will knock it off. The Australian parliament will modify it in the interests of the community. You cannot have this legislation just because you want to run a divisive agenda in the Australian workplace. That is our message to you. 
You cannot be so thick-skinned and thick-skulled that you do not understand that. I cannot put it more plainly to you. The way to go with industrial relations is to compromise, to negotiate and to provide for an independent umpire who has the power to bring parties who seem to be in intractable positions to the negotiating table and to keep them there bargaining in good faith. That is the way that—in a collective bargaining and in an enterprise bargaining situation—we are going to get some sense into industrial relations in this country. The workers in Geelong in the car industry and the workers in the great industries of textiles, petroleum and aluminium production are a unionised work force. We want these conflicts taken out of the political arena, we want the umpire to be given some real power to bring parties together where there are disputes, and we want companies and the unions to negotiate in good faith. 
I hope the government accept the amendments that we have put forward, although I do not think they will. This legislation may have to go to another place and yet again you may have to be taught another lesson. But keep coming back, keep trying, keep running this divisive agenda. We are quite happy to accommodate you at the state level and at the federal level, if need be, because our motivating factor is the resolution of conflict; your motivating factor is the creation and manipulation of it. That is divisive, that is unAustralian and that is what this parliament must defeat.

"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2002-06-24,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 is the government's third attempt to address its concerns about threats caused to jobs by pattern bargaining campaigns. Firstly, I would like to give the House a brief overview of this particular issue. The reality is that, as the previous speaker alluded, workplace bargaining helps the economy because wages and conditions are determined by genuine workplace negotiations between employers and employees, with outcomes based on mutual interests and local circumstances. 
However, there is no doubt that elements within the union movement have attempted to orchestrate a return to industry level bargaining through the process known as pattern bargaining. This means that unions use pattern bargaining to conduct their negotiations across a range of employers or an industry and do not in fact genuinely negotiate at enterprise level. Pattern bargaining is the worst type of negotiation because it involves no negotiation and ignores the needs of employees and employers at the workplace level. This bill would not prevent unions from making the same claims over a number of employers, but it will reinforce the Industrial Relations Commission's ability to end protected strike action by suspending or terminating bargaining periods if unions are not in fact genuinely bargaining about their claims.
I would like to speak very briefly about some of the politics associated with this particular issue. There is no doubt that the House would agree that strikes cost jobs. Industry-wide strikes cost a lot of jobs and hurt the community. In fact, the Labor Party cannot deny that when they were last in government they also sought to limit the right to strike; they were intended as a means of last resort. However, the unions are attempting to extend the right to strike. I notice that the previous speaker, the member for Corio, mentioned Mr Cameron. Doug Cameron and Craig Johnston of the AMWU have made it clear that their intent is to use pattern bargaining to end enterprise bargaining within the manufacturing industry. That was reported in the FinancialReview of 17 June 2000.
So what else has been happening in the unfortunate attempts by the union movement to ignore real job creation? Craig Johnston is the chief policy adviser to the Labor Party in the Victorian branch of the AMWU. The SydneyMorningHerald on 23 June 2001 reported that in the past year members of this branch of the union have held out against paying a $20,000 contempt of court fine for holding illegal stop work meetings. The fine was eventually paid by—guess who?—an anonymous businessman. That union has been the subject of allegations over two run-throughs causing several hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage to two Melbourne businesses. This was reported in the Age on 16 June 2001. According to the Australian on 30 November 2001, this union was rebuked by the Victorian Premier, Steve Bracks, who last year wrote to Mr Cameron's followers to complain about:
... allegations of violence, property damage, physical assault and intimidation against employers, employees and even fellow union officials. We also have reports from employers that some AMWU officials do not comply with industrial agreements and undertakings once entered into.
There is a reason for all of this: in the last six years the AMWU has donated $3 million to the ALP. And their threats go further. The Australian of 22 November 2001 reported:
Mr Cameron would not rule out disaffiliation from Labor as a result of the review.
Five days later, after the Leader of the Opposition's closed-door confessional, Mr Cameron proudly declared, according to the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 November 2001:
I am more relaxed after a commitment that Labor will not go down the path of a Blair-ite Third Way agenda.
The reality is that this is very much opposed by the union movement—and for good reason. Let us have a look at some of the recent articles in major newspapers. I refer to an article by Robert Gottliebsen in the Australian of Tuesday 23 April this year. In it, he makes reference to how:
The sweeping industrial reforms of the 1990s contributed to a fall in national union membership from about 40 per cent to 25 per cent. 
But in Western Australia the federal reforms contributed to an even greater fall, from 37 per cent to 19.5 per cent, and, if you exclude the public sector, it is down to 14 per cent union membership. Mr Gottliebsen does not believe that that contributed to the union movement developing skills to negotiate more flexible work practices; if anything, the union leaders were `harder and harder to deal with'. He now makes the observation, which we are all aware of:
All states are controlled by ALP governments, and most are under pressure to make significant industrial relations concessions. But nowhere has the drive to turn the IR clock back been more vigorous than in WA ...
He goes on to say:
The WA Government plans a set of amazing industrial reforms that will take the state back to the 1960s and 70s.
He gives some examples:
... union officials will have unlimited right of entry at any time to a work-place site, including the ability to look at non-member records.
All that's necessary is that a workplace has a member or a potential member.
He also goes on to quote another example:
Non-union collective agreements will be banned on workplaces under state jurisdiction. Smaller unincorporated businesses cannot go to the federal system, so they either have a union collective agreement or the award.
His final words include this:
In other words, the WA state agreements that gave so much productivity improvement have been made next to useless.
He goes on to say that the WA legislation will make it easier for pattern bargaining, the very thing that this bill will try to address.
I would now like to move on to another issue, which is the Federal Court's Electrolux ruling—last Friday's decision. I want to refer particularly to an article in the Australian on Monday, 24 June by Peter Hendy, who is the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Most of us would be familiar with the decision of the Federal Court, which is essentially to grant unions the right to demand non-union fees from those who are not in unions. In other words, somebody in a workplace who is not a member of the union can be asked to pay up to $500 as, frankly, a form of bribe. It certainly does not involve freedom of association or freedom of will. The Federal Court has in fact supported this, and Mr Hendy's comments are as follows:
The court gave an unhealthy free kick to unions wanting compulsory union fees and greater rights to strike.
He goes on to say:
This effectively permits compulsory unionism by the back door and a huge extension of the right to strike in the workplace. This is also an expansion of union power and privilege—
no doubt to allow people to do run-throughs like the one Mr Johnston did which caused several hundred thousand dollars worth of damage—
beyond what democratically elected Labor and Coalition governments in 1993 and 1996 intended ...
He makes this point, though, very interestingly in the article:
After all, why should the employees who recently kept working at BHP Steel in the face of union pickets be punished by each having to pay a $500 bill to the picketing unions just because they chose to work and keep the car industry (and the jobs of thousands of other workers) going?
A good point. Those who chose to keep jobs and opportunities open get to pay the fine to the union, which is exactly what it is about. He goes on in his article to say:
The umpire that makes the rules about union power should be the parliament, not the courts.
As we have seen from the member for Corio, they are simply going to knock it back, knock it back and knock it back. This is the third time this bill in one form or another has come before the House. It is fine to keep knocking it back because—can I say to the leaders of the opposition—the Australian people will keep knocking you back. It will be many years before you have any hope of getting on this side of the House.
The reality is that the Australian people have seen through your false commitments about border protection now that you are so divided and are refusing to support `excisement' of areas of Australia from the Migration Act. They are going to see through this, too. While those in the opposition may imagine that they have had some sort of win and that they will prevent the government from having its way, the reality is that it is the Australian people who will have their way. They will not elect those on the opposition benches to government because they will not support union thuggery; they will not support the likes of Craig Johnston running through a business. It is a cute little phrase, isn't it, for somebody who is essentially just a vandal and who caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage? They will not support unions donating $3 million to the ALP to ride roughshod over small businesses and those who choose not to be in a union. I trust in time that there will be those in the Senate who will see the sense of what the government is proposing. For those in the opposition ranks, they will be consigned to opposition for a very long time.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—The previous speaker, the member for Dawson, let the cat out of the bag, and what a dirty, smelly animal it is. In speaking on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002, the member for Dawson could not resist the temptation to address the issue of excisions from the migration zone. She called it `excisement'; I think `excision' is probably the right word. In speaking on the question of excision, she has revealed what we all know, and that is that the purpose of this legislation, along with the legislation that was brought into this parliament with absolutely no policy purpose whatsoever, is to play politics with very important issues: to play politics with the entire question of Australia's immigration program, to bring into disrepute the immigration program and, in relation to this bill, to seek to portray Labor as being too close to the unions. It has absolutely nothing to do with policy and everything to do with politics.
This bill should be viewed not in isolation but as one of many industrial relations bills that have been brought into the House of Representatives. At a time when parliament for this particular sitting is winding up, the minister cannot resist the temptation to bring in more and more bills, because he is not actually interested in policy outcomes; he is not actually interested in the future of this country. He is interested in one thing only, and that is playing cheap politics in the parliament and in the broader community.
The legislation seeks to prevent pattern bargaining. We would have been quite prepared to enter into discussions with the government on a way forward in relation to workplace relations and some of the objectives that the government say they have in respect of this legislation. As I say, I do not think that they have those objectives at all. They have only one objective and that is a very cheap political one. However, we have an alternative proposal, which is good faith bargaining. It was provided for in legislation introduced and passed in this parliament by Labor governments. In brief, good faith bargaining involves a range of procedural principles such as formulating and complying with a bargaining process, attending meetings at reasonable times and places, considering and responding to proposals made by the other party, and not capriciously adding items to or removing items from the agenda. As a demonstration of our bona fides, we have been interested in the concept of good faith bargaining and its reintroduction into workplace relations legislation in this country. Our shadow minister is a good man who is always looking for constructive solutions but time and time again his efforts in seeking to reach accommodations with the government fall on deaf ears because the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has only one agenda, and that is to play politics with issues that really ought to be above politics and in the national interest.
I want to spend a little time on the car industry because there is absolutely no doubt that this legislation has been reintroduced now, and we are debating it for the third time, in the context of potential industrial disputation in the car industry which, certainly on our side of the parliament, we are very keen to avoid. Our leader has indicated to the Australian Industry Group that our proposal and approach is one of imposing a duty on all parties involved in industrial disputation to bargain for agreements in good faith. It is to ensure that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has effective powers to bring parties in dispute together and to give effective powers to the Industrial Relations Commission to facilitate bargaining in good faith and to make orders to ensure that both employers and unions do so. You would think that that was pretty reasonable, but to this point it has been rejected out of hand by the government.
We also advocate the position that the Australian Industry Group, on behalf of car makers and component manufacturers, should convene a conference of union and employer representatives to address broader issues, including the reality that up to 500 individual enterprise bargains are up for renewal in the coming 12 months. You would think that if a government were operating in good faith it would believe that the convening of such a roundtable or conference involving employer representatives and unions would be a good idea because it might have a lot of value in heading off any prospective industrial disputation but, surprise, surprise, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is totally opposed to even holding a conference. He does not want to see that happen and we have to ask why. The answer is that a conference might actually chart a way forward for the automotive industry in this country and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on all the evidence available to us does not want to see a way forward. He sees great political dividends in industrial disputation in the automotive industry in the coming 12 months and he seems hell-bent on achieving that.
The BHP Western Port dispute which was concluded recently gives us a lot of encouragement in terms of its resolution as to a way forward. That dispute was crippling for the car industry. With its just-in-time inventory systems, we know that the car industry is quite vulnerable to industrial disputation. The BHP Western Port dispute dragged on for quite some considerable time. However, within 24 hours of the Industrial Relations Commission bringing the parties together, it was resolved to the satisfaction of the company and the unions. Is there not a lesson in that, that when parties do come together and talk to each other face to face, issues can be resolved? In this case it was an issue of job security because BHP had wanted to contract out its maintenance operations. When the parties got together, they sorted that out. Obviously accommodations were reached on both sides. This is exactly the process that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations opposes because he supports confrontation over cooperation.
I do not support union militancy in the car industry or in any other industry. I believe that bargaining in good faith is the way of the future. I also believe that families whose livelihoods depend on their employment in the car industry have a right to a say in relation to job security and the protection of their entitlements. Therefore, they have a right to have some say in the 500 individual enterprise bargains that are coming up over the next 12 months.
I have to say that zealotry on the part of the minister is spreading to the minister's department. This has taken some time but it is certainly well and truly in place now. In the department's submission to the Productivity Commission's review of the future assistance arrangements for the automotive industry, the department says:
The workplace relations environment in the industry has been shaped in part by the willingness of employers to accede to union influence.
Oh, dear; what a terrible thing that they might actually be getting on. It continues:
While unions have a legitimate role in representing employees, some companies still equate talking to their employees with talking to unions.
Surely companies are entitled to talk to unions, but apparently not so far as the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations is concerned. In what is basically a threat to the industry, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations goes on to state:
Current levels of protection provide employers with a cushion in negotiating with employees that can lead to suboptimal outcomes in setting wages and conditions... In the absence of further reductions in protection, however, management and the work force are likely to continue rent seeking behaviour at the expense of international best practice.
There is the zealotry of the department. We know, of course, where that spread from. It came from the minister himself. This is the same minister who told the H.R. Nicholls Society on 23 March this year:
My hope is that chief executives will make [industrial relations] their principal interest rather than leaving it in the hands of so-called industrial specialists. I mean, it's great that we've got specialists, but War is too important to be left to the Colonels—the Generals need to be involved as well.
There you have the minister declaring war. He was not only declaring war in the car industry but also declaring war in relation to the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He has been asked here in this parliament about the Scoresby Freeway. He wants to link any Commonwealth funding that he has any say over to employers declaring war on the relevant employees. Those are not my words but his words declaring `war' on the trade union movement and, through them, the workers of this country.
I was encouraged by the response of the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group to these sorts of threats that have been made by the department and by the minister. In today's Australian Financial Review, under the heading `Car industry chiefs attack Government', it says:
With tensions rising in the car industry, chief executive of the AI Group Bob Herbert yesterday declared he was `flabbergasted' by what appeared to be a move by the Government to politicise a Productivity Commission inquiry into industry assistance post-2005. 
I was flabbergasted too, because this is an industry that employs 57,000 workers and has done spectacularly well in shifting its orientation from a narrow domestic market to the global market, to the point where the automotive industry, both in finished cars and in components, is now generating $7 billion worth of exports for this country. The Minister for Workplace Relations and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources think that they can use the car industry as their own political plaything. The car industry is too important to be used as a political plaything. It has a great future. It has gone forward in leaps and bounds over the last 10 years. Why? Because the previous Labor government provided a good, predictable and very sensible policy framework within which the industry could shift its orientation away from that small, narrow domestic market to the global market. It has worked very well. 
I have visited all the plants that produce finished cars, along with a number of the car component manufacturers, and I am struck by the level of cooperation between employers and employees, and by the pride that employees have in the work that they do. They create special rooms where they get together to solve problems. They even come up with technological advances as a result of their experience on the assembly floor. They work hand in glove with management. It is a very encouraging industrial relations environment in which you are able to see that happening, to see the industry continuously innovating, to see the industry creating extra value, to see the industry creating world-class vehicles that are sold to the United States and to countries all around the world. I congratulate Holden on its sales of Monaro. Mitsubishi is now committed to a new model post 2005. Where will it sell a very large proportion of its new model? It will sell them into the United States market. We are selling high-quality Australian cars into the United States market and this government thinks it can make the car industry a political plaything to seek to gain some sort of advantage over the Labor Party. It should be more responsible. The car industry is too important for that to happen. I refer again to the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, who on AM this morning said:
I am not sure what the motives of Tony Abbott have been—
I think I am pretty sure—
but the last thing we really want to do here is to link in the issue of industry policy and industrial relations policy. I think the important thing is to try and take the politics out of this.
We could not agree more. I asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources in question time today whether he would withdraw his threat to link the outcome of the government's consideration of the Productivity Commission report into the future of assistance arrangements for the car industry with the industry's willingness to engage in industrial warfare. The minister said in response to me that he had never made any such link. So I sought and gained approval to table the minister's press release of 17 June—just a few days ago—where he said:
There's a growing case to include a provision that will ensure minimal industrial disruption in the post-2005 arrangements for Australia's vehicle manufacturing industry. 
It appears the government will have to seriously consider linking future industry assistance to industrial relations reform ... 	
...				...				...
All this uncertainty makes a government think twice about the logic of providing industry support beyond 2005 when tariffs fall and the $2 billion ACIS scheme comes to an end. Will we have to go so far as to tie future industry assistance to improved working conditions?
The minister, here in parliament, denied ever making those threats. He made those threats just a few days ago, but I glean, from the denial, that he has in effect withdrawn those threats. It is important that he clarify that, but from his bumbling response to the question that I asked I was able to glean that he has withdrawn that outrageous threat from the industry. He now needs to talk to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and persuade him to withdraw his threat, because he has not. 
I noticed, as we were asking the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources these questions, that they got into a huddle with the Prime Minister. I can guess that what happened in that huddle was that the Prime Minister said, `Boys, we may have gone a little bit too far here, because the Australian Industry Group and the car makers aren't too happy about us trying to make a political plaything out of an industry that employs 57,000 people and generates $7 billion worth of exports.' I think, as a result of the Prime Minister realising that they had gone too far, the minister for industry decided that he had better take a step back. I welcome him taking that step back. I urge now that the minister for workplace relations do that and break any link between ongoing assistance for the car industry with its willingness to engage in—to use the words of the minister for workplace relations—industrial `war' with the workers and with the unions.
I believe that the future of the car industry is in further investment in innovation so that the quality of cars and components continues to improve so that we can be a global competitor. We have already done spectacularly well in that industry and it has an enormous future. I therefore refer to the submission by Holden to the Productivity Commission, which has commented on the government's record in relation to an ongoing economic reform agenda and, most particularly, in respect of innovation. It says:
Concerning the internal efficiency of the national economy, it is evident that Australia is reaping the benefits of a very substantial economic reform program in the latter part of the 1980s.
It goes on to say:
... significant recent beneficial changes are difficult to identify ... In total, the signs of some improvement in economic dynamism that have been seen in the 1990s, may have been mostly due to reforms adopted a decade earlier. If this is the case the outlook for the current decade must be viewed as disappointing.
Here is Holden saying, `Look, there has been no economic reform agenda under this government. What is absolutely needed is a set of arrangements that encourage research and development and innovation in this industry.' That is the way forward, not cutting the wages and conditions of workers in that industry.
When this minister was appointed he questioned the inclusion of the word `innovation' in my shadow ministerial portfolio title. Now we know why—because on 29 January this year he told the Financial Review that the government had got the balance on research and development pretty right. This is a balance that he says is right when business spending on research and development has fallen in each and every year of the Howard government—he says that that is pretty right. He then went on to freeze the R&D Start program. He cut departmental funding by 30 per cent. He cut staffing by 10 per cent.
The future of the industry is not in cutting wages. It is not in industrial warfare. The industry does not want to take on the minister's agenda of industrial warfare. Let us all take a cold shower and work towards what is in the best interests of the car industry, and the workers who are employed in that industry, and abandon this government's ridiculous and outrageous linking of future assistance to the industry with its willingness, or otherwise, to engage in industrial war with its workers.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, I am pleased to see that somebody such as yourself, who has such a long-standing record of standing up for decent trade unionism in this House and elsewhere, is in the chair tonight to be a part of this debate. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 that the government is putting forward, which has yet another Orwellian name—a title that is a direct contradiction of what the legislation is actually about; namely, the `genuine bargaining' bill—is, in fact, designed to wipe out particular kinds of bargaining in industrial relations and to further restrict the opportunities that trade unions and their members have to bargain on equal terms with employers to achieve reasonable outcomes in terms of wages and conditions for workers in particular industries.
What this legislation shows is, yet again, the Howard government's obsession—the obsession that is most prominent with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—with ever-tighter constraints on the ability of workers to collectively bargain with their employers to achieve outcomes that are decent and reasonable, that give them the ability to have a decent standard of living and to share in the benefits of ever-increasing productivity. We have a new version of bargaining that is being put forward in this legislation. After six years of the Howard government, they are still in opposition mode. The minister is still making outrageous, sweeping accusations about the state of industrial relations in this country—about people being held to ransom and how the law is not working—when, in fact, they have been in charge for more than six years. So, if they have a problem, if industrial relations in Australia is not working, it is their system that is not working.
At each stage in these processes when they hit what they perceive as some kind of problem—a dispute or a difficulty here or some problem over there—their response is to try to make the rules even more weighted and even more slanted against unions and against workers. They will pursue the interests of employers to the disadvantage of workers to the nth degree. They will just keep going to a final point when we have a situation in this country redolent of Britain in the early 19th century with the Combination Acts, where participating in trade unionism and collectively bargaining for wages and conditions as an employee is, to all intents, illegal. They are slowly whittling away the capacity of workers to stand up for themselves, to bargain on something even vaguely approaching equal terms with their employers.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 does not encourage genuine bargaining. It tries to stop bargaining altogether. It is directed towards what is called pattern bargaining, where a union in a particular industry seeks to pursue a common outcome across a multiplicity of employers in that industry. This, of course, is a possible scenario that a more deregulated industrial relations system opens up—the possibility for a union to pursue a strategy that is designed to achieve broadly comparable outcomes for its members across a variety of employers within a single industry. That strikes me as being an objective which is not necessarily bad in itself; there is nothing particularly wrong with a trade union and its members pursuing that kind of objective.
But that does not suit the government. Having put in place a given system, they now decide that they need to tinker yet again with the system to outlaw the kinds of bargaining that they do not like. So you get these euphemisms like `genuine bargaining'. Genuine bargaining actually means bargaining John Howard style, bargaining Tony Abbott style, which is the old cloth cap out, tug the forelock and say to the bosses, `Please, sir, can we have some more?' That is their version of bargaining and bit by bit they are seeking to entrench that in the industrial relations system in this country. If that requires provoking industrial confrontation, if that requires producing disputes that are inflamed, that take longer to resolve, that cause more economic damage, from the point of view of the minister for workplace relations, so much the better. That is what he loves. That is what he is on about.
There was a universal laugh around the chamber this afternoon. Some of the giggles and guffaws from the government benches were barely disguised when the minister, hand on heart, stated that he is not interested in causing confrontation in industrial relations. That is all he is about. He is about pursuing his own political advantage by fostering dispute, confrontation and aggravation in industrial relations. His approach simply causes disputes to be more prolonged, more bitter, nastier and, ultimately, more damaging. The BHP Western Port dispute was a classic example of this. While Tony Abbott was out there trying to pick a fight, looking for somebody to pursue his agenda for him to inflame the situation, the Industrial Relations Commission had the parties sitting around a table talking through the issues. The umpire—the umpire that they have gradually whittled away—got the parties to an agreement in about 16 hours, yet the minister could not do it in three weeks. Why? Because he did not really want an agreement. He wanted to extract the maximum political advantage out of an inflamed industrial dispute that could allow him to further demonise and vilify not only trade unions and trade union officials but the workers who are members of unions who ultimately make the decisions about whether or not they take industrial action. That is the target. Those people are his target in his political strategy to win cheap applause from people in other areas.
Labor believes very strongly in the role of an independent umpire in the industrial relations system. Historically, the Industrial Relations Commission and its predecessor, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, have played a key role in both preventing and minimising disputes and in ensuring that disputes end more quickly. That is because they have a capacity to play an independent broker role which pushes both parties towards some sort of outcome which ultimately is acceptable to both. Labor believes that the independent umpire should be given back its powers—powers that were taken away by the minister's predecessor, Mr Reith—to perform this role in order to require the parties to bargain in good faith. In our view, the term `genuine bargaining' means bargaining in good faith, being fair dinkum about the process, being prepared to meet face to face, being prepared to follow protocols about how negotiations might be conducted, disclosing relevant information, considering and responding to proposals—not necessarily accepting them but at least actually considering and responding to them—and adhering to commitments that are given. It is a bit of basic honesty and decency. What the minister is about is trying to eliminate those kinds of factors from our industrial relations system and to reduce the independent umpire to some sort of a spectator who sits there and takes notes while the parties ultimately wipe each other out.
The car industry has been the focus of the most recent activity of the part of the minister. He has seen Peter Reith have his maritime dispute on the waterfront, and he is a bit jealous. So he is looking to provoke something that might be a vague reflection of that exciting period when all of the high-level people in various establishment clubs around the country got their rocks off about Peter Reith's rottweilers, batons and balaclavas and so forth. Now this minister, Peter Reith's successor, wants to try and create some sort of equivalent scenario. I have a bit of experience in the car industry as a union official—and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, may have had some yourself; I am not sure. In the late eighties and early nineties I represented about 1,400 people in the car industry, and I had quite a bit to do with the various major car manufacturers in Victoria. I think it is worth saying that compared with then—or, more particularly, compared with what the industry was back in the seventies—the vehicle manufacturing industry in this country is an amazing success story. We now have a serious exporter, with enormous changes off the back of the Button plan in the mid-eighties. We have workers with better jobs, more responsibility, more skills, better pay and better conditions. We have unions that have been part of a major reform process and have contributed to that reform process.
We only need to think back, for example, to the great and infamous Ford dispute in 1973, which consisted largely, but not entirely, of large numbers of workers doing serious damage to the Ford factory—throwing stones and tearing down fences—because of the enormous frustration that they felt with how they were being treated by their employer and the appalling industrial relations record of that company at that time. The industry, to its great credit, has come a long way since that time and we should, I think, take note of the fact that the overall level of disputation in the industry is, in fact, very small compared with what history has given us. If you look at what has happened in the vehicle industry over the past 15 to 20 years you will see a pattern of constructive, cooperative reform, where the unions and their members together with the major car companies and component manufacturers have achieved enormous progress. In the old days, just-in-time manufacturing would have been literally impossible because the level of disputation was such that there would have been more days of disruption to the end of the process than there would have been days of production because of the much higher level of industrial disputes and the much more diffuse nature of industrial disputation at the time.
I would also like to comment on why it is important to have the Industrial Relations Commission playing a direct and prominent role in dealing with disputes. There is a fundamental nexus in our system between the degree of involvement of the Industrial Relations Commission and the length, bitterness and ugliness of industrial disputes. There is a great need for an independent circuit-breaker, for an umpire who can, in a sense, push both parties towards some kind of resolution and who can apply a bit of judicious pressure at appropriate times in appropriate circumstances to try and get a reasonable outcome that both parties can accept.
I had relatively recent personal experience of the problems we now get as a result of the neutering of the industrial umpire by the Howard government. Several years ago there was a very bitter dispute in my electorate involving a company that I had had some previous dealings with in my capacity as the local member. The dispute ultimately went on for somewhere in the vicinity of six weeks. I ended up being involved in a capacity of simply facilitating the parties talking to each other in circumstances where it was practically impossible for either party, the employer or the union, to initiate such discussions because the two sides had taken an entrenched position and neither could make the first move. Neither side was in a position to actually propose discussions with the other because the mere fact of doing that would have been interpreted as a sign of weakness, of being under pressure and of willingness to make concessions. Because of the absence of a proactive role on the part of the Industrial Relations Commission in the dispute, the dispute was simply going on and on and getting nastier and nastier. The employer was losing more money, the workers were losing more money and their family circumstances were getting worse and worse.
I do not claim any great credit for the role that I played. It was very minor and I do not say that anything flowed from it. Things could have evolved in exactly the same way had I not done that. But the thing that was starkly clear to me was that the absence of a proactive role on the part of the Industrial Relations Commission was a fundamental problem. In disputes of a similar nature that I have been involved in in the past as a union official, I would have had the Industrial Relations Commission breathing down both my neck and the employer's neck, pushing both sides to a resolution, convening discussions and trying to get both sides to come to meetings and negotiations, where they could do so with honour and without being seen to have made a concession in the form of actually inviting or suggesting negotiations. The absence of the umpire meant that that dispute was prolonged—it was more bitter and it was harder for the employer and the workers to pick up the pieces after that dispute.
Ultimately there is a reason why the government want to get rid of the umpire. It is that they represent the people who benefit from the absence of an umpire. They ultimately represent the people who are better off, who have more economic power, who do not need to bargain collectively in our economy, who do not need to rely on trade unions, who do not need to rely on awards and who do not need the defence and protection of others to get a reasonable wage and a reasonable set of working conditions in their life. That is who the government represent. Therefore, they do not like the idea that there is an umpire, because the umpire occasionally might assist or rule in favour of those people in our society—workers—who do not have the bargaining power to deal on equal terms with major employers.
Although it is true to say that there are some workers, some of them union members, who have quite a lot of bargaining power—in some cases, some may even argue, an excessive amount of bargaining power—those people will always be a minority, and generally a pretty small minority. We have had examples in the past with the pilots—a group of people with a considerable amount of industrial muscle who were experienced at using it and who got very good rewards for it. They ultimately came unstuck in 1989, but that does not really change the broader picture. The percentage of workers who are in that position—who have got the muscle and the clout to demand good returns and who do not really need an umpire, an award system or some kind of bargaining framework—is very, very small.
Labor believe in genuine bargaining, in conciliation, in an independent umpire and in a system that minimises industrial disputes and makes sure that the length of duration of industrial disputes is kept to a minimum. We are proposing an alternative model to the government's provisions in this particular debate that is about good faith bargaining. It is about ensuring that in the enterprise bargaining process the parties are required to bargain with each other in good faith, to participate constructively in negotiations, to respond to proposals with a yes or a no or with alternatives, and to treat people with some sort of respect—not with contempt. What this government is ultimately fostering is industrial contempt. It is about fostering a climate where workers are kept under the heel by companies, where it pays for companies to mistreat their workers and where workers cannot get the dignity, the respect and the reasonable terms and conditions which trade unions are there to organise and negotiate for them. That is what this government is about. That is its agenda—to tilt the industrial relations playing field even more heavily in favour of employers.
—Are you going to tell this to the brothers—the comrades?
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order!
—They did it very severely in 1996—
—The minister will come to order.
—through the courtesy of Peter Reith, the then minister. Ever since then they have continued to tinker with the system to make it more and more biased toward employers and harder and harder for workers, through their unions, to achieve some kind of fairness and justice. That has been the whole approach that this government has taken. Tony Abbott, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, jealous of the hardline class warfare position adopted by his predecessor, Mr Reith, is now out to create mayhem—in this instance, in the vehicle industry, but he will find anything that he can locate to enable him to whip up any kind of industrial dispute in order to pursue his political objectives.
—The minister will come to order.
—This legislation should be rejected by the House. All of the blustering by the buffoon at the table here, who has been interrupting everybody, should also be rejected by the House. We should endeavour to ensure that we have an industrial relations framework in this country which produces conciliation, negotiation and respect between the parties and decent outcomes so that workers get a share of the productivity benefits they contribute to and so that we have reasonable wages and conditions for Australian workers.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—Tonight we are debating the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002. Here we go again, with another one of the government's attempts to have a go at the Australian worker.
—What's this—a retirement speech?
—What a misnomer it has come up with this time to cover this bit of worker-bashing legislation—
—This is a retirement speech.
—Does the minister want to go back to the dining room, Mr Deputy Speaker, or is he going to sit here interjecting like a parrot all night?
 (Mr Mossfield)—I call the minister to order, and I ask the member to make his address through the chair.
—This minister is an example of the approach that this government has to industrial relations. He wants to sit there going yappity yappity yap, but will he do anything about it? Not likely. He is one of the people who would like to think that this was about genuine bargaining. What a joke that is! We all know that this bill is just a bit of recycling. The government has recycled this proposal before. It was rejected by the Senate in the year 2000 and it is the government's third attempt to get this legislation through on this aspect of industrial relations.
—The minister at the table will come to order.
—The government knows that this bill is not going to pass the Senate. It knows that the opposition is going to vote against it. It knows that the minor parties are going to vote against it. The only people who want to have this piece of legislation are the pugnacious Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and his sidekick here in the House tonight.
—Sidekick!
—Some would say he is a drop kick but I am willing to be generous to him. The government would like us to believe that this bill is a good thing. To use the government's preferred terms, it will:
reinforce the principles of enterprise bargaining and ensure that access to protected action is limited to circumstances where there is genuine bargaining at the enterprise level.
That sounds fine when it is put like that, but this bill is really about introducing obstacles to the bargaining process, not facilitating it. The title of the bill is misleading. It is another example of Minister Abbott's Orwellian newspeak—another thing he adopted from his former colleague Minister Reith. As other speakers here tonight have said, he wants to show that he is hairier-chested and more punch-drunk than Minister Reith.
—We know he's an ape.
—As the shadow minister at the table just said, we know exactly what he is. This bill is an example of the Orwellian newspeak that the government goes on with. It is definitely not about genuine bargaining; it is about the opposite to genuine bargaining. If the bill is passed in its current form, it will result in restrictions of bargaining between employers and employees. I would like to remind the House what the Australian industrial relations system used to be. We used to have a Conciliation and Arbitration Commission where the approach was to try to settle disputes before they escalated. Both parties were encouraged to resolve disputes. What do we have now? We have a government, exemplified by its choice of ministers, which has an ideological hatred of unions and the workers they represent. Conciliation as a concept has disappeared. This government likes to pick a fight. It likes to provoke, and it is certainly not in the game of genuine bargaining. Today in question time we saw proof of that once again. The minister's response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition confirmed that the government would rather see industrial relations played out through highly paid lawyers fighting in the common law courts over damages actions.
—Who wrote this for you, Leo? Union hack theorists writing away in back offices?
—I think he has been vaccinated with a gramophone needle tonight, Mr Deputy Speaker.
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order! I ask both members to come to order.
—The minister at the table just cannot stop himself talking. If he wants to participate in the debate, he can get up and have a say. He can get on the speakers list. But I see that the only two people who are willing to stand up here tonight and defend the government on this are Mr Randall and Mr Barresi, who has been waiting his turn all night. The minister will not speak in this debate in the order he was supposed to; he wants to wait until the end so he can have the last nasty little shot at unions. The minister at the table, who is laughing his silly head off, is not even game to get into this debate.
—Order! The minister at the table will stop interjecting and the speaker will address his remarks through the chair.
—He just wants to sit there and interject from the sidelines. If he has something to say, he can get up and get into the debate. We would be interested to see where he stands on these things, but of course we will not, will we? We will not at all. But we know what his boss, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, thinks about these things. He is a very pugnacious minister. He likes a fight, and I have no doubt that this is one of the reasons he was given this portfolio by the Prime Minister. He wants conflict, he seeks it out and he seems to enjoy it. Each day at question time we get an example of this. It must be pretty obvious to everyone that his motives are dubious when people like the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, Bob Herbert, question his motives in seeking the sort of absolutely confrontationalist industrial relations framework that the minister is putting forward. We heard Mr Herbert on the ABC this morning. I think the ABC had asked the minister to come on, but he was ominously silent. He is just like the minister at the table here: happy to have a little bit of an interjection on the side but unwilling to get into the debate.
Australians right across the board used to have respect for the conciliation and arbitration system. It had the trust of both sides and, by and large, it was seen as a fair system which worked with both sides to bring about a resolution of industrial relations issues. You cannot expect there to be much goodwill or trust these days, however. With the government continuing to pursue its war against the unions, it is inevitable that legislation such as this and the other bills that are in this package will widen the divide between employees and employers. Once again with this legislation, as with other workplace relations bills currently before the parliament, we have the same set of circumstances. 
There are no industrial relations circumstances to justify the bill. It is therefore unnecessary legislation. The bill, if passed in its current form, would have the effect of prohibiting common claims. Common claims, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, as you are aware, are a normal component of bargaining, and employers as well as unions engage in them. The bill would result in the limitation of the Industrial Relations Commission's discretion. We should be strengthening the role of the commission, not fettering it. There is no point in having a lame duck commission. Of course, that is where the government ultimately intends to go. The government really wants to write the commission out of Australian legislation.
The commission has shown in the past that it can effectively deal with disputes and bring about a negotiated settlement. Why should we interfere with the role of the commission? The only reason for the government to want to alter the commission's current powers must be a cynical one. It wants to limit the commission's current uncircumscribed discretion and it wants to limit the ability of unions to represent their members. It is interesting to note that the prohibition on pattern bargaining has not been an issue internationally, simply because no other comparable country imposes the type of restrictions on industry-wide multi-employer bargaining and agreement making that apply in Australia. These restrictions have been the subject of ILO criticism of Australia on occasions. Nowhere else in the developed industrialised world are there restrictions on industry-wide agreement making as exist in Australia. That is not something to be proud of. The government appears to think that disadvantaging workers is a reasonable thing to do. We on this side do not agree. However, the government does not think that the same rules should apply to employers. The ACTU said in its submission to the recent Senate inquiry into the five workplace relations bills:
The effect of prohibiting the pursuit of common claims, as provided for in the Bill would be to reduce enterprise bargaining to a series of completely isolated negotiations, where workers would be unable to use the collectively-gained knowledge and experience which comes from participation in their union. Employers would, of course, not be so inhibited, and would be free to pursue approaches in common with other employers in the industry.
So much for the level playing field. The government wants to circumscribe the role of the umpire and put humps in the playing field. There is the difference: it is okay for employers but it is not okay for employees. The government is obsessed with unions and industrial action. There is no need for the legislation. Over recent years there has been a decline in working days lost due to industrial disputes. The commission already has power to suspend the bargaining period where a party has not tried or is not genuinely trying to reach an agreement. Why try to fix, in a shonky way, something that is not broken? That is the question the government has to answer. I will be interested to see whether any government members can tell us why we need to fix the system, because all those who are participating in it, including the employers, as we heard today, do not think that the system is broken. Again I quote the ACTU's submission to the Senate inquiry. It states:
To the extent that there is an issue of protracted industrial disputes, it reflects the lack of power in the Commission to deal with the underlying causes. Restoration of the arbitral power of the Commission would provide a means of dealing with such disputes ...
We saw that in a recent dispute which went on because the commission could not intervene. In the past, when the commission had power to intervene, many disputes were resolved before they got to the stage of creating economic havoc for employers and employees. The bill is bad legislation and it should be amended, and that is why I support the amendment moved by Mr McClelland, which:
... condemns the Government for:
(1)	unreasonably emasculating the powers of the AIRC to resolve industrial disputes in the interests of the parties;
(2)	interfering with the AIRC's discretion to deal with industrial disputes in the most appropriate way; and
(3)	failing to put forward constructive proposals to enable the Commission to direct parties to bargain in good faith”.
That brings me to the main point that I wish to make tonight: we need a system of conciliation and arbitration. We need an independent umpire. We need a stronger industrial commission, not a weaker one. This legislation will neither help to resolve disputes nor improve our industrial relations system. It will do more to increase the divisions between the powerful, in the form of employers, and the less powerful, in the form of workers. That, unfortunately, is what the government wants. The government wants to pit employers against employees. The minister wants to get himself a worse reputation than his predecessor had. The minister has absolutely no interest in fair bargaining, genuine bargaining or any sort of bargaining between employers and employees. His answer at question time today put that very squarely where he believes it is: we should have recourse to the courts and we should spend a lot of money on litigation. The system of conciliation and arbitration that we had, which was a world first, worked well for this country. That system is not broken. We should not pass the bill, because it will put Australia in a worse industrial position than we were in in the past. I commend to the House the opposition's amendment, and I hope that the Senate will not pass this legislation.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Barresi, Phillip, MP",LP,2002-06-24,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to participate in this debate. I rise to speak in support of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002. I will direct my remarks to the bill. It seems that every member of the ALP who has spoken on the bill so far has spent their 20 minutes simply bagging the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I do not know what it is about the opposition; no matter who is the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on this side, they seem to be fixated on trying to tear down the individual. Let us remember that the individuals who have occupied the position of Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in the last six years have given us the lowest number of industrial disputes, the highest income levels that many workers have seen and, of course, increased employment opportunities, with the growth in employment approaching one million. These are the individuals that members of the opposition wish to denigrate.
Why do ALP members feel compelled to denigrate the individuals who have held that portfolio? The two motivations that I think are cutting through are: first, they realise that these messages are resonating among the Australian public and they are seeing the benefits paying off; the other motivation—we cannot escape it—must be due to their masters of the union movement. When one union is willing to put $3 million of their members' hard-earned money into ALP coffers, it is no wonder that opposition members feel that they have to stand up and defend their brothers in the union movement. Eight opposition members are listed to speak on the bill—that is a $375,000 contribution from every one of them. I will be looking at the Australian Electoral Commission's returns after the next election and seeing whether the election coffers of those members—for example, McClelland, Tanner, O'Connor, Emerson, Zahra and Hatton—have been boosted by $375,000. I say to the union movement: save your money, because that $375,000 was wasted. We saw not one utterance of sensibility in 20 minutes.
The member for Rankin, the member for Melbourne and a few others have spoken about the plight of the automotive industry and how this government and this minister are attempting to destroy an $8 billion industry through industrial relations practices. Let us remember that the automotive industry has achieved significant reforms. These reforms have been, on the one hand, due to tariff reductions and the industry becoming competitive and, on the other, industrial relations reform.
—Good Labor policies!
—Yes, they are two great policies. The only problem is that the opposition used only one weapon to try to reform the auto industry, and that was to reduce tariffs. Labor slowly reduced tariffs from 25 per cent over a period of time, hoping that the auto industry would reform, and some reform has taken place. They were too gutless—absolutely gutless—to respond to the union movement.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Members of the opposition are willing to participate in debate, but we do take exception to that remark, because it does really apply to his own minister.
 (Mr Mossfield)—There is no point of order.
—Of course, I was referring to them as a collective. What I am saying is that the opposition did not have the courage or the internal fortitude that was required to stand up to the union movement and to reform the auto industry through industrial relations practices. Labor had only one strategy at the time, and that was to do it through tariffs. This government supports that, but industrial reform is also required. This is one of the reasons why we have come up with a series of legislation to assist organisations to reform.
It is so easy for members on the other side to say, `We don't support union militancy.' The member for Rankin got up here and said, `We don't support union militancy; of course there should be genuine negotiations,' but we saw them lining up—each individual, one by one—during the maritime strike. They lined up to support their union officials. Did they support the employees who wanted to go back to work during those recent picket lines? Did they try to get the employees back to work and to rein in the union movement? No, they did not. They may talk about not supporting union militancy, but out there in the real world they will not be photographed saying to the union movement, `Get back to work. Get those guys into work.' They are truly, as a collective, too gutless to stand up to the union officials.
Earlier, the member for Melbourne talked about genuine bargaining. He said that this bill, for some reason, is not about genuine bargaining but about a return to a cap-in-hand approach of kowtowing to an employer. This legislation is about genuine bargaining and empowering the work force. What it is not about is the ALP union collective financially kneecapping employers. If those opposite want to talk about capping, this is about kneecapping employers rather than providing them with the ability to stand up for the rights of the work force. If those on the other side want to be fair dinkum about support, they should also be fair dinkum about their approach to the militant unions and their acts of provocation out there in the work force. I certainly have not seen any of that. Talking about provocation, I have not seen any fair dinkumness about some of the union tactics that were used in my part of the world in Melbourne, when the unions busted down doors over in Box Hill and in Croydon. Where was the fair dinkumness then?
—Where was the fair dinkumness, Member for Corio, when those unions busted down those doors? Was that genuine bargaining that took place? It certainly was not.
—What about the use of dogs? What about training mercenaries? Do you know anything about that?
—This bill is about returning to enterprise bargaining. The member for Corio is ranting over there. I am not sure what he is ranting about, but it is probably about the $375,000 for the speech he still has to give on behalf of his union mates.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member has just said that the member for Corio, in effect, received a bribe for making his speech. That is disgraceful. It is the sort of slur that the opposition have come up against in this debate.
—Well, move a substantive motion!
—Your trouble, Fatso, is you get it back to front! He is the one who is supposed to move the motion, not me. I think the member should be called upon to make his remarks a little more temperate than they are.
—There is no point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Deakin made an inference that I received $75,000 from a union for my election campaign. That is not true, and I ask him to withdraw the inference that that was somehow a bribe during the election campaign.
—He said $375,000.
—Order! The member has taken objection to the wording. Would the member for Deakin reconsider—
—They were not the words that I said.
—I will listen carefully to the words of the member for Deakin and ask him to stick to the bill before the parliament.
—I certainly would welcome the member for Corio reading the Hansard tomorrow to check the accuracy of the words that I used. As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has said in the debate, in the past decade we have seen in excess of 41,000 collective agreements developed in the federal system. This alone is evidence that firms across all sectors of industry have embraced the concept of enterprise bargaining. When one examines the legislative framework of this bill and what is intended, we see that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission powers do dominate. The powers of the commission dominate because this bill is seeking to clarify an area of the Workplace Relations Act of 1996.
Simply, it provides a mechanistic guide to the commission when it is deliberating over a case. It is an enhancement of the commission in these matters and augurs well for the plight of many workers. The bill allows the commission the power to determine whether a negotiation process is genuine or not genuine, and in doing so the commission will be required to examine whether the bargaining is enterprise bargaining or personal bargaining. In this bill, cooling-off periods are outlined to empower the commission to suspend certain bargaining periods for a period of time. It is also the intention of the bill to enable all parties to have a chance to consider the implications of a negotiation and to arrive at the best possible outcome.
In the brief time I have available—I know that other members want to speak on this—if we look at my own state of Victoria, the threat of job losses is nowhere more acute than in that state. It is perhaps the state in the country that is more controlled by militant unions than any other. I am pleased to see that we have three other members of parliament from the state of Victoria here this evening. The Bracks government have pandered, and continue to pander—
Mr Zahra interjecting—
—It is a great government because it panders to the demands of the unions! Anyone who panders to demands is great! If you are a member of parliament, you are great because you respond to the unions! If you are a Labor government, you are great because you respond to union demands as well!
The AMWU, for example, through its representatives Craig Johnston and Darren Nelson, have been using threats in the manufacturing industry. The threats come with the news that enterprise bargaining agreements in the car components manufacturing industry will expire next year. Next year—and this is not me saying this; it is Darren Nelson, the assistant secretary of the Victorian division of the AMWU, who has been quoted in the Australian—as many as 500 car component manufacturers could be paralysed. Member for Melbourne, is that fair dinkum? That certainly is not a fair dinkum approach to negotiations, when you have 500 car component manufacturers that could be paralysed next year. The use of these tactics as a cloud over the head of the Australian car manufacturing industry is a disgrace and not in the best interests of workers or the community at large; in fact, it is detrimental.
My time has run out, unfortunately, and all I can say is that there is very little doubt in my mind that any measure taken to encourage and facilitate continued discussion between employees and employers away from union demands and union sentiment is a welcome one. This government is committed to the welfare of the Australian worker, securing Australian jobs and maintaining confidence in all industry sectors. It is for this reason that I support the bill and commend it to the House. I look forward to far more constructive contributions from the other side, rather than simply the denigrating of personalities who have occupied the positions of ministers for employment and workplace relations.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—Industrial relations is important to the electorate of McMillan; it always has been. In particular, within my electorate, the Latrobe Valley is a place which has been associated with industrial relations for generations now. It is the place where I grew up; it is a place that our family has been away from for some time now. It has given me a good understanding of why industrial relations is important to working people. It is the type of understanding that you get when you grow up in a working class family; it is the type of understanding that you get when you grow up being the son of a building worker; and it is the sort of understanding that you get when you understand, first hand, why unions are important to working people. People on the other side of this place have no idea at all about unions. They just pathologically hate unions and they hate working people as well by extension. That is their starting point and that is their end point. They have no understanding at all of why unions ever came into being and they have no understanding today of why unions are important to working people.
It is all well and good for people who have been to Brighton Grammar School, Melbourne Grammar, King's School in Sydney and all the other fancy schools, where their rich parents have sent them for $15,000 or $20,000 a year, or the sons and daughters of the bunyip aristocracy, who have been sent to flash schools in Melbourne and Sydney, to come here and lecture us about industrial relations, about what is important to people in trade unions and about what is important to people on low incomes, wages and salaries—people who are trying to do the best they can for their families—but it is not good enough for them to expect us to cop it sweet. We will not cop it, we will not put up with it and we will not sit here and not say anything about the type of privileged backgrounds that people on the other side have had. They come in here and lecture working people, trying to use this parliament as an instrument to put working class people down and trying to press working class people on low incomes who are in unions further into poverty and financial struggle. We will not sit here and say nothing about it. Things need to be said about the types of people in this government, and we in the Labor Party will make sure that the Australian people understand, and understand very clearly, what the government's legislation is all about—what they really want to do.
As is the case in so many other instances with this government, they come in here with bits of legislation with all sorts of fancy names on it. This one is called the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002. George Orwell would be proud of such a ridiculous title being given to a piece of legislation which has obviously got nothing to do with genuine bargaining. They have come in here with other bits of legislation. I am sure they have a big laugh about it over at the Melbourne Club and that at all the other bastions of the establishment they have a giggle with each other over a sherry or a glass of cognac; there is the usual carry-on and rah-rah associated with all the people over there who have had the privileged life that they have all enjoyed for so long. They would be laughing, saying `We introduced this bit of legislation and we called it the “genuine bargaining bill”, but, you know, it's really about making sure that people who are in workplaces aren't allowed to collectively organise their industrial relations circumstances, aren't allowed to bargain properly, and are really emasculated in the way that they are able to negotiate with their employer.' They would be having a great giggle, a great laugh, about that in their little clubs over there, in their fancy surrounds. They would be thinking it is a great hoot, at everyone else's expense. But they are not really fooling anyone; they are certainly not fooling me or other members of the Labor Party in this parliament. We think it is disgusting that they think it is funny; we think it is disgusting that they come in here, laugh about it, and try to make out that this bit of legislation is about something that it is not.
We all know what it is about: it is about trying to grind working people down. It is about trying to get people who are already in disadvantaged circumstances and grinding them down further and making sure that they have as little power in the workplace as possible to no productive or efficient end. This legislation is not about creating jobs; it is about reducing wages. It is not about increasing opportunity, or developing a new export focus for the country, or securing new export markets, or trying to drive wages up through productivity increases; it is all about trying to drive wages down and trying to keep people on low incomes down so that they cannot get a break, so that they cannot negotiate fairly in the workplace, and so that they cannot secure a fair industrial outcome in their workplace.
Other speakers today have talked about unions being just a tool of some people within the union movement within the context of the union movement's relationship with the ALP. Fundamentally, people opposite do not understand what unions are about. They do not understand the important role that unions play in communities like the Latrobe Valley, which I represent. They do not understand how important it is for people to belong to a union and the protection that being in a union provides to people in the workplace. We get giggling from some of the King's School heroes over there and some of the great champions who came out of Brighton Grammar School and all their other fancy schools. They come in here and carry on about how unions are no good because they are against the national interest and against workers' interests. That is what they do; they come in here and they say that. 
I do not really know how much experience people who sit on the other side who come from a privileged background have had with unions or workers or factories or any workplaces. I do not think they could know very much at all. They come in here and denigrate people in unions and things like union picnic days and activities which unions are involved in and some of the conditions which unions have negotiated over a great period of time. Those agreements and conditions that they are talking about were all negotiated by people—not by huge institutions which are not made up of anything but by people in employment who came together to try to secure a better and fairer deal for them, their work mates, their families and their communities.
We have the spectacle of the gigglers on the other side coming in here talking about union picnic days. They do not really understand what that is about. They do not get that union picnic days were always important for working people—a great way to come together, a great way to show good faith with your employer, a great way to build good relations. As someone who grew up in the Latrobe Valley, like just about every other child who grew up in the Latrobe Valley, I attended a union picnic every year with my dad, my mum, my two sisters and several thousand other children from the Latrobe Valley. 
These union picnic days were a pretty good opportunity for us kids—we made good friends, good mates, and it was a great opportunity to be with our families. These negotiations which were entered into by the work force and employers were all about recognising the importance of the relationship between employer, employee and their families. That is why we had these days; it was a great opportunity to come together to celebrate what our parents had achieved in the course of a year. It was a great way to recognise the fact that we lived in, and were a part of, a community. It was also a great way to recognise that workers had families and that the people on the other side of the table in the negotiations—the managers—had families too.  It was a great way of coming together. 
For a lot of people who did not have much money, those union picnic days were pretty important. Every year the kids received presents. Often those workers did not have a lot of money and buying a present for their kids was not that easy. Some people on the other side might not be able to relate to that or understand that. But let me tell you that that was real life for a lot of people in the Latrobe Valley and for working people in other industrial areas. Some of those people on the other side might denigrate that. They might think it is funny and laughable. They might seek to make that important relationship between workers, their families and unions seem unimportant, but they are really coming at it from the viewpoint of people who do not understand what that was all about and why that relationship was important. 
In the Latrobe Valley we worked very hard through the 1980s and in particular the 1990s, when we went through massive industrial change and the loss of a large number of jobs, to try to create an industrial relations climate which was conducive to investment, conducive to growth in jobs and conducive to having a cooperative relationship in the Latrobe Valley which would create and drive new business growth in our district. This came about through the Latrobe Valley development agreement, which was put together under the auspices of VECCI, the Australian Industry Group, the Gippsland Trades and Labour Council, several of our local councils, a number of other important employers in our district and a number of other important stakeholders within our region.
This agreement was put together so that we would be able to present to new industries that were considering setting up in different parts of the country an image as a region which said: `We are interested in working together. We are interested in coming up with a good enterprise agreement. We are interested in negotiating with you as a partner. We are interested in coming up with a way of getting your business here and making it a success for you.' A lot of people in the Labor movement did a lot of hard things to get that agreement. A lot of people in the Labor movement worked very hard with their constituencies to get people to make that agreement, because we recognised that we had to make those changes. We had to recognise that change had taken place in our community. That meant we had to change as well in order to be relevant to the new requirements of business so that people in business would want to come to our region and know that we were going to be flexible people, able to sit down and work with them productively to come up with a sensible enterprise bargaining agreement to make sure that their business was a success and that people had jobs locally. 
That was done through the 1990s. Through all of the changes we went through in the Latrobe Valley and the loss of those thousands of jobs, hardly any industrial action was taken at all. That really is a tribute to the preparedness of people in unions and workers to not use their power to pursue anything that would not be in the state's interest or in the national interest. Really, those people really did a hard thing under a lot of pressure not to use their considerable industrial might to engage in action which perhaps would not have been good for the state or for the nation. 
We often hear the people on the other side of the House referring to the conduct of unions as being `the law of the jungle'. They say, `We've got unions during this and doing that.' It is a bit rich for them to come in here and carry on about how unions behave when it all takes place under their own legislation. This is now the sixth, nearly the seventh, year of the Howard government. They have been in charge of the legislation in our country for all of that time; any industrial dispute takes place within the parameters of their industrial relations legislation. If they want to change it and strengthen the Industrial Relations Commission, if they want a bigger role and more power for the Industrial Relations Commission to resolve disputes so we do not have prolonged disputes and situations where there is a national strike or a situation which threatens a certain industry, then I am sure that we would be prepared to sit down and work with them to try to come up with legislation which would support that. But they have never been interested in that.
While the government are very quick to come in here, carry on and talk about how some union in one sector of the economy is doing this and how it is the `law of the jungle' and `Look out, the world is going to end,' they do not come in here and talk about the conduct of G&K O'Connor meatworks in Pakenham, which locked out 300 workers for nine months—the longest lockout in Australia's history since the Depression. It all took place under the federal government's legislation; it all took place under the watchful eye of Peter Reith, the then Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, who had been given a briefing about it. There was no doubt at all that he was backing the conduct of those employers; he was backing the lockout of those 300 people for nine months.
This dispute got no-one anywhere. It was a situation where G&K O'Connor meatworks decided that they were going to give up the agreement which they had and were going to push for a reduction in the pay and conditions of their work force by about 18 or 20 per cent, on average. They decided to do it unilaterally: `We're just doing it,' they said, `and you guys are gonna have to cop it.' So they locked their work force out.
The tragedy in all of this is that a lot of money has been spent in the Federal Court and other industrial jurisdictions on lawyers and so on, and after nine months of the lockout and a series of legal battles—and God knows how much money has been spent on lawyers—we have ended up with a situation where a lot of those fellows who were locked out are now back at work over there at G&K O'Connor's, they are all still in the union and G&K O'Connor's have gone back to basically the same type of agreement that they had before. They had a lot of urgers, and Peter Reith, the then minister for workplace relations was one of them. I am saying that, when you are blinded by mad ideology, you will pursue a path like G&K O'Connor meatworks did, and you will end up losing a lot of money and you will not in any way be in a different situation in relation to your work force.
If you treat your work force with contempt, if you treat them as if they were stupid, dull, dumb labour units that you can chop and change and move around, saying, `Who cares about them?'—if you think you can get away with it—you will be in the same position as G&K O'Connor meatworks, which have lost a lot of money and destroyed a whole lot of goodwill with their work force. They are in the situation where, whilst there were plenty of urgers around the place, there is no-one standing with them now; there is no-one saying, `Jeez, you did a great thing.' I do not think G&K O'Connor meatworks are going to be appearing in the BusinessReviewWeekly to talk about the success of their strategy, because it was not a success; it was a disaster. People in the industry know it and G&K O'Connor know it as well.
People come in here as well and give examples of the conduct of unions in the power industry in my electorate and say, `Unions abuse their position and hold the state to ransom.' What absolute rubbish and lies! In our district, we have seen a lot of effort being made by people who are employees at the power stations and by the unions that represent those people to come up with enterprise bargaining agreements which are fair and reasonable, flexible and centred on productivity. We have seen successful enterprise bargaining agreements negotiated at Loy Yang, we have seen successful enterprise bargaining agreements negotiated at Hazelwood and we have seen successful enterprise bargaining agreements negotiated in all other parts of the industry—except for the Yallourn power station.
The Yallourn power station set in place a strategy which was all about attacking its work force—it had in place a strategy to lock out its work force. In fact, it did lock out its work force in order to pursue an industrial strategy which was all about putting in place casualised working conditions for people and trying to break down a lot of the employment and job security that had been built up by those employees over many years.
This is not the approach to industrial relations that we want to see in the Latrobe Valley. We do not want to see this type of aggression and antagonism; we do not want to see this confrontation. What we want to see is cooperation. We want to see people working together, we want to see a recognition of the rights of workers and we want to see a recognition of the important role that trade unions play in our community as well. I am proud to be from the Latrobe Valley, I am proud of the industrial tradition of our region and I am proud of the important role the trade unions have played in our history and the important role that trade unions have played in our region in advancing the cause of workers.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I have to concur with the member for McMillan: the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 is no more than a rehash of proposals that were rejected by the parliament on two occasions two years ago. Despite the Chicken Little warnings by this government and its minister that the sky is falling or that the world will end, in fact Campaign 2000—which was the area that the minister most concentrated on in his attacks upon the union movement—has gone off with no concern at all. In fact, if one were to look at the actual facts in relation to the metals industry, one would see that the metals industry continues to have low levels of industrial disputation, notwithstanding the rantings and ravings of those on the other side, and continues to have sustainable wage outcomes.
This bill is, as I say, no more than a rehash. Why is it a rehash? I suppose one of the reasons it is a rehash of past attempts is that there is no agenda by this government other than to continue to kick unions and, by extension, their members—the employees. There is no agenda, so we literally have this industrial GroundhogDay, except we do not wake up to a furry animal every day; we wake up to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, which I can tell you is not a pretty sight. I think the fact is that the real intention is to create as many impediments to protected industrial action as possible and to limit the scope of the unions to pursue industry or multi-employer agreements. Like many of the bills to do with industrial laws lately, its title, as the member for McMillan so aptly pointed out, is Orwellian by nature. Again, that is not a surprise. That is a consistent theme of many bills described by the government prior to the election and subsequent to it. Its objective, I would contend, seems to be more to stifle genuine bargaining than to facilitate it.
Indeed, it reminds me of that description of the individual agreements that came into our system not long ago—the so-called Australian workplace agreements or AWAs. What always struck me about AWAs was that they were hardly Australian in nature, given the fact they were a new provision to more than 90 years of industrial relations law. They were in fact a new and alien provision of the industrial relations system. They were hardly a workplace agreement because in fact each employee, in theory at the very least, was expected to negotiate their outcomes one-on-one with their employer as if to suggest that there would be an equal playing field between the employer and each individual employee. It was hardly a workplace agreement. Most pointedly, they were rarely agreements. Australian workplace agreements were quite often those things that would be signed if you wanted to be employed. To gain jobs, you would be asked to sign them. Therefore, they were not agreements in many respects in the genuine sense, most being imposed upon employees: `Sign this or the job's not yours.' They were not Australian and not of the workplace and not often agreements. So it should not surprise me in the least that a bill entitled Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 would not be about genuine bargaining but quite the contrary.
We should not be surprised by this situation. We saw the government's attitude only last week when it seemed very disappointed that the industrial dispute at BHP was resolved by the parties. We have seen this government's inclination towards sponsoring very extreme methods—by hooded men on occasions—and indeed it has certainly been associated with the sight of attack dogs on the waterfront. We see this government's obsession when every frontbencher seems to froth at the mouth, mouthing anti-union mantra every question time whether the question is with respect to industrial relations or not. We see this government's and its ministers' contempt for consensus or roundtable resolutions. Instead, this minister wishes to encourage employers to involve themselves in greater conflict and aggression in the workplace.
The government in fact rants and raves about militancy but indeed it exhibits manifestations of militancy itself. We see this government's hatred in its multimillion dollar witch-hunt, or so-called royal commission, into the building industry. Industrial disputation, as I said at the beginning of my address, is at an all-time low. But listening to the frontbenchers on the other side, you would not believe that is the case. The government would have you believe that the country was rife with industrial conflict. I think it is clear that the evidence shows that that is not the case. Indeed, I think it is outrageous for the government to continue to pretend otherwise.
It is also important to note that it was Labor that introduced the capacity to negotiate at the enterprise level. The coalition or the Liberal Party were in control for much of the time from 1949 to 1983, but they made no attempt prior to 1983 to do anything about providing any forms of enterprise bargaining. The Labor Party introduced enterprise bargaining.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I rise tonight to talk about the issue of the big end of town screwing the little end of town again. I raise a specific example which has affected a number of crash repairers in my electorate. This relates to the issue of large insurance companies failing to make payments to crash repairers who undertake work on cars within a reasonable period of time. In my electorate and in electorates around the country, crash repairers are undertaking crash repair work on cars but when they seek to get their money back from the insurance companies, they have to wait between 60 and 90 days to receive that payment. As a consequence of this lax practice by insurance companies, crash repairers around the country are going to the wall. As I understand it, 20 crash repairers have hit the fence as a consequence of this practice by insurance companies.
I represent about 25 crash repairers in my electorate and there are about 50 in the cities of Casey and Greater Dandenong. This is a primary issue of concern to them. It affects their very survival. I would like to pay tribute to the VACC, which has been representing its members. It has been surveying its members now for two years. Its findings are very interesting. It has put a spotlight on the rather unsavoury practices of some of these large insurance companies. The survey results have identified that 50 per cent of large insurance companies are waiting 45 to 60 days before they pay crash repairers. What does that mean in terms of delayed payments? What does it mean to crash repairers? What is the problem with delayed payments? Let me quote from a survey by the VACC which was carried out in April 2002. With regard to delayed payments, the survey says that it is about:
fairness and ethical business practices!
the time that is wasted by repairers following up with insurers on the phone!
repairers' obligation to pay their debtors on time!
the uncertainty the delays cause in cash flow management!
repairers obligation to pay taxes, such as the GST, on time in order to avoid fines!
repairers obligation to pay wages and salaries to their staff!
repairers getting fed up with insurers and repairers resorting to the use of factoring agents to get their payments ...
direct and indirect costs these delays cause!
In some instances, particularly in my electorate, crash repairers are waiting between 60 and 90 days to receive amounts of up to $70,000 or $80,000 back for the work that has been undertaken. A number of companies are having to resort to factoring agents. Because of these lax practices of insurance companies, these people are going to finance companies and saying, `We've got a problem because the major car insurers are not paying on time.' In a manner of speaking, they have to go to debt collecting agencies to get their money from major car insurers which have assets of close to a billion dollars or $500 million. If you are a small business in the Dandenong area you have to ring up a finance company and beg them to get the payment from the major insurer. That is an absolute disgrace. It is a situation that should not be allowed to continue.
The survey I have referred to asked for reasons for delay in payments. It surveyed most of the crash repairers which are involved with the VACC. The major reason for the delays of between 60 and 90 days was that the files were not at hand. Some 60 per cent of respondents said the reason why it took between 60 and 90 days to get their money—the period of time which is basically throwing these crash repairers against the wall—was because they did not have the file. Other reasons included because the files were lost. You have $70,000 to $80,000 worth of bills and when the crash repairer rings up the major car insurer and says, `I want my payment. Where is it?' the answer is, `I'm sorry, I don't have the file at hand.' This is an absolutely ridiculous practice. There has to be some legislation which addresses this issue. There has to be a situation where crash repairers around this country do not have to go begging to finance companies to collect their debts.
It is quite clear that 50 per cent of major car insurance companies in this country are just not going to be responsible so they have to be encouraged to be responsible through legislation. That means that we should legislate in some way, shape or form. We have the mechanisms in both the state and federal spheres to ensure that these companies meet their obligations and pay within 30 or 45 days.
