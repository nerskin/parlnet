Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill will amend the National Consumer Credit Protection Act and the Privacy Act. This important reform will require our four largest banks to participate fully in the comprehensive credit reporting system, delivering benefits to lenders and borrowers alike, while preserving and enhancing the important security and consumer protections enshrined in the Privacy Act.


In introducing this bill today, we are implementing a commitment that the government set out in its response to the Productivity Commission's landmark inquiry into data availability and use, as announced at the time of the 2017-18 budget. In that report, the Productivity Commission recommended that we move to mandate participation in the comprehensive credit reporting system if less than 40 per cent of accounts were being reported in mid-2017. We agreed with this recommendation, giving industry a further six months to meet the target.


When the government announced our commitment to legislate in November 2017, there was simply no prospect that the target would be met by the end of the year.


Australians have been waiting for comprehensive credit reporting for a long time. The amendments to the Privacy Act establishing the voluntary comprehensive credit reporting system were passed by this House in 2012, following extensive consideration by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The financial system inquiry recommended that the financial system take up comprehensive credit reporting in 2014. The industry standard for comprehensive credit reporting—the Principles of Reciprocity and Data Exchange—was authorised by the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission in 2015.


And yet, as of last year, Australia was still waiting for industry to move forward on this issue.


This is why we are committing to this legislation. Australia is an international laggard in credit reporting. Many of our largest trading partners—including the United States of America, the UK, New Zealand and Japan—have well-established comprehensive credit reporting systems. On this matter, we are falling behind even developing economies such as South Africa and India.


But movement forward in Australia has been stymied by the lack of a 'critical mass' of credit reporting data.


There is a critical first mover problem at play here—without sufficient data in the comprehensive credit reporting system, there is very little benefit for any individual credit provider to invest the time and capital required in building systems and arrangements to access it.


This lack of data means that lenders have a more difficult task meeting their responsible lending obligations. It means that more loans are declined by lenders who simply cannot verify a customer's creditworthiness. And it means that many loans are mispriced, leaving borrowers with good credit histories paying higher interest rates than they otherwise would.


With this legislation, we are changing that equation.


The major banks account for more than 80 per cent of household lending, and hence hold a huge quantity of credit information. Our expectation is that the inclusion of this data in the system, alongside the industry-established principles of reciprocity, will create a 'critical mass' of credit data that provides strong incentives for smaller credit providers to participate in the credit reporting system.


This bill sets out the mandatory credit information fields that must be provided by the major banks to eligible credit reporting bureaus—identification information, payment information, default information, credit liability information, repayment history information, and new arrangement information.


The major banks must supply mandatory credit information on 50 per cent of all eligible accounts within a 90-day window from 1 July 2018, and on their remaining accounts within a 90-day window from 1 July 2019.


This information must be supplied to every eligible credit reporting body—that is, every credit reporting body that meets the standards under the Privacy Act, and had a contract with the bank on 2 November 2017.


This means in effect that every major bank will be required to supply the mandatory credit information to Australia's three largest credit reporting bodies—Equifax, Experian and Illion.


While the bill limits the initial mandatory bulk supply to these three bodies, nothing in the bill prevents additional credit reporting bodies from entering into supply agreements with credit providers and competing with the established bodies. The government strongly supports competition in the credit reporting market.


Once the major banks have supplied the required information, credit providers will be able to access the information from the credit reporting bodies in the event that a customer makes a credit inquiry, alongside analysis and credit scores based on this information.


This means that credit providers will be able to make lending and risk pricing decisions on the basis of comprehensive information, rather than a small fragment of the overall picture.


All lenders who participate in comprehensive credit reporting will have an enhanced capacity to meet their responsible lending obligations. Those obligations are an important part of consumer protection arrangements.


Small credit providers, including innovative fintech firms and new entrants, will be better able to serve customers and assess the lending capacity of potential borrowers.


Placing smaller lenders on a more level playing field with the major banks, in respect of access to credit information, will drive competition in the consumer lending market.


Greater competition in the lending market should benefit consumers, by being offered greater access to finance and better pricing.


Those customers who are currently disadvantaged by the existing negative system—by having a thin credit file, or by having a single default marked against them—will have a better chance to build and repair their credit history prior to applying for a major loan.


Small-business owners, entrepreneurs, and sole traders will be empowered to borrow to build their businesses on the basis of strong consumer credit histories.


We are alert to risks for vulnerable consumers. Nothing about this bill changes the important protections in the credit act against predatory or misleading conduct by credit providers. ASIC retains all its powers to act to protect customers from misconduct in the lending sector.


Customers who suffer from temporary hardships should not be impeded or discouraged from making appropriate arrangements with their credit providers.


To ensure that the provisions in the Privacy Act dealing with hardship cases remain appropriate, the Attorney-General has asked his department to conduct a review of the arrangements for hardship reporting under the Privacy Act and credit reporting code.


In this legislation, we are building on already-established frameworks to build the comprehensive credit reporting of the future. 


Through regulations under this bill, we will ensure that those banks and credit providers that are already supplying comprehensive credit data, including NAB, will continue to benefit from the protections and principles embedded in the existing industry established framework. 


Where credit providers and credit reporting bodies are subject to requirements under the bill, they will be subject to penalties if they fail to comply.


Enforcement of these requirements will be responsibility of ASIC, who will be granted the appropriate powers to collect information and require audits to confirm that these requirements are ultimately being met.


Credit providers and credit reporting bodies will also be required to provide statements to the Treasurer in January of 2019 and 2020 certifying their compliance with the initial supply provisions of the bill.


Clearly, industry is well placed to meet the timeframes and requirements set out in this bill, which align closely to existing industry standards.


The security of consumer information is of high importance to the government.


This bill strengthens the privacy and security provisions established under the Privacy Act.


We are well aware of the risks of data breaches and privacy infringements in the credit-reporting environment.


The government has already acted to strengthen the Privacy Act's approach to data breaches, with the mandatory Notifiable Data Breaches scheme coming into effect in February of this year. That scheme introduced serious penalties for failing to appropriately notify customers of a data breach.


The Australian Information Commissioner will continue to have oversight of the management of Australians' personal data, including credit information.


All requirements for credit providers and credit reporting bodies to maintain security standards and protect data against unlawful access or misuse will continue to operate.


In addition, we are extending the security provisions under the Privacy Act to ensure that all credit reporting bodies store their data in Australia, or in a secure cloud service certified by the Australian Signals Directorate. 


And we are requiring credit providers to satisfy themselves that a credit-reporting body is meeting reasonable security standards, before they supply the mandatory credit information. Under their existing bilateral arrangements, banks already perform audits and ensure that the credit-reporting bodies continue to upgrade their security systems to meet the changing environments of various threats. These important activities will continue under the comprehensive credit-reporting system.


The inclusion of these provisions follows extensive consultation with industry, consumer groups, and security agencies, and will allow Australians to rest easy, knowing that their credit reporting information is stored safely and securely.


In addition to the security provisions, this bill allows for innovation and change in the credit-reporting sector.


Should new means of information exchange be developed, or new industry frameworks for credit sharing come into existence, the bill will allow for that through the prescribing of regulations.


If it becomes apparent that mandatory supply should be extended to cover second-tier credit providers, the bill will allow for that through, again, the prescribing of regulations.


The bill also contains a statutory review provision, with a review to be completed by 1 January 2022.


We expect that this review will provide an opportunity for the government to confirm that the system is operating as intended; and to consider the impacts of the system on consumers and industry, whether the scope of the system should be expanded, and whether alternate frameworks for credit reporting would be more appropriate given technological changes or, again, changes in the security environment.


In closing, I note that this bill will bring Australia into line with our international peers, by ensuring that our largest banks participate fully in the comprehensive credit-reporting system.


We expect that consumers and small businesses will see the benefits of this scheme, as the lending market becomes more competitive and more effective at delivering loans.


The extensive consultation undertaken in developing the bill will ensure that the approach taken is both workable and effective.


As always, full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum. 


Debate adjourned.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Social Services) (09:52):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Statute Update (Autumn 2018) Bill 2018 makes minor and technical changes to the Commonwealth statute book to improve its quality and accuracy.


Statute law revision acts and statute stocktake acts have been passed on a regular basis since 1934 as a means of removing obsolete and spent provisions from the statute book and correcting mistakes in drafting. They are traditionally non‑controversial and regarded as an essential means of keeping the Commonwealth statute book accurate and up-to-date.


The process of statute law revision and update aims to enhance the clarity and efficient use of the statute book. These bills:


make improvements to legislation to take into account changes to drafting precedents and procedures


correct technical errors in legislation that have arisen from drafting clerical mistakes; and


repeal spent and obsolete acts and provisions of acts.


This bill contains six schedules.


Schedule 1 corrects errors in five principal acts and makes minor technical improvements to clarify the text of the law.


Schedule 2 amends four acts to replace outdated references to 'the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia' with references to 'Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand'.


Schedule 3 to the bill makes amendments to the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 which are consequential to the enactment of the Acts and Instruments (Frameworks Reform) Act 2015. These amendments provide additional guidance on the application of sunsetting and disallowance provisions of the Legislation Act 2003 and update superseded references to the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 to the Legislation Act 2003.


Schedule 4 repeals 22 obsolete references to the Crown in right of Norfolk Island, reflecting the abolition of that body politic on 1 July 2016.


Schedule 5 repeals spent provisions in two acts.


Schedule 6 repeals 40 amending acts which are now obsolete.


These ongoing corrections and improvements to legislation are important to ensure that the Commonwealth statute book remains up to date, accurate and user friendly.


Debate adjourned.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health) (10:29):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Private health insurance is an essential and valuable part of Australia's health system. This government is committed to making private health insurance affordable for the more than 13 million Australian families, young people and older Australians with private health cover.


People with private health insurance have the benefit of their choice of doctor, timing of treatment and, in many cases, shorter waiting times. They also obtain coverage for some health services not included under Medicare.


Last October, I announced the most significant package of private health insurance reforms in over a decade to make private health insurance simpler and more affordable for Australians. The reforms will help strengthen the viability of the private health system by addressing concerns about affordability, complexity and lack of transparency of private health insurance.


The private health insurance reform package was the result of extensive consultation, including through the Private Health Ministerial Advisory Committee and with a wide range of organisations representing service providers, hospitals, insurers and consumers.


The reform package has already resulted in lower premiums for consumers. From 1 April 2018, health insurance policyholders will face an average weighted premium increase of 3.95 per cent; the lowest premium change in 17 years—lower than any year under the ALP's previous government by a considerable margin.


And, of course, the government continues to spend over $6 billion per year on the private health insurance rebate which helps to make private health insurance affordable.


I am introducing three bills today:


the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2018;


the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Amendment (Excess Levels for Private Health Insurance Policies) Bill 2018; and


the Medicare Levy Amendment (Excess Levels for Private Health Insurance Policies) Bill 2018.


The first bill I want to introduce is the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2018.


This bill will amend the Private Health Insurance Act 2007(the act) and associated legislation to support a number of the reforms I announced last year.


Specifically, this bill will:


allow for discounts of up to 10 per cent for Australians under 30 years of age for hospital cover, which will help bring young people into the private health system and provide them discounts right through until they are 40 and, in some cases, beyond;


strengthen the powers of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman;


allow private health insurers to cover travel and accommodation costs as part of a hospital product for people attending health services, in particular benefiting Australians in rural and regional areas;


improve information provision for consumers;


reform the administration of second-tier default benefits arrangements for hospitals;


increase maximum excess levels for products providing an exemption from the Medicare levy surcharge; and


facilitate the termination of closed products and migration of people to new products.


This bill will also improve consumer transparency by removing the use of benefit limitation periods in policies and ensure that consumers who have purchased benefit limitation period inclusive policies since the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 was introduced do not need to repay premium rebates they have received, are not retrospectively liable for the Medicare levy surcharge and are not liable for lifetime health cover loadings.


I thank all of the members of the House for their work in supporting this process. I particularly thank all of the consumers and policyholders who have provided feedback and all of the members of the advisory committee. I particularly want to acknowledge the work of Rachel David and Matthew Koce, representing both small and large insurers right across the spectrum. Also, the hospitals and the device makers. The MTAA has played a critical role in the ability of Australians to have the lowest change in premiums in 17 years.


I specifically want to acknowledge the work of my principal adviser, Alex Caroly, in my office, who has moved heaven and earth to help bring about these reforms to ensure not just that private health is more affordable but that there is better mental health coverage, better rural and remote coverage and better transparency in terms of simplicity.


Above all else, I want to note that it is essential for the health of our nation that we continue to maintain a strong and competitive private health insurance market. The proposals from those on the other side of this chamber, for what would amount to a 16 per cent increase in private health insurance costs by taking away the most affordable entry-level private health products, would be utterly devastating to private health insurers, therefore to private hospitals and therefore to public hospital waiting lists.


By contrast, we believe deeply and passionately in the Australian hybrid model, which ensures that people have choice, people have the ability to elect into private health and, from that, they also have peace of mind. That protects our system and it protects individuals. Therefore, the measures outlined in this bill will support these reforms and that system.


I commend this bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Facilities to support naval operations in the north. 


The Department of Defence proposes to construct a new wharf at HMAS Coonawarra in Darwin to support the Navy and the Australian Defence Force more broadly. Darwin is strategically vital for Australia's defence, being the only port capable of providing war facilities to support naval maritime activities conducted in the region. Competition for wharf space in Darwin has increased a lot over the years, and the new wharf will alleviate current constraints. The project will also include the construction of a new fuel facility that will store larger quantities of fuel for berthed vessels. This project aligns with the 2016 defence white paper's advice on the importance of key enabling capabilities of defence bases. The paper foreshadows the upgrading of HMAS Coonawarra to support the new offshore patrol vessels.


This project will employ up to 240 skilled contractors and construction workers. The estimated project cost is $272.6 million, excluding GST; future personnel and operating costs are estimated at $4.1 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to start in October 2019 and be completed by mid-2023. I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Larrakeyah Barracks redevelopment project. 


The Department of Defence proposes to redevelop the Larrakeyah Defence Precinct in Darwin, Northern Territory, which encompasses HMAS Coonawarra and the Larrakeyah Barracks, to address shortcomings in engineering services, accommodation and infrastructure. Addressing the deficiencies in infrastructure will allow for future expansion and population growth in the area. The 2016 defence white paper identifies the importance of key enabling capabilities of defence bases and foreshadowed the upgrading of Larrakeyah Barracks and HMAS Coonawarra to support more offshore patrol vessels and enable ADF operations and exercises.


This project also supports HMAS Coonawarra as a key maritime precinct and home port for 12 Armidale class patrol boats. The precinct provides support functions to ADF troops, and major fleet units for joint and combined operations as well as humanitarian and disaster relief. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $223 million, excluding GST. The cost includes upgrading North-West Mobile Force accommodation, a new shared user facility, upgrade to the base entry precinct, and improving electrical potable water and firefighting infrastructure, sewerage, and stormwater works, and ICT infrastructure.


The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants, contractors and construction workers. Opportunities for upskilling and on-the-job training are anticipated. The project will employ about 290 personnel and an average construction workforce of 130 personnel. The Larrakeyah Barracks is home to 700 personnel, which comprise ADF personnel, contractors, public servants and United States Marine Corps. It also supports 147 Defence Housing Authority homes.


Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in September 2018 and be completed by June 2023. I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Stage two of the Garden Island (East), Critical Infrastructure Recovery Program, Sydney.


The Department of Defence is proposing to undertake repairs, installation and replacement works to wharfs and base-wide engineering services at Garden Island in Sydney. Stage 1 of the project addressed the remediation of the cruiser wharf and oil wharf. Following consideration by the Public Works Committee, the parliament agreed that it was expedient to carry out the work on 14 June 2017. Stage 2 of the Garden Island infrastructure recovery program will address the condition, capacity and compliance issues with the remaining wharves, engineering services and supporting infrastructure to ensure they are fit for purpose and able to support the Royal Australian Navy's current and future operational requirements.


The proposed work will include an upgrade of the electrical services and fuel network, and upgrade and repair selected portions of the hydraulic services. The work also extends to repair and upgrade the fleet-based east wharves and the east and west dock wharves. The 2016 defence white paper identified the important of key enabling capabilities of the Defence estate, including bases and wharves, and foreshadowed the upgrading of Garden Island to continue to support an expanded fleet and accommodate larger platforms, such as the Canberra-class amphibious ships. This capital investment in infrastructure at Garden Island will bring economic benefits to the local New South Wales economy, with short-term employment opportunities predominantly in the building, construction and labour markets. The works will also provide opportunities for suppliers involved in the manufacture and distribution of construction materials and equipment. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $286.5 million, excluding GST. This includes construction costs, escalation allowances, professional service fees, design, and construction and design contingencies. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled from late 2018 to late 2023. I commend the motion to the House.

The Department of Defence is proposing to upgrade the engine maintenance and testing facility at the RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, to maintain the fleet of classic Hornets, Super Hornets, Growlers and new F-35 aircraft. The 2016 defence white paperreinforces the importance of investing in vital enabling capability, including upgrading of testing facilities. The proposed work minimises the need for new infrastructure, as it will use the existing purpose-built facility with an upgrade and will provide the best value for money out of all the options considered. It is anticipated that throughout the project up to 120 personnel may be employed on-site at various stages and that a significant percentage of the tendered work packages will provide opportunities for local small- to medium-size enterprises.

As advised when this project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 7 December of last year, the Department of Defence is proposing to provide health facilities on Defence bases to meet its requirement of maintaining the health and wellbeing of Australian Defence Force personnel for operational preparedness. The 2016 defence white paper reinforced the importance of health care as a key military enabler. Defence proposes to upgrade existing Joint Health Command healthcare facilities at 13 locations around Australia. The Joint Health Command provides the Australian Defence Force with pre and post deployment and proactive health care for operational preparedness.


Existing health facilities have several issues affecting Joint Health Command's ability to deliver effective healthcare services, including ageing buildings, non-compliance with building codes and infection risks due to outdated facilities. A key objective of this project is to deliver facilities to support consistent and efficient health care across Defence. The project proposes to refurbish five existing health centres and construct eight new health centres, where it is not possible to refurbish or upgrade existing facilities. The project will generate employment opportunities in the construction sector in regional areas, including sites across most mainland states and territories.

As advised when this project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 7 December, the Department of Defence is proposing to undertake infrastructure works to support the upgrade of the existing aviation fuel tankers and elevating hydrant vehicle fleets. The proposed work is consistent with the fuel infrastructure upgrade policy set out in the 2016 defence white paper. This project will deliver new and upgraded facilities across 14 military air bases within Australia, and at the Royal Malaysian Air Force Base Butterworth.


The new aviation refuelling fleet will require supporting facilities, including fuel-spill containment, fuel-treatment systems, vehicle shelters, and vehicle circulation and access roads. The extent of the infrastructure works by site varies as a result of the differing allocations of equipment and the availability of appropriate space within existing infrastructure. The works will also sustain and provide training to the required deployable Australian Defence Force workforce to operate Defence or allied aviation refuelling vehicles.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Maritime Operational Support Capability facilities project.


The Department of Defence proposes to upgrade the facilities and infrastructure at HMAS Stirling in Rockingham, Western Australia, and the Garden Island defence precinct and Randwick Barracks in Sydney, New South Wales, to support the Maritime Operational Support Capability, MOSC, project. The Australian Defence Force will replace the ageing HMA ships Success and Sirius with a single class of auxiliary oiler replenishment vessels. 


The MOSC project will provide fit-for-purpose facilities and infrastructure to support the new vessels. The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants, contractors and construction workers and will include opportunities for upskilling and on-the-job training to improve employability prospects on future projects. The project will employ a construction workforce of about 65 personnel, with 50 at HMAS Stirling, and 15 at the Randwick Barracks. 


The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project is considered value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would once again like to thank the committee for again undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.


Question agreed to.

 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (12:55):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Facilities to support naval operations in the north. 


The Department of Defence proposes to construct a new wharf at HMAS Coonawarra in Darwin to support the Navy and the Australian Defence Force more broadly. Darwin is strategically vital for Australia's defence, being the only port capable of providing war facilities to support naval maritime activities conducted in the region. Competition for wharf space in Darwin has increased a lot over the years, and the new wharf will alleviate current constraints. The project will also include the construction of a new fuel facility that will store larger quantities of fuel for berthed vessels. This project aligns with the 2016 defence white paper's advice on the importance of key enabling capabilities of defence bases. The paper foreshadows the upgrading of HMAS Coonawarra to support the new offshore patrol vessels.


This project will employ up to 240 skilled contractors and construction workers. The estimated project cost is $272.6 million, excluding GST; future personnel and operating costs are estimated at $4.1 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to start in October 2019 and be completed by mid-2023. I commend the motion to the House.

Mr ZIMMERMAN
 (North Sydney) (13:14):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, I present the committee's report, incorporating dissenting reports, on the inquiry into the use and marketing of electronic cigarettes and personal vaporisers, together with the minutes of proceedings.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr ZIMMERMAN:
  by leave—Approximately 2.4 million Australians smoke cigarettes daily, and it has been estimated that two out of every three smokers will die prematurely due to their smoking. Given these stark figures, reducing the number of Australians who smoke is one of the nation's most important public health objectives. This committee has spent close to a year examining whether e-cigarettes could assist in meeting that objective. The Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport has a long history of delivering consensus and bipartisan reports. On this occasion, that has not been possible and I find myself in the unusual position as chair of co-authoring a dissenting report. The committee has been presented with starkly conflicting views during this inquiry, and I respect those committee members who have formed different judgements to my own. I do, however, disagree with the conclusions reached by the majority of my colleagues. The majority on the committee made five recommendations, including two-yearly reviews of the evidence, an international gathering of experts, a national approach to non-nicotine e-cigarettes, including greater regulation of colours and flavourings, and a continuation of the Therapeutic Goods Administration's role in classifying nicotine. I present a dissenting report, along with my colleague the member for Goldstein. The member for Bowman has also submitted a dissenting report, which concurs with our conclusions.


Australia has been a global leader in developing tobacco control policies. This approach has been very successful. Between 1991 and 2013, the proportion of Australians smoking daily dropped from 24 per cent to 12.8 per cent. If recent years, however, progress has stalled, with the daily smoking rate only dropping from 12.8 per cent to 12.2 per cent between 2013 and 2016. It is highly unlikely Australia will reach its 2018 target of reducing smoking to 10 per cent of the population. In these circumstances, a new approach is needed for those smokers who have been unable to quit smoking using the assistance currently available. We need another weapon in the arsenal. That's why our dissenting report recommends that e-cigarettes containing nicotine should be made legal. We know that nicotine is highly addictive. Quitting is hard and many smokers have unsuccessfully tried repeatedly. Based on the evidence presented to the committee, e-cigarettes may be an answer for many of these people. While the evidence base regarding e-cigarettes is still emerging, there are clear indications that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful to human health than smoking tobacco cigarettes. If long-term smokers who have been unable to quit smoking tobacco cigarettes switched to e-cigarettes, thousands of lives could be saved. One medical researcher whom the committee met in New Zealand put the choice starkly. As she said, if a patient has earnestly tried existing ways of quitting but failed, then, knowing the consequences of that patient continuing to smoke, how could a medical practitioner morally and ethically not recommend they consider e-cigarettes?


Despite the potential health gains, Australia's public health community has been resistant to the idea of making e-cigarettes legally available. This stands in contrast to many of their counterparts in the United Kingdom and New Zealand who gave evidence to the committee. Many members of our health community are concerned that legally available nicotine e-cigarettes may, by extension, make smoking attractive to young people. This is what is referred to as the 'gateway effect'. In those countries where nicotine e-cigarettes are legally available, however, there has not been an increase in youth smoking. In fact, smoking rates among young people continue to fall in jurisdictions where e-cigarettes are available. If e-cigarettes are made legal, we need the right regulatory environment, particularly one that recognises the need to prevent young people from taking up vaping. Restrictions should be imposed to limit the appeal of e-cigarettes to young people and nonsmokers. In this regard, the European Union and the United Kingdom provide excellent regulatory models.


In conclusion, I would like to thank the organisations, agencies and individuals who participated in this inquiry, especially those individuals who shared their personal experiences using e-cigarettes. The committee also heard from witnesses from the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and I thank them for the insight they provided. Finally, I would like to thank my committee colleagues for the consideration of the evidence during what has been a difficult inquiry, and the committee staff for their work, which is always exceptionally professional. I commend the report and, obviously, the dissenting reports to the House.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (13:19):  by leave—I stand here in the very unusual circumstances of being the deputy chair and member of the opposition presenting the majority report of the electronic cigarettes and personal vaporisers in Australia inquiry in use and marketing.


As deputy chair of the committee I would have preferred, and my preference would have been, to have nicotine e-cigarettes evaluated by independent health experts and not politicians. I don't think we're in a position to make scientific judgements on what is harmful and what isn't. We know conclusive evidence, for many years, has shown us that nicotine and tobacco cause cancer and many other illnesses.


I respect the views of the chair of the committee and I congratulate him on chairing the inquiry, always giving everyone the opportunity to talk and ensuring that all views were heard. Having said that, once the committee made that decision and was commissioned by the government to investigate e-cigarettes, it was useful to hear from people around the country and overseas about the negative impacts of smoking and e-cigarettes and their usage here in Australia and in other parts of the world. This includes, as you heard from the member for North Sydney, New Zealand and the UK, where we heard evidence from their health departments, from people involved in this particular industry and from people who had done research in this area.


The terms of reference into this particular report were the use and marketing of e-cigarettes and personal vaporisers and how they may assist people quit smoking, and the health impacts of the use of e-cigarettes and personal vaporisers. This is the area where the majority members of the committee felt that the evidence of health impacts of the use of e-cigarettes and that they cause no harm was not actually there. We accept the fact that they may cause less harm. But that is not a reason to go all-out and ensure that they are sold and marketed, because the evidence is still out. We don't know what the long-term effects are. One of the recommendations in the report says that more research needs to be done and that the research needs to be looked at, perhaps, by members of this committee or other committees every so often to see where it's up to.


One of the other terms of reference was the international approach to legislating and regulating the use of e-cigarettes. We looked at the different jurisdictions around the world, including the UK and New Zealand, and the appropriate regulatory framework for e-cigarettes and personal vaporisers in Australia. In New Zealand we met with the Minister for Health, the select parliamentary New Zealand health committee, the acting high commissioner in New Zealand, the New Zealand Ministry of Health, the technical experts advisory group on electronic cigarettes, and the New Zealand cancer society.


As a reformed smoker myself, I'm extremely wary of experts placed in front of the committee that are sponsored by big tobacco, or of people who, perhaps, receive some form of payment for work done by big tobacco. So I was very dubious of some of the so-called experts that were giving evidence to our committee. My office also received some odd calls during the report process from so-called concerned smokers who certainly had very well-crafted talking points which seemed to be very similar and very well-rehearsed.


The committee does normally work in a coordinated manner, and it did. But this is, I suppose, the first time in my memory—or in my experience here in this House—where the chair has a dissenting report and the deputy chair is presenting the majority report. What I'd really like to note is that one of the things that we on the committee were fairly united on was the TGA—that if, in the future, there is evidence that shows there is no health impact on people, it should go through the TGA. We know that there has already been an application and one that's already been rejected by the TGA, which was an application to allow nicotine use in e-cigarettes. That was in March 2017, I think. There are paragraphs in the report that refer to this. Committee members also noted that the National Health and Medical Research Council concluded in April 2017:


… policy makers should act to minimise the harm of nicotine e-cigarettes until 'evidence of safety, quality and efficacy can be produced'.


That submission to the committee was very hard evidence saying that unless we have more evidence, unless there is more research, we should refrain from changing anything.


This report also gave big tobacco what I think was an absolutely appalling opportunity to influence tobacco policy in Australia. We in this country have prided ourselves on being constantly at the forefront of doing all that we can as governments and agencies to ensure that people have the right information and the tools and assistance to give up tobacco. That is happening at a very fast pace, as we heard the member for North Sydney say earlier. The fact that big tobacco companies were not able to influence, because the committee took very seriously the evidence that we received, but were able to have a voice—to have a platform—is something that we should be wary of. We should ensure that we don't allow them to have a voice, because we've seen the way that they have acted in the past. We've seen the way that they have treated the Australian public for many, many years.


I think the committee said that it wanted to follow the advice of independent experts on nicotine and e-cigarettes. We saw that hard-core smokers in some places could come off nicotine tobacco products and go on to vaping and e-cigarettes. Even though it was less harmful, we still don't have the evidence to show that there is no health impact from e-cigarettes. Until we get that evidence, until science and experts can say that there is no impact on health, we should be very cautious in this area.


I would like to thank the secretariat and my fellow colleagues—the chair, the member for North Sydney—but especially Stephanie Mikac, the secretary; Caitlin Cahill; Timothy Brennan, who accompanied us to New Zealand; Carissa Skinner; and all the other staff members, because I think they do a great, great job in supporting committees. We have seen it firsthand. Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, you were the deputy chair of the Health and Ageing Committee when I was the chair a few years back, and you have seen firsthand the great work that they do. I make the point that without those people supporting and assisting us we wouldn't be able to do these things.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (13:30):  I recently met with local GetUp! members regarding their very legitimate concerns about the Turnbull government's proposed actions about donation legislation affecting charities and advocacy groups. The proposal by the government seeks to deny legitimate organisations, such as GetUp!, the right to contribute to the political landscape. It's also clear that many charitable and not-for-profit organisations will be prevented from advocating for a fairer and just Australia if the government persists with this action in this form. It's an outcome that would ultimately be bad for democracy and it has the capacity to silence legitimate political debate in this country.


In my electorate of Richmond there are over 11,000 registered GetUp! members joining hundreds of thousands more across Australia. These people seek to engage Australians in the democratic process by giving them a voice on important issues. Members of these groups also want to show their support by making legitimate donations to these organisations, and the government's legislation would impose exacting compliance regimes on those organisations and the charity sector, making it difficult for people to provide the financial support needed to engage in the political debate.


Labor's committed to reforming the political donation system to ensure our democracy is protected from improper influence from overseas. We're proud of continuously fighting for improved transparency and much greater accountability in Australia's political donation system. However, we are concerned the government has overreached with the legislation as it is in its current form. We want to find a sensible way to ban foreign donations without selling out charitable organisations that do incredibly important work right throughout our community.


I'd like to conclude by thanking those GetUp! members in my electorate for taking the time to meet with me and sharing their concerns. I encourage them to keep up the great work they do— (Time expired)

We very rarely get answers from the government, but today we did get an answer. It was elusive. It was only one answer hidden in the thicket of government nonreplies, but the Prime Minister today has made it very clear that he will take his corporate tax cuts to the next election. Whilst I do not agree with his position, I do acknowledge that he answered the question. I just want to advise him and his representatives in this government that we are up for the next election being a referendum on whether this nation should give $65 billion to large corporations or whether we should be a nation that prioritises the needs of middle-class and working-class Australians. We will have this fight on the Turnbull government's corporate tax cuts.


At the next election there will be two very different visions offered for the future of this nation to the people of Australia. The government's agenda is very clear: a $65 billion handout to multinationals, to big banks and to large corporations and raising the taxes for working Australians who earn less than $87,000 a year. Labor, by contrast, will offer the following vision to the Australian people: lower taxes for families, higher wages for workers, and better schools and hospitals for all Australians. We stand for the fair go. That's the choice. That's the contest, and the contest starts now. Let me make something very clear: Labor will go to the next election promising to repeal the Prime Minister's multibillion dollar handout for big business, if it passes the Senate. 


Let us not hear any more from the government about being 'the party for lower taxes', because the government actually have two pieces of tax legislation in the Senate. They've got their tax giveaway for their friends at the top end of town, but they have another piece of legislation. It's a tax increase for nurses and teachers, police officers, childcare workers and mechanics; a tax increase of $300 for someone who earns $60,000; a tax increase of $350 for someone earning $70,000. This Prime Minister wants to punish working Australians. Labor just chooses to protect them. 


Politics is all about priorities. The government wants the parliament to sign a cheque for $65 billion out of the nation's ATM, and it has to be paid for. This government loves to misquote Labor. Whenever Labor have supported changes in corporate taxation, we've replaced that revenue with other revenue. We hear this Prime Minister cherrypick our arguments: dishonest then, dishonest now, dishonest into the future. The reality is this government has pretended to the Australian people that it can take $65 billion out of the budget and there is nothing to be explained. It doesn't explain where the money is coming from. But we have a problem in this country. Our hospitals are still too crowded. Waiting lists for surgery are too long. Schools are not appropriately funded. TAFEs are still closing. Child care is still too expensive and too hard to find. Cities, suburbs and regions are crying out for new roads and ports, rail and bridges and airports, and a first-rate NBN. Older Australians are still waiting in greater numbers than ever for aged-care packages, and the wages for Australian workers are simply too low.


What will we have at the end of Mr Turnbull's $65 billion tax giveaway? Nothing. We could be using that money to repair the budget and pay down the debt. We could be using it to invest in the future of our economy, in the luck we make ourselves, in our people, in education, in skills, in training and in apprenticeships. You do not deliver a prosperous middle class and working class in this country by throwing money at big banks. You do it by investing in new industries, skilling up workers and helping adults retrain for the jobs of the future. You do it by supporting a decent wage, including penalty rates for people who will be working on the upcoming public holidays this Easter. This is the Labor way: new industries, skilled workers, productive businesses and higher wages. 


Labor has a strategy for growth. We have proposed the Australian investment guarantee. We will support businesses to immediately deduct an extra 20 per cent of their investments in eligible depreciable assets. This means trucks and utes for tradies, and machinery, plant and equipment for productivity-boosting innovation in industry, and also depreciable intangible assets for purchases like software upgrades. We want to actually invest scarce taxpayer money on the direct promise that companies invest back in productivity. This government wants to give away $65 billion with no promises and no strings attached. We are happy to help companies invest in job creation, in productivity growth and better wages, but we want to see something for the taxpayer support they receive. 


Then we look at what this government wants to do with $65 billion. Sixty cents in every dollar of this government's $65 billion giveaway will go straight overseas. This wasn't a socialist think tank—it wasn't the Australia Institute, the 'Cuban Institute' or the 'North Korean Institute'—it was analysis from the former chief economist at Goldman Sachs. Sixty cents in every dollar—$39 billion taxpayer dollars—will go straight to multinational profits and overseas. I understand that the Prime Minister has always been a fan of sending money offshore, but I don't want him to do it with taxpayers' dollars! This is not a plan for Australian jobs or Australian wages. This is corporate welfare for multinational firms. This is foreign aid for foreign multinationals. 


Of course, our friends at the big Australian banks never go missing when there's Mr Turnbull in town. Some of the Australian businesses who will receive a benefit from this $65 billion of Australian taxpayer support will be the banks—Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ and NAB. This tax giveaway is a multibillion dollar bankers' bonus.


This royal commission of the banks, which this Prime Minister and Treasurer mocked, attacked, ridiculed and sneered at—and with their fingernail marks on the concrete were dragged to having—every day reveals worse conduct. What we have seen already is simply shocking. What is the government's response? They want to give the same banks billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, money which could be spent looking after the hospitals and schools of Australia.


There is nothing in this proposal guaranteeing wage increases for working Australians. Nothing. On the government's own numbers this $65 billion corporate largesse from the taxpayers of Australia to the big end of town is predicted to produce a 1.1 per cent increase in wages growth in 20 years time. That's $2 a working day, $10 a week, in 2037. Has anyone who dreamed up this corporate tax giveaway had a serious conversation with working Australians about the family budgets that they are dealing with every week?


How on earth could this government dream up a scheme which gives away so much money to large companies for so little result and, indeed—to be fair to big business—they haven't even bothered pretending that they're going to do anything for the government in return. I knew that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister weren't bright, but I never imagined that they were so out of touch that even their friends would not do anything for the $65 billion. Never has a conservative government worked so hard to spend so much money for so little result.


Of course, it's not just Labor saying this. What we saw, to justify the case—this clarion economic strategy of this beleaguered, one-trick-pony government—is that the government are running around with a two-lined letter from big business, 'Give us the money and we promise we will seriously consider thinking about an investigation into an inquiry into the potential to do something about wages one day.' This is only one step up from those email scams. Not as many typos, but the picture's the same. You know: 'Dear so-and-so, congratulations and hello my very good friend. Your long-lost relative, the prince of Nigeria, has died and left you everything. Just send money and we will release the funds.'


But it gets worse. Today we've learnt more about this piece of corporate spam, that the commitment to the Senate wasn't the original; it was the sequel. It was the executive director's cut: I know the Prime Minister drives a hard bargain:. 'Hello Percy; hello Murgatroyd. I need you to back me up here.' 'Yes, what do you want?' 'Commitment to jobs.' 'No, you can't have that.' 'Commitment to wages?' 'No, you can't have that.' 'Commitment to not offshoring?' 'Absolutely not!' 'We want you to commit to tax.' 'Oh, my goodness, old chap. What is going on here?' I'll tell you one thing: we want to be internationally competitive but not on corporate tax— (Time expired)

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2018-03-28,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (15:28):  This MPI talks about millionaires instead of ordinary Australians. Are the 875,000 retirees who will have to pay the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer's retirees' tax all millionaires? We've heard a succession of examples in the House today of self-funded retirees on ordinary incomes, on low incomes, who are going to have to suffer if this man, the Leader of the Opposition, is elected—him reaching his hand into their pocket and denying them credit for tax already paid.


Now everyone in this chamber, I assume, puts in a tax return. Some people here, and, certainly, millions of Australians, expect a small tax refund when they lodge their tax returns. What the Labor Party is now proposing is that 875,000 retirees—people who have paid tax their whole lives, people who have built this country to make it what it is and people who have put small sums of money aside to provide for themselves or to provide for a loved one in their retirement—are now going to have the Labor Party saying, 'You do not keep your tax refund.' Tax paid on your behalf, everyone else gets credit for; you don't. It is theft. It is theft masked in very flowery words.


Looking at the words of the shadow Treasurer just a fortnight ago in announcing this measure, when challenged, he said that this is a well-targeted measure and that Labor's reforms are carefully designed. He said Labor's reforms are properly designed and Labor's reforms are sensible. Then he got out and said: 'The government will run a scare campaign. We know that. This is a very well-designed policy.' What did we see yesterday? We saw the Labor Party admit this is a rotten, rotten policy. Changing it on the run, it's now so-called providing protection to 300,000 pensioners—protection from their own policy!—but, sadly, they are not going to protect 875,000 additional Australians who are now going to have their money stolen by the Labor Party.


Despite this backflip, there is incessant talk from the Leader of the Opposition and his team about millionaires. Let's have a look at some of these so-called millionaires who are going to have their tax refund stolen by the Labor Party. We heard about a few of them in question time. We've got Alan from Bunbury, who has an income of $40,000 a year. I challenge any of those on the other side to live off $40,000 a year. Alan has a small share portfolio—a very, very modest share portfolio—and of his $40,000 of income, 25 per cent of that, or $10,000 out of the $40,000, is represented by this refund of tax paid on his behalf. So the Labor Party is saying to Alan in Bunbury, 'No, we're going to take $10,000 off you and you can live off $30,000.' Are these the millionaires the Labor Party are referring to? Are these the millionaires the Leader of the Opposition was just speaking about?


What about Colin? We've got another person here. Colin is a self-funded retiree. He said: 'We don't want to receive any pension from the government. We have a small portfolio invested in Australian shares.' The franking credits—the tax refund—represents 30 per cent of his income. They will have $12,000 ripped out of their pocket every year due to the retirees tax put forward by the Labor Party. Is Colin, with 30 per cent of his income now stolen by the Labor Party, a millionaire?


What about Graham? Graham said: 'My wife and I worked for over 40 years, diligently saving and placing funds into our super account to enable us to be self-funded when we retired. Now you and your Labor Party are proposing to change the rules if elected. Your proposal to take franking credits from our share portfolio will reduce our annual income—an income of under $40,000—by 20 to 25 per cent.' Are Graham and his wife the millionaires that the Labor Party keep incessantly talking about?


The Labor Party might think this humiliating backdown has somehow salvaged this policy, but this policy is rotten to the core. What we saw yesterday in their humiliating backdown of what was called a well-calibrated, well-targeted policy just a fortnight ago, is just the first cut. There are 875,000 decent, hardworking Australians who have paid taxes their whole lives, who have contributed to this country and who have set aside, in most cases, small sums of money or small parcels of shares to provide for themselves or a loved one in the future. They are going to be hit hardest. They're not going to let the Labor Party get away with it. And we're not going to let the Labor Party get away with it.


Every day you will hear examples of people like Colin, Graham or, for example, Campbell's mother, who we heard about today from the Treasurer. Campbell's mother is in an aged-care facility, is 91, has a small share portfolio and uses her tax refund to partly fund her nursing home fees. Is Campbell's mother, at 91, one of the so-called fat cat wealthy investor millionaires that the Labor Party keep incessantly talking about? Of course she's not.


This is why, between now and the next election, we will lay bare the Labor Party plan. The Labor Party plan is very simple, and I will give them some credit: they're at least naked in their ambition about it. The Labor Party want to create a big bucket of money that they take from hardworking retirees, 875,000 retirees, so they can go and splash it around the electorate to their favoured groups. 'So what do we do? We go and hit the easy targets.' That's what Labor said. 'Let's go and hit the easy targets, those retirees who have paid tax their whole life.'


The other part of this humiliating backdown from the Labor Party, attacking so-called millionaires, is that they said, 'We're protecting pensioners.' We all know the irony of pensioners requiring protection from their own policy, because 875,000 other people certainly aren't protected, but that was a lie as well, because if you're a pensioner from tomorrow, with a self-managed super fund, guess what: Labor's going to take your tax refund too. So after tomorrow we'll be back to square one: pensioners, low-income self-funded retirees and those with a self-managed super fund are in the gun from the Labor Party, just so the Labor Party can go and spend that on some favoured groups come election time, because they are addicted to spending and they cannot say no to any group who comes to them for money. So what do you do? You go and attack the people who are the easy targets.


Well, I've got a message for the Labor Party. I don't think those 875,000 low-income self-funded retirees are going to allow themselves to be an easy target. They are going to fight hard against this grossly unfair tax grab. This is the first cut to try and salvage this disastrous policy, this very well-calibrated policy—well, it was very well calibrated two weeks ago. It is going to suffer another cut, because this is rotten to the core. This policy is rotten to the core, and 875,000 Australians are not going to allow the Labor Party to get away with it.


We'll have one example after another of people like Colin, like Graham and like Campbell's mother—or what about Anthony, who said, 'I've got an income of $32,000, which will be reduced by $5,000'? The shadow Treasurer says, 'Anthony, on $32,000, you are a fat cat millionaire, and we want to take $5,000 off you.' Well, I can tell you: Anthony and his wife are not going to allow the shadow Treasurer to get away with this.


Yesterday's humiliating backdown is just the first cut. This cannot be salvaged, and we're going to assure all of those 875,000 Australians that the only way to protect themselves against the shadow Treasurer is to vote for the coalition at the next election. (Time expired)

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:38):  It's interesting, isn't it, that the member for Deakin doesn't want to talk at all about the $65 billion of big business tax cuts that his Prime Minister recommitted to today. I think it's really a tale of two letters, Mr Deputy Speaker. One is the letter that the Business Council of Australia finally sent to the Senate last week, which contains all of two sentences:


We believe that a reduction in the corporate tax rate, as proposed through the Government's enterprise tax plan, is urgent and vital to keep Australia competitive.


If the Senate passes this important legislation we, as some of the nation's largest employers, commit to invest more in Australia which will lead to employing more Australians and therefore stronger wage growth as the tax cut takes effect.


It does not say, 'We will increase wages'—nothing as simple as that, no.


The interesting letter is the letter that the Business Council of Australia members refused to sign, which actually is a very good letter. It's quite a detailed letter that sets the economic context and then says: 'Our commitment, the whole point of the Enterprise Tax Plan, is to create new and better jobs in Australia. Therefore the Business Council of Australia members offer the following commitment: if the Senate passes the Enterprise Tax Plan in full, we will (1) create more Australian jobs in the cities, towns, suburbs and bush.'


Why couldn't they put that in the final letter? Why is it that this didn't make the cut for the final letter? We know that this tax cut won't lead to new jobs, and the Business Council of Australia are not prepared to say that they will create new jobs. In social security, we've got mutual obligation. The government gives you something; you do something in return for that. You do volunteer work. You look for work. There is no mutual obligation when it comes to a $65 billion big-business tax cut. In fact, the promise that they've given is about as convincing as the commitments contestants make on Married at First Sight.


The next commitment that the Business Council were asked to sign up to was the commitment that they'll invest in more Australian projects and ideas, especially in remote and rural Australia. Were they prepared to sign up to that one? No, they were not prepared to sign up to that one. And how pathetically weak is One Nation that they were prepared to back the big-business tax cuts in return for 1,000 apprenticeships in the bush? There are 148,000 fewer apprentices across Australia right now than when we were in government, and One Nation's prepared to give away $65 billion in big-business tax cuts for 1,000 apprentices in the bush. It's incredible, too, isn't that, the National Australia Bank recorded a profit of $6.5 billion last year. Has that led to extra jobs? No, they actually cut 6,000 jobs.


So here we've got the Business Council of Australia not prepared to create more jobs. They're not prepared to invest in more Australian projects and ideas. Were they prepared to commit to being in a stronger position to avoid the offshoring of jobs? No, that one didn't make the cut either. They couldn't commit to less offshoring of Australian jobs. Could they commit to increasing wages when the conditions are right? They weren't even asked to commit to flat-out increasing wages—no. They can't even commit to increasing wages when the conditions are right. I'll tell you what: profits have grown 32 per cent over the last two years, and how much have wages grown in that time? They've grown by four per cent in the same time. You've got a 32 per cent increase in profits and wages are not even really keeping up with inflation. When will the conditions be right if a 32 per cent increase in profitability is not the right time to increase wages? You've got the Secretary to the Treasury, John Fraser, saying that he is worried about the severing of the link between increased profitability, increased productivity and increased wages. When will conditions be right?


Fifth, big business were asked to 'pay our tax and show our commitment by signing the ATO's tax transparency standard'. These people can't even commit to paying their tax. That didn't make the final cut of the letter they signed up to. I guess that it is no wonder because, in 2015, when we did tax transparency legislation, they fought us every step of the way and the Liberals and the Greens combined to vote against tax transparency. It's no wonder that they couldn't sign this letter, because they don't want to do any of this stuff.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2018-03-28,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (15:43):  The Leader of the Opposition made a very grand speech today, and he's painted the picture of a vision for two different Australias. Under a vision of a future with a Labor government, it is the everyday Australian being poorer. In a future under the coalition, it is everyday Australians being richer. In a future under Labor, small businesses are closing down. In a future under the coalition, small businesses are growing. In a future under Labor, job security is weak. In a future under the coalition, job security is strong. He talks of two visions, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who just gave her speech, was talking about, I think, two letters. I think the problem is that there are two worlds that the Labor Party are living in: the real world and the fake world. It's like when the little boy who is being naughty throwing stones at cars from the school playground suddenly smashes a window and is the first one in there to the teacher and saying, 'Sir, I saw somebody throwing stones at cars.' I think the psychologists call it something like psychological projection, where one decides to blame others for undertaking the unfortunate actions of oneself. Someone who is really rude might go around saying to everybody, 'Everyone else is rude.' This is exactly the strategy of the opposition because the Leader of the Opposition has stood up today and stated his future vision for this country—and he'll take it to the election—it is one of less tax, yet this is the party that is, in fact, opposed to lowering taxes.


This coalition government is in the business of lowering taxes. The opposition is doing everything to oppose it. The opposition believes in increasing taxes. Why does Labor wish to have higher taxes? Because they wish to take money out of the pockets of individuals to suck it in to the vortex of big government because they know if they can make Australians poorer and if they can make Australians less secure, they're going to be more reliant on big government. That is precisely what the opposition believes in: it's all about big government so you punish hardworking individuals, you rip into their pockets and take out the money, and you make their jobs insecure so they will turn around and be reliant on big government and, therefore, the Labor Party.


Then the Leader of the Opposition carries on saying he wants to protect people with hospitals and schools. So tell me this: why would the Labor Party ensure that teachers and nurses have to pay more money due to their taxes? How is that looking after teachers? How is that looking after nurses? Why should young families pay more money to buy a property—a family home—because of Labor's negative gearing policy? Why should young families be punished by Labor's taxes? Why shouldn't there be the right to deduct costs for managing one's own taxes? Again, it's everyday workers' money that will be stripped away by the Labor Party. We will have young entrepreneurs who will be forced to pay higher income taxes. We will have farmers who'll be slugged with higher capital gains taxes. Why? Because they want to suck it into the vortex of big government—that's all the Labor Party does.


There is one exception—and let's give them credit—where the Labor Party actually did not try to take a higher tax revenue. You know what it was? They opposed the tax avoidance legislation for multinationals. Seven billion dollars a year is forecast but, no, they don't want to take it off multinationals; they want it to take it off mums and dads. They want to ruin the lives of individual Australians because they believe, by making them poorer and by making them weaker, they're going to turn to big government, and that's where Labor has its sweet spot. We will stand by lower taxes and we will absolutely fight Labor every inch of the way.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:48):  I'm delighted to hear the member for Fairfax announce on behalf of the Liberal and National parties they're there for lower taxes. I'm delighted to hear they are going to stand for workers against higher taxes. And, therefore, I assume the honourable member is going to cross the floor and vote against the increase in income taxes that his government is proposing on every Australian earning more than $21,000. It's very Churchillian. They're going to take the money out of the pockets of individuals. Yes, they are. They want higher taxes on Australians who earn between $21,000 and $87,000 a year—teachers and nurses.


This side of the House stands for lower taxes and that side of the House stands for taxing them more. The Prime Minister told the House today how much he admires childcare workers. Perhaps he could show that admiration by not taxing them more. Put aside their very legitimate industrial relations concerns, maybe he could start with not taxing them more.


This week says it all about the values of this coalition government. There are 694 days since the last federal budget, and the next sitting day will be budget day. It says it all about this government that they've spent all their time trying to get a $65 billion corporate tax cut through the other House, at the same time as proposing a $44 billion tax rise on Australians—working Australians earning between $21,000 and $87,000 a year. A childcare worker earning $45,000 a year, not a generous sum, they want to tax $225 a year. With a deficit of $23 billion what they want to do is give away a corporate tax cut and tax Australians more, working Australians. So we'll have no lectures about tax from this mob over here. They don't believe in lower tax; they believe in different tax. They believe in taxing working Australians more and they believe in taxing business less. That's what they believe in.


The other thing is those opposite love a good scare campaign. The Prime Minister's never happier than when he can launch a scare campaign. He's not very good at it—he's no Tony Abbott—but he still likes to try. The other thing they've done is launch their defence of the dividend imputation refundability policy. What they believe in is a system that no other country in the world has. What they believe in is a system in which people who own shares and who have paid no income tax should be paid a refund even though they haven't paid that tax. That's their big driving philosophy. That's what they believe. They believe that the budget emergency is so bad, that the debt and deficit disaster is so bad, that we should spend $6 billion a year sending refunds to people who haven't paid tax.


Let us deal once and for all with this double taxation nonsense. The government says it's double taxation. They would be right if the Labor Party were proposing to tax dividends. If we were proposing to say, 'If you receive $10,000 or $20,000 worth of dividends, we will tax you at your marginal rate or we'll tax you at some special rate,' but that is not what is being proposed. Take the government's theory to its natural conclusion. Let's just live in a world for a moment where the shares in Australia are all owned by people over 65 who pay no tax and who have tax-free superannuation. The company paid—those companies that do pay tax—its tax rate and then distributed its dividends to its shareholders, retirees. Then, under this government's model, they sent a refund for all that tax paid to the shareholders. How much money would be raised from Australia's companies? Zero. It's their model of taxation in Australia—absolutely no tax paid under their model.


Not only is Australia the only country in the world with fully refundable dividend imputation, most tax concessions are not refundable. If you're a tradie you can claim your expenses and you can reduce your taxable income, but once you're down to zero you don't get negative income tax. You don't get sent a cheque by the government. Malcolm Turnbull will defend the right of some of Australia's wealthiest investors to the death to get their tax refunds even if they haven't paid tax. Is he going to extend the same right to Australia's workers, to Australia's tradies? I don't think so. I'm not going to hold my breath for that to happen, because this Prime Minister knows whose side he's on, we'll give him that. We know whose side he's on. And we know whose side we're on and we're on the side of fairness in the tax system. We don't mind a fight when it comes to fairness and we'll fight this right up to the election. (Time expired)

"Gee, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-03-28,"



Mr GEE
 (Calare) (15:53):  How ironic it is that those opposite would have the gall to move this matter of public importance about ordinary Australians at the very moment that they're seeking to rip off the tax refunds of ordinary Australian retirees. It's breathtaking. The gall and the front of those opposite to bring this into this House today is absolutely breathtaking. There are 875,000 retirees who are going to affected by their tax grab. We are talking about tens of billions of dollars, about $56 billion, that they are trying to grab from the retirees of Australia.


The thing about it is, and you'd know from your own electorate, Deputy Speaker Hogan, that these are hardworking Australians who've spent their lives helping to build our nation, and helping to build our region and our communities. They have proceeded to do that with an expectation that the rules are the rules and that they would be able to retire on a certain amount of income, and all of that now has been snatched away from them by this extraordinary tax grab by those opposite. And you saw how badly planned the whole fiasco was when they've announced that they're backtracking on 300,000-odd pensioners. It's a flip flop. The people out there, the retirees, know that those opposite can't be trusted and they will be wondering what's next: what tax refund are they coming for next; how are they going to get their hands on my wallet next; and am I going to be able to retire beyond one, two, three, four or five years? 


Uncertainty now reigns supreme in Australia's retiree community. I think it's an extraordinarily shabby way to treat Australia's retirees, and those opposite should be ashamed of bringing this sort of MPI about ordinary Australians into the national parliament at the same time they're ripping off tens of billions of dollars of retirees' tax refunds. It's a shameful episode. 


What this government is doing for ordinary Australians is probably the best thing you can do: besides not touching their tax refunds, we're actually giving them jobs. The jobs growth that this government has overseen has been extraordinary: more than 1,100 new jobs a day—and this is 900 more jobs than the economy created under Labor each day. This is an extraordinary achievement. In the last year, the total number of jobs created was 420,700 compared with Labor's last year of government of only 88,900. On this side of the aisle, we believe in jobs and lower taxation; on that side, it's all about tax grabs—what tax can we impose next; where can we get more money to spend? 


We know how they're going to spend it. We know about their economic management. Who could forget the pink batts; who could forget that shameful episode—an episode which actually cost lives. Look at them all over there laughing about it. It cost lives. The Building the Education Revolution—who could forget how they handled that one? Overinflated school halls and classrooms; out-of-town builders getting all the work. 


People know that this government is the one that is delivering jobs. We've got an unemployment rate of 5.6 per cent—in Calare, it's 3.9 per cent. Since the coalition was elected in September 2013, the economy has created almost one million jobs—997,800—which is an increase of 8.7 per cent. Total employment and total full-time unemployment—and that's an important one—are at record highs. The current rate of jobs growth remains high at 3.5 per cent over the year and is more than double the decade average of 1.6 per cent—and they've all gone quiet, because they know the figures don't lie. They know this is a significant achievement and one which they never attained. They talk a big game, but all they're ever about is grabbing tax and finding out who they can rip off next. You saw that with their disgraceful display in which they hadn't thought out their policy and suddenly had to flip flop: are we going to take the tax refunds from pensioners or are we not? Nevertheless, 875,000 retirees are going to suffer. We've been hearing about them in this House all week. 


We believe in lower tax. We believe that everyone should pay their fair share, which is why we have extended the multinational anti-avoidance law that's been announced today. This makes sure that these entities are not dodging tax and are paying their fair share. This is another way that this government is driving the economy and economic growth. We're about growth and jobs; you people are about taxing and taking money from retirees— (Time expired)

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (15:58):  It is extraordinary to follow the member for Calare, who's plainly forgotten that he voted to axe the energy supplement that will see two million Australians, including 400,000 age pensioners, lose their energy supplement. If you are a married couple, that means $550 out of your budget, and this member for Calare and every other National Party member and every Liberal has voted for that cut. Every single budget that this lot have brought down since 2014 has contained a cut to the pension—every single one. You're addicted to cutting the pension. You're absolutely addicted. 


Back in 2014, we had some real specials; some absolute specials. Talk about policy consistency—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  A point of order, Member for Corangamite?




Ms Henderson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would ask that the member direct her comments through the chair.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Jagajaga will continue.




Ms MACKLIN:
  It is just an extraordinary display by this government that in every single budget they have tried to cut the pension. And here we have today the government, in the Senate, trying to give big business a $65 billion tax cut while, at the same time, they have legislation in the parliament to cut the pension—to cut the pension this year just like they had legislation in the parliament to cut the pension last year, the year before that and the one before that. We all remember that it was this Liberal-National government that sought to cut pension indexation that would have taken $23 billion out of the pockets of pensioners—$23 billion! That's what would have happened if Labor hadn't protected pensioners. Labor has had to protect pensioners every single year after this lot's budget. We have had to vote down the cuts to pensioners that each and every one of you have voted for.


Of course, it was this government that took $1 billion out of pensioner concessions. That was done by this government with just a stroke of the pen. It axed the $900 seniors supplement. Of course, it was this government that came in here and changed the assets test arrangement. That actually knocked 90,000 pensioners off the pension. It took them off the pension altogether. There were 330,000 pensioners hurt by that decision by this government, which, of course, all the Liberal and National Party members voted for. All of them voted for it.


I know there are some National Party members who don't agree with this policy. I don't know about the member for Calare. He might get up and tell us whether or not he agrees that the pension age should go to 70. Does the member for Calare agree with that? I know there are other members of the National Party who don't agree with that. Funnily enough, the government never bring this legislation into the parliament; they just keep the cut in the budget—so in fact their deficit numbers are all wrong. But what this would mean is that hundreds of thousands of Australians would not have access to the pension until they were 70. Anyone born after 1958 would be affected by that decision, which the government has already made—it's in the budget—and 375,000 Australians would have to wait longer for the pension.


These are all your policies that will hurt the pension. I could go on for hours about the cuts to the pension this government actually has in the budget it's trying to get through this parliament, which would hurt hundreds of thousands of Australians. Of course, one of the other things that this government refuses to do—that so many pensioners are calling on it to change—is to fix the deeming rates. Interest rates keep going down. For three years this government has refused to adjust the deeming rates. That is pure theft from pensioners on the part of this government, and that just sums this government up. (Time expired)

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2018-03-28,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (16:03):  It's regrettable that the member for Jagajaga has so fundamentally distorted this situation with pensioners. Perhaps one of the Labor Party's greatest shames, when they were in government, was when they callously moved 80,000 single parents from the single parent pension onto Newstart. Even Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister, said that that was a day of great shame. The most vulnerable, mainly women but some men, in our community were savagely attacked by the Labor Party, and Kevin Rudd said sorry. What a shame that the member for Jagajaga has no sense of regret about that whatsoever.


The Labor Party also increased the pension age from 65 to 67, so there is an enormous amount of hypocrisy. We joined with the Greens to pass a pension increase to the most vulnerable of pensioners. And, yes, there was an adjustment in the threshold to people on the part-pension, because we didn't feel it was appropriate that if you had assets of $1.2 million a part-pension was payable. We brought some fairness back into the system, and now that's just under $900,000. That is still a very significant amount of money. Many pensioners would love to have that amount of money in their bank account. When we made that adjustment, which was based on fairness, we also increased the pension to $170,000 of the most vulnerable low-income pensioners, and the Labor Party rejected that legislation.


This reflects how little they really care about pensioners. We've seen that in spades with this shocking attempt to grab the cash, tax refunds, from pensioners and self-funded retirees. The Leader of the Opposition has bungled his own tax backflip. He can't even execute a backflip with any sense of clarity. He's now admitted that this is going to be a $3.3 billion or more tax on retirees every single year, if he gets his way. This is not just a shocking attack on the self-funded retirees around our nation, it is a shocking attack on pensioners. There is no pension guarantee. Anyone receiving a pension will still see their super fund lose its franking credits—potentially, costing pensioners thousands of dollars a year. The member for Maribyrnong, the Leader of the Opposition, and Labor do not care about pensioners. They do not care about self-funded retirees. This, frankly, is a shocking mess of a policy.


Our government's focus is on building a strong economy and standing up for those who most need our help. That's why we will fight this policy every step of the way. Very proudly, we have absolutely attacked multinational tax avoidance. Again, we have to join with the Greens to do so. This will include a range of legislation to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax. As a result of this legislation, the ATO has identified 38 large companies and expects that some $7 billion in income will be returned to the Australian tax base.


Our focus is on driving jobs for all Australians: increasing job opportunities; driving business investment; driving confidence. We are absolutely determined to pass our company tax cuts so that all companies, big and small, can share in this prosperity. This is, of course, a policy that Labor previously agreed to and supported. The member for Lilley, sitting opposite me, in 2010 banked $600 million in his budget, with a one per cent cut in the company tax rate, delivering $450, on average, to all workers for the year, and he bragged about how well that was for the economy. The member for Lilley has never explained that. He sits there shaking his head. What the member for Lilley doesn't understand is the absolute hypocrisy— (Time expired)

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (16:08):  I rise to support this matter of importance because it's absolutely vital that the people of Australia understand that their Prime Minister is so out of touch that he wants to give an unfunded, unconditional $65 billion to the big end of town and, at the same time, impose taxes on 80 per cent of the workforce. This is a Prime Minister who is so out of touch: former merchant banker, never met a worker in his life that he'd have a concern for. He thinks it's reasonable—at a time when there is wage stagnation in this country, when we have the lowest wage growth in a generation—to provide $65,000 billion to corporations without conditions, without being funded, without being explained.


We know how it's going to be funded if it gets through. We know what's going to happen here. As we already know because they've already announced it, the government is going to impose taxes on all workers on between $21,000 and $87,000 a year. Every worker earning between $21,000 and $87,000 a year will be getting a tax increase as a result of this government. At the same time, if you earn $1 million a year, you get a $16,000 tax break. What sort of equity is that? What sort of equity and fairness is that?


This could only be from a Prime Minister that's so out of touch, that's comfortable in the boardroom but awkward like a fish out of water in offices, depots and factories because he has no understanding, no empathy and no concern for working people in this country. That is the reality. It must be the reality because the only thing he seeks to do is to rob from workers and look after his mates—rob from workers by way of increasing their taxes, and at the same time provide an unconditional, unfunded $65 billion in taxes. What we heard today in question time, of course, was that there are no conditions—no commitment to wage growth, no commitment to employment growth, no commitment to stop offshoring, not one intention to do what is needed to look after working people in this nation. No wonder the Australian people have turned their back on this Prime Minister. He turned his back on them. He turned his back on them, and we saw it first, of course, when he chose to oppose the opposition's private member's motion to stop the cut to penalty rates.


This Easter is the first Easter since the penalty rate cuts were brought in on 1 July last year. We will have retail and hospitality workers going to work on public holidays and on Sunday and receiving real wage decreases. Of course, next July they have further cuts in real wages to look forward to. And in July 2020 they have further cuts to occur as a result of that penalty rate decision. I don't know if people notice—certainly they wouldn't notice on the other side of the chamber—but hairdressers and beauticians are also going to get penalty rate cuts if the application before the Fair Work Commission is successful. That application was made last week.


We have one application after another to attack working people at a time that wage growth is stagnant. Profits are up, wages are flatlining, and what is the answer from the Prime Minister? 'Well, we've got profits up, wages low; let's give a tax cut to big business.' That's all they contemplated. That's the only policy they have. As the Leader of the Opposition said, they are a one-trick pony, this government. They have one policy. As the Leader of the Opposition has made very, very clear, we're up for this fight. We're happy to have this fight from this day forward and every day until the next election, because we know the Australian people do not believe in unfairness and widening inequality in this country.


We are seeing too many people missing out in this country. We do not need lectures from the government in relation to pensioners. They want to increase the pension age to 70 for working people if this country. Can you imagine nurses, construction workers—workers who actually work physically—working until they are 70 before they are even entitled to the pension? It would increase to the highest number in the entire world: 70 before you receive a pension. And yet this government wants to lecture us on pensioners? This government's unfair, the Prime Minister's out of touch and we can't wait till the next election.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:14):  Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, I join with everyone that's congratulated you in the past on your recent elevation to high office.


It's a great shame that those opposite now are abandoning their posts because they know that they are about to cop a shellacking. I'm very pleased to see that my friend the member for Fairfax is in the chamber with me, because this is a very important discussion that we're having this afternoon. It's important to bring this down to a local level. I'm sure the same situation applies in Fairfax as it does in Fisher—that is, in two federal seats on the Sunshine Coast. There are 741 people in Fisher alone that have been helped off welfare and put into work, including 181 young people, through this government's jobactive wage subsidies. The other side don't like to talk about that, do they? Another great thing on the Sunshine Coast is the record low unemployment: 5.1 per cent. I just seek to remind those opposite that success leaves clues. You can't argue with numbers like 5.1 per cent. I wonder if those opposite could say something similar about an employment rate under the previous Labor government.


There is $266 million extra for schools in Fisher. I love it when they come up with these MPIs because it's just a free kick. There is $1.6 billion in extra funding for the Bruce Highway, member for Fairfax. There are millions for a business case which the member for Fairfax was instrumental in organising for the funding of the North Coast Connect rail project, a fast rail project from Maroochydore and Nambour to Brisbane. What have the Romans ever done for us? What has the Turnbull government ever done for us? The answer is $1.6 billion for roads and fast rail.


These are groundbreaking projects that will change the lives of hardworking Australians—hardworking people living in Fisher, living in Fairfax and living in Wide Bay. I don't know about Fairfax, but I don't have too many big businesses operating in Fisher. I don't think there are too many big businesses operating in Fairfax. Perhaps we can change that. The other side are always keen to turn a big business into a small business, but on our side of the fence we have absolutely laser-like focus on looking after our small businesses on the Sunshine Coast.


There is $5 million for the Thompson Institute. They talk about ordinary Australians. Ordinary Australians will receive some fantastic mental health care through the Thompson Institute—people who suffer from dementia; people who are at very, very low points in their lives and need help, particularly in relation to suicide prevention; and youth with mental health issues. We all want to care for the mental health of our young people. There is $5 million for the new Sunshine Coast community sporting hub in Kawana. This government cares for ordinary Australians. It puts its money where its mouth is. There is $3 million for upgrades to the Events Centre in Caloundra. The list continues to go on.


Another great example is a commercialisation grant of $1 million that was provided by the federal government for a Caloundra business by the name of HeliMods. HeliMods will take this power stretcher loader to the world and it will revolutionise people being loaded into emergency services helicopters. I know that Will is heading off to the US in a couple of weeks time to try and sell this concept—it's like selling ice to the Eskimos—to the US National Guard. This is something that will revolutionise the transport of very sick and injured people. A million dollars as just been announced in relation to homelessness programs in Fisher alone.


Those opposite talk about ordinary Australians. The Turnbull government gives a damn about ordinary Australians. It always has and always will. (Time expired)

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (16:19):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 178: Bonn convention-amendments; Universal Postal Union-amendments.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr ROBERT:
  by leave—Thank you for the opportunity to make a short statement in respect of Report 178. The report deals with two treaty actions:


amendments to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals; and


amendments to the constitution of the Universal Postal Union, the general regulations, the Universal Postal Convention, the final protocol to the convention, and the Postal Payment Services Agreement and Final Protocol, adopted by the 26th congress of the postal union.


The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, called the Bonn convention, is a multilateral treaty protecting vulnerable migratory species.


Migratory species that are in need of protection are listed in the appendices to the Bonn convention.


There are two appendices: appendix I lists endangered species and appendix II lists species that have an unfavourable conservation status, but are not endangered.


Amendments to the appendices of the Bonn convention come into effect automatically unless a party to the convention lodges a reservation.


Australia is a range state for five of the species added to the appendices of the Bonn convention at the conference of the parties held in October last year.


The Australian government advised the committee that Australia has lodged reservations in relation to the dusky shark, the blue shark and the white-spotted guitarfish, which have been added to appendix II of the Bonn convention.


These reservations arise from an inconsistency between the Bonn convention and the EPBC Act.


The EPBC Act extends the prohibition on taking endangered species listed in appendix I of the Bonn Convention to species listed in appendix II that are not endangered.


This would unnecessarily prevent commercial and recreational fishers from taking the species being added to appendix II when those fisheries are sustainably managed in Australia.


It's important to note that Australia already applies the conservation measures required under the Bonn convention in relation to these species.


The committee acknowledges that, absent an appropriate amendment to the EPBC Act, there is no alternative for the Australian government but to lodge reservations in this regard.


Australia has accepted the listing of the Christmas Island frigatebird or the whale shark, which have been included in appendix I.


As the amendments to the Bonn convention come into effect automatically and Australia's reservations have already been lodged, the committee has not made a recommendation in relation to this treaty action.


However, the committee agrees that the treaty action is in the national interest.


The Universal Postal Union is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for formulating and setting the rules for the flow of international mail.


The Australian government is proposing to ratify the amendments to the constitution of the Universal Postal Union, the general regulations, the Universal Postal Convention, the final protocol to the convention, and the Postal Payment Services Agreement and Final Protocol, adopted by the 26th congress.


The documents adopted by the congress reflect incremental refinement and improvement of the regulatory framework and operations of the international postal system.


Australia's ratification of the documents adopted by the 26th congress will ensure our continued participation in the international postal system, which these days plays such a pretty important part not only in day-to-day life but in international commerce.


The committee supports the ratification of the treaty.

Mr HASTIE:
  by leave—I am pleased to present the committee's review of proposed amendments to the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. The committee reported on its review of this bill on 26 February 2018, making four recommendations that were accepted by the government.


The proposed amendments will implement changes to schedule 1 of the bill to implement the committee's recommendations 1 and 2 in its previous report.


The proposed amendments will also introduce a new schedule 2 to the bill that amends 33 acts to implement machinery-of-government changes relating to establishment of the Home Affairs portfolio and the Attorney-General's ongoing oversight role.


The committee considered that the proposed amendments are consistent with the government's statements that they amend ministerial and department references to transfer responsibility for these 33 acts and amend provisions that either no longer make sense or are redundant, or to ensure that more than one minister can exercise a function.


The committee considered the government should keep the relationship between security and oversight under review to ensure the division of responsibility between the two ministers remains appropriate.


The committee will monitor the impact of the revised ministerial and departmental arrangements in its annual oversight inquiries.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2018-03-28,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:25):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, I present the following two reports: Examination of the Australian Crime Commission annual report 2015-16 and Examination of the Australian Federal Police annual report 2015-16.


Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  by leave—The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement has a statutory duty to examine each annual report of the Australian Crime Commission, the ACC, under the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Act 2010. This is the sixth time the committee has examined the annual report.


It is worth noting a few things from the report. The priorities the Australian Crime Commission focused on in 2015-16 were tackling criminal activity and profit-making; the Targeting Criminal Wealth No. 2 Special Investigation; the ACC-led Eligo 2 National Task Force; the contribution to the Criminal Assets Confiscation Task Force, led by the AFP; contribution to the multiagency Serious Financial Crime Taskforce; tackling high-risk criminals through the Highest Risk Criminal Targets No. 2 Special Investigation; the national criminal target list; the national target system; automated alerting; and state-specific special investigations into the highest risk criminal targets in Victoria and South Australia. In tackling criminal gangs, the priorities were the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs Special Operation; the ACC-led Australian Gangs Intelligence Coordination Centre; the gangs intelligence hub; the national gangs list; and the national taskforce operation Morpheus.


I have a couple of other important things to say in relation to the report that are worth noting about the international deployments of the ACC. The committee was advised that officers were currently deployed in Hong Kong, Dubai, the US and Canada. Officers are also currently deployed to Europol, The Hague and the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom.


Something that was of particular interest to the committee was the adoption of wastewater analysis. This is a coalition initiative which in May 2016 the Minister for Justice authorised the expenditure of over $3.5 million over three years to establish. Simply, wastewater analysis tests wastewater through the sewerage system to make an analysis of what drugs are being used in a particular area. Thirteen drugs—illicit and licit—were examined. The two licit drugs were alcohol and tobacco. Over time, this will give us some very good time-series analysis so we can see the trends in these drugs, both the illicit and licit.


Further, when it comes to the work of the Australian Crime Commission Illicit drug data report, there are some interesting statistics. In 2014 there were 105,862 illicit drug seizures in one year. This was an increase from the previous year. Other findings: there were 514 kilograms of methamphetamine stimulus seized and 35,468 arrests. There were a record number of national cannabis seizures and arrests—59,271 and 75,105 respectively. There were a record number of cocaine seizures, weighing over half a tonne, and 2,092 arrests. There was also a decrease in the number of clandestine laboratories detected by law enforcement agencies.


However, these figures can often be an indication of the trends of those particular drugs. Although we commend the ACC in their work, we need to acknowledge the extensive network of the supply chains supplying illicit drugs into this country. As has been said many times by many experienced officers, the problem of illicit drugs is not something that we'll ever be able to arrest ourselves out of, nor will we be able to prevent the problem through the interception of illegal drugs.


In conclusion, the committee extols the Australian Crime Commission for its continued work to inform Australia's law enforcement agencies in their fight against serious and organised crime. In particular, the committee is supportive of the ACC's engagement with Australia's international partners, including the Five Eyes, Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates. The inquiries into crystal methamphetamines and illicit tobacco have shown the value of fostering a cooperative relationship with countries that are known as transit points for illicit commodities coming into Australia.


On the second report—the AFP report: again, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement has a statutory duty to examine the annual report of the Australian Federal Police. Our AFP is the Australian government's primary policing agency and describes itself as:


… a key member of the Australian law enforcement and national security community, leading policing efforts to keep Australians and Australian interests safe both at home and overseas. 


On staffing matters of the AFP: as at 30 June 2016, the AFP had 6,657 staff, including 3,481 sworn officers, 2,491 unsworn staff and 672 Protective Service Officers. Of these staff, 45 per cent are located outside the AFP's headquarters in the ACT, with 284 serving overseas and 28 serving in the Commonwealth external territories. One thing that is very pleasing to report is that the AFP continued to experience very low attrition rates in 2015. Overall, the adjusted attrition rate as at 30 June was just 2.61 per cent.


In conclusion, we again congratulate the AFP for the work they do in keeping our community safe. One concluding comment I would like to make is that this parliament, as a bipartisan policy, has decided that the excise in cigarettes will be ramped up significantly. This is effectively a prohibition by price that this parliament has gone down the track of. Whenever we have a prohibition, it naturally leads to increased criminal activity—to increased smuggling. In the years to come, that will put greater demands on the resources of both the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission. We need to make sure, if we're going down this track and we're going to see these additional problems with increased smuggling and increased criminal activity, that these two agencies are given the resources to fight that problem. I thank the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2018-03-28,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:25):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, I present the following two reports: Examination of the Australian Crime Commission annual report 2015-16 and Examination of the Australian Federal Police annual report 2015-16.


Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  by leave—The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement has a statutory duty to examine each annual report of the Australian Crime Commission, the ACC, under the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Act 2010. This is the sixth time the committee has examined the annual report.


It is worth noting a few things from the report. The priorities the Australian Crime Commission focused on in 2015-16 were tackling criminal activity and profit-making; the Targeting Criminal Wealth No. 2 Special Investigation; the ACC-led Eligo 2 National Task Force; the contribution to the Criminal Assets Confiscation Task Force, led by the AFP; contribution to the multiagency Serious Financial Crime Taskforce; tackling high-risk criminals through the Highest Risk Criminal Targets No. 2 Special Investigation; the national criminal target list; the national target system; automated alerting; and state-specific special investigations into the highest risk criminal targets in Victoria and South Australia. In tackling criminal gangs, the priorities were the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs Special Operation; the ACC-led Australian Gangs Intelligence Coordination Centre; the gangs intelligence hub; the national gangs list; and the national taskforce operation Morpheus.


I have a couple of other important things to say in relation to the report that are worth noting about the international deployments of the ACC. The committee was advised that officers were currently deployed in Hong Kong, Dubai, the US and Canada. Officers are also currently deployed to Europol, The Hague and the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom.


Something that was of particular interest to the committee was the adoption of wastewater analysis. This is a coalition initiative which in May 2016 the Minister for Justice authorised the expenditure of over $3.5 million over three years to establish. Simply, wastewater analysis tests wastewater through the sewerage system to make an analysis of what drugs are being used in a particular area. Thirteen drugs—illicit and licit—were examined. The two licit drugs were alcohol and tobacco. Over time, this will give us some very good time-series analysis so we can see the trends in these drugs, both the illicit and licit.


Further, when it comes to the work of the Australian Crime Commission Illicit drug data report, there are some interesting statistics. In 2014 there were 105,862 illicit drug seizures in one year. This was an increase from the previous year. Other findings: there were 514 kilograms of methamphetamine stimulus seized and 35,468 arrests. There were a record number of national cannabis seizures and arrests—59,271 and 75,105 respectively. There were a record number of cocaine seizures, weighing over half a tonne, and 2,092 arrests. There was also a decrease in the number of clandestine laboratories detected by law enforcement agencies.


However, these figures can often be an indication of the trends of those particular drugs. Although we commend the ACC in their work, we need to acknowledge the extensive network of the supply chains supplying illicit drugs into this country. As has been said many times by many experienced officers, the problem of illicit drugs is not something that we'll ever be able to arrest ourselves out of, nor will we be able to prevent the problem through the interception of illegal drugs.


In conclusion, the committee extols the Australian Crime Commission for its continued work to inform Australia's law enforcement agencies in their fight against serious and organised crime. In particular, the committee is supportive of the ACC's engagement with Australia's international partners, including the Five Eyes, Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates. The inquiries into crystal methamphetamines and illicit tobacco have shown the value of fostering a cooperative relationship with countries that are known as transit points for illicit commodities coming into Australia.


On the second report—the AFP report: again, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement has a statutory duty to examine the annual report of the Australian Federal Police. Our AFP is the Australian government's primary policing agency and describes itself as:


… a key member of the Australian law enforcement and national security community, leading policing efforts to keep Australians and Australian interests safe both at home and overseas. 


On staffing matters of the AFP: as at 30 June 2016, the AFP had 6,657 staff, including 3,481 sworn officers, 2,491 unsworn staff and 672 Protective Service Officers. Of these staff, 45 per cent are located outside the AFP's headquarters in the ACT, with 284 serving overseas and 28 serving in the Commonwealth external territories. One thing that is very pleasing to report is that the AFP continued to experience very low attrition rates in 2015. Overall, the adjusted attrition rate as at 30 June was just 2.61 per cent.


In conclusion, we again congratulate the AFP for the work they do in keeping our community safe. One concluding comment I would like to make is that this parliament, as a bipartisan policy, has decided that the excise in cigarettes will be ramped up significantly. This is effectively a prohibition by price that this parliament has gone down the track of. Whenever we have a prohibition, it naturally leads to increased criminal activity—to increased smuggling. In the years to come, that will put greater demands on the resources of both the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission. We need to make sure, if we're going down this track and we're going to see these additional problems with increased smuggling and increased criminal activity, that these two agencies are given the resources to fight that problem. I thank the House.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (10:00):  I rise today to offer my condolences on the death of Professor David Albert Cooper AO, a great Australian physician, who died on 18 March this year. David's had many accolades bestowed upon him from Australia and overseas. He was head of the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales and a past president of the International AIDS Society. With Professor Ron Penny, David diagnosed the first HIV case in Australia, in 1982, following his experiences in the United States of America. He was also the first to describe HIV transmission during breastfeeding, in 1985, and produced many papers of huge medical importance in immunology and infectious diseases. David led the Australian response to the HIV epidemic and the AIDS epidemic, and I and many others attribute the Australian response, often described as the best in the world, to David's calm, non-judgemental, compassionate and reasoned clinical skills.


I had occasional contact with David over the years in my role as a paediatrician. However, on a recent trip to Thailand and Myanmar with the Global Fund I came to know him on a much more personal level, and I'm very grateful for that experience. David was a proud Jewish Australian who loved his family, and we compared grandparent stories on that trip. He loved his work, his patients and science. He has given much to many organisations here and overseas and will be deeply missed, both here and in many places where he provided ongoing support, such as Thailand and Myanmar. He was revered by everyone on our trip to Thailand and Myanmar. It was amazing, as we went around to the different medical institutes and hospitals, how well he was known and how he was revered, with almost godlike status. His work and his support in these places will continue for many years as one of his legacies.


To David's wife, Dorrie, and his daughters, Becky and Ilana, I offer my sincere condolences. I know how much he cared for them and loved them. To Professor Tony Kelleher and the staff of the Kirby Institute: I know how much you meant to David, and I know your work will continue to honour him in many ways for many years to come. To his wide circle of friends, medical and scientific colleagues, political acquaintances and patients, I say: we should all be grateful for the contact we've had with David and honour his legacy by continuing to support the work he has done and the work that will continue into the future. Thank you.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2018-03-28,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (11:54):  I rise in respect of the recent report on life insurance that was tabled in the House this week. It's a report that was released by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I'm a member, and I was part of the inquiry that gave rise to the report. I wanted to make just a few observations about some of the issues that we canvassed in the submissions and hearings in this inquiry. Of course, there were a really wide and interesting range of issues raised by submitters, so I certainly can't touch on all of them in the short time available to me, but there are a few that I thought would be worth commenting on today.


The first one is mental health. Mental health is an issue that affects many Australians. Understanding of mental health has been evolving over recent decades. The way mental health interacts with life insurance and with insurance generally has attracted significant attention in our inquiry and more broadly. There is significant value in continuing discussions about the role of insurers in respect of prevention when it comes to mental health. Once someone has developed a mental health issue, it's complicated to have insurers involved in rehabilitation, for various reasons, the obvious one being the potential for conflict of interest: if you're paying the claim and are also responsible for determining whether somebody has been rehabilitated then that can give rise to some fairly obvious concerns. Prevention is a different category of work. It is worthwhile giving some thought to what contribution insurers might be able to make towards work preventing people from developing mental health issues in the first place. That won't be determined in any kind of hurry, but it should be considered and further discussed.


We also had significant material before us about mental health exclusions—provisions in insurance policies that exclude people from coverage in respect of mental health issues—and obligations to disclose pre-existing mental health issues. We had a useful discussion on that in this inquiry. We need to ensure that (1) people can get coverage in respect of mental health issues and (2) people are not dissuaded from seeking help and getting diagnoses in respect of mental health issues because they're concerned about the potential impact on their insurance. I look forward to continuing public debate about what can be done to make insurance and mental health prevention work better and to ensure that people are not prevented from obtaining insurance because of mental health issues and, similarly, not dissuaded from seeking help with mental health issues because of insurance issues.


There was some discussion about doctors on one hand and insurers on the other having different perspectives when it comes to the production of medical information and records. I encourage doctors and insurers to work together on this issue. There are recommendations about it in our report, but disagreements over disclosure will ultimately lead to poorer outcomes for consumers and patients, because the cost of disagreement will be visited upon them. I encourage doctors' organisations, whether it's the AMA or the RACGP, and insurers' representatives to collaborate, open a dialogue and continue to discuss what can be done to serve consumers' and patients' interests.


The next issue is genetic testing. This was probably one of the most hotly contested issues in this inquiry. Patients who have genetic tests don't want a potential propensity towards a particular disability, illness or disease to affect the premiums they pay or their ability to get insurance in the first place. Similarly, those who undertake genetic testing for research reasons have legitimate concerns about the potential for insurers' use of genetic testing to lead to a chilling effect on people's willingness to participate in genetic testing for research purposes. There are also, quite rightly, concerns about the potential impact on consumers more broadly. If insurers are unable to consider genetic testing results, will they assume that a proportion of the insured population have particularly propensities and price that risk into premiums for everyone, and if so, is that fair to all consumers?


The use of genetic testing is not a simple issue. We have sought to strike a balance in respect of this issue in the report. I think that reasonable minds could quite easily differ about how this issue could be dealt with. I wanted to put on record my thanks to all submitters who raised issues about that particular topic, genetic testing, because it is a complex question and it can have a real impact on people's lives—patients, consumers, beneficiaries of research, potential beneficiaries of research, people who undertake research, and, of course, firms and shareholders. A range of different interests arise, and we need to make sure that we take them into account.


The other thing I briefly wanted to touch on before ceding the floor to my friend the member for Forde, who was also on the inquiry, is the issue of insurance in superannuation, particularly insurance that is a default product in superannuation. There have certainly been some concerns raised with people in the public debate about the potential for insurance premiums to eat away at your superannuation balance, particularly if you have a low balance. I just wanted to mention the corollary to that perspective, which is that, if you were to take away default insurance products, that would leave people in a situation where they are quite likely to be uninsured in the event of some catastrophic injury or illness. For example, if you develop cancer and have to take a year off work, you might never have thought about income protection insurance, life insurance, TPD—the insurance products that might be in your superannuation. You might never have bought those insurance products. But suddenly you've got multiple sclerosis or you have cancer or you've had a terrible injury that's not covered by workers compensation or motor accident compensation, and it can be an absolute godsend to have that insurance that you never would have thought to get and you wouldn't have if it weren't for it being a default product in your superannuation fund. So I am very pleased that we considered this issue in the inquiry. I certainly have had family members who've had to take long periods of time off work unexpectedly because of serious illness. If you don't have the insurance and you are then forced to refinance your house because you couldn't afford to work and you didn't have any income support, that's a pretty significant issue. I wanted to mention that, again, I think there are a range of considerations in this question, but I did want to emphasise my own perspective on that particular issue and my concern to ensure that people do have the support that they need in the event of catastrophe.


I want to record my thanks to the chair of the committee, the deputy chair of the committee, the other members of the committee and of course the secretariat. We have an excellent secretariat in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, and I am very grateful to them for all the work they continually do. I also want to express my thanks to all of the submitters to the inquiry, particularly those who took the time to come and give evidence in person. But my thanks go to everyone who made a submission; some made more than one submission. These were complex, detailed issues that we dealt with over a long period of time. We received significant support from experts in the community, many of whom were just there out of altruism and community-mindedness. Some also had some private interests that would be served by recommendations made, but I have to say there was a lot of willingness to be involved in this inquiry and to really give time and effort to try to help us to reach the right conclusions and give the right recommendations. I place on record my appreciation for all of them.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (12:03):  I would like to associate myself with the remarks just made by the member for Griffith. I think this report really demonstrates the great work that is done in this parliament across party-political lines, where committees take the time to thoroughly investigate a particular issue or a set of concerns that are raised from whatever the source may be and produce a report such as this, which has covered a wide range of issues on a bipartisan basis. I think it is a great testament to the quality of the work and the willingness of the committee to work together to get this outcome. I think it's a pity that more of the work that is done in this place is not seen by the public at large, instead of some of the other things that they see.


The reason this inquiry is so important is that insurance is incredibly important to the lives of Australian people. And, at the end of the day, that was what the focus of this inquiry was about. It was about how we seek to craft a set of recommendations that will improve the operation of the industry for the benefit of the Australian people, particularly at a time when they need it. We have spent a lot of time over the last few years focusing on the provision of advice, the initial up-front component at the beginning of a process with the life insurance industry or the investment industry—for the sake of this contribution, we'll focus on the life insurance industry. The advice part is incredibly important, because there is a requirement for advisers to ensure that the products they recommend or the strategies they recommend are in accordance with the client's best interests. We never know really, at the outset, whether that's the case, but where the rubber hits the road is at the time of claim. This, in part, was one of the catalysts for this inquiry in the first place—issues in the claims process as identified in the media. That is where the focus of this report has been. How do we improve the claims process? How do we improve the quality and the clarity of the terms and conditions within life insurance or income protection policies? They are very complex and wordy documents and there are a variety of definitions across all of the 29 different companies that provide insurance in Australia. That is where the complexity arises.


I can well understand the difficulty many Australians have in understanding what they actually have in their insurance policy. I think it's fair to say that we in this place know the complexity of these documents and how much reading is involved, and I'm sure that even we would admit that, with all of the reports and other things that we get across our desks, we don't necessarily read everything, because it's actually impossible to do so. I would suggest that it's the same for consumers. They get documents that are wordy. They are legal or are legalistic in their wording. They don't take the time to read through them in great detail. And, even if they do, they'd probably find them hard to understand. That's what some of the recommendations in here are around—improving understandability, transparency and ease of reading for consumers so that they can actually understand what they are getting in their cover. I think that is critically important. As I said, it's at claims time when the rubber hits the road, and a lot of our time was focused on how we improve that process.


One of the issues that was identified was the issue of definitions of medical conditions, and one of the recommendations specifically addresses that issue. It's the responsibility of insurance companies to ensure that the definitions in their products are regularly kept up to date, not only in retail life insurance products but also, importantly, in group life.


The media reports leading up to this particular inquiry identified a number of circumstances involving policies in a group life setting. The committee did a tremendous amount of work around: how do we improve the understanding for consumers of what insurance cover they actually have within a group life setting, particularly within their superannuation fund? The member for Griffith touched on this in her contribution. It is very, very important, because people in a very difficult circumstance in their life need to understand or have the understanding that they have some security in the event of a terminal illness or cancer or in the event of an injury where they can't work for a period of time. They need to be able to ensure that the process of protecting their financial situation is robust. Medical definitions not being up to date doesn't assist with that.


In the group life setting, we also discovered a number of instances where people actually had cover but, due to the conditions and terms within the super fund, couldn't make a claim, because they weren't getting contributions or the balance wasn't at a certain limit et cetera. So we had situations potentially where people were paying premiums on insurance policies which they couldn't actually claim on. What benefit is that to those people? They are the things that we want to see removed from the industry, because people should be getting what they pay for.


A number of the recommendations in this report focus on those issues around group life insurance about ensuring that people are getting clear information from the trustees of the super fund but also via the ATO, where possible, of not only what their superannuation account balances are but what insurance cover they have within their superannuation funds, because many people don't even know they have insurance cover. The fact that people have something they don't know about is, I think, a breakdown in the level of communication by the superannuation funds to educate their members about what they actually have in their fund.



One of the interesting recommendations, which I haven't seen much commentary on so far, is something that I have discussed at length with the industry over the years—this is more in the retail insurance space than in group life policy—and that is legacy products. Legacy products have been around for a long period of time. I think one company said they had a product from 1928 or something like that; that was when it was first written. So they have got these very old systems that don't talk to each other and that probably have old definitions and old terms and conditions. One of the issues we discussed was how we work with the industry to rationalise this book of legacy products and through that process ensure there is a no-disadvantage test to ensure that, where policies are moved to a new policy, the current policyholder is no worse off. This was looked at on the basis of putting people into newer products with better terms and conditions, reducing the cost of managing these complex, long-term books for the insurance company and, hopefully, reducing the long-term cost to consumers in Australia. I commend this report to the House. (Time expired)

One of the issues that was identified was the issue of definitions of medical conditions, and one of the recommendations specifically addresses that issue. It's the responsibility of insurance companies to ensure that the definitions in their products are regularly kept up to date, not only in retail life insurance products but also, importantly, in group life.


The media reports leading up to this particular inquiry identified a number of circumstances involving policies in a group life setting. The committee did a tremendous amount of work around: how do we improve the understanding for consumers of what insurance cover they actually have within a group life setting, particularly within their superannuation fund? The member for Griffith touched on this in her contribution. It is very, very important, because people in a very difficult circumstance in their life need to understand or have the understanding that they have some security in the event of a terminal illness or cancer or in the event of an injury where they can't work for a period of time. They need to be able to ensure that the process of protecting their financial situation is robust. Medical definitions not being up to date doesn't assist with that.


In the group life setting, we also discovered a number of instances where people actually had cover but, due to the conditions and terms within the super fund, couldn't make a claim, because they weren't getting contributions or the balance wasn't at a certain limit et cetera. So we had situations potentially where people were paying premiums on insurance policies which they couldn't actually claim on. What benefit is that to those people? They are the things that we want to see removed from the industry, because people should be getting what they pay for.


A number of the recommendations in this report focus on those issues around group life insurance about ensuring that people are getting clear information from the trustees of the super fund but also via the ATO, where possible, of not only what their superannuation account balances are but what insurance cover they have within their superannuation funds, because many people don't even know they have insurance cover. The fact that people have something they don't know about is, I think, a breakdown in the level of communication by the superannuation funds to educate their members about what they actually have in their fund.



One of the interesting recommendations, which I haven't seen much commentary on so far, is something that I have discussed at length with the industry over the years—this is more in the retail insurance space than in group life policy—and that is legacy products. Legacy products have been around for a long period of time. I think one company said they had a product from 1928 or something like that; that was when it was first written. So they have got these very old systems that don't talk to each other and that probably have old definitions and old terms and conditions. One of the issues we discussed was how we work with the industry to rationalise this book of legacy products and through that process ensure there is a no-disadvantage test to ensure that, where policies are moved to a new policy, the current policyholder is no worse off. This was looked at on the basis of putting people into newer products with better terms and conditions, reducing the cost of managing these complex, long-term books for the insurance company and, hopefully, reducing the long-term cost to consumers in Australia. I commend this report to the House. (Time expired)

Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (16:07):  Less than 20 kilometres away from the Perth CBD sits the electorate of Burt. It's not out in the sticks, despite what you may hear from many of my university friends. It is indeed in metropolitan Perth, and it is the year 2018. And in 2018, students are expected to do their homework and research their assignments online. We are required to pay our bills online, bank online and work online. We even watch TV online. The government even asks us to report to Centrelink online and to complete passport applications online. And, of course, we all have to pay our tax—unless you're some of Australia's biggest companies—online.


In Burt, we have areas on the NBN, areas getting the NBN and a whole lot of areas that will be sitting in a technological dead zone without the NBN or, in fact, without even ADSL for quite a while. Until recently, suburbs like Thornlie were just a big blank space on the NBN rollout map. They may now be coloured in, but there isn't any NBN coming to them or surrounding areas until at least 2019, and, on current performance, that's more realistically 2021 if they're lucky. The types of issues that I hear from my constituents about the Prime Minister's failed 'fraudband' network are many and varied, from service class 0 homes that, for whatever reason, cannot and, seemingly, will not be given access to the NBN, to slow internet speeds—slower, in fact, than people had on their ADSL—to rollout dates that keep on getting pushed back.


The availability of ADSL services across Perth's south-eastern suburbs was already patchy at best. Plenty of my constituents pay for expensive mobile data plans on their phones or a dongle, so that they can access the internet from their computers at home, assuming they aren't living within the various mobile black spots that also cover many parts of my electorate. Many resort to staying back late at work or school to download large documents or complete tasks that they could otherwise have been doing at home. Some even have to walk their children to sit outside their school in the evening so that they can access the school's wi-fi to get their homework done.


But what happens when these households do eventually move onto the NBN? If your area isn't one of the many that has had their rollout delayed, you'll probably start to notice your mailbox filling with paraphernalia from telcos reminding you that now is the time to switch, often advertising speeds and prices that seem just too good to be true. And, often, they are. We now have the ACCC conducting an inquiry into misleading claims made by internet service providers over the kinds of speeds that consumers could expect. Some constituents are telling me that they are lucky if they can get the speed test itself to download in less than 10 seconds.


About one-fifth of Australians are getting fibre-to-the-premises connections, but the majority are being connected using the older technology such as copper telephone wires and pay television cables. The end result is that some households and businesses are unable to access the high speeds which they pay for. Some are told they can get a refund; others suffer not knowing. NBN Co has been blunt about this: if you want high speeds and you have fibre to the node, you had better be prepared to pay for it. You can drive down streets in my electorate where people on one side get fibre to their home—it's much faster and much more reliable—and people on the other side of the street are connected by copper, which limits their internet speed.


NBN chief Bill Morrow has been quoted as saying:


Fibre medium is better than copper medium … You can't argue any other way, but do we need that fibre today?


I'm sure that, when the first copper wires were laid in Australia, the telecommunications company installing them—that was the government—didn't expect that the same copper wires would be used to download movies, play video games—I don't think they even knew what video games were—stream music, publish graphic-heavy online content or interact with social networks around the clock. By limiting achievable speeds and reliability of our broadband to what we think we may need today, we limit the ability of Australian businesses and individuals to innovate into the future. We do not know what the internet will or could be used for in 10, 20, 50 or even 100 years time, and we need the capacity to accommodate the growing needs of the Australian community, its businesses and its future leaders. We should not constrain ourselves and condemn the next generation—indeed, my generation—to having to pay to do all of this again at a much higher cost.


To the members of my community in Burt: I would like to assure you that we will continue to advocate for a timelier, better quality NBN rollout for Perth's south-eastern suburbs. We deserve better, and I'm here in this place to make sure we get it.
