"PRESIDENT, The",,2018-11-14,"



The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  I have a statement regarding a point of order raised by Senator Bernardi yesterday with respect to badges. Holding up newspapers or placards or displaying items such as badges with slogans is disorderly and was ruled as such by President Sibraa and President Reid on numerous occasions. It is also very well established by rulings of past presidents, including President Calvert in 2003, that it is not in order to wear in the chamber T-shirts or other clothing bearing slogans. President Parry ruled it is disorderly for senators to wear garments bearing slogans, regardless of the size of the slogan, on 17 July 2014. Such practices are disruptive of orderly debate as they allow senators to intervene in ways other than by receiving the call from the chair. It would be highly undesirable to have debate in the Senate reduced to the level of displaying such material. The Senate is not a billboard. I believe it is consistent to apply this same principle to attachments to items of clothing.


Consistent with statements I have made over the past year, I distinguish from these rules the wearing of relatively non-contentious lapel-sized ribbons and badges without statements or slogans, a practice which has grown to be accepted over many years now. I understand that senators have strong views on many issues, but debate in the Senate is subject to simple and reasonable rules to maintain order. Senators will be called to order in accordance with these rules. I thank senators.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:35):  In my last remaining minutes, I'll go back and summarise my speech from last night. I started my speech talking about the adventures of Bunyip Bluegum and the very famous Australian literary classic The Magic Pudding. I talked about the allure and seduction of the magic pudding: how Bunyip Bluegum couldn't go past a pudding that needed constant eating. It was a cheeky, mischievous pudding that invited everyone to consume it constantly. I talked about how the adventure led to pudding thieves and a chase across the Australian bush trying to keep the pudding away from pudding thieves, and how this reflected the GST debate in this country in recent years.


I would like to say again that the Greens will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018, but we want to be very clear that this GST legislation that we have before us is like a magic pudding—miraculously, more money is going to solve the problem and keep the pudding growing. The money to keep the pudding constantly replenished has to come from somewhere. We know this Liberal government has an atrocious track record of taking money from Australia's most vulnerable people. We just saw this week a 25 per cent cut to Foodbank announced by a Liberal minister. Luckily, our Prime Minister intervened after three days of public debate, including the National Farmers Federation wading into this debate. They're prepared to cut aid for fresh food to Australians, even at a time of relative fiscal ease. Can you imagine what's going to happen in five or 10 years time when they need to top up the GST magic pudding and they don't have the money?


We saw in 2013 zombie budget cuts to just about every aspect of our social security net—even to GP co-payments—the age of entitlement and ex-Treasurer Mr Joe Hockey smoking cigars with Senator Cormann, who's in the chamber today. I'll never forget that, and I don't think anyone in this chamber or the Australian public will ever forget that. There are two critical issues: where the money is going to come from and the fact that we need to maintain constant vigilance as to where in consolidated revenue those funds will come from. They have to come from somewhere.


The second point—and Senator Dean Smith is in the chamber now—is that I wholeheartedly agree that this should be the start of a much bigger debate about tax reform in this country and the role that the Commonwealth government plays in that. Like Senator Smith, I also agree that the Commonwealth government should play a bigger role in the taxation debate versus the states. I gave my views last night, and I'll give them again in conclusion. If we want to be talking about tax reform, let's talk about proper reforms to the petroleum resource rent tax. I note that the CEO of Woodside—Senator Cormann and Senator Smith, being Western Australian senators, would be familiar with him—talked about locking in the government's recent weak reforms to the PRRT. I'm not surprised that he wants to lock those in, because we need to go a lot further. We need to go a lot further than just changing the uplift rates on the PRRT. We need to actually put a 10 per cent floor on annual royalty from these projects that can be offset against future PRRT liabilities. The Greens will be announcing and releasing our costings on this shortly. We believe that is a much more equitable and fair way to roll out the PRRT into the future. 


We'll also be releasing details, going into the next federal election—which I understand will be very soon—on significant tax reform around new resource rent taxes, especially mining resource rent taxes, super profit taxes. They're the kinds of things we believe the Commonwealth government should be leading on. We do need tax reform in this country, I agree with Senator Smith. Why have we walked away from super profit taxes on the mining industry, for example? There are a number of other reforms we would like to see. We would like to see carbon pricing, another national reform that was enacted by this government, that the Commonwealth government led on. We need to have a price on carbon if we're going to tackle emissions. It's not a silver bullet, I agree, but it's an absolutely necessary component for action on reducing emissions, even if we're going to meet our Paris targets, which may not be enough. 


So we need to have the debate in here about the role of the Commonwealth and the federal parliament in looking at a price on carbon. And there's so much more. I welcome the debate on tax reform at the federal government level. We will be supporting this. We are very cautious about where this money's going to come from. We will be vigilant, to make sure that it's not taken off Australia's most vulnerable people, by whichever party is in power in the next term of government or the term after that, when the GST magic pudding has to be topped up. We'll be watching very closely for who the pudding thieves are going to be. We have our suspicions right here, right now, who they are. The Greens will play a role in parliament in keeping a future government, be it Labor or Liberal, honest on tax reform and federal government tax reform in Australia.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (09:41):  I rise to make a short contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. I want to make it clear at the outset that, like other Labor senators, I will be supporting this bill. The main reason, though, that I want to make a contribution is to highlight some very concerning remarks that were made in the debate on this bill by Pauline Hanson's One Nation senator from Western Australia, Senator Peter Georgiou. I was very disturbed yesterday when I heard Senator Georgiou's marks. We all know, in Queensland, that Senator Hanson and her party colleagues have a long history of saying they are prepared to sell out Queensland when it comes to GST funding. It would appear that, despite many rebuffs by the public and election defeats for Senator Hanson, she and her colleagues are still at it, trying to take GST funding off Queensland. 


The comments Senator Georgiou made yesterday that I want to refer to include the following:


It's time to get real. Instead of trying to keep everyone happy, the government should announce that the distribution of GST will move to a per capita basis over a five-year time frame …


What would it mean for GST to move to a per capita basis, whether it be over a five-year time frame or anything else? For starters, the Productivity Commission, the federal government's own body, had a good look at this earlier in the debate about GST funding. They calculated that moving to a per capita system of distributing GST funds among the states would result in a cut of $1.2 billion per annum to Queensland in GST funding. That's $1.2 billion less that Queensland would have to spend on hospitals, on schools, on roads and on all sorts of other public services that Queenslanders depend upon. 


I've been waiting for Senator Hanson, throughout this debate, to come in and contradict the remarks made by her colleague, Senator Georgiou, but as yet she has failed to appear. She has been conspicuously silent in this debate while her own colleague, Senator Georgiou, has been willing to get up and bash Queensland yet again over GST funding. From her silence on this matter, we can only interpret that she must agree with Senator Georgiou that Western Australia and other states should benefit in GST funding at the expense of Queensland. 


My suspicion that Senator Hanson is supportive of this position from Senator Georgiou is backed up by previous remarks that she has made on GST funding. Senator Hanson has a long history of making comments that indicate she is prepared to reduce GST funding to Queensland to benefit other states. Who can forget the comments Senator Hanson made in January 2017, prior to the Western Australian state election, when she appeared in an interview on Perth radio station 6PR. She was asked: 'Will you, Senator Hanson, help us in Western Australia in this fight, and would you be willing to see the GST share of your home state, Queensland, reduced so that Western Australia can get a better deal?' 


Her response: 'Of course I will; no problem.' And it wasn't long after that she denied ever having said that, but there it is in black and white.


That's not the only time, though, that she's made these kinds of comments. On 22 June this year in Queensland's The Courier Mail, Senator Hanson was quoted as saying that she would be willing to push for a fair and just share of the GST carve-up for WA even at the expense of Queensland. She said:


As a senator in this place, and you're making decisions on the floor of Parliament, you have to step outside your State as well, and you've got to look at what is fair and balanced … I'm the leader of a national party. You've got to look at what is fair and just, right across, for all Australians. And I will still stand by that.


She backed it up with further comments to The Courier Mail on 4 July this year saying:


… many Queenslanders would be happy to lose a few cents in GST revenue to increase funds to states like Western Australia.


Well I'm sorry, Senator Hanson, but moving to the per capita system that you and your colleagues have supported consistently doesn't mean that Queensland loses a few cents; it means that Queensland loses $1.2 billion per year, money that could be spent on essential public services right around Queensland. 


I've been very vocal in the time I've been here about Senator Hanson having repeatedly sold out battlers on a range of issues. She's voted to cut penalty rates; she's voted to cut pensions; she's voted to cut funding for schools, hospitals and apprenticeships. And it's no surprise she does that because we all know she votes with the government, with the Liberals, 90 per cent of the time. What these comments that continue to come out from One Nation senators show is that not only Senator Hanson and her colleagues are prepared to sell out battlers but they're actually prepared to sell out every single Queenslander. They're prepared to sell out every Queensland man, every Queensland woman, every Queensland boy and every Queensland girl. They're prepared to sell out every nurse in Queensland, every teacher in Queensland, every motorist in Queensland and every pensioner in Queensland. 


Senator Hanson should know better than anyone that Queensland is Australia's most decentralised state. It is an extremely expensive state in which to provide services. It's not just about providing services in inner city Melbourne or inner city Sydney; you've got to provide services in Brisbane, Rockhampton, Cairns, the Torres Strait and western Queensland—very remote places that are expensive to service but that deserve high-quality services from their state and federal governments. And, in order to do that, they require a fair share of GST funding, not to lose $1.2 billion a year, which is what Senator Hanson continues to advocate for.


This might well be Senator Hanson's greatest sellout yet. There's a long line of them, whether it be penalty rates being cut or whether it be supporting cuts to schools, hospital funding and pensions. But this one—supporting cuts to GST funding of $1.2 billion per year to Queensland—may well be Senator Hanson's greatest sellout yet. It's about as big a sellout as you can get in Queensland. I don't think it would even be a bigger sellout if 'The King' Wally Lewis actually put on a blue New South Wales jersey. That's how bad this is. 


She is turning her back on Queenslanders yet again. I, for one, am sick of hearing Senator Hanson say one thing when she's travelling around Queensland—that she's sticking up for battlers and that she's down here in Canberra fighting for Queenslanders—and seeing her every time she comes down here line up with the Liberals to vote for cuts to the things that battlers need right throughout Queensland. And here she and her colleagues are again calling for Queensland to lose $1.2 billion a year in GST funding.


I think it's important that Senator Hanson finally come out today and express her position on this bill. Does she support what her colleague is saying—moving towards a per capita system of distributing GST—or is she actually prepared to do her job as a senator for Queensland and fight for the benefit of Queensland, fight for the extra $1.2 billion a year in GST funding that her colleague wants to take off Queenslanders? The time for hiding is over, Senator Hanson. Come and state what your position is. Do you support changes to the GST system which would rip off Queenslanders or not?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-11-14,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:49):  Firstly, I thank all those senators who've contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Our government has long recognised that what has been happening with WA's share of the GST is unfair, not sustainable in a federation and has to be fixed. The proposition that, in a federation, stronger states should support other states so that all have the capacity to provide similar outcomes for their populations is a good and important principle which we must continue to protect and preserve. However, an arrangement which puts any one state into the position, as has happened to WA in the past, where it receives less than 30 per cent of its share of the GST back as a result of fiscal equalisation cannot possibly be sustained.


All of Western Australia's federal Liberal members and senators have long argued that this is an unacceptable situation for our home state and must be fixed. Firstly, we secured about $1.4 billion in federal GST top-up payments for WA to provide additional funding towards much-needed WA infrastructure. This was always intended as a short-term measure. Initially in 2015-16 it effectively stopped the drop in WA's share of the GST from 37.6 per cent to below 30 per cent. For this financial year—the 2018-19 financial year—our top-up payments have effectively lifted WA's share of the GST to 50 per cent.


To facilitate a more structured, ongoing resolution to this issue, WA Liberal members and senators advocated for and secured the Productivity Commission inquiry into the impact of GST-sharing arrangements on national productivity and growth. That was the basis on which, as a government, we focused on the national interest. We developed our plan to make GST arrangements fairer for WA and better for national economic growth and job creation, while also making sure that every state is better off.


This bill reforms GST payments to the states and territories by providing a fairer and more sustainable way of distributing the GST. It is a plan which addresses a longstanding unfairness for Western Australia in a way that leaves all states and territories better off. Since it was introduced in 2000, every dollar of GST raised has been distributed to the states and territories according to the system of horizontal fiscal equalisation. While this worked in a relatively predictable way in the early years of the horizontal fiscal equalisation system, the mining investment boom demonstrated that Australia's horizontal fiscal equalisation system struggles to function well when faced with economic shocks. In particular, the mining investment and construction boom created significant volatility in the distribution of the GST.


The government's plan will firstly create a new equalisation benchmark—the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria, whichever is higher. Secondly, it will introduce a permanent in-system relativity floor of 0.7 from 2022-23, increasing to 0.75 from 2024-25. Thirdly, it will permanently boost the GST pool of funds available for distribution to the states and territories by providing direct Commonwealth cash injections each year from 2021-22 onwards. These are in addition to GST collections. Fourthly, during the transition period from 2021-22 to 2026-27, states and territories will be guaranteed the better of the old system or the new system. Fifthly, by 2026 the Productivity Commission will conduct an inquiry to assess whether the updated system is working efficiently and effectively and operating as intended. Sixthly, it will separately provide short-term top-ups to Western Australia and the Northern Territory to keep their relativities above 0.7 and 4.66 respectively from 2019-20 to 2021-22.


As a result of this legislation, all states will be better off, with the Australian government injecting an additional $9 billion over 10 years to 2028-29. The GST pool from 2026-27 will grow by more than a billion dollars each and every year compared with what would have occurred without these reforms. We have provided a national solution to a national challenge that was in the too-hard basket for too long. I commend this bill to the Senate.

I'm not surprised that he wants to lock those in, because we need to go a lot further. We need to go a lot further than just changing the uplift rates on the PRRT. We need to actually put a 10 per cent floor on annual royalty from these projects that can be offset against future PRRT liabilities.

That was the basis on which, as a government, we focused on the national interest. We developed our plan to make GST arrangements fairer for WA and better for national economic growth and job creation, while also making sure that every state is better off.


This bill reforms GST payments to the states and territories by providing a fairer and more sustainable way of distributing the GST. It is a plan which addresses a longstanding unfairness for Western Australia in a way that leaves all states and territories better off. Since it was introduced in 2000, every dollar of GST raised has been distributed to the states and territories according to the system of horizontal fiscal equalisation. While this worked in a relatively predictable way in the early years of the horizontal fiscal equalisation system, the mining investment boom demonstrated that Australia's horizontal fiscal equalisation system struggles to function well when faced with economic shocks. In particular, the mining investment and construction boom created significant volatility in the distribution of the GST.


The government's plan will firstly create a new equalisation benchmark—the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria, whichever is higher. Secondly, it will introduce a permanent in-system relativity floor of 0.7 from 2022-23, increasing to 0.75 from 2024-25. Thirdly, it will permanently boost the GST pool of funds available for distribution to the states and territories by providing direct Commonwealth cash injections each year from 2021-22 onwards. These are in addition to GST collections. Fourthly, during the transition period from 2021-22 to 2026-27, states and territories will be guaranteed the better of the old system or the new system. Fifthly, by 2026 the Productivity Commission will conduct an inquiry to assess whether the updated system is working efficiently and effectively and operating as intended. Sixthly, it will separately provide short-term top-ups to Western Australia and the Northern Territory to keep their relativities above 0.7 and 4.66 respectively from 2019-20 to 2021-22.


As a result of this legislation, all states will be better off, with the Australian government injecting an additional $9 billion over 10 years to 2028-29. The GST pool from 2026-27 will grow by more than a billion dollars each and every year compared with what would have occurred without these reforms. We have provided a national solution to a national challenge that was in the too-hard basket for too long. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2018-11-14,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (12:45):  Labor's ugly and opportunistic politics of division need to be outed. In recent times, we've seen Labor promote the politics of envy, jealousy and resentment of one Australian against their fellow Australian. It is the politics of division, the politics of class warfare and the politics of denigrating the virtues of hard work, self-reliance and delayed gratification. Virtues which have built our nation are being demonised by Labor in favour of the disingenuous and dishonest socialist dogma of an alleged equity, which in actual practice sees all people ultimately become equally poor. As Margaret Thatcher said, socialism always fails because they 'run out of other people's money'.


To partially pay for Labor's extravagant policies, they are intent on ripping off hardworking Australians who have worked hard, seeking to be self-reliant and not be a burden on their fellow Australians. Today, I will deal with just two of Labor's five unfair tax policies conceived in the womb of envy. First is Labor's policy on negative gearing. Now, seriously, this is 'policy stupid' on steroids. To justify Labor's tax grab, they use all the rhetoric of division but no common sense. Negative gearing allows mortgage payments to be deducted against rental income by property owners. The practical impact of removing this deduction will, in fact, hit the poorest the hardest. Why is that? Because all the reports have indicated that, if you remove negative gearing, the household owner will make up for it by increasing rent, so it is the renters within our community who will actually pay the burden of Labor's tax grab. As we might think, it is mainly the renters within the community who are, in fact, on the lowest incomes. In my home state of Tasmania, it has been determined to be about $500 per annum extra that people renting their houses will need to pay to their landlords, courtesy of Labor's attempted tax grab.


Labor have portrayed this as somehow being an unfair concession to the rich. That's the rhetoric, but, as I always want to do in these debates and in considering these matters, I ask: what are the facts? The facts are that in my home state of Tasmania, for example, in the electorate of Lyons, there are 3,000 negative gearers. In the electorate of Braddon, where the Liberal Party has just endorsed Gavin Pearce—an exceptionally good candidate—there are 3,400 negative gearers. In the electorate of Bass, there are 3½ thousand negative gearers. And so the list goes on. Labor, having realised the stupidity of their policy, have sought to say that they will somehow grandfather it. Let's remember the actual numbers within the Australian community, because those who use negative gearing are neither rich nor the owners of multiple investment properties. Rather—and these are very stunning statistics—they are made up of 58,000 teachers, 41,000 nurses, 52,000 retail workers, 19,000 police and emergency personnel, and tradies and small business people who put aside a bit of money each month to save for their future. About two-thirds of those who negative gear have a taxable income under $80,000 per annum. So much for Labor's dishonest portrayal that these are, allegedly, the rich people within the community. And 71 per cent have only one property, and 72 per cent use it for a tax deduction of less than $10,000 per year.


There are approximately 1.3 million of our fellow Australians who negatively gear, and according to the Labor Party they are the filthy rich, who need to have their tax burden increased. No, they are 1.3 million of our fellow Australians who are willing to delay and defer income today for a better future for themselves tomorrow so they won't be reliant on their fellow Australians through the welfare system. They want to work hard and they want to save to ensure that they can be self-reliant and not a burden on their fellow Australians. These are virtues that we in the Liberal Party embrace; these are virtues that we in the Liberal Party want to ensure are continued.


Just briefly, the Australian Labor Party in fact got rid of negative gearing once. That worked out exceptionally well, didn't it? Within two years they had to reinstate it. Mr Swan, whilst he was Treasurer, told Melbourne radio, 'It would be economically disastrous to do anything on negative gearing.' Mr Swan was right then, and that statement remains right today. It is a matter of regret that the Australian Labor Party do not see that it is still the case today.


Secondly, in the brief bit of time remaining to me, I turn to Labor's attempt to double-tax our pensioners and our self-funded retirees. Here we have another cohort of the Australian community that are not rich. In fact, it's 870,000 of our fellow Australians who will be impacted by Labor's tax grab, which seeks to double-tax them. With the dividend imputation that Labor wants to remove we have a situation where franking credits used by the shareholder are allowed to be offset against their tax obligation. In other words, it would be a tax refund. And who are the people who currently benefit from this? They are overwhelmingly low-income earners within the Australian community.


As I said, 870,000 of our fellow Australians will be worse off under Labor's proposed changes. More than half of all the people impacted by Labor's policy have a taxable income below $18,200. Hello, Mr Shorten? Hello, Labor Party? This is not a cohort of the filthy rich, as Labor would seek to portray them. Indeed, 96 per cent of all people who will be impacted have a taxable income below $87,000—hardly the filthy rich! And yet these are the people that the Australian Labor Party would seek to target, be it those who are currently employed or be they teachers, nurses or retail workers who want to save for the future and put a nest egg aside. As the Liberal Party and as the Liberal government, we say to them, 'If you want to have a go, we'll give you a fair go.' Labor's approach is, 'If you want to have a go, we'll tax you to ensure that you cannot get ahead.' We do support the aspirational, those who believe in the virtues of self-reliance, working hard and deferring lifestyle today until tomorrow to ensure that they can be self-reliant and not a burden on their fellow Australians. 


I say to my fellow Australians as we approach the next election: be exceptionally careful with what the Australian Labor Party will need to do to fund their extravagant policies. The funding of their extravagant policies will come out of your pockets, especially those of you who seek to look after yourselves. The Liberals will always give a fair go to those who seek to have a go.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2018-11-14,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) and the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia (Senator Canavan) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and Kitching today relating to the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and to the Minister for the Environment (Ms Price).


On the Indonesian free-trade agreement, can I say that the Prime Minister's visit to Singapore has now exposed in full the utter debacle created by Mr Morrison's desperate decision to trash decades of considered, bipartisan foreign policy to try to win a few votes in Wentworth—and didn't that go well! We learnt in Senate estimates that the decision to consider moving the Australian embassy in Israel wasn't taken to cabinet; that it wasn't based on any proposal from DFAT; that the foreign minister, Senator Payne, was given less than 48 hours notice; and that the media was briefed before the Australian Defence Force. Mr Turnbull warned that it would prompt a very negative reaction from Indonesia and he was right. This decision from Mr Morrison is harming our economy, costing jobs and damaging one of Australia's most important relationships. Mr Morrison himself in Jakarta in September said that the agreement:


… will open the door to a new era of opportunities for Australian and Indonesian business. Whether in agriculture and manufacturing, services or investment, this new agreement lays a foundation to realise the economic potential of our partnership.


It will create jobs and it will create wealth for both countries.


He said that the agreement would be signed within months, and media were briefed that it would be signed this week on the sidelines of the EAS in Singapore. Now it is sidelined. Why? To quote the Indonesian trade minister, the delay is 'because of Palestine', and he has made it clear that the agreement will be delayed until this is fixed.


Under this trade deal, 99 per cent of Australian exports to Indonesia will be tariff free—exports like frozen beef, sheep meat, feed grains, steel coil, citrus products, carrots and potatoes. But now, because of Mr Morrison's short-sighted, ill-considered decision, Australian farmers, Australian manufacturers and Australian workers will suffer. But this isn't just about trade. Indonesia is a critical relationship to Australia, but it is fair to say that our bilateral ties struggle to reach their full potential.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  So why did you suspend the live cattle trade?




Senator WONG:
  You may not be interested, Senator, but we actually care about this relationship. Indonesia is the world's fourth-largest country by population and is projected to be the fourth-largest economy by 2050. The largest economy in South-East Asia, Indonesia is critical to Australia's security and stability—something Labor has always understood, from Curtin and Chifley through Keating and Hawke and the Rudd and Gillard governments. Yet, under this government, our trade with Indonesia has actually decreased. As Mr Morrison said in Singapore, just moments ago after meeting with Indonesia's President:


Indonesia doing well economically, Indonesia doing well strategically, is good for Australia, and that's why we do it. We do it because it's good for our national interests to support Indonesia's advancement.


He said that 'it's good for our national interests'. Well, Prime Minister, perhaps you should have put that on your lapel badge: 'Do what's good for Australia's national interests'. Instead, you trashed the national interests to try to get votes in Wentworth.


But, even worse, now we are seeing this terrible decision dragged through the prism of the Liberal Party's bitter internal divisions. The same people who tore down Malcolm Turnbull and elevated Mr Morrison are now weaponising the embassy decision to continue their hard right, divisive agenda to undermine another Liberal Prime Minister. We've already seen Senator Abetz gleefully leaping onto Sky News to undermine our relationship with Indonesia. 'Brilliant Mr Morrison', who is supposed to be such a strategic genius, has now, after losing votes on this issue in Wentworth, firmly wedged himself, between the national interest and the interests of the people who made him Prime Minister. He is trapped between doing the right thing by the nation and returning to sensible bipartisan policy. But, if he does, he will face the political consequences from the hard right.


Of course, Australia should consider foreign policy decisions based on our national interests. But that means that you have to be responsible enough to act consistently for the national interest. The overturning of the bipartisan position on the location of the embassy in Israel for short-term political gain was not in our national interests. Well, Labor says 'enough'. Under pressure from journalists in Singapore, Mr Morrison has just committed to making a decision on the embassy by Christmas. Why Christmas, Prime Minister? Why not now? It took you one day to wreck this trade deal; why do you have to wait another month to fix it? (Time expired)

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-11-14,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:08):  I'm absolutely gobsmacked at the extraordinary hypocrisy of the Labor Party, weeping hot tears of grief on a free trade agreement after five free trade agreements have already been negotiated by the coalition; two of which I vaguely remember the Labor Party actually tried to scuttle—the China free trade agreement and the TPP. Yet now they come in here bleating about an Indonesia free trade agreement.


I agree with Senator Wong on one thing: she is absolutely right when she says that the partnership between Australia and Indonesia is one of our nation's most significant. She is right, because Indonesia is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and it presents significant and profound opportunities for Australia as the demand grows for our goods and our services and particularly our produce. It has a rapidly growing consumer base and it is projected to be the world's fourth-largest economy in the world by 2050. By bolstering the economic ties between our nations it will lead to even greater opportunities for Australian businesses, for Australian manufacturers and for Australian farmers.


Our extensive relationship with Indonesia is both mature and strong. It sustains constructive dialogue on all issues of common interest and it is steeped in the history of both our nations. Do you know what, Madam Deputy President? Prime Minister Morrison, who is talking about an Indonesian free trade agreement as we sit here today, is just the right man to do it. We can rely on Prime Minister Morrison to make the right deals. When we are dotting the i's and crossing the t's, as Senator Cormann mentioned, on this free trade agreement he is the right man to be doing it.


He's a man that we've trusted with the most important decisions of this government for the last five years. If we think about it, at the stage when the coalition came to office it was Mr Morrison who was the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. He was the man who stopped the boats. He was the man who turned them around and sent them back. He was the man who shut down 18 detention centres in the last five years. He was the man who did that.


When he was the Minister for Social Services, he was the one who reduced our welfare dependency to its lowest rate in 25 years. And, of course, as Treasurer his track record speaks for itself. We now have economic growth of 3.4 per cent. That is at the top of the OECD league ladder and it is the envy of the developed world. We have created more than 1.2 million jobs in the last five years alone; 89,000 were what the Labor Party created in their last year of government. That's 89,000 compared to 1.2 million new jobs, with around 400,000 in the last 12 months. The vast majority of those were full-time, and the vast majority went to women. In fact, the female participation rate is at higher levels than it has ever been at before. Youth unemployment is down to low levels—the lowest levels in 25 years. We've maintained our AAA credit rating from not one, not two, but three credit-rating agencies. And, of course, the budget is on its way back to balance one year earlier than anticipated. That's what good fiscal management will deliver.


And good fiscal management pays political dividends, because people want an economy that's creating jobs and they want an economy that's growing, and they trust Prime Minister Morrison to deliver it in the same way that they have trusted Prime Minister Morrison to negotiate the finer points of an Indonesian free trade agreement—an Indonesian free trade agreement which is part of our growth strategy for the Australian economy.


As I said, this is the sixth free trade agreement that we've negotiated in just five years. Think about it: the China free trade agreement was a game-changing and transformative agreement for the Australian economy. There was China, Japan, South Korea and the TPP—of course, we could hardly forget the TPP. We nearly didn't get that through; that was only in the last couple of weeks. Now there is Peru and, finally, Indonesia in just five years. That's how we create the opportunities for Australian businesses and that's how we ensure our economy stays strong. That's how we can ensure that there are jobs and growth for future generations of Australians. (Time expired)

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-11-14,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:13):  Today's question time reinforced, just as yesterday's did, that we have a reckless, big-talking Prime Minister who is full of big promises and short on attention to detail, delivery and any sense of the national interest. His desperate decision to try to win votes in Wentworth is costing us jobs and is at great expense to our relationships not only with Indonesia but with many other parts of the world.


We have seen Mr Morrison, our Prime Minister, junk a longstanding bipartisan foreign policy, and it is a key foreign policy that is important to the success of the Australia-Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. We saw Senator Cormann arguing that the i's and the t's are just being dotted and crossed, and that's the reason for the delay. But Indonesia's own trade minister says the delay in signing the agreement is because of Palestine. You may say that it's about dotting the i's and crossing the t's, but the simple fact is that it is delayed because the question of moving the embassy to Jerusalem has not been resolved and ruled out.


Senator Hume says that this is in fact about Mr Morrison debating and refining the finer points of the agreement. Frankly, I think that is bollocks. We know that the delay is about getting this issue of this nonsense idea of moving Australia's embassy to Jerusalem off the table. We've seen this entrench further division and chaos in the coalition. We saw Senator Abetz, who is in fact the government's chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, suggesting that Australia rethink the $360 million we give them in aid each year. I'm assuming Senator Abetz is a great fan of moving the embassy to Jerusalem. The idea that a view like that could be reflected in the media or in this place shows the disregard with which members of this place are prepared to treat the important views of Indonesia.


Mr Morrison said last September that the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement would be signed within months. The media had been briefed that it would be signed this week on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit in Singapore. Again Senator Cormann and Senator Hume might say, 'No, this is actually all about Prime Minister Morrison getting the job done, making sure we get all the finer details of it correct.' Well, it certainly sounds to me like it was all ready to be done, all ready to be signed, but for this absolute catastrophe of international policy, this brain fart of an idea that we think it would be a good idea to move Australia's embassy to Jerusalem.


The Australian people are right to be concerned about this and to demand that Mr Morrison gets this done and signs the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement before he comes back to Australia. How could he facilitate that? Perhaps by making a quick decision to say, 'Yes, we'll take our bollocks idea about moving Australia's embassy to Jerusalem off the table', and to do so immediately.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (15:18):  I always enjoy making a contribution in these matters when Labor's hypocrisy sits writ large, front and centre. Let's refresh their memory. The last time they even said the word 'Indonesia' from a trade perspective was when they ceased the trade of live cattle into Indonesia, bringing tens of thousands of Australian families to their knees. Many of them have never recovered. Many have been bankrupted. Even more importantly, there was a significant social impact in Indonesia with the loss of such an important source of protein at that time. They didn't really care. They don't care. In fact, I've been here five years and I think that's the first time I've heard Senator Wong even talk about agriculture or trade agreements—never before. There was .no interest yesterday, the day before, last week, last month or last year. They're embarrassed, because we all know what happened under Labor with their attempts to bring to a close—over six or seven years, I think it was—negotiations for a free trade agreement with China. Of course, it wasn't until we had an excellent minister in place that we closed that out in less than two years.


So this is just complete hypocrisy. The government is well and truly on the record that this agreement is progressing. We're at a point where there's the scrubbing of legal terms. The TPA agreement has to be done in a number of languages. We're checking it. We're going very steadily with that job, as you would expect. Here you are: you'd have us go ahead and sign the document on behalf of this nation without having any regard to the national interests and the responsibilities that come with FTAs. So we just need to remind anybody listening of the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party.


It's not to do with a delay in a free trade agreement. It has nothing to do with that. It's not to do with the consideration of the location of the embassy in Israel, which is under due consideration. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that a decision will be taken before Christmas. I can almost hear the bells of Santa Claus. It's not as if it's been delayed for 12 months, two years or three years. This is simply about one thing: Prime Minister Morrison is obviously biting significantly into your polling around Mr Shorten. That's what this is all about. You have to concentrate. You don't stand up in this place during question time or any other time wanting to have a serious conversation about serious matters. You don't want to talk about the economy, because you can't, of course. Australians break out in a giggle when you start to talk about the economy. You don't want to talk about employment, because of the sterling figures that have been produced by this coalition, a major contribution made by Mr Morrison.


You are frightened of Mr Morrison. It is as clear as the nose on your face. Every time you're in here talking about it, you're trying to peg back some country you've lost. Well, I'll tell you this: I agree you ought to be frightened, because as I move around my electorate of Queensland I'm starting to get very strong reports. They say: 'I like this bloke. I trust this bloke.' They've said it hasn't been since John Howard that we've been able to sense what a person is and what they're going to deliver. So I know your polling is showing that. I know Bill is over there—Mr Shorten, I should say—shaking in his boots at the moment. That's why it's reflected in your strategies in the Senate this week. That's all you've wanted to talked about. You don't want to talk about the important issues of domestic violence. You don't want to talk about other economic initiatives that are being pursued by the government and frustrated by you. You just want to talk about Mr Morrison. You want to dip the paintbrush into a bit of old paint of 15 years ago. You want to talk about a free trade agreement that's progressing very well and will be significant for this country—probably one of the most important. You want to talk about a decision that's under review, as it appropriately should be, in relation to the location of our embassy in Israel. You are frightened. It is clear. You would do better to try and make a positive alternative policy narrative than to continue this attack, which is failing you dismally.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:23):  It's another moment, another week and another month when we, as Australians, feel embarrassment under the leadership of Prime Minister Morrison or, indeed, whoever is in the role of leadership in this country under this coalition government. It is another moment, thanks to this government, when we all feel the cringe and the embarrassment, as Australians, of knowing about the mutterings in the Pacific, in the region, of our nearest neighbours, that will filter throughout the diplomatic channels and elsewhere—mutterings about how arrogant we are as a nation when we hear of the thought bubbles that come out of this government and out of this Prime Minister's mouth. Whether it's junking longstanding bipartisan foreign policy, such as the thought-bubble decision of moving the Australian embassy to Jerusalem, or whether it's the rude words of the now environment minister, who has been termed the L-plated environment minister, it leaves Australians in a diplomatic mess. It does not serve Australia's national interests in any way whatsoever.


It's very rare that I agree with Senator Fierravanti-Wells, the former Minister for International Development and the Pacific. But, having read her opinion piece in The Sydney Morning Heraldtoday, at least there is one senator on that side that does recognise the effects of climate change on the Pacific. She raises that in her opinion piece in some detail, but then she gets to the important point that it is 'regrettable' that the good work that has been done by this government in the Pacific has been damaged by this new, L-plates environment minister in, as we know, that very unfortunate incident with former President of Kiribati Anote Tong. In answers to questions asked by Senator Kitching on this very matter, we did not receive from Senator Cormann anything detailed in relation to that—or, indeed, how it has damaged our relationship with the Pacific. That has not been the only thing, of course, that has damaged our relationship with the Pacific. The decision by the government to not even have the Prime Minister attend the Pacific Islands Forum meeting on Nauru was another embarrassing and short-sighted decision. Former President Tong said in a recent interview, about Minister Price:


Obviously she needs to learn a great deal more about the world around her … If she came to Kiribati, I would be happy to show her what we do. Maybe she could begin to understand … and be less arrogant about it.


I think it shows very clearly how arrogant we are perceived to be by the region, and rightly so, after that minister's comments on the night in question.


Now, it doesn't just stop there, but it needs to stop. Whether it's in relation to the Pacific or whether it's in relation to Indonesia, it needs to stop. We need to stop, straightaway, this undiplomatic language and these stupid decisions—these thought-bubble decisions—that have damaged our relationship with our nearest neighbours. But, instead, what do we have? We have Senator Abetz going on Sky News today and undermining even further our relationship with Indonesia. Well, we have all had enough. We have all had enough of the embarrassment and the cringing we feel when we hear these former ministers, current ministers, ministers on L-plates, new prime ministers, former prime ministers or whatever revolving-door positions those on the other side are in today—




Senator Cameron:
  What muppet now?




Senator SINGH:
  Whatever muppet is popping up now—thanks, Senator Cameron. We've had enough of it. We've certainly had enough of it. We want to ensure that our relationships with our nearest neighbours are solid, concrete partnerships. That is why our leader, Bill Shorten, made that pledge at a recent speech outlining what Labor would do in government with our relationships in the Pacific—how it would be a partnership and not paternalism, and that we know, with the rising sea levels, we need to take action to support our neighbours now.

  The government acknowledges the United Nations World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims and the invaluable work of emergency services across the globe in responding to and assisting those in need. Road safety is a key priority of this government. No-one should be killed or seriously injured on our roads. The government commends the work of Mr Peter Frazer in his tireless advocacy in the promotion of road safety across the country. The government commissioned an independent inquiry into the effectiveness of the National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020, which was released in September. The government will continue to work with key road safety stakeholders, all levels of government and the parliament.

   (i) the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) annual data, released on 13 November 2018, shows the gender pay gap is still unacceptably high at 16.2%,


   (ii) men earn $25,717 or 21.3% more than women each year on average, in full-time work across all jobs, including overtime and bonuses,


   (iii) financial and insurance services remains the industry with the highest total remuneration gender pay gap at 30.3%,


   (iv) construction is the industry with the second-highest gender pay gap at 29.4%,


   (v) the female-dominated industry of health care and social assistance saw a second annual increase in its gender pay gap to 16.1%,


   (vi) more than half of employers do not analyse their pay data for gender pay gaps,


   (vii) 41.5% of employers who did a pay gap analysis took no action to address it,


   (viii) only 17.9% of organisations that conducted a gender pay gap analysis are actually reporting pay equity metrics up to the boards and governing bodies,


   (ix) when it comes to Paid Parental Leave, women account for 94.9% of all primary carer's leave utilised, with men accounting for only 5.1%, and


   (x) less than 2 in 100 companies have set targets for men's engagement in flexible work; and


(b) calls on the Federal Government to:


   (i) increase the resourcing for WGEA, strengthen its powers and require large employers publicly report their gender pay gap, and


   (ii) prohibit the use of pay gag clauses in private employment contracts, which clauses disguise the gender pay gap in the private sector.

Senator RUSTON:
  The gender pay gap has been trending down under the Liberal-National government. Based on ABS data, the gender pay gap has fallen to 14.5 per cent, the lowest percentage on record—falling by 2.7 percentage points under the Liberal-National government. The government has provided an additional $8 million to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency to enable them to increase the scope of their gender pay gap reporting from around 40 per cent of the workforce to around 75 per cent of the workforce. The information provided by WGEA to employers provides them with a clear picture, enabling them to address pay disparities in the workplace. The United Kingdom has recently imposed a requirement for companies with 250 employees or more to report their gender pay gap publicly. We will consider how effective this is as further data becomes available.

We're rolling out the red-carpet-engagement treatment for the Japanese Prime Minister. It's a friendship/close allies visit to talk about closer regional ties, defence and national security.


This is an issue. There is a massive object in the room that no-one is talking about, and it's called a minke whale. There are 333 of them that the Japanese harpoon fleets are heading into the Southern Ocean to kill this summer. Why aren't we doing something about it?

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-11-14,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:25):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the issue:


Putting local workers first, including cracking down on 457 visas; using Australian grade steel; and protecting local manufacturers.


Look at what has happened in recent years. This government drove one of the highest skilled industries out of the country, the vehicle manufacturing industry. All over the world, countries queue up to try to get investment in high skill, high-tech manufacturing, yet what did this government do? It drove them out of the country. That has left workers in South Australia with no jobs or with jobs that pay far less. It has condemned workers to low-paying work in areas of South Australia. This government is pathetic when it comes to these issues.


On the issue of the old 457 visas, they've simply changed the name but everyone knows what the visa is. A report by Ms Bassina Farbenblum and Dr Laurie Berg entitled Wage theft in silence: why migrant workers do not recover their unpaid wages in Australia found that the majority of migrant workers are paid well below the minimum wage and only a few take the opportunity to try to recover the wages they are owed. Amongst international students and backpackers who acknowledge that they had been underpaid, the overwhelming majority suffered wage theft in silence. Less than one in 10 took action to recover the wages they were owed, only three per cent of underpaid participants contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman and well over half of them recovered none of their unpaid wages. Participants selected a range of rational reasons why they had not sought to address their underpayment: a quarter indicated fear of possible immigration consequences, close to half reported that they did not know what to do and many believed that they would not be successful. We considered this report in the references committee inquiry that was precipitated by Senator Molan backing Woolworths against cleaners in Woolworths stores. This report demonstrates that an epidemic of wage theft has taken place across this country during the coalition's time as a government—hopefully that won't be much longer.


Another area that was brought to my attention recently was the CFMEU dispute down at the Royal Hobart Hospital, where site induction training was conducted by the Master Builders Association, the MBA, which, all the time, backs these mad people that are running this muppet government. The CFMEU brought attention to a case of over 100 Chinese plasterers working at the Royal Hobart Hospital site. When the CFMEU came across them, those workers had gone unpaid for nine weeks. Workers' safety should not be left exposed on any site. Most of these workers spoke little or no English, and the site safety induction was delivered in English, courtesy of the Master Builders Association. The MBA took money from contractors to deliver the induction to workers who could not speak English and delivered that induction in the English language. The good news is that the CFMEU made sure those workers received back pay and were being paid properly. They recovered $1.132 million in entitlements. Good on the CFMEU!


The government's ABCC had done nothing at the Royal Hobart Hospital site. They'd been on the site nearly every day and had done nothing to help those workers. It just shows the bias in this organisation, the ABCC. It just shows that they don't care. They are simply an organisation set up by the coalition to attack the CFMEU and building workers. It is just outrageous. While Senator Cash and her fellow muppets are making it harder for unions to represent their members, employers and their associations are getting away with not paying workers their proper pay and delivering safety training in a language that the workers don't understand. How dopey is this? Rather than exploiting vulnerable workers on temporary work visas, employers need to be employing and training more Australian workers. Instead of punishing unions, the government should be working with unions to ensure workplaces are fair and safe.


We've got Senator Cash, now a disgraced minister who misled the Senate on five occasions and whose advisers actually breached the law and advised the press of an AFP raid on the AWU. This is a failed minister. This is a minister who, when she was finally caught out on this, turned on young women in the Leader of the Opposition's office and accused them of all sorts of crazy, unsavoury things that had no basis in fact. This minister is a disgrace. For this government to have Senator Cash sitting in the cabinet room is an example of how bad they are, how devoid they are of talent and how devoid they are of people who can do a job for the government.


The government's crocodile tears over skill shortages and Senator Cash's crocodile tears are disingenuous, because this government has failed to deliver anything over the last five years. If Senator Cash and the coalition paid more attention to improving vocational education, instead of attacking workers, attacking their unions and attacking each other, we might be in a better position in this country. We would not be in the mess we are in and we would not have this government that the former Prime Minister called 'mad' and the current Prime Minister declared were 'muppets'. This is a terrible government.


Under the draconian ABCC Building Code, unions and employers can't reach agreement to guarantee the employment of apprentices. On the one hand, they're saying there are no apprentices being employed and, on the other hand, they're stopping unions and employers reaching agreements that would give young kids in this country a fair go and give them an opportunity to get an apprenticeship. And what's the latest effort? At the same time as the OECD is reporting that Australia can't access global value chains due to the lack of skills in this country, the latest effort is for Senator Cash and the Prime Minister to cave in to Senator Hanson on this so-called bush wage. It's modelled on a thought bubble from Senator Hanson. A thought bubble from Senator Hanson isn't very big, let me tell you. We've got a situation where $60 million is going to be allocated to employers who have no record of looking after apprentices and who have not employed apprentices in the past. This is going to be at the expense of companies in the bush that have been employing apprentices for years. This is a nonsense. In Senator Cash's own state, there are 9,615 fewer apprentices, including more than 7,000 in trade occupations. This is a government that doesn't get it.

Yesterday I started my MPI contribution by pointing out that, even though the MPI came from those opposite, it reflected a number of ticks for this government on a whole range of issues where this government continues to get on with the job and to deliver for the Australian people. As we look at this MPI, we're in the same place. We're talking about Australian workers. We're talking about cracking down on 457 visa holders. We're talking about the use of Australian steel and protecting local manufacturers.


I will start with the last one first—protecting local manufacturers. 'Protection' is a very dangerous word, but the best way of protecting local manufacturers is actually giving them the chance to thrive and to grow in a growing economy and in growing export markets. What have we seen in the ABS statistics in recent times for manufacturing jobs in Australia? After a long period of structural decline, we've actually seen, according to the ABS, employment in manufacturing on the increase over the last 12 months. In the year to August, we've seen some 306,000 new jobs in the manufacturing sector, in fact, representing an increase of 2½ per cent. Manufacturing jobs surged by 86,000-odd in the last 12 months alone. One in five positions created since 2007 have actually been in manufacturing. So the policies of this government in our management of the domestic economy but also in boosting international trade through a series of free trade agreements has given Australian manufacturers the chance to succeed.


I'll just go through the recent agreement that's currently before this place, one that Labor seems to be walking away from. That is the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement. PAFTA does a number of things of advantage. I'm very keen on some of the agricultural changes, but that's not what I'm going to focus on here today. I'm going to look at the changes to machinery imports. Peru is an economy which is seeking to increasingly utilise its natural resources, be they agricultural or mineral. It wants access to high-quality agricultural and mining equipment, and that is an area where Australia has some specific international advantages. So, under the Peru free trade agreement, which is still before this place, some 95 per cent of tariffs—tariffs of up to 17 per cent—would be eliminated on it entering into force and all remaining tariffs would be eliminated within five years. There are agricultural machinery manufacturers and mining machinery manufacturers in Australia that would benefit extraordinarily from that. Through that, we would see the manufacturing sector in Australia continuing to grow and continuing to provide those long-term, high-quality jobs that all those on this side of the chamber want to see. 


Steel is vitally important to the Australian economy. It's a very important part of our manufacturing industry. It's very important for the construction sector, for engineering, for agriculture and for the mining sector. It contributes, in fact, around $11 billion to Australia's GDP every year. The steel industry is, in every sense of the words, a nation builder and is a massive contributor to our economy. More than 90,000 Australians are employed in the steel industry and related industries, and many more are employed indirectly in downstream industries that utilise steel. So this government certainly wants to see the steel industry continue in Australia and continue to supply both Australia and the world with a high-quality product.


Now we'll move on to the management of the 457 visa program. The government has abolished the 457 visa program because it isn't meeting our economic needs at this time. This was done to put Australian jobs first. There is a new visa category, the temporary skill shortage visa, which was implemented on 18 March 2018. Labor and the unions destroyed the integrity of Australia's skilled migration program when they were last in power. We are cleaning up Labor's mess with the changes that we have made to the 457 program. Workers from overseas with particular skills are required in the Australian economy. Coming from Western Australia, I very well remember the pressures in the Western Australian economy from a lack of skilled workers during the mining construction boom. It was essential for Western Australia to take advantage of the opportunities that then existed. We had a pathway to bring in skilled workers from elsewhere, and in some parts of the economy those pathways are still required where there are genuine skill shortages, and that is what the new temporary skills shortage visa will fill.


As part of the reform in this area, the coalition government tore up Labor's expansive skill list of 651 occupations and, in its place, this government is putting in place an evidence based list of occupations that reflect the genuine skills needed in our economy. This list is updated every six months. The six-monthly updates are based on research from the Department of Jobs and Small Business. In accordance with their advice, occupations are added or removed to ensure that it is responsive to the needs of the Australian labour market. In that way, it protects Australian workers.


Under Labor, the 457 program actually expanded with the addition of 40,000 foreign workers. So their rhetoric in this area, the rhetoric we just heard a few minutes ago from Senator Cameron, is a complete nonsense and a complete rewriting of history. This is a government that is getting on with the job. It is delivering for Australians by boosting the economy and by creating pathways for the high-quality produce of Australia to get to the rest of the world so our high-quality Australian manufacturers can export their products to the rest of the world. That is why this government is so committed to continuing to finding new pathways to markets—things like the Indonesia trade agreement that's currently under discussion, the Peru free trade agreement that's currently before this place and the TPP-11 which has recently been passed by this place. In this way, we see that those manufacturing jobs will continue to grow and continue to be a very important—in fact, an increasingly important—part of our economy.


As economies transition, as older jobs disappear and newer jobs flow into the market, there is the potential for dislocation. It is a legitimate role of government to help with that dislocation, but we must not try to pander to the protectionist policies of the past that have failed over and over and over again. This is, sadly, as I have stated in this place before, the path that those opposite seem to be going down. There was a consensus that trade was of benefit to the economy and of benefit to all economies—of benefit to the world. It increases our government-to-government links, it increases our business-to-business links and it increases our individual-to-individual links. It allows people to move more easily across borders to take advantage of opportunities and it allows for the free flow of goods and services, as much as practicable in a world where the idea of trade has become somewhat problematic.


We have seen an antagonism towards trade across the political spectrum, and I think this is something that is very dangerous for the planet. When we start getting into trade wars, I think it offers very real risks that can lead elsewhere. The best way of keeping the peace globally is to make sure we have a highly integrated economy where everybody trades with as many people as possible. I think it is vitally important that we continue to grow the Australian economy and that we continue to grow our manufacturing export sector. In doing so we link our economy to the rest of the world in as many ways as possible. That is the path to the jobs of the future and to getting as many Australians into work as possible—providing the high-quality jobs of the future—and that is the path this government continues to proceed down.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-11-14,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:45):  As an Australian nationalist, I make no apologies for being strong on jobs for Australians first, and that definitely includes apprenticeships. Labor and the coalition on the other hand have quite literally opened the floodgates to foreign workers on visa schemes that have sold out the unemployed and the under-unemployed right across this country. Labor sold out workers in this country by establishing a little-known category called the 400 visa. It was a category that had very little oversight and that gave approval to foreign workers, in as little as 24 hours, to come and take Australian jobs. Hundreds of thousands of workers were employed under the 400 visa category, costing long-term unemployed Australians and university graduates finishing their studies a chance of employment.


We had the 457 visa program, where, again under Labor, the floodgates were opened to foreigners to come and take hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs. When Labor lost government in 2013, they were letting 130,000 foreign workers into Australia to take jobs like ship's engineers, ship's officers, radio journalists, magistrates, park rangers, zookeepers, and flight attendants. They are just some of the jobs Labor allowed to go to foreigners. Thankfully, the number of foreign workers on the 457 visa program dropped by 60,000 last year. One Nation was largely responsible for cuts to over 200 of those job categories, some of which I mentioned before.


I also note that ACTU Secretary Sally McManus said in July this year that there are 1.4 million visa holders with working rights in Australia. That's disgusting. I have no doubt that these people are hard workers, but the point of my disgust comes down to Australians wanting a job. They have to compete with over one million overseas workers. Both Labor and the coalition have hoodwinked voters in this country. They talk tough on jobs, but they are quietly undermining the unemployed and the future youth, who will one day join the search for a job in Australia.


I want to bring to the Senate's attention another real problem that both Labor and the coalition have failed to recognise. The Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations, Kelly O'Dwyer, last year admitted in a Financial Review interview that 400,000 ABNs were issued to people on visas who are not allowed to work in this country. Australians find that to be so typical of government departments—they don't talk to each other. So, on top of the 1.4 million work visas issued to foreigners, we have a further 400,000 taking jobs from Aussies under the guise of small-business ownership.


I note this matter of public importance also highlights the need to protect local manufacturers and Australian grade steel. It's a bit bloody tough to protect Australian grade steel when the Greens, supported by Labor, are constantly trying to shut down mining in this country. You see, Australian-grade steel requires Australian coal, particularly the high-quality coal from my home state of Queensland, along with the high-grade iron ore from my One Nation colleague's home state of Western Australia. When I stayed in camp with 800 miners in Moranbah only a few weeks ago, I learned that the majority of Central Queensland coalmines are producing coking coal, which is one of two key ingredients for Australian-grade steel. Australian coking coal is mixed with Western Australian iron ore to form the best steel in the world. That's why we're exporting these two commodities to countries like China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. They want their bridges and buildings to stand the test of time. But, if the Greens and Labor team up again at the next election with their mutual preference deals, we'll be thrust back to building straw-and-mud homes. The key to using Australian-grade steel and protecting local manufacturers is to stop demonising coal and other mining throughout this country.


As for Senator Cameron's approach to my policy on getting apprenticeships in this country, I've done more for the youth of this nation in apprenticeship schemes than Labor have ever done. If it means that rural and regional areas get the chance for their youth to get into apprenticeship schemes then so be it. If you want to refer to it as sucking up— (Time expired)

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-11-14,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:51):  There is only one party in this place that can be trusted to put the interests of Australian workers first, and that's the Australian Labor Party. So let's look at this issue of putting workers first.


Let's look at the issue of 457 visas. This is an area which this government has completely mucked up. We know that last year the then Turnbull government rushed to announce the crackdown on 457 visas in around April, and they did that without consulting affected stakeholders. The changes and the subsequent revisions to the skilled occupation lists sent waves of uncertainty through the business, innovation and education sectors. We know that, within Mr Dutton's own department, officials were describing the skilled migration changes as a dog's breakfast. So this is a government that can't be trusted in relation to the issue of 457 visas.


We know that this is an issue particularly in Central and Northern Queensland. Our candidate in the seat of Flynn, Mr Zac Beers, has been very active in this particular space, conducting roundtables with our shadow minister for immigration, Shayne Neumann. That happened in April. We're particularly concerned about the reports that, in the solar farm area, there are unskilled workers going about on backpacker visas. These are not specialised workers, and they shouldn't be used to undertake work that should be completed by qualified professionals. This appears to be going on at the moment. So we've got an out-of-touch LNP that's constantly fought against labour market testing, which ensures that Australian workers are given the first shot at local jobs before temporary work visas are made available here. We've seen that Mr O'Dowd, the current member for Flynn, has voted against putting important labour-market-testing conditions into legislation, selling out local workers in Gladstone.


Let's look at the issue of labour hire, another issue that impacts particularly in Central Queensland. If you're listening for policies on the other side to deal with this issue of unfair labour hire practices, you'd be very disappointed, because there is not a peep from the government on this issue of unfair labour hire practices. Compare this with Labor. We have come up with the 'same jobs, same pay' policy, which goes a long way towards addressing this issue.


Again, Labor's candidate in the seat of Flynn is out there talking to workers who are the victims of unfair labour hire practices. He's been through places like Gladstone, Biloela, Moura, Blackwater and the Central Highlands, finding that these areas are being crippled by the atrocious behaviour of big companies that are taking advantage of the broken industrial relations system that we have, which allows casual labour hire to be a replacement for permanent jobs. Mr Beers has said that across Flynn he's heard stories from workers who have been made redundant, losing their permanent jobs and being offered their positions back as casual labour hire employees at significantly lower rates and with absolutely no job security or certainty. He's also heard from workers who have literally had to wait by the phone, afraid to miss a call from their employer to come in for a shift because, if they don't answer that call, they know that they'll be taken off the roster for weeks to come. He's also heard from workers who have been forced to accept unsafe and potentially life-threatening working conditions.


We know that, in Central Queensland, if you're dependent on a labour hire job and you speak up about safety issues, you can quite easily lose your job. It's an absolute disgrace that this government has stood by and allowed this practice of labour hire to infect workplaces around the country. The misuse of labour hire is destroying Central Queensland communities—let's not make any bones about that. This is a practice that must come to an end. Only a Shorten Labor government is committed to stamping out this insidious practice and restoring fairness to workers across Australia.


When we come to the issue of manufacturing, let's never forget in this place that it was those opposite who destroyed the automotive manufacturing industry. They walked away from it. Every country around the world worth its salt that has a motor vehicle manufacturing industry puts in some degree of subsidy. But this government would not support our sovereign capacity to manufacture motor vehicles. We on this side have a strong plan that will ensure that local manufacturing firms and jobs continue.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2018-11-14,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:56):  Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, you may have heard the saying 'leading with your chin'. This motion from Senator Urquhart says:


Putting local workers first, including cracking down on 457 visas; using Australian grade steel; and protecting local manufacturers.


For the Labor Party to put this motion forward, is leading with your chin, for sure.


Let's have a look at the facts here. The motion talks about 'putting local workers first, including cracking down on 457 visas'. There are no 457 visas—they've been abolished. But there were 457s. When Labor was in power there were 40,000 more people working in Australia on 457 visas than there were when we abolished the 457s. When those opposite were in government there were more people working on 457 visas than when we took over government and abolished the 457 visas and brought in the new system, the temporary skill shortage visas. The new temporary skill shortage visa was implemented on 18 March 2018. Labor and the unions destroyed the integrity of Australia's skilled migration program, just like they destroyed the integrity of our borders. Those opposite cannot be trusted on their border policies, nor can they be trusted to run this country.


As part of our reform package, the coalition tore up Labor's expansive list of 651 occupations listed on the 457 visa, which had opened up Australia's labour market and permanent resident programs to occupations such as potters, goat herders—I'm sure there'd be a big demand for goat herders—and cattery workers. In its place, the government established an evidence based list of occupations that reflects the genuine skill needs of our economy. I want to emphasise the point that, under Labor, there were more people coming into Australia on 457 visas and working than there were under the coalition government—yet they are complaining about the 457 visa.


The motion also talks about 'using Australian grade steel'. I couldn't agree more. The steel industry is vital and employs many, many people. The steel industry, and our incredibly high-quality steel, is worth billions of dollars here. In fact, it contributes $11 billion to Australia's GDP each year. The steel industry is a nation builder and a significant contributor to our economy. More than 90,000 Australians are employed in the steel industry and many more are employed indirectly in downstream industries that utilise the steel.


So here we have Labor saying that we've got to look after our steel and buy local steel, but who is against coalmining? We know who is against coalmining. Don't shake your head, Senator Watt. It depends where Mr Shorten is talking. If he is in Melbourne and talking at a by-election he is against coalmining. You know that you will be hamstrung by the Greens. You know that the Greens are the tail wagging the dog and they want to shut down every mine in Australia.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Williams, I don't want to dob in Senator Ketter, but it is Senator Ketter, not Senator Watt.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  My apologies, Mr Acting Deputy President. They've changed seats. My sincere apologies. Senator Ketter—instead of Senator Watt—here you are opposing coalmining, but how do we produce steel? Out of coking coal. We have high-quality coking coal, some of the best in the world, and the steel we produce is magnificent steel. As I said, there are 90,000 people employed, plus a huge number of people in employment on the downstream side.


You want to keep manufacturing here. Well, the problem we've got in Australia is the cost of doing business here compared to the rest of the world. What's one of the main costs? One of the main costs is electricity. Remember 2010, when Labor was in power? 'There'll be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Yes, I think Senator Brown remembers that famous quote: 'There'll be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Of course, along came the member for New England, Mr Tony Windsor, and he stamped his foot and said, 'I'll get behind you on one condition: that a multiparty climate change committee be formed.' And what did we get? We got a tax of $9 billion a year and growing—nine thousand million dollars in tax. It put electricity prices up. What does that do for manufacturing here? It means we are uncompetitive.




Senator Carol Brown:
  You're in government. What've you been doing?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I think, Mr Acting Deputy President, the truth is starting to hurt Senator Carol Brown. I don't think she's enjoying what I'm saying, but she's going to have to sit there and listen carefully and take every word in, because what I'm saying is the absolute truth.


So you've put the cost of doing business up. I see it all the time. I've seen it at an abattoir in Inverell. Where they used to pay $40,000 a week for electricity, they're now paying $70,000 a week because of things such as the renewable energy target, which, thank goodness, the coalition did reduce from 41,000 gigawatts to 33,000 gigawatts—and it should have been reduced more. There's nothing wrong with renewable energy, on one condition: it competes on a level playing field. We see the wind towers being built now in the plain between Inverell and Glen Innes. That's fine, but there's one problem: for every wind tower that spins eight hours a day, 365 days a year, anyone who's hooked to the grid—the pensioner, the widow, the business, the family—pays $700,000 a year to that one wind turbine before they buy one watt of electricity. I think that is very unfair.


What they did in South Australia was put these windmills everywhere. Where I grew up, at Jamestown, the hills are covered with them. Of course, because of the subsidy, they can sell electricity cheaply. What did they do? They sent the coal-fired power station at Port Augusta broke. It was literally blown up. What happened then? The lights went out. The lights went out because the stupid subsidies sent the reliable source of electricity broke.


We have the crazy attitude of many in here that Australia is going to dominate the world, rule the world and change the world. They had a column in the Australian Hotel a few weeks ago—The Australian newspaper, sorry; though I have been to the Australian Hotel before today, I can tell you—that highlighted the number of coal-fired generation plants being constructed around the world. Guess what they're going to burn in those coal-fired generating plants? They're going to burn coal. Do they burn the more efficient coal from Australia or do they burn the second-rate brown coal from Indonesia, China or wherever? The Greens and many others will say: 'Don't have a coalmine in Australia. Don't burn more efficient coal, with higher energy and less CO2 production. Burn the rubbish coal and, hence, shut down the mining here and take away our wealth and our jobs.' That is the crazy hypocrisy of this whole situation. As Dr Finkel, our Chief Scientist, said, we can cut out all our emissions, 1.3 per cent of the world's CO2, and it will have virtually no effect on the planet whatsoever, but we're paying for it and paying dearly. I return to the cost of doing business. If we want to keep manufacturing here, we need to keep the costs down, and electricity is one.


You don't want to see foreigners working here. Mr Acting Deputy President, it was 15 September 2008, a while back now, when I made my maiden speech to this chamber. I said then that some of the young ones in Australia who are fit and capable of working need a touch on the backside with a cattle prod—not literally, metaphorically—to get them off their butts and get them to work. When I was a young fella, if you didn't work it was a shame. You were shamed in your community. We didn't have enough land for me to work when I threw in my scholarship at university in and came home to the farm, so I took up shearing sheep. It's not an easy job. There's probably none tougher. I remember my first day shearing. I worked my butt off for eight hours and crawled out on all fours. I had shorn 32 sheep for the day. I thought, 'What a great future I have in this industry!' Anyway, I got better as time went on. I then went driving trucks.


So the young ones, the healthy ones, need to get to work. Our abattoir at Inverell employs 800 people. It was started by the great man John McDonald and his family, who kicked off the abattoir after it had closed down about 20 years ago. Locals were employed. They actually ran a bus out to areas of unemployment such as Tyngin. People came to work for the first couple of days. Then they didn't come to work. Australians came to work and—guess what?—they failed the grog test. They failed the drug test. They got the spear. They were offered a job, they had a job and they wouldn't play by the rules.


So what do we have now? We have many Filipino and Brazilian workers there because we can't get others to work there. It is all right to say, 'Let's have the locals working,' but they've got to have a bit of a go. There's nothing wrong with working at abattoirs. It's a great industry that relies on exports and export income. It has great local jobs and puts great money in the local community. So it's all right to say, 'Preserve our jobs,' but the locals are going to have to work. In many countries, as Senator Gichuhi pointed out about where she comes from in her maiden speech, if you don't work, you don't get paid. Luckily we do in Australia, but that money should be there to help people along to the next job. For those who refuse to work, we have a real problem because some are simply not capable of working and we need to keep business costs down.

"Anning, Sen Fraser",KAP,2018-11-14,"



Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (17:06):  This MPI raises a number of very important matters of great concern to me. As I said in my speech opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, there has been a long list of so-called free trade deals, going back to the disastrous Lima agreement of 1975, which have crippled our manufacturing industries and, in the process, shed many hundreds of thousands of Aussie jobs. It seems very ironic that this MPI would be put up by the Labor Party today when, only a few weeks ago, it supported the latest TPP agreement which did exactly what it is now lamenting. Australia's self-proclaimed 'Fabius Maximus', former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, has to rate as the No. 1 enemy of manufacturing industry and jobs, signing a trade agreement that had the explicit purpose of killing Australian jobs and transferring manufacture to the Third World. Whitlam slashed tariffs and, overnight, destroyed whole industries.


Before Whitlam, around 70 per cent of the Australian workforce were employed in decent, well-paid jobs in manufacturing, but now that number has fallen to a tiny fraction. The working-class voter who naively put Whitlam into power in 1972 little realised that his radical Left interventionist vision cared nothing for the prosperity of them and their families. Those who cared about their jobs, the jobs of Aussie workers—and I know there are many in the Labor Party today who genuinely do—realised that trade treaties that allow cheap foreign products to be dumped on our markets simply destroy our own industries. They realised that allowing foreign workers to flood into this country on 457 visas and the like only takes jobs from Australians.


Foreign worker visas are a Trojan Horse not only stealing hundreds of thousands of jobs from Aussies every year but providing a conduit for a flood of Third World immigrants. Foreign worker visas should not be issued at the expense of Australian jobs. There should be a very stringent public interest test in which employers seeking foreign labour should be required to prove that the position genuinely cannot be filled by an Australian. These visas should be of a very limited time with a subsequent period of ineligibility for reapplication after completion. At their conclusion, those who have had foreign worker visas should be compelled to return to their countries of origin with no entitlement to jump the queue for immigration selection.


It is of great concern to me that neither the Liberals nor the Labor Party appear to have any industrial policies. How can we ever hope to address the decline of Australian manufacturing under these circumstances? As I set out in my maiden speech, I do not just want to protect our remaining residual manufacturing; I want a program to reindustrialise Australia. However, we don't need to reinvent the wheel on this. 


Konrad Adenauer's postwar German economic miracle, which ultimately led to both high wages and high profits for companies, is a model for the reindustrialisation of Australia and a means to return to widespread employment in secondary industry. Adenauer's approach of rebuilding manufacturing as a national collaborative effort between private capital, government and unions provides a means to create sustainable industries, free of the adversarial industrial disputes that bedevilled our past. Following the German model, the boards of these new industries would have positions reserved for union representatives who would have full access to profit-and-loss accounts and would then be able to realistically negotiate wage levels, based on the actual profitability of the companies. As occurred in postwar Germany, wages would be expected to be low on start-up but then would grow with rising profits.


By following this model, collaborative manufacturing would be built up, concurrently serving the interests of labour and capital. Supported by some import restrictions and limited temporary tariffs, and a blanket policy for government procurement of only locally made goods, Australia could be reindustrialised along efficient, cooperative lines, re-creating our national industrial independence and balancing our economic development through import substitution. The cooperative nationalist industrial model that I propose would lead to the creation of hundreds of thousands of secure, well-paid jobs in a profitable industry free of industrial disputes that would reassert our economic freedom and our independence as a nation.

"Smith, Sen David",ALP,2018-11-14,"



Senator DAVID SMITH
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:11):  Putting local workers first and protecting local manufacturers is a key responsibility of Australian government and can only be done by a government that understands the threats facing workers and manufacturing businesses in Australia, threats this government has shown it simply does not understand—threats like foreign products, such as steel, being dumped into the Australian market; threats like the use of visas to bring in foreign workers to do jobs that can and should be done by Australians; threats like underinvestment in research and development; and threats like governments procuring goods and services from overseas when there are equal or better Australian alternatives available. 


The government's contempt for manufacturing is demonstrated by the revolving door of ministers for industry. Minister Karen Andrews is the sixth. Under this government, they have a shorter life expectancy than the bogong moth. Minister Andrews' tenure has been marked by her preference for soft media events, rather than meetings with actual stakeholders. Currently, Minister Andrews is asleep at the wheel while crises and urgent calls for action pile up at her door. A perfect example of such a situation is the crisis, on her watch, facing the complementary medicine industry.


Complementary medicine manufacturing in Australia has 82 different manufacturing companies employing over 29,000 Australians and paying $170 million annually in salaries. The industry generated $4.9 billion in revenue in 2017 and has nearly doubled in size in the last five years. Much of this growth has come on the back of exports to Asia. This growth is based on Australia's reputation as a clean, safe supplier, endorsed by the 'Australian made' logo. It's an increasingly rare example of Australian manufacturers being able to enjoy some competitive advantage against cheaper overseas rivals. But an unintended outcome of changes to labelling laws has thrown doubt on the industry's right to use the 'Australian made' label, jeopardising the jobs and revenue generated by this industry. This crisis requires firm and decisive action by the minister for industry to find a resolution. So how many stakeholders have managed a meeting with Minister Andrews on this matter? According to our information, it is zero. Perhaps this minister, too, is suffering from what a member of the government described earlier today as 'L-plate syndrome'. 


As the OECD has made clear, the sustainability of economic growth and prosperity depends on knowledge based economies having a vibrant innovation system. A nation that does not invest in R&D is not investing in its future. The latest annual science, research and innovation budget tables, released last month, confirm there has been a 10 per cent decline in real terms in spending on science, research and innovation during the life of this government. This decline has covered all sectors—government, universities and businesses both large and small. A Shorten Labor government will aim for three per cent of GDP to be devoted to R&D by 2030. The present level, 1.8 per cent of GDP, is well below the OECD average of 2.3 per cent.


The automotive industry is another example of this government's failure. Automotive manufacturing has not only been a major direct employer, especially in South Australia and Victoria, but it has also generated jobs across Australia through its supply chain. Most importantly, this industry always has been the great repository of advanced manufacturing skills in Australia. It's been the great driver of research and development, as leaders of other sectors have long acknowledged, making Australia not just a leading industrial nation but, more importantly, a nation ready for the fourth industrial revolution.


But Australians will not benefit unless government is prepared to invest in Australians, in their skills and in their future. Unfortunately, this government has given up. The former motor vehicle producers know the capability of Australia's engineers and industrial designers. That's why all three have still chosen to retain design and testing centres in Australia. We must not lose this essential core of knowledge and skills and the great talent pool of the former auto supply chain.


A small window remains for Australia to fully participate in the technological revolution that is transforming industrial economies across the globe. We don't have to compete with low-wage countries producing manufactured goods for mass markets, but that window is about to close unless there is change in 2019.

Senator STOKER
 (Queensland) (17:16):  I think it's really interesting that this matter of public importance starts with, 'Putting local workers first'. It's interesting because it's obvious. It is core to who we are as a coalition government that we put Australians, their jobs, their work, their freedom and their prosperity first every day of the week. It's a principal role of a government to endeavour always to do what is in the best interests of Australians. That means doing all we can to support Australians to have jobs.


On our side of politics, we believe deeply that the best solution—the very best for any individual—is work. Not welfare—work. There are some in this place who think the solution is to have a big government, promise the earth, give plenty, require little and, in the process, stifle the economic growth that's needed to be able to provide jobs. A constant welfare drip doesn't grow the economy. It doesn't give support to those people in our community who are looking for a job, who are desperately wanting a chance to get ahead, who are proud people wanting to get along without the need for government handouts.


Tax reform and reducing the burden of tax on businesses is key to providing businesses with the capacity to create jobs. When we do that, we are putting local workers first. But, of course, those opposite have been happy to get in the way of efforts to reduce the tax burden on business. They've been happy to hamper the government in its effort to make it as easy as possible for business to grow and to include more and more Australians in that wealth. We've made individual income tax cuts because we know they make a difference to individuals and give them more reward in their pockets for the effort they put into work.


Another initiative that is fundamental to growing jobs in this country is the negotiation of free trade agreements. Australian manufacturers and producers are well respected around the world for their competitive pricing and the product quality they produce. Removing barriers to trade improves our trading position and leads to more jobs for local workers. In the past year, exports have increased by four per cent, while, importantly, rural exports have increased by 19 per cent. Our landmark agreements with China, Japan, South Korea and, recently, Peru will generate more export opportunities for Australian agriculture, mining, manufacturing and service industries.


This MPI talks about 457 visas, but the 457 visa program has been cancelled. It ended on 18 March 2018, and it's worth noting that under Labor there were 40,000 457 visas. That's how many were in place at the time that the coalition came to government, and it has taken a coalition government to act to put Australians first in this field. The new temporary skills shortage visa scheme was implemented in March 2018, and it is yet again a case of the coalition cleaning up Labor's mess. In doing so, we have torn up the expansive list of 651 occupations that had opened up Australia's labour market and permanent residence programs to a broad range of options. Instead, we are now focused on what matters, and that is putting Australians and their job opportunities first, putting Australian businesses and their needs first, and always testing the entitlement to go for a visa against this important question: could we get an Australian to do this job? That's what we do every day of the week, because you can always count on the coalition to put the needs of Australian workers first.

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2018-11-14,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (17:21):  I rise to contribute to this matter of public importance debate about the government's failure to put local workers first and to protect local manufacturing. It is, of course, only the ALP who cares about manufacturing jobs and working people—including, I would say, working people in the western suburbs of Melbourne. As we know, this is being tested at the moment, with an election on in Victoria.


It's disappointing that the Greens have chosen not to participate in this debate, but it is perhaps not surprising, because they, like the Liberals, are not truly focused on delivering for Australian workers. Their failure to put local workers and local industries first is, of course, not the only failure by the Greens that we have heard about this week. I am, of course, talking about the complete failure of the Greens to address the toxic culture of violent misogyny that is currently plaguing their party. The New South Wales Greens are in open warfare over the failure of the Greens leadership to take a stand over indecent assault allegations levelled against Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham. Former Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon has condemned Mr Buckingham's response to this complaint and criticised party leaders for failing to call out his shocking behaviour. Current Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi and member for Newtown, Jenny Leong, have called on Mr Buckingham to stand down as a Greens MP. When they are so riven with division and their culture has become so toxic, it is no wonder the Greens are completely incapable of delivering on the things that matter to the Australian people, like gender equality in the workplace and an economy that delivers for all Australians.


The former Leader of the Greens in my home state of Victoria was accused of sexist discrimination and sexually harassing a former staff member. According to this complaint, the Greens leader banned women from entering a meeting room in his office which he described as 'the men's room' and described women working in his office as 'fat, hairy lesbians' and 'hairy-legged feminists'. The current leader of the Victorian Greens, Samantha Ratnam, is refusing to show some leadership and sack her disgraced candidate for Footscray, Angus McAlpine. Just this week, it has been reported that Mr McAlpine had boasted about drugging women and raping them, trivialised domestic violence and made a series of other disgusting sexist and homophobic slurs. This Greens candidate's behaviour has been criticised by the Victorian Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby and the Centres Against Sexual Assault, but Samantha Ratnam and the Victorian Greens continue to make excuses for him and to promote him under the Greens banner. Today the ABC reports that the Victorian Greens are also standing by their candidate for Sandringham, Dominic Phillips, who liked a series of sexist and racist social media pages which joked about pornography, degraded women and insulted multicultural Australia.


The Greens cannot be trusted to stand up for Australia, Australian jobs, local industry and the role of women in society when they refuse to address the toxic culture of violent misogyny that currently plagues their party, including in my home state of Victoria. You can say that you have principles and values, but words are empty, as the Greens leader, Senator Di Natale, said yesterday. If you are not prepared to act in accordance with your principles, you have none; you become all that you complain of. That is what we see today in the Greens political party.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:27):  I move:


That the ASIC Corporations (Banking Code of Practice) Instrument 2018/700, made under the Corporations Act 2001, be disallowed.


I put this disallowance up because a most unusual situation has arisen in this chamber. Yesterday when I spoke about the GST reform I talked about Norman Lindsay's 1918 Australian classic, The Magic Pudding. To use another theatrical analogy for today's disallowance we have gone into The Twilight Zone. Normally when this Senate considers whether or not to disallow a regulatory instrument, it matters to us and is important, because normally the regulatory instrument being considered and examined would make changes to the laws of the land. These changes would matter because these laws would affect the people we represent, but today is different. I really want senators to understand this. Today we have gone into the twilight zone of regulatory instruments. We are considering whether to disallow a regulatory instrument that has no effect in law. To be very clear: this is a regulation that doesn't regulate, this is a law that has no effect in Commonwealth law and this is a code of practice that has no practical effect from a legislative or legal point of view, and that is what makes it problematic.


What is perhaps ironic and indeed bewildering is that the Senate today with this disallowance is considering a voluntary code of practice for banking in Australia written by the Australian Banking Association. To give you a little bit of background, the banking industry and the banking sector—the Australian Banking Association is the body that represents the big and the small banks—has had a voluntary code of conduct for many, many years. To provide a bit of context for senators, we have seen—and many of us in this chamber have sat through—numerous inquiries over the last decade into misconduct in the financial services industry in Australia. Many of us have asked questions of the regulators at estimates and at numerous Senate inquiries into the regulation of the banks and the financial services industry. 


Eventually, after years of campaigning, we got a royal commission into the banks and the financial services industry. That royal commission is still sitting. While we've had an interim report, we haven't had a final report on the banks in this country. So the first important question we need to ask ourselves is: why is the Senate considering a voluntary code of conduct written by the banks for the banks? Commissioner Hayne has explained why this regulation doesn't matter. In his own words, he says:


Contravention of a provision of the … Code—


The banking code that we're considering—


… may be a breach of contract but otherwise it is not, and will not be, a contravention of law. The Code stands as a set of promises made by the banks enforceable only at the behest of an aggrieved customer. … The code is not subject to—


I repeat: the code is not subject to—


… the Competition and Consumer Act … The code therefore stands in sharp contrast with generally similar industry codes of practice—


We have considered many of them in this chamber. Commissioner Hayne continues:


… Codes dealt with by … the Competition and Consumer Act are called ‘applicable industry codes’ … And a contravention of an applicable industry code engages all the remedial provisions of … the Competition and Consumer Act. Further, if the relevant provision of an applicable industry code is a civil penalty provision, the regulator … may bring civil penalty proceedings … None of this applies—


I repeat: none of this applies—


to the current banking code and none of this will apply to the 2019 Code.


This is the code that the Senate, by default, is about to give its stamp of approval to, if you don't support the Greens' disallowance. 


In other words, because the financial sector is not regulated under the Competition and Consumer Act, this code is not enforceable. I say again: this is a voluntary code, and it was written by the banks for the banks. By the way, senators, this is the first time that a voluntary code has been before the Senate. I will explain why in a minute, and why this is actually a critical part of the debate. 


Commissioner Hayne has also explained how this code was created:


Although approved by ASIC, it is necessary to recognise that the content of the 2019 Code was also determined by those who are to be bound by its provisions: the banks themselves. It is they who decided how the definition of small business should be framed. It is the banks, therefore, who determined what reach the Code will have.


I'll say it again: the banks have written this code for themselves. It is a code written by banks for banks. It is a voluntary code. 


I don't think anybody would disagree, including the banks who have put this new code forward, that their last voluntary code didn't work. It wasn't up to scratch. It wasn't up to standard. It failed the Australian people. It failed the customers of the banks and, ultimately, it failed the banks themselves. So, because the banks have written this code for themselves, by definition it's not particularly useful or helpful to anyone else. 


When this version of the code was announced there was much brouhaha about how good it would be for small business, but the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Ms Kate Carnell, has popped that bubble. Ms Carnell recently said that the code 'falls short of addressing the imbalance of power held by the banks' and that it 'will allow the continuation of the aggressive bank tactics revealed by the commission'. Similarly, Commissioner Hayne himself has raised concerns with the code and how it relates to a small business's ability to repay a loan. In fact, Commissioner Hayne has opened questions in his interim report—and I hope all senators have read that—directly regarding this issue. My office has spoken to Ms Carnell about this disallowance and about this voluntary code of conduct. By the banks' own admission, it's already out of date. But, perhaps most tellingly, the Australian Banking Association themselves are not happy with the version of the code that is before the Senate.


So let's synthesise this. The banks come up with a new voluntary code of conduct. Because of the royal commission and the shaming of the banks, they realise their voluntary code of conduct isn't working and they need a new one—one that might actually work. What do they do? They go to ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and they say, 'Can you have a look at this voluntary code of conduct and tell us whether you think it's okay.' After a couple of months, ASIC come out and say, 'Yes, it's okay.' So ASIC have essentially given this their formal stamp of approval. That's why it's being considered before the Senate today, because ASIC have been dragged in by the banks, or maybe easily persuaded by the banks, to review their voluntary code of conduct and give it their stamp of approval. Because ASIC is involved, the Senate and the Australian parliament are involved.


Let me frame it for you again. If this disallowance doesn't get up today and, to use a Trump term, this fake regulation goes into effect, we are essentially giving our stamp of approval, as the Australian parliament, to this voluntary code of conduct. I don't think any senator would think now is the time to be doing that, before the royal commission has even delivered its final report. I'll come back later to what I think the motivations of the banks are for putting this voluntary code of conduct through this process before the royal commission has delivered its report.


Let me just emphasise what I said about Commissioner Hayne's own concerns about this voluntary code of conduct that we have before us. Why is this code of conduct that we're considering today out of date already? It's out of date already because as new revelations became public during the royal commission, including fees for no service and charging dead people, the banks decided they'd better write that into their code of conduct as well. Guess what: the banks have already changed their code of conduct. But it is not in the regulations that are before the Senate today. The regulations before the Senate today passed through a process prior to that, so it's already out of date. By the banks' own admission, the regulation we're looking at today is already out of date. By the banks' own admission, the code of conduct that has been endorsed by ASIC is deficient. The instrument in question refers to the code published in August 2018. Yet on Wednesday, 10 October 2018, last month, the ABA, the Australian Banking Association, announced further amendments to the code to stop banks from charging fees for no service and to ensure refunds to customers. You could be cynical enough to say it was also an important PR exercise to make a public statement that they were again updating their voluntary code of conduct. One does wonder, if the royal commission continued beyond its February date, what other revelations might come to light that might change a voluntary code of conduct which, by the way—I'll say it again—we are tacitly endorsing today if we don't disallow it. Apparently the August version of the code was not sufficiently robust to stop the banks from charging fees for no service, including to dead people. That, I say again, is the code that will go into fake regulation today if we allow it to.


To be clear, the Senate is considering whether to approve ASIC's endorsement of an unenforceable code written by the banks—a voluntary code—when the banks have admitted that the version of the code that has been endorsed by ASIC isn't good enough to stop them charging fees to dead people. That's what you will be allowing today if you don't support the Greens' disallowance of this voluntary code of conduct.


This regulation is useless. It does nothing in light of the revelations of the royal commission. ASIC can't enforce the code of conduct, and it's not covered by the Competition and Consumer Act. Because it does nothing, that makes it dangerous, and I would argue that it also makes it a highly political document. This is a PR exercise for the banks. Why else would the banks be wanting to seek ASIC endorsement? From my understanding—and I stand to be corrected—this is the first time ever that the banks have sought ASIC's endorsement for a voluntary code. I suspect they did it because of the royal commission and the revelations. They wanted to get ASIC's endorsement to give the code more weight. Then, of course, they wanted to get parliament's endorsement and allow it to pass into fake regulation.


We in this place have better things to do than to sign off on window-dressing or potential brand-washing for the banks. I am happy to look at a code of conduct when the royal commission is finished and all these things have been thrashed out and the Australian public get their $60-plus million worth of deliberations by the Hayne royal commission. The royal commission has surprised just about everyone in this country, including many of its critics, and there were harsh critics, not just on the need for a royal commission but whether it would be a complete waste of money. Most of those critics have since swallowed their pride and publicly admitted that some of the revelations they've heard were shocking—much worse than they expected. I understand from speaking to Professor Stiglitz, who is in this building today, that the US is going through a very similar thing with some of the revelations they're hearing about their financial services sector. He said that the 10 years since the global financial crisis, the GFC, have revealed even more deep-seated problems, systemic failures and misconduct within the financial services industry.


Senators, this is a one-off opportunity to get real reform in place within the financial services sector. I'm proud to be part of a party that has written to the royal commission. We made a substantial submission. I want to acknowledge the work of my office and Senator Di Natale's office in preparing that submission to the royal commission. Our submission outlined 18 structural reforms that we believe the commission should consider. By the way, we were invited by the royal commission at this point in time to make submissions on policy. Commissioner Hayne said that he wanted to hear from people on policy suggestions and policy solutions, and the Greens took that opportunity.


This is a one-off opportunity for reform. This is not the time to be giving the banks a chance to window-dress and to do the media. Next week, they're in front of the royal commission. Everyone is speculating that it is going to be a very difficult couple of weeks for the CEOs, the chief executives, going to the royal commission. They can say, with their hands on their hearts: 'We have just had our code of conduct through parliament. We have just had our code of conduct endorsed by ASIC, by the regulator. We've fixed our problems. Through this code of conduct, we've fixed the systemic problems that have led to the misconduct that you've seen in the royal commission.' Yet we know that it's not even covered by our laws and it's out of date already. Do not give them the opportunity to brand-wash, to window-dress, what has been one of the most serious issues that we have managed to achieve, as a House, as a Senate and as a parliament, certainly in this term of government, if not in many terms of government.


This is a one-off opportunity to get some real reforms in the financial services sector to protect customers, to reduce systemic risk and to hold capitalism to account. If you think I'm being a little bit startling in my comments, I will quote the current Prime Minister, Mr Scott Morrison, on the day that the royal commission was announced. Remember when Mr Turnbull, the then Prime Minister, said he would be calling for a royal commission? It was because we forced him to. This parliament forced him to. Mr Scott Morrison came out and said, 'This is not capitalism on trial, unlike what some people in this building would like to believe.' They were the exact words that Mr Scott Morrison used. Well, let me tell you: this has been capitalism on trial.


From the very first week, the commissioner, after his initial deliberation, said to the banks, 'I wants you to go away and consider the proposition, how much profit is too much profit? At what point do you stop putting profit and a culture of profit before people?' In his interim statement, on the opening page, he said that 'greed' had caused the problems that he had seen through this royal commission—greed. Where do you draw the line? It's a very, very important question we have to answer. This is coming from a man that is not a leftie or a socialist trying to overthrow the capitalist system. This is a very well respected commissioner with all the resources the Australian people can give him and his commission at his disposal to get to the bottom of the problems that we've seen in this sector.


This is a critical moment in time for reform—in the next three months. It irks me that this fake regulation gives the banks a chance to say that they've actually achieved something through this royal commission—to get a jump on Commissioner Hayne, to get a jump on this parliament and to get a jump on the Australian people and even potentially their customers. The royal commission and the Ombudsman have raised concerns—and I've gone through that today—and the banks are currently redrafting it, even as it is before parliament and being considered. In the face of this widespread misconduct, the regulators and parliament should be focused on more meaningful reforms. It's the responsibility of the regulators and this parliament, not the banks, to write laws that govern this nation's banks in the public interest. It is better for there to be no regulation than for there to be unenforceable regulation. That's my proposition to you today. The days of the banks writing their own rules should be over, and we can send that message right here, right now, on behalf of the Australian people.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-11-14,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:47):  Labor does not support this disallowance today, but we recognise that the code of practice has been manifestly inadequate. That is an important reason—however inadequate the changes before the chamber might be today—to recognise that there are improvements in the code of practice before us and that to disallow it simply reverts to the framework, right back from 2013, in which many of these problems are embedded. The current banking code of practice, as part of the regulation of banks and financial services, has not prevented massive misconduct from occurring. We've seen very clearly that the mix of self-regulation through the code of practice and regulation through the Corporations Act, ASIC, the National Consumer Credit Protection Act and other acts of this parliament have not adequately stopped banks and other financial service providers from becoming embroiled in these terrible scandals. 


It's been very clear to Labor for a long time that more needed to be done. It was clear to us that Australians needed better protections, that banks and financial service providers needed to lift their game. That is why Labor took the bold and courageous step in 2016 of calling for a banking royal commission. This decision wasn't easy. We were pilloried for it, derided by the government and we were told that a royal commission would be nothing more than a QC's complaints desk, a populist whinge and a reckless distraction. This government said that they thought that it would be a waste of time, and they did everything they could to stop it from happening. As we know, they voted against it in this parliament some 26 times. They set up parliamentary inquiries to try and head it off at the pass. They thought they could stop the scrutiny of the royal commission being applied to the banks. They have been wrong on all of these counts. The evidence within the Australian community of the impact of this misconduct is just too strong and the hurt that people have experienced is just too widespread.


Victims of financial services misconduct have come forward week after week. We've heard, through stories in the media and from members of parliament and the Australian community, about an industry that has been seen to have lost its ethical and moral compass. The government did indeed see the writing on the wall when it finally caved in to the pressure from Labor and the community and agreed to call this royal commission. That happened late last year, and now the Prime Minister, the member for Cook, has described the decision as regrettable.


It's not surprising, given that this government has been hostile to the royal commission from the outset, that they have curtailed the time available for it to do its work. The commission has barely had the opportunity to scratch the surface of the misconduct that has occurred in the financial services industry. Certainly, I would personally like to add to the calls that hearings be held in my home state of Western Australia. Labor MPs from Western Australia have all signed up to lobby for that and to say that the community of Western Australia deserves to have its own story told. As we've heard, the context of misconduct varies from community to community, from state to state and from institution to institution, so it's really important that the voices of Western Australians are heard and that those Western Australians have the opportunity to tell their own stories.


The commissioner has done an admirable job—indeed, I think, a quite extraordinary job, given the circumstances. He was given a mere 14 months to inquire into retail banking, home lending and consumer lending, including consumer credit and personal loans, as well as small business lending, farm lending, general insurance, life insurance, superannuation and financial advice. This means they've had just two weeks to spend on each of these complex subjects, some of which have touched the lives of millions of Australians and some of which relate to services used by nearly every member of the Australian community. The commission has received over 10,000 submissions from the public. Ten thousand Australians took the time to let the commission know about their experiences of bank and financial service provider misconduct. But, because of the restrictive time line, only 27 victims out of 10,000 have had the chance to tell their story in person, and I can tell you that there are things to be learned from the specific characterisation of the experiences of victims themselves.


The misconduct of the financial services sector is so widespread that it affects hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians, so we've called for the time available for the royal commission to be extended to allow more victims to have the opportunity to share their stories. The government, sadly, has been stubborn in its refusal to give the commission more time. This is why the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for financial services, along with some of my Labor colleagues around the country, have been holding their own roundtables with victims of banking misconduct, and we've heard from many, many victims whose voices haven't been heard through the royal commission process. These stories have been brutal and harrowing. People are hurting. Consequences of misconduct identified by the royal commission and, indeed, the consequences of other misconduct that Commissioner Hayne didn't have time to consider are being felt by families in every state and territory and in every city and town around Australia.


In the interim report were posed important questions about the future regulation of our financial services industry, and the commissioner's general observation has been of greed and the culture of the pursuit of profits above the honest and ethical conduct of the sector. This has been well reported and understood. These findings and this backdrop interim report will no doubt form the basis on which final recommendations will be framed.


The commissioner has also made specific observations about self-regulation, and this is very relevant to today's debate, particularly in relation to the case studies heard by the commission. Commissioner Hayne discussed the competition between regulation and self-regulation and considered a specific example relating to the 2019 Banking Code of Practice, the document we are considering today. The example related to non-monetary defaults, where a lender is able to accelerate a loan or demand full repayment of a loan immediately, regardless of whether the borrower is behind in their rescheduled repayments. The code imposes some new limits on non-monetary default clauses, and the commissioner poses a question, presumably to be answered, I would hope, in his final report:


Apart from existing rules prohibiting unconscionable conduct and rendering unfair contract terms void, should there be some additional rules that govern what a lender can or cannot do before it brings a loan to an end or it seeks to enforce repayment?


The commissioner goes on to discuss the provisions in the 2019 code, noting:


But the 2019 Code will set limits on the use of provisions of that kind. Assuming that the contractual terms relied on are not unenforceable under the unfair contract terms provisions of the ASIC Act, and assuming further that reliance on the terms is not affected by the 2019 Code, are there any circumstances in which termination and renewal of a loan contract should be governed except by the general law of contract?


In this context we can see that this discussion demonstrates that the 2019 Banking Code of Practice, the document we are discussing today, is part of a very real regulatory framework that the commissioner will be considering when he makes his final report in February. That should not rule out us lifting those standards here today, not disallowing the lifting of those standards by reverting to the 2013 code.


The questions of reform and improvement to regulations and laws are open to questions, regardless of the existence of the 2019 code. We acknowledge that this code is a step in the right direction, but we also acknowledge it comes nowhere close to fixing the problems identified by the royal commission so far. The commissioner has signalled that he will consider it as part of the existing regulatory environment, and he will consider whether more needs to be done to protect consumers and small business from misconduct and unfair practice and tactics.


We see this code as a small step in the right direction by industry. We know there's more to be done, and we look forward to the release of Commissioner Hayne's final report in February 2019. In the meantime, we should not—this place should not—stand in the way of the banking industry coming forward and improving, however slightly, its code of practice. We aren't going to refuse to allow banks to improve the consumer protections they voluntary commit to delivering to Australians just because we are engaged in a parallel process of policy development through the royal commission. It is possible, thankfully, for us to allow the 2019 code to come into force and at the same time consider and implement regulatory change to further improve the banking and financial services sectors in coming months.


Labor have been completely consistent on this, and we will consider recommendations from Commissioner Hayne and the recommendations coming out from the many parliamentary inquiries into financial services that are running concurrently. However, the evidence before this place shows that there are real and practical lifts in sector standards in the new 2019 code of practice, and we should not stand in the way of it being delivered. In the meantime, what we in the Labor Party are focused on is doing what is necessary to restore trust and confidence in our banks and broader parts of the finance sector and to protect consumers from unethical and dishonest behaviour.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:00):  The government does not support this motion. The government supports action by the financial services industry to provide consumers with more rights to hold institutions to account. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's support for this code not only is an important part of rebuilding the community's trust in the financial sector but also puts pressure on other sectors to raise their standards in how they deal with consumers.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:01):  Thank you, Acting Deputy President. Why is it the role of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to restore trust in the Australian banking sector? Why is it the regulator's role to restore trust by allowing an unenforceable code in Australian law to pass into fake regulation? How is that restoring trust? As I explained, Senator Canavan, this is not covered by the Competition and Consumer Act. I even read out the words of the royal commissioner himself. He said that, while there may be some contract law implications, it is not covered by the laws and legislation of this parliament. How is it restoring confidence to rubberstamp and give the seal of approval to the banks at this point in time, before the royal commission has even delivered its final report?


Of course the banks want to restore trust, and I genuinely hope that the Australian people's trust in the banks is restored. But let me say to senators: that's going to come from proper regulation and it's going to come from structural reform in the Australian banking sector and the financial services sector. I have outlined a number of reforms that the Greens believe need to happen, and the first thing I'd like to do is take the mandate for financial securities off ASIC and give it to the ACCC. We know the history. The ACCC had this mandate taken off them when a special regulator was set up for the financial services industry. I've read out in previous speeches that the people involved in that structural reform have now looked back and said: 'We made a mistake. It should have stayed with the ACCC.' I've got no problems with ASIC and their current resourcing or with the people at ASIC regulating the wholesale side of the market, but the retail side of financial services should be regulated by the ACCC.


There are a number of people who are supporting the Greens' call for the ACCC to regulate this industry. The ACCC have shown that they are prepared to take on companies—they have shown that. The problem with ASIC is that they have a conflicted mandate in this country. On the one hand, they have to factor into their decisions the stability, efficiency and functioning of the financial system; on the other hand, they have to protect consumers of financial services and financial products. That is why you and I, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, have sat through countless inquiries listening to evidence about enforceable undertakings rather than strong action on white-collar crime. That's why we've had to endure that. I don't hold ASIC responsible for that; they've had a conflicted mandate from the start. Even when ASIC was set up, the point was raised that it was a specialist regulator set up for a specialist sector. Why does financial services have its own regulator? Who else does?


ACCC covers everyone else. This was set up and people said: 'If you do that, you know what the risk is? The risk is that your regulator will become captured by the industry.' This is not me saying this; this is what has come out of the royal commission—a weak regulator who has failed to do their job and who has been captured by the industry. Once again, I don't blame people at ASIC for this. They have a conflicted mandate, not to mention all of the resourcing issues they've had over the years. But it is time for structural reforms.


Senator Canavan has come in here today to say that ASIC's essential rubberstamping of this fake regulation that isn't covered by Australian law is somehow going to restore the Australian people's trust in the banks. It isn't. It is the royal commission's job now to restore trust. Yes, it is ASIC's job to step up and take real action. But I am telling you that this is not real action—a voluntary code of conduct unenforceable by Australian law. It's a code written by the banks for the banks that isn't even complete. I notice that Labor didn't even address this issue. The fake regulation that we have before us doesn't even address the updated voluntary code of conduct which has since been changed. I went through the detail a second ago. It has since been changed to make sure banks can't take fees for service from dead people. That is not even in this regulation. I would like to see Senator Canavan address that.


I will just stress one more time that this is an important juncture in history for us to make substantive change, to be bold and to make sure that we can restore trust in the banking sector, not just for customers but also for the financial system, for the banks themselves and for their shareholders and other stakeholders in this debate. There is no way this voluntary code of conduct, which is not enforceable by law, written by the banks today, is going to restore the Australian people's faith in the banks.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1, standing in the name of Senator Whish-Wilson, be agreed to.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-11-14,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:27):  I move:


That the ASIC Corporations (Banking Code of Practice) Instrument 2018/700, made under the Corporations Act 2001, be disallowed.


I put this disallowance up because a most unusual situation has arisen in this chamber. Yesterday when I spoke about the GST reform I talked about Norman Lindsay's 1918 Australian classic, The Magic Pudding. To use another theatrical analogy for today's disallowance we have gone into The Twilight Zone. Normally when this Senate considers whether or not to disallow a regulatory instrument, it matters to us and is important, because normally the regulatory instrument being considered and examined would make changes to the laws of the land. These changes would matter because these laws would affect the people we represent, but today is different. I really want senators to understand this. Today we have gone into the twilight zone of regulatory instruments. We are considering whether to disallow a regulatory instrument that has no effect in law. To be very clear: this is a regulation that doesn't regulate, this is a law that has no effect in Commonwealth law and this is a code of practice that has no practical effect from a legislative or legal point of view, and that is what makes it problematic.


What is perhaps ironic and indeed bewildering is that the Senate today with this disallowance is considering a voluntary code of practice for banking in Australia written by the Australian Banking Association. To give you a little bit of background, the banking industry and the banking sector—the Australian Banking Association is the body that represents the big and the small banks—has had a voluntary code of conduct for many, many years. To provide a bit of context for senators, we have seen—and many of us in this chamber have sat through—numerous inquiries over the last decade into misconduct in the financial services industry in Australia. Many of us have asked questions of the regulators at estimates and at numerous Senate inquiries into the regulation of the banks and the financial services industry. 


Eventually, after years of campaigning, we got a royal commission into the banks and the financial services industry. That royal commission is still sitting. While we've had an interim report, we haven't had a final report on the banks in this country. So the first important question we need to ask ourselves is: why is the Senate considering a voluntary code of conduct written by the banks for the banks? Commissioner Hayne has explained why this regulation doesn't matter. In his own words, he says:


Contravention of a provision of the … Code—


The banking code that we're considering—


… may be a breach of contract but otherwise it is not, and will not be, a contravention of law. The Code stands as a set of promises made by the banks enforceable only at the behest of an aggrieved customer. … The code is not subject to—


I repeat: the code is not subject to—


… the Competition and Consumer Act … The code therefore stands in sharp contrast with generally similar industry codes of practice—


We have considered many of them in this chamber. Commissioner Hayne continues:


… Codes dealt with by … the Competition and Consumer Act are called ‘applicable industry codes’ … And a contravention of an applicable industry code engages all the remedial provisions of … the Competition and Consumer Act. Further, if the relevant provision of an applicable industry code is a civil penalty provision, the regulator … may bring civil penalty proceedings … None of this applies—


I repeat: none of this applies—


to the current banking code and none of this will apply to the 2019 Code.


This is the code that the Senate, by default, is about to give its stamp of approval to, if you don't support the Greens' disallowance. 


In other words, because the financial sector is not regulated under the Competition and Consumer Act, this code is not enforceable. I say again: this is a voluntary code, and it was written by the banks for the banks. By the way, senators, this is the first time that a voluntary code has been before the Senate. I will explain why in a minute, and why this is actually a critical part of the debate. 


Commissioner Hayne has also explained how this code was created:


Although approved by ASIC, it is necessary to recognise that the content of the 2019 Code was also determined by those who are to be bound by its provisions: the banks themselves. It is they who decided how the definition of small business should be framed. It is the banks, therefore, who determined what reach the Code will have.


I'll say it again: the banks have written this code for themselves. It is a code written by banks for banks. It is a voluntary code. 


I don't think anybody would disagree, including the banks who have put this new code forward, that their last voluntary code didn't work. It wasn't up to scratch. It wasn't up to standard. It failed the Australian people. It failed the customers of the banks and, ultimately, it failed the banks themselves. So, because the banks have written this code for themselves, by definition it's not particularly useful or helpful to anyone else. 


When this version of the code was announced there was much brouhaha about how good it would be for small business, but the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Ms Kate Carnell, has popped that bubble. Ms Carnell recently said that the code 'falls short of addressing the imbalance of power held by the banks' and that it 'will allow the continuation of the aggressive bank tactics revealed by the commission'. Similarly, Commissioner Hayne himself has raised concerns with the code and how it relates to a small business's ability to repay a loan. In fact, Commissioner Hayne has opened questions in his interim report—and I hope all senators have read that—directly regarding this issue. My office has spoken to Ms Carnell about this disallowance and about this voluntary code of conduct. By the banks' own admission, it's already out of date. But, perhaps most tellingly, the Australian Banking Association themselves are not happy with the version of the code that is before the Senate.


So let's synthesise this. The banks come up with a new voluntary code of conduct. Because of the royal commission and the shaming of the banks, they realise their voluntary code of conduct isn't working and they need a new one—one that might actually work. What do they do? They go to ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and they say, 'Can you have a look at this voluntary code of conduct and tell us whether you think it's okay.' After a couple of months, ASIC come out and say, 'Yes, it's okay.' So ASIC have essentially given this their formal stamp of approval. That's why it's being considered before the Senate today, because ASIC have been dragged in by the banks, or maybe easily persuaded by the banks, to review their voluntary code of conduct and give it their stamp of approval. Because ASIC is involved, the Senate and the Australian parliament are involved.


Let me frame it for you again. If this disallowance doesn't get up today and, to use a Trump term, this fake regulation goes into effect, we are essentially giving our stamp of approval, as the Australian parliament, to this voluntary code of conduct. I don't think any senator would think now is the time to be doing that, before the royal commission has even delivered its final report. I'll come back later to what I think the motivations of the banks are for putting this voluntary code of conduct through this process before the royal commission has delivered its report.


Let me just emphasise what I said about Commissioner Hayne's own concerns about this voluntary code of conduct that we have before us. Why is this code of conduct that we're considering today out of date already? It's out of date already because as new revelations became public during the royal commission, including fees for no service and charging dead people, the banks decided they'd better write that into their code of conduct as well. Guess what: the banks have already changed their code of conduct. But it is not in the regulations that are before the Senate today. The regulations before the Senate today passed through a process prior to that, so it's already out of date. By the banks' own admission, the regulation we're looking at today is already out of date. By the banks' own admission, the code of conduct that has been endorsed by ASIC is deficient. The instrument in question refers to the code published in August 2018. Yet on Wednesday, 10 October 2018, last month, the ABA, the Australian Banking Association, announced further amendments to the code to stop banks from charging fees for no service and to ensure refunds to customers. You could be cynical enough to say it was also an important PR exercise to make a public statement that they were again updating their voluntary code of conduct. One does wonder, if the royal commission continued beyond its February date, what other revelations might come to light that might change a voluntary code of conduct which, by the way—I'll say it again—we are tacitly endorsing today if we don't disallow it. Apparently the August version of the code was not sufficiently robust to stop the banks from charging fees for no service, including to dead people. That, I say again, is the code that will go into fake regulation today if we allow it to.


To be clear, the Senate is considering whether to approve ASIC's endorsement of an unenforceable code written by the banks—a voluntary code—when the banks have admitted that the version of the code that has been endorsed by ASIC isn't good enough to stop them charging fees to dead people. That's what you will be allowing today if you don't support the Greens' disallowance of this voluntary code of conduct.


This regulation is useless. It does nothing in light of the revelations of the royal commission. ASIC can't enforce the code of conduct, and it's not covered by the Competition and Consumer Act. Because it does nothing, that makes it dangerous, and I would argue that it also makes it a highly political document. This is a PR exercise for the banks. Why else would the banks be wanting to seek ASIC endorsement? From my understanding—and I stand to be corrected—this is the first time ever that the banks have sought ASIC's endorsement for a voluntary code. I suspect they did it because of the royal commission and the revelations. They wanted to get ASIC's endorsement to give the code more weight. Then, of course, they wanted to get parliament's endorsement and allow it to pass into fake regulation.


We in this place have better things to do than to sign off on window-dressing or potential brand-washing for the banks. I am happy to look at a code of conduct when the royal commission is finished and all these things have been thrashed out and the Australian public get their $60-plus million worth of deliberations by the Hayne royal commission. The royal commission has surprised just about everyone in this country, including many of its critics, and there were harsh critics, not just on the need for a royal commission but whether it would be a complete waste of money. Most of those critics have since swallowed their pride and publicly admitted that some of the revelations they've heard were shocking—much worse than they expected. I understand from speaking to Professor Stiglitz, who is in this building today, that the US is going through a very similar thing with some of the revelations they're hearing about their financial services sector. He said that the 10 years since the global financial crisis, the GFC, have revealed even more deep-seated problems, systemic failures and misconduct within the financial services industry.


Senators, this is a one-off opportunity to get real reform in place within the financial services sector. I'm proud to be part of a party that has written to the royal commission. We made a substantial submission. I want to acknowledge the work of my office and Senator Di Natale's office in preparing that submission to the royal commission. Our submission outlined 18 structural reforms that we believe the commission should consider. By the way, we were invited by the royal commission at this point in time to make submissions on policy. Commissioner Hayne said that he wanted to hear from people on policy suggestions and policy solutions, and the Greens took that opportunity.


This is a one-off opportunity for reform. This is not the time to be giving the banks a chance to window-dress and to do the media. Next week, they're in front of the royal commission. Everyone is speculating that it is going to be a very difficult couple of weeks for the CEOs, the chief executives, going to the royal commission. They can say, with their hands on their hearts: 'We have just had our code of conduct through parliament. We have just had our code of conduct endorsed by ASIC, by the regulator. We've fixed our problems. Through this code of conduct, we've fixed the systemic problems that have led to the misconduct that you've seen in the royal commission.' Yet we know that it's not even covered by our laws and it's out of date already. Do not give them the opportunity to brand-wash, to window-dress, what has been one of the most serious issues that we have managed to achieve, as a House, as a Senate and as a parliament, certainly in this term of government, if not in many terms of government.


This is a one-off opportunity to get some real reforms in the financial services sector to protect customers, to reduce systemic risk and to hold capitalism to account. If you think I'm being a little bit startling in my comments, I will quote the current Prime Minister, Mr Scott Morrison, on the day that the royal commission was announced. Remember when Mr Turnbull, the then Prime Minister, said he would be calling for a royal commission? It was because we forced him to. This parliament forced him to. Mr Scott Morrison came out and said, 'This is not capitalism on trial, unlike what some people in this building would like to believe.' They were the exact words that Mr Scott Morrison used. Well, let me tell you: this has been capitalism on trial.


From the very first week, the commissioner, after his initial deliberation, said to the banks, 'I wants you to go away and consider the proposition, how much profit is too much profit? At what point do you stop putting profit and a culture of profit before people?' In his interim statement, on the opening page, he said that 'greed' had caused the problems that he had seen through this royal commission—greed. Where do you draw the line? It's a very, very important question we have to answer. This is coming from a man that is not a leftie or a socialist trying to overthrow the capitalist system. This is a very well respected commissioner with all the resources the Australian people can give him and his commission at his disposal to get to the bottom of the problems that we've seen in this sector.


This is a critical moment in time for reform—in the next three months. It irks me that this fake regulation gives the banks a chance to say that they've actually achieved something through this royal commission—to get a jump on Commissioner Hayne, to get a jump on this parliament and to get a jump on the Australian people and even potentially their customers. The royal commission and the Ombudsman have raised concerns—and I've gone through that today—and the banks are currently redrafting it, even as it is before parliament and being considered. In the face of this widespread misconduct, the regulators and parliament should be focused on more meaningful reforms. It's the responsibility of the regulators and this parliament, not the banks, to write laws that govern this nation's banks in the public interest. It is better for there to be no regulation than for there to be unenforceable regulation. That's my proposition to you today. The days of the banks writing their own rules should be over, and we can send that message right here, right now, on behalf of the Australian people. 

",Senate,<title>REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS</title>,<title>Disallowance</title>,REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS,23,2
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-11-14,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:47):  Labor does not support this disallowance today, but we recognise that the code of practice has been manifestly inadequate. That is an important reason—however inadequate the changes before the chamber might be today—to recognise that there are improvements in the code of practice before us and that to disallow it simply reverts to the framework, right back from 2013, in which many of these problems are embedded. The current banking code of practice, as part of the regulation of banks and financial services, has not prevented massive misconduct from occurring. We've seen very clearly that the mix of self-regulation through the code of practice and regulation through the Corporations Act, ASIC, the National Consumer Credit Protection Act and other acts of this parliament have not adequately stopped banks and other financial service providers from becoming embroiled in these terrible scandals. 


It's been very clear to Labor for a long time that more needed to be done. It was clear to us that Australians needed better protections, that banks and financial service providers needed to lift their game. That is why Labor took the bold and courageous step in 2016 of calling for a banking royal commission. This decision wasn't easy. We were pilloried for it, derided by the government and we were told that a royal commission would be nothing more than a QC's complaints desk, a populist whinge and a reckless distraction. This government said that they thought that it would be a waste of time, and they did everything they could to stop it from happening. As we know, they voted against it in this parliament some 26 times. They set up parliamentary inquiries to try and head it off at the pass. They thought they could stop the scrutiny of the royal commission being applied to the banks. They have been wrong on all of these counts. The evidence within the Australian community of the impact of this misconduct is just too strong and the hurt that people have experienced is just too widespread.


Victims of financial services misconduct have come forward week after week. We've heard, through stories in the media and from members of parliament and the Australian community, about an industry that has been seen to have lost its ethical and moral compass. The government did indeed see the writing on the wall when it finally caved in to the pressure from Labor and the community and agreed to call this royal commission. That happened late last year, and now the Prime Minister, the member for Cook, has described the decision as regrettable.


It's not surprising, given that this government has been hostile to the royal commission from the outset, that they have curtailed the time available for it to do its work. The commission has barely had the opportunity to scratch the surface of the misconduct that has occurred in the financial services industry. Certainly, I would personally like to add to the calls that hearings be held in my home state of Western Australia. Labor MPs from Western Australia have all signed up to lobby for that and to say that the community of Western Australia deserves to have its own story told. As we've heard, the context of misconduct varies from community to community, from state to state and from institution to institution, so it's really important that the voices of Western Australians are heard and that those Western Australians have the opportunity to tell their own stories.


The commissioner has done an admirable job—indeed, I think, a quite extraordinary job, given the circumstances. He was given a mere 14 months to inquire into retail banking, home lending and consumer lending, including consumer credit and personal loans, as well as small business lending, farm lending, general insurance, life insurance, superannuation and financial advice. This means they've had just two weeks to spend on each of these complex subjects, some of which have touched the lives of millions of Australians and some of which relate to services used by nearly every member of the Australian community. The commission has received over 10,000 submissions from the public. Ten thousand Australians took the time to let the commission know about their experiences of bank and financial service provider misconduct. But, because of the restrictive time line, only 27 victims out of 10,000 have had the chance to tell their story in person, and I can tell you that there are things to be learned from the specific characterisation of the experiences of victims themselves.


The misconduct of the financial services sector is so widespread that it affects hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians, so we've called for the time available for the royal commission to be extended to allow more victims to have the opportunity to share their stories. The government, sadly, has been stubborn in its refusal to give the commission more time. This is why the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for financial services, along with some of my Labor colleagues around the country, have been holding their own roundtables with victims of banking misconduct, and we've heard from many, many victims whose voices haven't been heard through the royal commission process. These stories have been brutal and harrowing. People are hurting. Consequences of misconduct identified by the royal commission and, indeed, the consequences of other misconduct that Commissioner Hayne didn't have time to consider are being felt by families in every state and territory and in every city and town around Australia.


In the interim report were posed important questions about the future regulation of our financial services industry, and the commissioner's general observation has been of greed and the culture of the pursuit of profits above the honest and ethical conduct of the sector. This has been well reported and understood. These findings and this backdrop interim report will no doubt form the basis on which final recommendations will be framed.


The commissioner has also made specific observations about self-regulation, and this is very relevant to today's debate, particularly in relation to the case studies heard by the commission. Commissioner Hayne discussed the competition between regulation and self-regulation and considered a specific example relating to the 2019 Banking Code of Practice, the document we are considering today. The example related to non-monetary defaults, where a lender is able to accelerate a loan or demand full repayment of a loan immediately, regardless of whether the borrower is behind in their rescheduled repayments. The code imposes some new limits on non-monetary default clauses, and the commissioner poses a question, presumably to be answered, I would hope, in his final report:


Apart from existing rules prohibiting unconscionable conduct and rendering unfair contract terms void, should there be some additional rules that govern what a lender can or cannot do before it brings a loan to an end or it seeks to enforce repayment?


The commissioner goes on to discuss the provisions in the 2019 code, noting:


But the 2019 Code will set limits on the use of provisions of that kind. Assuming that the contractual terms relied on are not unenforceable under the unfair contract terms provisions of the ASIC Act, and assuming further that reliance on the terms is not affected by the 2019 Code, are there any circumstances in which termination and renewal of a loan contract should be governed except by the general law of contract?


In this context we can see that this discussion demonstrates that the 2019 Banking Code of Practice, the document we are discussing today, is part of a very real regulatory framework that the commissioner will be considering when he makes his final report in February. That should not rule out us lifting those standards here today, not disallowing the lifting of those standards by reverting to the 2013 code.


The questions of reform and improvement to regulations and laws are open to questions, regardless of the existence of the 2019 code. We acknowledge that this code is a step in the right direction, but we also acknowledge it comes nowhere close to fixing the problems identified by the royal commission so far. The commissioner has signalled that he will consider it as part of the existing regulatory environment, and he will consider whether more needs to be done to protect consumers and small business from misconduct and unfair practice and tactics.


We see this code as a small step in the right direction by industry. We know there's more to be done, and we look forward to the release of Commissioner Hayne's final report in February 2019. In the meantime, we should not—this place should not—stand in the way of the banking industry coming forward and improving, however slightly, its code of practice. We aren't going to refuse to allow banks to improve the consumer protections they voluntary commit to delivering to Australians just because we are engaged in a parallel process of policy development through the royal commission. It is possible, thankfully, for us to allow the 2019 code to come into force and at the same time consider and implement regulatory change to further improve the banking and financial services sectors in coming months.


Labor have been completely consistent on this, and we will consider recommendations from Commissioner Hayne and the recommendations coming out from the many parliamentary inquiries into financial services that are running concurrently. However, the evidence before this place shows that there are real and practical lifts in sector standards in the new 2019 code of practice, and we should not stand in the way of it being delivered. In the meantime, what we in the Labor Party are focused on is doing what is necessary to restore trust and confidence in our banks and broader parts of the finance sector and to protect consumers from unethical and dishonest behaviour.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:01):  Thank you, Acting Deputy President. Why is it the role of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to restore trust in the Australian banking sector? Why is it the regulator's role to restore trust by allowing an unenforceable code in Australian law to pass into fake regulation? How is that restoring trust? As I explained, Senator Canavan, this is not covered by the Competition and Consumer Act. I even read out the words of the royal commissioner himself. He said that, while there may be some contract law implications, it is not covered by the laws and legislation of this parliament. How is it restoring confidence to rubberstamp and give the seal of approval to the banks at this point in time, before the royal commission has even delivered its final report?


Of course the banks want to restore trust, and I genuinely hope that the Australian people's trust in the banks is restored. But let me say to senators: that's going to come from proper regulation and it's going to come from structural reform in the Australian banking sector and the financial services sector. I have outlined a number of reforms that the Greens believe need to happen, and the first thing I'd like to do is take the mandate for financial securities off ASIC and give it to the ACCC. We know the history. The ACCC had this mandate taken off them when a special regulator was set up for the financial services industry. I've read out in previous speeches that the people involved in that structural reform have now looked back and said: 'We made a mistake. It should have stayed with the ACCC.' I've got no problems with ASIC and their current resourcing or with the people at ASIC regulating the wholesale side of the market, but the retail side of financial services should be regulated by the ACCC.


There are a number of people who are supporting the Greens' call for the ACCC to regulate this industry. The ACCC have shown that they are prepared to take on companies—they have shown that. The problem with ASIC is that they have a conflicted mandate in this country. On the one hand, they have to factor into their decisions the stability, efficiency and functioning of the financial system; on the other hand, they have to protect consumers of financial services and financial products. That is why you and I, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, have sat through countless inquiries listening to evidence about enforceable undertakings rather than strong action on white-collar crime. That's why we've had to endure that. I don't hold ASIC responsible for that; they've had a conflicted mandate from the start. Even when ASIC was set up, the point was raised that it was a specialist regulator set up for a specialist sector. Why does financial services have its own regulator? Who else does?


ACCC covers everyone else. This was set up and people said: 'If you do that, you know what the risk is? The risk is that your regulator will become captured by the industry.' This is not me saying this; this is what has come out of the royal commission—a weak regulator who has failed to do their job and who has been captured by the industry. Once again, I don't blame people at ASIC for this. They have a conflicted mandate, not to mention all of the resourcing issues they've had over the years. But it is time for structural reforms.


Senator Canavan has come in here today to say that ASIC's essential rubberstamping of this fake regulation that isn't covered by Australian law is somehow going to restore the Australian people's trust in the banks. It isn't. It is the royal commission's job now to restore trust. Yes, it is ASIC's job to step up and take real action. But I am telling you that this is not real action—a voluntary code of conduct unenforceable by Australian law. It's a code written by the banks for the banks that isn't even complete. I notice that Labor didn't even address this issue. The fake regulation that we have before us doesn't even address the updated voluntary code of conduct which has since been changed. I went through the detail a second ago. It has since been changed to make sure banks can't take fees for service from dead people. That is not even in this regulation. I would like to see Senator Canavan address that.


I will just stress one more time that this is an important juncture in history for us to make substantive change, to be bold and to make sure that we can restore trust in the banking sector, not just for customers but also for the financial system, for the banks themselves and for their shareholders and other stakeholders in this debate. There is no way this voluntary code of conduct, which is not enforceable by law, written by the banks today, is going to restore the Australian people's faith in the banks.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1, standing in the name of Senator Whish-Wilson, be agreed to.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-11-14,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:14):  I, and on behalf of Senator Hanson-Young, move:


That the following matter be referred to the Environment and Communications References Committee for inquiry and report by 30 March 2019: 


The impact of seismic testing on fisheries and the marine environment, with particular reference to:


(a) the regulation of seismic testing, and the responsibilities of federal and state governments;


(b) the consultation process regarding the approval of seismic testing;


(c) how potential impacts are taken into account during the consultation process;


(d) applications for seismic testing in the Otway Basin; off the coast of Newcastle, New South Wales; and the waters surrounding Kangaroo Island, South Australia;


(e) recent scientific findings; and


(f) any other related matters.


Of course, senators care about the ocean and marine life and protecting our commercial and recreational fishing industries. Seismic testing—the use of sonic guns to propel sound waves through the ocean to the depths of the ocean floor—and the potential impacts that is having on marine life and on the productivity of our fisheries is a very significant issue for a lot of communities around this country. I proposed a Senate references committee that would look at the impacts of seismic testing. In fact, I'll read this out to senators who are interested in this subject. I know they would all want to stand up for their coastal communities and the industries in those communities. I asked:


That the following matter be referred to the Environment and Communications References Committee for inquiry and report by 29 March 2019—


I put this motion to the Senate two days ago and, sadly, not only did it get defeated; Labor denied me leave to have the chance to talk about the motion they voted down, even though I know that fishing interests in Tasmania have contacted Senator Urquhart and others and urged them to support this inquiry, as I know stakeholders around the country have phoned their senators and urged them to support this inquiry. It was going to look at:


The impact of seismic testing on fisheries and the marine environment, with particular reference to:


(a) the regulation of seismic testing, and the responsibilities of federal and state governments—


There have been some pretty big barneys going on between state governments and the federal government over new permits that have been released for the oil and gas industry. I know Senator Canavan will contribute to this debate, and I promise him that I won't cut him off like I did in the last one. My inexperience led me to jump to my feet and wrap up debate. I will be very interested to hear what he has to say, because I know, to use a quote, he has been 'under the pump'. Fishing interests have contacted his office, as no doubt they have many of his colleague's offices, and raised this issue with him. Keep in mind that a Senate inquiry is a chance for everyone to have their say. It is a chance to call witnesses and look at the evidence. There should be nothing to hide if you have nothing to hide. Nevertheless this inquiry has been shut down. Both Labor and the Liberal Party, I suspect, have been got to by big oil and gas and won't be supporting this inquiry. Let me go back to the terms of reference: we want to look at the regulation of seismic testing, and the interplay between state and federal governments.


There have been considerable concerns over this. I will shortly read from a summary where the New South Wales fisheries and environment minister was very angry that the federal government had thumbed its nose at his recommendations around new seismic permits off Sydney and Newcastle. Why not thrash that out in a Senate process where we can all participate, hear what different parties have to say and look at whether the balance is right? That is all that is. This is why I tried to initiate this inquiry:


(b) the consultation process regarding the approval of seismic testing—


The rock lobster industry in Tasmania approached me and said, 'Senator, in this consultation process we basically have been given a week to provide our industry's feedback through NOPSEMA on new seismic surveys that are being allocated in Bass Strait and off the west coast of King Island.' King Island is one of my favourite places on Earth, it is absolutely amazing on so many different levels. The fishermen are worried about new seismic testing there. The commercial crayfishing industry are worried about new seismic testing. They had a week.


Don't take this from me; the rock lobster industry have been on the record and have spoken to the media. They want this inquiry. They have been asking senators and MPs to support this inquiry, because they are not happy with the consultation process. They believe—in their own words—that it has been a 'box-ticking exercise'. I understand that Senator Urquhart apparently doesn't support this inquiry, because she doesn't believe that the seismic testing is going to occur until next year, but the consultation process has occurred now. That is part of this inquiry. That is why we are doing it. She clearly isn't standing up for the local fishing industry, who want this inquiry, which is very disappointing. The next terms of reference are:


(c) how potential impacts are taken into account during the consultation process;


(d) applications for seismic testing in the Otway Basin; off the coast of Newcastle, New South Wales; and the waters surrounding Kangaroo Island, South Australia—


This relates to the new, controversial permits that have been issued to big oil and gas. The terms of reference continue:


(e) recent scientific findings …


I want to tell a story about this. This is a true story—of course, all of the stories I tell are true. When I started as a senator in 2012, a friend of mine that I went to school with contacted me over in Western Australia. He is a commercial snapper fishermen. He has a boat and he goes out and catches snapper, and that's how he makes his living. He contacted me and said, 'Peter, I've got big problems with seismic testing in my fishery—not just problems of nearly getting mown down and run over by seismic boats but not having a say in when these seismic boats fire their massive sonic guns down into the ocean and the ocean floor.' He actually had a Mexican stand-off with a seismic boat that could have been really ugly. That's how desperate he's become, because he was being pushed out of his fishery. But he had mapped, through his own fisheries data, the massive decline in his fishing productivity when the seismic testing had occurred, in the years that the seismic testing had pushed him out of his fishery. He was told when and where he could fish by the oil and gas industry. That was his view. It was interesting at the time, because I said to him: 'You know what? In my home state of Tassie, the commercial fishing industry can open doors in state parliament and in federal parliament.' They get supported by a lot of senators in this place, and I've had my share of barneys with them over the years.




Senator Canavan:
  I thought they were your friends.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I've had my share of barneys with them over the years, Senator Canavan, around supertrawlers and the impacts of salmon aquaculture on the pristine waters of Tasmania. I have had my barneys with the commercial fishing industries over the years. I know how good they are at getting what they want in this place. But do you know what I said to my mate? The pun wasn't intended. I'm not going to name him in here today, because I know he's actually had threats of violence against him because of the stance he's taken against seismic companies. I said: 'You know what? There is a bigger fish in the pond than you in Canberra and in your state parliament, and it is the oil and gas industry.' Senator Canavan knows that very well. They are the ones who will rule the roost here. I said, 'So, even though your commercial fishing interests may have support in parliaments, you are not going to get what you want if you cross the oil and gas industry.'



Senator Canavan interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I would very much like to call my friend under parliamentary privilege to give his evidence—a real businessman with a real business impacted by seismic testing. This is the point I was getting to before Senator Canavan so rudely interjected—something I would never do in this chamber! I said to my friend, 'I will look into this for you,' and in 2013 I spoke to Senator Colbeck about seismic testing in fisheries, and Senator Colbeck said to me, 'There's no evidence that seismic testing impacts the productivity of fisheries.' So I said, 'Okay.' I went and looked and, lo and behold, Senator Colbeck was right in one sense: there had been no studies. Considering how big this industry is—a multibillion- or trillion-dollar industry around the world—there had been virtually no studies.


I've got the reports here in front of me, and I haven't got time to go through them today. There was some data used from 1984-85 that was quoted in a report in 2002, which I'm happy to table, that looked at some impacts off US coastal areas. Recently there have been some reports and some studies done, including a study done in 2015, which I have here, on the impacts on the scallop industry, another industry that has been very concerned about the impacts of seismic testing. But very little has been done. It's completely underscrutinised, considering the size and importance of our commercial fishing industry.


I spoke to the new head of AIMS, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, at a Great Barrier Reef Foundation briefing recently. He said to me, 'I know you are trying to get an inquiry up on seismic, Senator Whish-Wilson. I want you to know that we have just received funding to do a proper study, an independent study, of the impact of seismic testing on fisheries.' I asked him how long it would take and he said about 18 months. So, some funding has been given to this industry. Through you Chair, I ask Senator Canavan: considering the uncertainty and the precautionary principle, why are we proceeding with giving out tens of thousands of kilometres of acreage to seismic companies without a proper study of its impact on marine life?


You all know that I care about cetaceans and ecosystems, and I do care about the livelihood of people like my mate in WA who is a commercial snapper fisherman, and I care for the rock lobster industry in Tasmania, and the scallop industry. Everything has to be in balance and this issue is one that we need to scrutinise. So, why has this Senate rejected a references inquiry? Once again, all I've got out of Labor is that they don't think it is a priority and they can deal with it next year, if they get into government—and I, of course, have no guarantee that they will. They don't believe that the seismic testing is occurring off the west coast of King Island until next year, even though the consultation process, which is the key issue the industry has, has just occurred and is not good enough. I know NOPSEMA has started to take a bit of extra action on consultation, since we have shone a light on it already. But this needs to be looked at thoroughly, including the regulation of this industry.


I make no bones that I don't want to see more oil and gas exploration off the coast of Tasmania, in our pristine waters and in our fisheries, which, let me tell you, are under so much pressure. Our oceans right now, with warming waters, with ocean acidification and with plastics, are under pressure that is unprecedented in our history—I am talking about anthropogenic history. Off the east coast of Tasmania, 90 per cent of our giant kelp forests are gone. That evidence was presented to my Senate inquiry in Hobart by a diver, Mick Baron from Eaglehawk Dive Centre. In the December before the March inquiry, he said, ''Whishy', I want you to come out and bring your cameras and I want you to dive on these kelp forests before they are gone.' Then, when he presented at my inquiry in March, he said, 'You're too late. The last ones have gone.' They were an ecosystem that stretched from north-east Tasmania, from Mount William, all the way down to the south-west wilderness area. They were 10,000 years old and as important to the ecosystem of Tasmania as the Barrier Reef is to Queensland. They are gone. I'll tell you, Senator Canavan, there will be information out shortly, which IMAS currently has, and we have been waiting for for some time, about the impact of urchin barrens, Tasmania's version of the crown of thorns starfish, which is killing the reef. I know that nearly a third of Tasmania's reefs are dead from urchin barrens, the infestations that have occurred through warming waters and pressures on our reefs from overfishing. The only thing that kills the urchin barrens is lobsters. There is a lot of pressure on our fisheries. This year, our abalone industry, for the first time, voluntarily didn't catch their quota. In fact, they didn't even catch a single abalone off the east coast of Tasmania. They are under that much pressure. We have seen Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome cripple our oyster industry in Tasmania, because of warming waters and new diseases and new viruses. We have seen algal blooms shut down our recreational fisheries, including scallops, and we have seen declining catches in just about every fish species in state waters, including the sentinel species that used to be held up as the robust example of how our fisheries management is working—that is, flathead.


I don't think anyone I speak to on the east coast of my state would disagree that the oceans are in trouble. So why are we adding extra pressure to our oceans unnecessarily by firing massive sonic guns for the oil and gas industry down into our waters when preliminary studies done by IMAS on the scallop industry show they have an impact? They do have a productivity impact on the larvae of scallops. That's only a preliminary study.


This is a very, very serious matter and it's not just an issue in my state. Senator Hanson-Young is going to talk about South Australia, and I know there will be a lot of New South Wales senators or MPs, if they could, who would like to talk about their serious concerns that off North Sydney and Newcastle is the biggest area that has been opened up to seismic oil and gas exploration and potentially oil rigs—you name it. It's coming at a time when our ocean is broken. We have to take a stand. All I am asking the Senate to do today is support a Greens inquiry to provide some transparency on this. Everybody gets their say—the oil and gas industry, the seismic industry, NOPSEMA, the commercial fishing industry—and we do the job that we were elected by the Australian people to do: to look at this. There's no reason not to support this inquiry. I implore all senators to rethink the position they took two days ago of voting down this inquiry.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Environment and Communications References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,24,1
"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2018-11-14,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:31):  The government will not be supporting this motion. It won't be supporting this motion, because, as was clearly outlined in Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution, this is not an inquiry that is being established to get to the bottom of the best science on these very important matters. It is not an inquiry to do a consultation in good faith. It is an inquiry that is intending to try and shut down a very important Australian industry. That's the objective of the Australian Greens.


For the Australian Greens to come into this place and try to present themselves as somehow a defender and supporter of the proud Australian fishing industry is taking the hypocrisy of the Greens to a whole new level. We've seen their hypocrisy time and time again in this place, but today they have taken it to a new level. This is the party that has tried time and time again to shut down Australian fishing. They try and shut down Australian fishing. They've moved motions this year to try to lock out more Australian family fishermen from their grounds to try and provide for their families. That is their agenda.


We in the government support all Australian industries. We want to see Australian businesses flourish. We want to see Australian families be able to provide for themselves in our fishing industry, in our resources industry, in our agricultural industries and in our small businesses right across the length and breadth of this country. We have a very proud history of oil and gas production, including in the areas that Senator Whish-Wilson outlined. I note, and I'll make some comments on, the proposals for seismic testing off the Victorian coast that Senator Whish-Wilson referred to.


What Senator Whish-Wilson failed to refer to in his lengthy contribution on this debate—this goes to his agenda to shut down the industry; he's not approached this particular issue in good faith and he has decided to ignore clear facts that are inconvenient to his particular arguments. What Senator Whish-Wilson has completely glossed over is that just north of the state where he lives, near the seismic testing Senator Whish-Wilson has referred to, is the Bass Strait, where we have produced oil and gas in this country for more than 50 years, including through the use of seismic testing to explore areas. That has supplied Australia with hydrocarbons for half a century. It was of great assistance to this nation, particularly in response to the OPEC oil crisis. We were very, very fortunate that that particular field started to be developed just before the OPEC oil crisis in the 1970s. That was more luck than planning, but we were very lucky that it came online in the 1970s.  It meant that during that period we were not affected as severely as countries like the United States were, because we were self-sufficient or almost self-sufficient in oil and gas thanks to the Bass Strait. And of course we benefited from the higher oil prices as a large oil and gas producer. So our economy was insulated in the 1970s thanks to the production in the Bass Strait. Since then, we've continued to produce a significant amount of, largely, gas these days—not oil—from the Bass Strait, and we've done so in an incredibly safe way.


If Senator Whish-Wilson had real evidence, he would be able to point to areas where our regulations and our oversight of the industry in the Bass Strait have been inadequate, and that evidence is simply not there. It is not there, because we have in this country a very robust regulatory process that we take extremely seriously, and it has served our nation well. We've been able to protect our environment as well as provide the essential inputs for a modern economy, which include oil and gas.


I would take a bet that at least one of the Greens senators here in the chamber right now, probably all three of them, got here today not on a horse and probably not on their own legs—



Senator Steele-John interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  but in a car powered by oil and gas. 



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  They hopped into a car powered by oil and gas.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order!




Senator CANAVAN:
  I see them all the time getting into Z-sleds out the front of this place. 



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Canavan!




Senator CANAVAN:
  They don't have horses hitched to the front of Parliament House!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, resume your seat.




Senator CANAVAN:
  They don't have any horses—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, resume your seat, please. 



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Could I have a bit of silence in the chamber, including from those talking to my left. I'm trying to listen to Senator Canavan. And, those down the end, please cease your interjections. It's disorderly.



Senator Urquhart interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Because I can't hear, Senator Urquhart. Continue, Senator Canavan—in peace and quiet, hopefully.




Senator CANAVAN:
  All of us, all Australians, rely on oil and gas. Unfortunately, because we are not producing as much, particularly oil, from the Bass Strait anymore, our reliance on overseas imports to serve those needs have increased rapidly, particularly in the last 20 years. At the start of this century, on the eve of September 11, we as a nation produced enough petroleum products to supply 95 per cent of our nation's needs—95 per cent of our nation's needs in 2000-01. Sixteen years later, in 2016-17—the latest figures we have—we only produced enough petroleum to serve 48 per cent of our nation's domestic needs. Most of that comes from northern Western Australia. It is exported, too, because of its proximity to those markets. But the fact is, in the space of less than 20 years, we have gone from being effectively or almost self-sufficient in petroleum products to being able to supply only half of our domestic needs. That is a serious issue. It is a serious issue for consumers in Australia. But it is probably more of a serious issue for the security of our nation, given our vulnerability now due to the need to import such important products as oil.


We should continue to search for new areas like the Bass Strait, which has served us so well for 50 years. We should bring the best science to bear to do that. And, of course, in doing that, we should make sure we consider, listen to and protect other Australian industries that might be affected by that search. That is why we are actively engaged in this. Senator Whish-Wilson touched on this and glossed over it a bit. 


As I said, we have a very robust independent regulatory process. All applications to conduct seismic testing or petroleum production in Australia require approval from NOPSEMA, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. It is an independent agency. It is incredibly robust. I think it is staffed with extremely well qualified and diligent public servants, and they independently assess all of these plans. Again, Senator Whish-Wilson just glosses over the facts that aren't convenient to his cause. He didn't mention that one of the large seismic proposals he was speaking about, a proposal by CGG for off the coast of Victoria, was recently sent back by NOPSEMA. NOPSEMA thought that CGG's plans, their proposals, were not up to scratch and NOPSEMA sent them back to CGG—which they do all the time. They are very diligent regulators. And, by the statute NOPSEMA operate under, they must not accept environmental plans that pose a risk to the environment which is not as low as practicable, and they take that very, very seriously. This of course includes assessing the risks to other industries, including our very important fishing industry. 


That's why we as a government are very actively engaged with international researchers and the science on these matters. We have funded a number of research projects in recent years on the impact of seismic surveys, including their impact on zooplankton, marine invertebrates, rock lobsters and others. These have been funded by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, the industry and government. In 2016, Geoscience Australia, another fantastic independent government agency, published in its marine pollution bulletin a comprehensive review and evaluation of existing research on seismic impacts on fish and invertebrates. In 2017 the CSIRO, an extremely respected research institution in our country, completed an independent zooplankton modelling study. All of those are available publicly. As Senator Whish-Wilson outlined, funding has been provided to the Australian Institute of Marine Science to undertake further research into the impacts of sound from seismic air guns and vessels on benthic fish and pearl oysters. 


This research, as I said, is publicly available. I regularly catch up with those doing this research and with NOPSEMA, as I mentioned, to make sure that they are properly assessing this. All of this science factors into their decision-making.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  The minister for oil and gas!




Senator CANAVAN:
  I am perturbed sometimes that the Australian Greens seem to often disparage the diligence and professionalism of the Australian Public Service. When they get a decision from the Australian Public Service that they don't like, they come out and cast all sorts of aspersions about motivations and say that it must be because of the oil and gas industry. I think it's an absolute disgrace. Our Australian public servants do a fantastic job and take their role extremely seriously. I don't believe they're influenced by such motivations as those often ascribed to them by the Greens. 


We are also continuing extensive consultation with the industry over these issues. My understanding is that Minister Colbeck will be convening a meeting and a roundtable with the oil and gas sector and the seafood industry later this week on these matters. In fact, I have recently caught up with the oil and gas industry to stress how important these matters are. I know they are taking them very, very seriously. In November last year I announced a series of reports to improve the consultation practices and transparency of the offshore oil and gas sector. New measures will include the full publication of draft environmental plans and a mandatory public comment period on plans relating to exploration activities. The department has released draft amendments to the environment regulations to implement these measures, along with an explanatory document to provide further information on the proposed changes. All of that is available on the industry department's website, and we are consulting with the seafood industry as well to make sure those new consultation requirements will meet their needs. 


I do note that even before we will formally require these greater consultation practices, Equinor, the Norwegian state oil company that has acreage or leases in the Great Australian Bight, has committed to publishing their environmental plans. They have already been conducting consultation, although they have not submitted an environmental plan for the Great Australian Bight. But the Great Australian Bight is an incredibly prospective oil and gas district. It is often characterised as perhaps the most prospective offshore oil and gas area in the world. Wouldn't it be fantastic if we can develop and open up a new oil and gas basin that can secure oil security and national security for this nation, and, of course, provide enormous economic wealth and prosperity to South Australia and other parts of the country? 


I note that this certainly seems to be the view of locals on the ground in South Australia, with a number of mayors being elected over the weekend in regional South Australia who are supportive of development of the Great Australian Bight. The Greens and green activist groups have been running a scare campaign over these issues throughout these areas, and that has clearly fallen flat—fallen absolutely flat. Michael Pengilly has been elected as the mayor of Kangaroo Island. He was asked about the Great Australian Bight this week and said: 


I don’t oppose it, my view is very strongly that the environmental lobby have successfully run a great fear campaign against it. Everybody is environmentally conscious these days but you need to have some clarity and common sense. Our economy revolves around the oil industry, we have to have energy.


I think Mr Pengilly, the new mayor of Kangaroo Island, is speaking common sense there—something that there's a distinct lack of from the Australian Greens. Common sense is something you generally do not hear much from the Australian Greens. I'd also mention the new Port Lincoln mayor, Brad Flaherty, who's also agreed that it's not an issue for local government. Mr Flaherty says that he's pro-employment and pro-business—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  and he would make sure that these sorts of things are a priority for—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Senator Whish-Wilson, when you were speaking I quietened Senator Canavan down for interjecting. This is about the fourth time I've had to stop for you to cease your interjecting. There will not be a fifth. I will name you under standing order 203 if you interject again while I'm in the chair. I ask you to be quiet and let the minister have his say without interjections.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Thank you. As I was saying, I think the people of South Australia have spoken over the weekend. They support economic development. They support sensible and commonsense approaches to this issue. We must have environmental rigour and robust regulations around this, which we do have in this country. We must strive to continue to improve those regulations, as I did last year, requiring more information and transparency from the oil and gas sector. We do of course have a serious national security issue, where we have only 21 days of petrol available at the moment in Australia. We have only 19 days of diesel available at the moment. That is a serious concern that the government is taking action to rectify. One of the more important, or certainly more effective, ways we could better handle that issue and secure safety for the Australian people in our country is to increase our own domestic production of oil and gas if that proves possible to do.


We support appropriate regulation of this industry. As I've said, it has a proud history: 190 seismic surveys have occurred in the Gippsland and Otway basins since the 1960s. We've robustly regulated those in the past; we will continue to do that in the future. We support continued efforts to increase that robustness and increase consultation but not stunts from the Australian Greens, which are simply about trying to shut down Australian jobs, Australian industry and Australian national security, not improve the environment. We are focused on the commonsense actions we can take to continue to do that. We will continue to defend proud Australian industries like the Australian seafood industry, the Australian fishing industry and the Australian oil and gas industry. All of those industries provide jobs and enormous wealth to our country. We are proud of them and we'll continue to work with them for the best results for the Australian people.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:47):  Todayas we did on Monday when the Greens brought on an almost identical reference for debate, Labor will oppose this motion. That is not because of notice or any other reason other than that we don't support this motion for referral on its merits. We have our own proud record of protecting the environment and our precious oceans. We're very proud of our record in terms of the network of marine parks that we've put in place, and we're fighting very hard to restore these protections, which were stripped away by this government. We stopped the supertrawler and as a future government we will make this ban permanent.


What we have before us is the Greens being all at sea in managing the committee they propose to send this issue to. We in the Labor Party are very aware of the community and industry concerns in relation to NOPSEMA's processes and community concerns and consultation around seismic testing. Labor Party MPs and senators have had ongoing discussion with community and industry stakeholders in relation to their concerns about these impacts. But, as those in the Greens would know, NOPSEMA is at this very moment consulting on draft regulations. These regulations aim to improve consultation and the transparency of offshore oil and gas with respect to seismic testing. It would frankly be silly to duplicate this process here in the Senate, particularly in an environment where we won't see the experts work together directly.


We note the consultation page of NOPSEMA currently includes proposed changes which would require the publication of environmental plans by the titleholder on acceptance by NOPSEMA and also formalise a public comment period on environment plans for exploration activities, including seismic surveys. It's good to see this improved engagement from NOPSEMA with the seafood industry. They published an information paper in September this year for proponents of seismic testing for acoustic emissions to assist with the kinds of deficiencies that have been coming up in environmental plans when it comes to seismic testing. This information paper said:


A range of deficiencies have been commonly identified by NOPSEMA in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for acoustic emissions from seismic surveys. These deficiencies have contributed to protracted assessment timeframes, reduced operational flexibility and challenges to industry’s social license to operate.


What we see now is NOPSEMA inviting stakeholders to provide feedback on these regulations to the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science by no later than 16 November. Public consultations have already been held in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne. We know there will be further consultation with the oil and gas industry and the seafood industry. What's really important is that these conversations are allowed to continue without the blatant politicisation that we see before us on these issues from the Greens.


We also note that, while these regulations are being looked at and the processes are being changed, there is indeed no seismic testing approved for this summer in the regions that the Greens have listed in their reference for this committee. We understand that NOPSEMA has been actively engaging with both the seafood industry and the oil and gas industry with respect to proposals for seismic testing this summer. Regions listed in the motion are: the Otway Basin; Newcastle, New South Wales; and Kangaroo Island. So why would we see a Senate inquiry from the parliament of Australia examine seismic testing in only one of NOPSEMA's regulatory regions and two very discrete subregions? I'm surprised to see that, despite Senator Whish-Wilson being a senator for Tasmania, he didn't include in his motion the Gippsland Basin off south-east Victoria and, indeed, north-east Tasmania. We know that there are issues of concern that have come from the local seafood industry in those places.


What I want to also highlight to the chamber today is that this proposal doesn't have merit in its duplication of processes and engagements that are already going on and that this reference seeks to be sent to the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee among its many inquiries and, frankly, its many Greens chairs. By 'Greens' I mean plural Greens. They have not been able to delegate responsibility for the committee to a single senator. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Oh, here we go!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order, Senator Whish-Wilson!




Senator PRATT:
  Four of their nine senators are acting chairs for the committee's seven inquiries. It's inquiring into seven matters, including the ABC governance reference that the Labor Party sought to send to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I have a point of order on that standing order you quoted earlier, Mr Acting Deputy President. Does that get a reset for a different speaker or does it apply to the whole debate?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I'm trying to keep you in order because there have been a lot of interjections since I've been in the chair. You know my tolerance for interjections is very low, so there's no reset. Please do not interject.




Senator PRATT:
  We have seven inquiries before the references committee, including the ABC governance reference. The Labor Party sought to send that reference to the finance and public administration committee. We can see that it has hearings scheduled for later this month. I have to say that this committee has little or no time this year for other hearings. If this were an urgent inquiry rather than a political stunt coming from the Greens, the Greens would have supported our reference of the ABC governance issue to go to a different committee. It is not appropriate use of the Senate's time, frankly, to create inquiries to attempt to score political points when the particular committee in question is bursting at the seams with inquiries already.


It is premature to initiate a Senate inquiry into community consultation on seismic testing, because there is significant consultation already underway, and it is through that process that people should have their voices heard. We in this place, on the Labor side, want to listen to all sides engaged in this issue: the industry doing the seismic testing, the fishing industry and broader community concerns. But we will not stand here to prejudge government- and industry-led consultation that seeks to resolve these serious issues that have both environmental and commercial significance.


We will stand up for our environment, and we have a proven track record of doing so—a proven track record of delivering reform and not stripping away protections or grandstanding to score political points while letting opportunities slip by. So today I would like to encourage the Greens to acknowledge that this motion has twice been unsuccessful in just three days. We need to let the oil and gas industry and the seafood industry, together with government regulations, get on with the job of resolving these issues first through their current rounds of consultation.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-11-14,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (18:56):  Centre Alliance will be supporting this reference today. It will be doing so not just because it relates to an activity that takes place in a Commonwealth jurisdiction and not just because the terms of reference are quite reasonable. I might go out on a limb here and say that, of all the senators in this chamber, I probably understand more about seismic testing than anyone else, having taught acoustics for the better part of a decade and having built seismic sonars—parametric sonars. So I do know a little bit about the topic. I've taught people in the survey industry and people in Navy how to make sure, when they are operating very powerful sonars, that they minimise the risk to marine mammals and other life forms in the ocean.


What I can say also is that the science on this is not settled. I appreciate what Senator Canavan said about a number of studies that are underway, and indeed they could be used as input to this particular inquiry. I also might point out that the technology is not settled in relation to these sorts of activities. There are all sorts of different technologies that come into play. There are very simple seismic guns. There are sonars that use directivity to make sure the sound is directed at the sea floor and not necessarily more broadly across the ocean. There are parametric sonars that are designed to give better penetration of the sea floor without necessarily causing harm to marine life that is in the vicinity.


One of the things that often doesn't take place with government funded inquiries is the gathering of perspectives from all sorts of different stakeholders. I know better than others that there are circumstances where seismic testing or loud sonic noises underwater cause harm. I know that, if you're a diver and you are near a loud acoustic source, it can be painful and it will cause disorientation. The Navy use it as a technique to prevent enemy divers getting near a ship. So there's no question that there are circumstances where this sort of activity can cause harm, but there are also circumstances where it doesn't cause harm, and an inquiry like this would be useful in understanding the bounds, where the danger lies, where the harm lies and, indeed, what different technologies might change the parameters.


Senator Canavan has raised perhaps a somewhat extremist view on the other side of the question from where he accuses the Greens of doing so, perhaps on the left side of the spectrum. The reality is I'm not necessarily suggesting that you stop this activity and prevent oil and gas activities going ahead, although I don't support them in the Great Australian Bight for other reasons. The point is that there are things you can do with technology that may make it better, may make it safer. We should explore those things and use that knowledge to potentially adjust regulations. So this is not necessarily about stopping seismic testing altogether; it's about making sure that, when it occurs, the least harm is caused.


I want to correct Senator Canavan, who suggested that the Mayor of Kangaroo Island Council has made a statement and therefore the people of South Australia have spoken. I just checked. He had 1,480 votes. I don't think that is the people of South Australia talking on it. I want to put that on the record.


The bottom line is: if we don't support this inquiry then we simply won't get to understand how we could perhaps do this better.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-11-14,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (19:01):  I rise to contribute to this debate on what is an important motion to establish an inquiry into seismic testing. I'd firstly like to associate myself with the comments made by my colleague Senate Whish-Wilson, who has outlined all of the very, very good reasons why a Senate inquiry into seismic testing is needed and why even the suggestion that the Senate inquire into this issue has already helped push along some response from industry and from the government agency and departments involved.


Why am I particularly influenced by and passionate about this issue today? Because as a senator for South Australia I now know, as of last Friday, that the government agency NOPSEMA will, in the first half of next month—so in three weeks time—hand down a decision as to whether the Norwegian company PGS can undertake seismic testing in the Great Australian Bight in March next year. That's why this inquiry is urgent.


We heard from Senator Pratt, representing the Labor opposition, a lot of weasel words as to why Labor were not prepared to support this inquiry. They said it was because none of it was urgent; it could be done next year; none of this was important. I can tell you that it may not seem urgent to a senator from Western Australia but it is important to those of us in South Australia who are absolutely horrified that the Norwegian company PGS want to, during March, send blasts through the waters not far from Kangaroo Island, not far from Port Lincoln. We know that the last time this occurred in the Great Australian Bight dead whales washed up on the coast at Ardrossan, right onto the beach. There were seven sperm whales found dead on the beach in South Australia last time seismic testing occurred.


We know, of course, that the fishing industry in South Australia is also very concerned about this testing happening. They're concerned firstly because of the impacts it had last time—dead whales, a decline in scallops, a decline in rock lobster and a decline in types of plankton—but they're also very, very concerned, as is the majority of the South Australian voting public, that seismic testing will be the first step towards drilling in the Great Australian Bight. The application currently before the government agency for approval is to do this type of loud, dangerous testing and blasting in the water, affecting the dolphins, whales and other marine life, is only 90 kilometres from Kangaroo Island and 80 kilometres from Port Lincoln, right in the heart of South Australia's tourism jewel. We're worried. We're absolutely worried that if this testing is to go ahead, it is the first step to drilling these areas as well. We've already got an application for drilling in the Great Australian Bight from the Norwegian company Equinor, and these tests are to set the path for new applications for drilling as well. We don't want it in the Great Australian Bight and we don't want it just off the coast of Kangaroo Island.


Some people might suggest, as we heard the minister do in this place, that the Greens are just scaremongering. I tell you what: most South Australians are scared and terrified of what will happen if we allow drilling in our precious bight. We've got every right to be scared; we've got every right to be terrified, because there was a report from the company, Equinor, with their own modelling, leaked today into the public. Of course, they never wanted it to be seen by the voters in South Australia or by the communities. This report shows that if there were a spill in the Great Australian Bight our entire coastline would be devastated, and not just in South Australia. This report from Equinor themselves shows that oil would drift beyond the South Australian coastline all the way up to Bondi Beach in Sydney and all the way up to Port Macquarie. Every Australian who loves our coastline, who believes in our beautiful beaches, who spends time fishing and swimming, whose industries, jobs and businesses rely on a healthy coast should be terrified that this government, backed up by the opposition, is willing to tick off on an operation that is going to put this at risk.


This isn't just some kind of Greens scaremongering. This is the company's own internal document that has been leaked. Of course they didn't want it getting out to the public. They don't want people to know how dangerous drilling for oil would be in the Great Australian Bight if there were a spill. They say: 'We don't want there to be a spill. It's just that, if there were one, this is what would happen.' It's not a risk worth taking. What this document shows is that, even in the oil company's own full-scale oil spill maps, there is no way they would be able to contain the oil and the sludge and the muck and prevent it ruining our coastline, ruining our beaches and devastating our fishing and tourism industries.


I love South Australia's beautiful beaches, but I also grew up on the coast in Victoria. When I was a kid, I used to go swimming down at Cape Conran. That whole area will be devastated. Further up the coast—the South Coast of New South Wales, Bondi Beach in Sydney, Port Macquarie, South West Rocks—will be devastated, covered in oil and sludge and muck. It wouldn't just cost billions and billions of dollars and thousands of hours of people power to clean up. Some places would never recover. In South Australia, where our coastline is so pristine, there is no way it would ever recover. There is a reason these big multinational foreign companies don't want to have to pay for the insurance of our tourism and fishing industries if they undertake this drilling: they know that the payouts would be so huge that it just makes the whole project unviable. South Australians are absolutely terrified that our coastline, our tourism industry and our precious Kangaroo Island are, right now, being hung out to dry.


This inquiry is the first step in trying to put a spotlight on what is going on. If the seismic testing happens, there will be even more companies drilling for oil and gas, not just Equinor. We already know how devastating one oil spill would be. Imagine if there were more wells popped around the Great Australian Bight, where there are very, very deep seabeds and incredibly deep and rough seas. All of the experts say how difficult it would be to ensure that this could be done safely and without accident. All we need to do is look at what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, where it was much shallower and there were much calmer waters and much more experience; yet BP's oil spill still hasn't been cleaned up from over a decade ago. The fishing and tourism industries in that area have been absolutely decimated. That is what will happen in South Australia if we do not put a stop to this once and for all.


It is extremely disappointing to see the Labor Party and the Liberal Party today voting down a mere inquiry into seismic testing. What are you afraid of? What are you afraid this inquiry might uncover? What are you afraid the Australian people will find out? I heard Senator Canavan, the minister, talking about this issue and saying that people in South Australia don't care about this. Well, he is dead wrong. Labor and Liberal senators in this place from South Australia know that he's dead wrong. There is a reason they are not in here today defending the gutless positions of their parties. Not one representative from the South Australian Liberal Party or the South Australian Labor Party have come in here today to defend this gutless position of their parties. That is because they know that they will be turfed out if the South Australian community gets wind of just how dismissive their parties are being to this issue in South Australia and to our coastline, our beaches and our industries. But it is not just their parties being gutless on this issue; they should be in here standing up for their state—and they are not. They are not standing up for their beautiful beaches. They are not in here defending our environment, and they are not in here defending our tourism and our fishing industries. Instead, we have members of their party accusing those of us who are trying to stop this horrendous activity from happening of being scaremongers.


The company's own private internal documents show that it would be a wipe-out if there was an accident, even if we just allowed that seismic testing to occur, as the first step to more oil or gas wells being drilled closer to Kangaroo Island and closer to Port Lincoln. The last time that happened, dead whales washed up on the beaches in South Australia. That is what happened in December 2014. I don't want to see that happen this summer. I don't want to see anymore dead whales washed up on South Australian beaches this summer because this government and the Labor Party are too gutless to stand up to big oil and big gas in this country. Stop the weasel words, get out of the pockets of the oil and gas industry, and do something for the voters and the community in South Australia. That's what I am here doing. That's what the Greens are doing. We will stare down the interests of these big oil and gas companies, and we will stand up for our marine life and our environment.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-11-14,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:15):  I'll wrap up debate now, in the remaining minutes. I would just like to say we have a really good example tonight of why you need the Greens in this parliament, in the Senate, to hold both Labor and Liberal, the duopoly of Australian politics, to account.


It has been outlined by Senator Pratt and Senator Canavan that there are things going on in the seismic space in this country. There are roundtable meetings going on between the fishing industry and the oil and gas companies. NOPSEMA went through a whole new process in September. They've reopened consultation on seismic applications and the concerns of stakeholders. Guess what: I went to the media in July this year and said, 'I am going to move for a Senate inquiry into seismic testing in this country.' The Greens said they were going to move for a Senate inquiry and, lo and behold, we had a little bit of sunlight and a little bit of scrutiny and things started happening. 


So, while we may lose this debate today—and, sadly, that looks like it's going to be the case—I and my colleagues here can say today that this is why you need the Greens in the Senate. This is why NOPSEMA has gone through a new process that they announced in September, because we stood up for stakeholders. We stood up for the rock lobster industry. We stood up for the tuna industry in South Australia. We stood up for regional communities, and things started happening. We have seen there's going to be a whole new round of consultations and roundtable meetings now between industry and other stakeholders. Senator Colbeck is going to get the oil and gas industries together with the fishing industry.


I would have liked to do this in the public eye through a Senate references inquiry. I said I and the Greens were going to do this in July. We have given plenty of time for Labor to come on board. Unfortunately, they have proven tonight what I, sadly, in my heart, probably knew anyway: that they're in bed with the oil and gas industry. Let me tell you what: this augurs very poorly for when they most likely get into government at the next election, when they have said they are going to bring in a new marine protected areas campaign and strategy. We know that oil and gas got to them last time, and they watered down their marine protected areas program in this country.


This is just more evidence that their donors and the lobbyists who have come from the Labor Party have got to them—the fact they won't even support a public inquiry into seismic testing, even with the fishing industry calling their offices and meeting with them. I know the fishing industry have been to Canberra and have gone to the offices of senators and ministers and asked for this inquiry, but they won't support it. Why did I get denied leave yesterday even to make a statement about this in the Senate when this inquiry went down? I'll leave that to the Australian people and those stakeholders who are listening to this debate to work out for themselves, but that's how it often works in here: those people who call the shots are actually the vested interests. There is nothing wrong with scrutiny of this industry.


Let me finish by saying that seismic testing poses an unacceptable risk to the health of our oceans. There has been almost no research done on this. Senator Patrick, who understands seismic testing, is prepared to admit that. Marine wildlife, including migrating whales, and productive fisheries resources are all at risk, and we had a chance today to actually scrutinise the effect of this massive trillion-dollar industry and the potential impacts seismic testing is having on our oceans at a time in history when our oceans desperately need us to look after them.


I urge senators, in the last few seconds of this debate, to reconsider and to vote for this inquiry. The Greens have done a very good job chairing the Environment and Communications References Committee. There is scope for this inquiry. The claim by Labor that there is no time and no resources for that committee to look at this is a load of rubbish.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 3 be agreed to.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-11-14,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:14):  I, and on behalf of Senator Hanson-Young, move:


That the following matter be referred to the Environment and Communications References Committee for inquiry and report by 30 March 2019: 


The impact of seismic testing on fisheries and the marine environment, with particular reference to:


(a) the regulation of seismic testing, and the responsibilities of federal and state governments;


(b) the consultation process regarding the approval of seismic testing;


(c) how potential impacts are taken into account during the consultation process;


(d) applications for seismic testing in the Otway Basin; off the coast of Newcastle, New South Wales; and the waters surrounding Kangaroo Island, South Australia;


(e) recent scientific findings; and


(f) any other related matters.


Of course, senators care about the ocean and marine life and protecting our commercial and recreational fishing industries. Seismic testing—the use of sonic guns to propel sound waves through the ocean to the depths of the ocean floor—and the potential impacts that is having on marine life and on the productivity of our fisheries is a very significant issue for a lot of communities around this country. I proposed a Senate references committee that would look at the impacts of seismic testing. In fact, I'll read this out to senators who are interested in this subject. I know they would all want to stand up for their coastal communities and the industries in those communities. I asked:


That the following matter be referred to the Environment and Communications References Committee for inquiry and report by 29 March 2019—


I put this motion to the Senate two days ago and, sadly, not only did it get defeated; Labor denied me leave to have the chance to talk about the motion they voted down, even though I know that fishing interests in Tasmania have contacted Senator Urquhart and others and urged them to support this inquiry, as I know stakeholders around the country have phoned their senators and urged them to support this inquiry. It was going to look at:


The impact of seismic testing on fisheries and the marine environment, with particular reference to:


(a) the regulation of seismic testing, and the responsibilities of federal and state governments—


There have been some pretty big barneys going on between state governments and the federal government over new permits that have been released for the oil and gas industry. I know Senator Canavan will contribute to this debate, and I promise him that I won't cut him off like I did in the last one. My inexperience led me to jump to my feet and wrap up debate. I will be very interested to hear what he has to say, because I know, to use a quote, he has been 'under the pump'. Fishing interests have contacted his office, as no doubt they have many of his colleague's offices, and raised this issue with him. Keep in mind that a Senate inquiry is a chance for everyone to have their say. It is a chance to call witnesses and look at the evidence. There should be nothing to hide if you have nothing to hide. Nevertheless this inquiry has been shut down. Both Labor and the Liberal Party, I suspect, have been got to by big oil and gas and won't be supporting this inquiry. Let me go back to the terms of reference: we want to look at the regulation of seismic testing, and the interplay between state and federal governments.


There have been considerable concerns over this. I will shortly read from a summary where the New South Wales fisheries and environment minister was very angry that the federal government had thumbed its nose at his recommendations around new seismic permits off Sydney and Newcastle. Why not thrash that out in a Senate process where we can all participate, hear what different parties have to say and look at whether the balance is right? That is all that is. This is why I tried to initiate this inquiry:


(b) the consultation process regarding the approval of seismic testing—


The rock lobster industry in Tasmania approached me and said, 'Senator, in this consultation process we basically have been given a week to provide our industry's feedback through NOPSEMA on new seismic surveys that are being allocated in Bass Strait and off the west coast of King Island.' King Island is one of my favourite places on Earth, it is absolutely amazing on so many different levels. The fishermen are worried about new seismic testing there. The commercial crayfishing industry are worried about new seismic testing. They had a week.


Don't take this from me; the rock lobster industry have been on the record and have spoken to the media. They want this inquiry. They have been asking senators and MPs to support this inquiry, because they are not happy with the consultation process. They believe—in their own words—that it has been a 'box-ticking exercise'. I understand that Senator Urquhart apparently doesn't support this inquiry, because she doesn't believe that the seismic testing is going to occur until next year, but the consultation process has occurred now. That is part of this inquiry. That is why we are doing it. She clearly isn't standing up for the local fishing industry, who want this inquiry, which is very disappointing. The next terms of reference are:


(c) how potential impacts are taken into account during the consultation process;


(d) applications for seismic testing in the Otway Basin; off the coast of Newcastle, New South Wales; and the waters surrounding Kangaroo Island, South Australia—


This relates to the new, controversial permits that have been issued to big oil and gas. The terms of reference continue:


(e) recent scientific findings …


I want to tell a story about this. This is a true story—of course, all of the stories I tell are true. When I started as a senator in 2012, a friend of mine that I went to school with contacted me over in Western Australia. He is a commercial snapper fishermen. He has a boat and he goes out and catches snapper, and that's how he makes his living. He contacted me and said, 'Peter, I've got big problems with seismic testing in my fishery—not just problems of nearly getting mown down and run over by seismic boats but not having a say in when these seismic boats fire their massive sonic guns down into the ocean and the ocean floor.' He actually had a Mexican stand-off with a seismic boat that could have been really ugly. That's how desperate he's become, because he was being pushed out of his fishery. But he had mapped, through his own fisheries data, the massive decline in his fishing productivity when the seismic testing had occurred, in the years that the seismic testing had pushed him out of his fishery. He was told when and where he could fish by the oil and gas industry. That was his view. It was interesting at the time, because I said to him: 'You know what? In my home state of Tassie, the commercial fishing industry can open doors in state parliament and in federal parliament.' They get supported by a lot of senators in this place, and I've had my share of barneys with them over the years.




Senator Canavan:
  I thought they were your friends.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I've had my share of barneys with them over the years, Senator Canavan, around supertrawlers and the impacts of salmon aquaculture on the pristine waters of Tasmania. I have had my barneys with the commercial fishing industries over the years. I know how good they are at getting what they want in this place. But do you know what I said to my mate? The pun wasn't intended. I'm not going to name him in here today, because I know he's actually had threats of violence against him because of the stance he's taken against seismic companies. I said: 'You know what? There is a bigger fish in the pond than you in Canberra and in your state parliament, and it is the oil and gas industry.' Senator Canavan knows that very well. They are the ones who will rule the roost here. I said, 'So, even though your commercial fishing interests may have support in parliaments, you are not going to get what you want if you cross the oil and gas industry.'



Senator Canavan interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I would very much like to call my friend under parliamentary privilege to give his evidence—a real businessman with a real business impacted by seismic testing. This is the point I was getting to before Senator Canavan so rudely interjected—something I would never do in this chamber! I said to my friend, 'I will look into this for you,' and in 2013 I spoke to Senator Colbeck about seismic testing in fisheries, and Senator Colbeck said to me, 'There's no evidence that seismic testing impacts the productivity of fisheries.' So I said, 'Okay.' I went and looked and, lo and behold, Senator Colbeck was right in one sense: there had been no studies. Considering how big this industry is—a multibillion- or trillion-dollar industry around the world—there had been virtually no studies.


I've got the reports here in front of me, and I haven't got time to go through them today. There was some data used from 1984-85 that was quoted in a report in 2002, which I'm happy to table, that looked at some impacts off US coastal areas. Recently there have been some reports and some studies done, including a study done in 2015, which I have here, on the impacts on the scallop industry, another industry that has been very concerned about the impacts of seismic testing. But very little has been done. It's completely underscrutinised, considering the size and importance of our commercial fishing industry.


I spoke to the new head of AIMS, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, at a Great Barrier Reef Foundation briefing recently. He said to me, 'I know you are trying to get an inquiry up on seismic, Senator Whish-Wilson. I want you to know that we have just received funding to do a proper study, an independent study, of the impact of seismic testing on fisheries.' I asked him how long it would take and he said about 18 months. So, some funding has been given to this industry. Through you Chair, I ask Senator Canavan: considering the uncertainty and the precautionary principle, why are we proceeding with giving out tens of thousands of kilometres of acreage to seismic companies without a proper study of its impact on marine life?


You all know that I care about cetaceans and ecosystems, and I do care about the livelihood of people like my mate in WA who is a commercial snapper fisherman, and I care for the rock lobster industry in Tasmania, and the scallop industry. Everything has to be in balance and this issue is one that we need to scrutinise. So, why has this Senate rejected a references inquiry? Once again, all I've got out of Labor is that they don't think it is a priority and they can deal with it next year, if they get into government—and I, of course, have no guarantee that they will. They don't believe that the seismic testing is occurring off the west coast of King Island until next year, even though the consultation process, which is the key issue the industry has, has just occurred and is not good enough. I know NOPSEMA has started to take a bit of extra action on consultation, since we have shone a light on it already. But this needs to be looked at thoroughly, including the regulation of this industry.


I make no bones that I don't want to see more oil and gas exploration off the coast of Tasmania, in our pristine waters and in our fisheries, which, let me tell you, are under so much pressure. Our oceans right now, with warming waters, with ocean acidification and with plastics, are under pressure that is unprecedented in our history—I am talking about anthropogenic history. Off the east coast of Tasmania, 90 per cent of our giant kelp forests are gone. That evidence was presented to my Senate inquiry in Hobart by a diver, Mick Baron from Eaglehawk Dive Centre. In the December before the March inquiry, he said, ''Whishy', I want you to come out and bring your cameras and I want you to dive on these kelp forests before they are gone.' Then, when he presented at my inquiry in March, he said, 'You're too late. The last ones have gone.' They were an ecosystem that stretched from north-east Tasmania, from Mount William, all the way down to the south-west wilderness area. They were 10,000 years old and as important to the ecosystem of Tasmania as the Barrier Reef is to Queensland. They are gone. I'll tell you, Senator Canavan, there will be information out shortly, which IMAS currently has, and we have been waiting for for some time, about the impact of urchin barrens, Tasmania's version of the crown of thorns starfish, which is killing the reef. I know that nearly a third of Tasmania's reefs are dead from urchin barrens, the infestations that have occurred through warming waters and pressures on our reefs from overfishing. The only thing that kills the urchin barrens is lobsters. There is a lot of pressure on our fisheries. This year, our abalone industry, for the first time, voluntarily didn't catch their quota. In fact, they didn't even catch a single abalone off the east coast of Tasmania. They are under that much pressure. We have seen Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome cripple our oyster industry in Tasmania, because of warming waters and new diseases and new viruses. We have seen algal blooms shut down our recreational fisheries, including scallops, and we have seen declining catches in just about every fish species in state waters, including the sentinel species that used to be held up as the robust example of how our fisheries management is working—that is, flathead.


I don't think anyone I speak to on the east coast of my state would disagree that the oceans are in trouble. So why are we adding extra pressure to our oceans unnecessarily by firing massive sonic guns for the oil and gas industry down into our waters when preliminary studies done by IMAS on the scallop industry show they have an impact? They do have a productivity impact on the larvae of scallops. That's only a preliminary study.


This is a very, very serious matter and it's not just an issue in my state. Senator Hanson-Young is going to talk about South Australia, and I know there will be a lot of New South Wales senators or MPs, if they could, who would like to talk about their serious concerns that off North Sydney and Newcastle is the biggest area that has been opened up to seismic oil and gas exploration and potentially oil rigs—you name it. It's coming at a time when our ocean is broken. We have to take a stand. All I am asking the Senate to do today is support a Greens inquiry to provide some transparency on this. Everybody gets their say—the oil and gas industry, the seismic industry, NOPSEMA, the commercial fishing industry—and we do the job that we were elected by the Australian people to do: to look at this. There's no reason not to support this inquiry. I implore all senators to rethink the position they took two days ago of voting down this inquiry.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2018-11-14,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:31):  The government will not be supporting this motion. It won't be supporting this motion, because, as was clearly outlined in Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution, this is not an inquiry that is being established to get to the bottom of the best science on these very important matters. It is not an inquiry to do a consultation in good faith. It is an inquiry that is intending to try and shut down a very important Australian industry. That's the objective of the Australian Greens.


For the Australian Greens to come into this place and try to present themselves as somehow a defender and supporter of the proud Australian fishing industry is taking the hypocrisy of the Greens to a whole new level. We've seen their hypocrisy time and time again in this place, but today they have taken it to a new level. This is the party that has tried time and time again to shut down Australian fishing. They try and shut down Australian fishing. They've moved motions this year to try to lock out more Australian family fishermen from their grounds to try and provide for their families. That is their agenda.


We in the government support all Australian industries. We want to see Australian businesses flourish. We want to see Australian families be able to provide for themselves in our fishing industry, in our resources industry, in our agricultural industries and in our small businesses right across the length and breadth of this country. We have a very proud history of oil and gas production, including in the areas that Senator Whish-Wilson outlined. I note, and I'll make some comments on, the proposals for seismic testing off the Victorian coast that Senator Whish-Wilson referred to.


What Senator Whish-Wilson failed to refer to in his lengthy contribution on this debate—this goes to his agenda to shut down the industry; he's not approached this particular issue in good faith and he has decided to ignore clear facts that are inconvenient to his particular arguments. What Senator Whish-Wilson has completely glossed over is that just north of the state where he lives, near the seismic testing Senator Whish-Wilson has referred to, is the Bass Strait, where we have produced oil and gas in this country for more than 50 years, including through the use of seismic testing to explore areas. That has supplied Australia with hydrocarbons for half a century. It was of great assistance to this nation, particularly in response to the OPEC oil crisis. We were very, very fortunate that that particular field started to be developed just before the OPEC oil crisis in the 1970s. That was more luck than planning, but we were very lucky that it came online in the 1970s.  It meant that during that period we were not affected as severely as countries like the United States were, because we were self-sufficient or almost self-sufficient in oil and gas thanks to the Bass Strait. And of course we benefited from the higher oil prices as a large oil and gas producer. So our economy was insulated in the 1970s thanks to the production in the Bass Strait. Since then, we've continued to produce a significant amount of, largely, gas these days—not oil—from the Bass Strait, and we've done so in an incredibly safe way.


If Senator Whish-Wilson had real evidence, he would be able to point to areas where our regulations and our oversight of the industry in the Bass Strait have been inadequate, and that evidence is simply not there. It is not there, because we have in this country a very robust regulatory process that we take extremely seriously, and it has served our nation well. We've been able to protect our environment as well as provide the essential inputs for a modern economy, which include oil and gas.


I would take a bet that at least one of the Greens senators here in the chamber right now, probably all three of them, got here today not on a horse and probably not on their own legs—



Senator Steele-John interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  but in a car powered by oil and gas. 



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  They hopped into a car powered by oil and gas.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order!




Senator CANAVAN:
  I see them all the time getting into Z-sleds out the front of this place. 



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Canavan!




Senator CANAVAN:
  They don't have horses hitched to the front of Parliament House!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, resume your seat.




Senator CANAVAN:
  They don't have any horses—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, resume your seat, please. 



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Could I have a bit of silence in the chamber, including from those talking to my left. I'm trying to listen to Senator Canavan. And, those down the end, please cease your interjections. It's disorderly.



Senator Urquhart interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Because I can't hear, Senator Urquhart. Continue, Senator Canavan—in peace and quiet, hopefully.




Senator CANAVAN:
  All of us, all Australians, rely on oil and gas. Unfortunately, because we are not producing as much, particularly oil, from the Bass Strait anymore, our reliance on overseas imports to serve those needs have increased rapidly, particularly in the last 20 years. At the start of this century, on the eve of September 11, we as a nation produced enough petroleum products to supply 95 per cent of our nation's needs—95 per cent of our nation's needs in 2000-01. Sixteen years later, in 2016-17—the latest figures we have—we only produced enough petroleum to serve 48 per cent of our nation's domestic needs. Most of that comes from northern Western Australia. It is exported, too, because of its proximity to those markets. But the fact is, in the space of less than 20 years, we have gone from being effectively or almost self-sufficient in petroleum products to being able to supply only half of our domestic needs. That is a serious issue. It is a serious issue for consumers in Australia. But it is probably more of a serious issue for the security of our nation, given our vulnerability now due to the need to import such important products as oil.


We should continue to search for new areas like the Bass Strait, which has served us so well for 50 years. We should bring the best science to bear to do that. And, of course, in doing that, we should make sure we consider, listen to and protect other Australian industries that might be affected by that search. That is why we are actively engaged in this. Senator Whish-Wilson touched on this and glossed over it a bit. 


As I said, we have a very robust independent regulatory process. All applications to conduct seismic testing or petroleum production in Australia require approval from NOPSEMA, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. It is an independent agency. It is incredibly robust. I think it is staffed with extremely well qualified and diligent public servants, and they independently assess all of these plans. Again, Senator Whish-Wilson just glosses over the facts that aren't convenient to his cause. He didn't mention that one of the large seismic proposals he was speaking about, a proposal by CGG for off the coast of Victoria, was recently sent back by NOPSEMA. NOPSEMA thought that CGG's plans, their proposals, were not up to scratch and NOPSEMA sent them back to CGG—which they do all the time. They are very diligent regulators. And, by the statute NOPSEMA operate under, they must not accept environmental plans that pose a risk to the environment which is not as low as practicable, and they take that very, very seriously. This of course includes assessing the risks to other industries, including our very important fishing industry. 


That's why we as a government are very actively engaged with international researchers and the science on these matters. We have funded a number of research projects in recent years on the impact of seismic surveys, including their impact on zooplankton, marine invertebrates, rock lobsters and others. These have been funded by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, the industry and government. In 2016, Geoscience Australia, another fantastic independent government agency, published in its marine pollution bulletin a comprehensive review and evaluation of existing research on seismic impacts on fish and invertebrates. In 2017 the CSIRO, an extremely respected research institution in our country, completed an independent zooplankton modelling study. All of those are available publicly. As Senator Whish-Wilson outlined, funding has been provided to the Australian Institute of Marine Science to undertake further research into the impacts of sound from seismic air guns and vessels on benthic fish and pearl oysters. 


This research, as I said, is publicly available. I regularly catch up with those doing this research and with NOPSEMA, as I mentioned, to make sure that they are properly assessing this. All of this science factors into their decision-making.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  The minister for oil and gas!




Senator CANAVAN:
  I am perturbed sometimes that the Australian Greens seem to often disparage the diligence and professionalism of the Australian Public Service. When they get a decision from the Australian Public Service that they don't like, they come out and cast all sorts of aspersions about motivations and say that it must be because of the oil and gas industry. I think it's an absolute disgrace. Our Australian public servants do a fantastic job and take their role extremely seriously. I don't believe they're influenced by such motivations as those often ascribed to them by the Greens. 


We are also continuing extensive consultation with the industry over these issues. My understanding is that Minister Colbeck will be convening a meeting and a roundtable with the oil and gas sector and the seafood industry later this week on these matters. In fact, I have recently caught up with the oil and gas industry to stress how important these matters are. I know they are taking them very, very seriously. In November last year I announced a series of reports to improve the consultation practices and transparency of the offshore oil and gas sector. New measures will include the full publication of draft environmental plans and a mandatory public comment period on plans relating to exploration activities. The department has released draft amendments to the environment regulations to implement these measures, along with an explanatory document to provide further information on the proposed changes. All of that is available on the industry department's website, and we are consulting with the seafood industry as well to make sure those new consultation requirements will meet their needs. 


I do note that even before we will formally require these greater consultation practices, Equinor, the Norwegian state oil company that has acreage or leases in the Great Australian Bight, has committed to publishing their environmental plans. They have already been conducting consultation, although they have not submitted an environmental plan for the Great Australian Bight. But the Great Australian Bight is an incredibly prospective oil and gas district. It is often characterised as perhaps the most prospective offshore oil and gas area in the world. Wouldn't it be fantastic if we can develop and open up a new oil and gas basin that can secure oil security and national security for this nation, and, of course, provide enormous economic wealth and prosperity to South Australia and other parts of the country? 


I note that this certainly seems to be the view of locals on the ground in South Australia, with a number of mayors being elected over the weekend in regional South Australia who are supportive of development of the Great Australian Bight. The Greens and green activist groups have been running a scare campaign over these issues throughout these areas, and that has clearly fallen flat—fallen absolutely flat. Michael Pengilly has been elected as the mayor of Kangaroo Island. He was asked about the Great Australian Bight this week and said: 


I don’t oppose it, my view is very strongly that the environmental lobby have successfully run a great fear campaign against it. Everybody is environmentally conscious these days but you need to have some clarity and common sense. Our economy revolves around the oil industry, we have to have energy.


I think Mr Pengilly, the new mayor of Kangaroo Island, is speaking common sense there—something that there's a distinct lack of from the Australian Greens. Common sense is something you generally do not hear much from the Australian Greens. I'd also mention the new Port Lincoln mayor, Brad Flaherty, who's also agreed that it's not an issue for local government. Mr Flaherty says that he's pro-employment and pro-business—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  and he would make sure that these sorts of things are a priority for—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Senator Whish-Wilson, when you were speaking I quietened Senator Canavan down for interjecting. This is about the fourth time I've had to stop for you to cease your interjecting. There will not be a fifth. I will name you under standing order 203 if you interject again while I'm in the chair. I ask you to be quiet and let the minister have his say without interjections.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Thank you. As I was saying, I think the people of South Australia have spoken over the weekend. They support economic development. They support sensible and commonsense approaches to this issue. We must have environmental rigour and robust regulations around this, which we do have in this country. We must strive to continue to improve those regulations, as I did last year, requiring more information and transparency from the oil and gas sector. We do of course have a serious national security issue, where we have only 21 days of petrol available at the moment in Australia. We have only 19 days of diesel available at the moment. That is a serious concern that the government is taking action to rectify. One of the more important, or certainly more effective, ways we could better handle that issue and secure safety for the Australian people in our country is to increase our own domestic production of oil and gas if that proves possible to do.


We support appropriate regulation of this industry. As I've said, it has a proud history: 190 seismic surveys have occurred in the Gippsland and Otway basins since the 1960s. We've robustly regulated those in the past; we will continue to do that in the future. We support continued efforts to increase that robustness and increase consultation but not stunts from the Australian Greens, which are simply about trying to shut down Australian jobs, Australian industry and Australian national security, not improve the environment. We are focused on the commonsense actions we can take to continue to do that. We will continue to defend proud Australian industries like the Australian seafood industry, the Australian fishing industry and the Australian oil and gas industry. All of those industries provide jobs and enormous wealth to our country. We are proud of them and we'll continue to work with them for the best results for the Australian people.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-11-14,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (18:47):  Todayas we did on Monday when the Greens brought on an almost identical reference for debate, Labor will oppose this motion. That is not because of notice or any other reason other than that we don't support this motion for referral on its merits. We have our own proud record of protecting the environment and our precious oceans. We're very proud of our record in terms of the network of marine parks that we've put in place, and we're fighting very hard to restore these protections, which were stripped away by this government. We stopped the supertrawler and as a future government we will make this ban permanent.


What we have before us is the Greens being all at sea in managing the committee they propose to send this issue to. We in the Labor Party are very aware of the community and industry concerns in relation to NOPSEMA's processes and community concerns and consultation around seismic testing. Labor Party MPs and senators have had ongoing discussion with community and industry stakeholders in relation to their concerns about these impacts. But, as those in the Greens would know, NOPSEMA is at this very moment consulting on draft regulations. These regulations aim to improve consultation and the transparency of offshore oil and gas with respect to seismic testing. It would frankly be silly to duplicate this process here in the Senate, particularly in an environment where we won't see the experts work together directly.


We note the consultation page of NOPSEMA currently includes proposed changes which would require the publication of environmental plans by the titleholder on acceptance by NOPSEMA and also formalise a public comment period on environment plans for exploration activities, including seismic surveys. It's good to see this improved engagement from NOPSEMA with the seafood industry. They published an information paper in September this year for proponents of seismic testing for acoustic emissions to assist with the kinds of deficiencies that have been coming up in environmental plans when it comes to seismic testing. This information paper said:


A range of deficiencies have been commonly identified by NOPSEMA in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for acoustic emissions from seismic surveys. These deficiencies have contributed to protracted assessment timeframes, reduced operational flexibility and challenges to industry’s social license to operate.


What we see now is NOPSEMA inviting stakeholders to provide feedback on these regulations to the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science by no later than 16 November. Public consultations have already been held in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne. We know there will be further consultation with the oil and gas industry and the seafood industry. What's really important is that these conversations are allowed to continue without the blatant politicisation that we see before us on these issues from the Greens.


We also note that, while these regulations are being looked at and the processes are being changed, there is indeed no seismic testing approved for this summer in the regions that the Greens have listed in their reference for this committee. We understand that NOPSEMA has been actively engaging with both the seafood industry and the oil and gas industry with respect to proposals for seismic testing this summer. Regions listed in the motion are: the Otway Basin; Newcastle, New South Wales; and Kangaroo Island. So why would we see a Senate inquiry from the parliament of Australia examine seismic testing in only one of NOPSEMA's regulatory regions and two very discrete subregions? I'm surprised to see that, despite Senator Whish-Wilson being a senator for Tasmania, he didn't include in his motion the Gippsland Basin off south-east Victoria and, indeed, north-east Tasmania. We know that there are issues of concern that have come from the local seafood industry in those places.


What I want to also highlight to the chamber today is that this proposal doesn't have merit in its duplication of processes and engagements that are already going on and that this reference seeks to be sent to the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee among its many inquiries and, frankly, its many Greens chairs. By 'Greens' I mean plural Greens. They have not been able to delegate responsibility for the committee to a single senator. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Oh, here we go!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order, Senator Whish-Wilson!




Senator PRATT:
  Four of their nine senators are acting chairs for the committee's seven inquiries. It's inquiring into seven matters, including the ABC governance reference that the Labor Party sought to send to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I have a point of order on that standing order you quoted earlier, Mr Acting Deputy President. Does that get a reset for a different speaker or does it apply to the whole debate?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I'm trying to keep you in order because there have been a lot of interjections since I've been in the chair. You know my tolerance for interjections is very low, so there's no reset. Please do not interject.




Senator PRATT:
  We have seven inquiries before the references committee, including the ABC governance reference. The Labor Party sought to send that reference to the finance and public administration committee. We can see that it has hearings scheduled for later this month. I have to say that this committee has little or no time this year for other hearings. If this were an urgent inquiry rather than a political stunt coming from the Greens, the Greens would have supported our reference of the ABC governance issue to go to a different committee. It is not appropriate use of the Senate's time, frankly, to create inquiries to attempt to score political points when the particular committee in question is bursting at the seams with inquiries already.


It is premature to initiate a Senate inquiry into community consultation on seismic testing, because there is significant consultation already underway, and it is through that process that people should have their voices heard. We in this place, on the Labor side, want to listen to all sides engaged in this issue: the industry doing the seismic testing, the fishing industry and broader community concerns. But we will not stand here to prejudge government- and industry-led consultation that seeks to resolve these serious issues that have both environmental and commercial significance.


We will stand up for our environment, and we have a proven track record of doing so—a proven track record of delivering reform and not stripping away protections or grandstanding to score political points while letting opportunities slip by. So today I would like to encourage the Greens to acknowledge that this motion has twice been unsuccessful in just three days. We need to let the oil and gas industry and the seafood industry, together with government regulations, get on with the job of resolving these issues first through their current rounds of consultation.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-11-14,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (18:56):  Centre Alliance will be supporting this reference today. It will be doing so not just because it relates to an activity that takes place in a Commonwealth jurisdiction and not just because the terms of reference are quite reasonable. I might go out on a limb here and say that, of all the senators in this chamber, I probably understand more about seismic testing than anyone else, having taught acoustics for the better part of a decade and having built seismic sonars—parametric sonars. So I do know a little bit about the topic. I've taught people in the survey industry and people in Navy how to make sure, when they are operating very powerful sonars, that they minimise the risk to marine mammals and other life forms in the ocean.


What I can say also is that the science on this is not settled. I appreciate what Senator Canavan said about a number of studies that are underway, and indeed they could be used as input to this particular inquiry. I also might point out that the technology is not settled in relation to these sorts of activities. There are all sorts of different technologies that come into play. There are very simple seismic guns. There are sonars that use directivity to make sure the sound is directed at the sea floor and not necessarily more broadly across the ocean. There are parametric sonars that are designed to give better penetration of the sea floor without necessarily causing harm to marine life that is in the vicinity.


One of the things that often doesn't take place with government funded inquiries is the gathering of perspectives from all sorts of different stakeholders. I know better than others that there are circumstances where seismic testing or loud sonic noises underwater cause harm. I know that, if you're a diver and you are near a loud acoustic source, it can be painful and it will cause disorientation. The Navy use it as a technique to prevent enemy divers getting near a ship. So there's no question that there are circumstances where this sort of activity can cause harm, but there are also circumstances where it doesn't cause harm, and an inquiry like this would be useful in understanding the bounds, where the danger lies, where the harm lies and, indeed, what different technologies might change the parameters.


Senator Canavan has raised perhaps a somewhat extremist view on the other side of the question from where he accuses the Greens of doing so, perhaps on the left side of the spectrum. The reality is I'm not necessarily suggesting that you stop this activity and prevent oil and gas activities going ahead, although I don't support them in the Great Australian Bight for other reasons. The point is that there are things you can do with technology that may make it better, may make it safer. We should explore those things and use that knowledge to potentially adjust regulations. So this is not necessarily about stopping seismic testing altogether; it's about making sure that, when it occurs, the least harm is caused.


I want to correct Senator Canavan, who suggested that the Mayor of Kangaroo Island Council has made a statement and therefore the people of South Australia have spoken. I just checked. He had 1,480 votes. I don't think that is the people of South Australia talking on it. I want to put that on the record.


The bottom line is: if we don't support this inquiry then we simply won't get to understand how we could perhaps do this better.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,24,2
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-11-14,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (19:01):  I rise to contribute to this debate on what is an important motion to establish an inquiry into seismic testing. I'd firstly like to associate myself with the comments made by my colleague Senate Whish-Wilson, who has outlined all of the very, very good reasons why a Senate inquiry into seismic testing is needed and why even the suggestion that the Senate inquire into this issue has already helped push along some response from industry and from the government agency and departments involved.


Why am I particularly influenced by and passionate about this issue today? Because as a senator for South Australia I now know, as of last Friday, that the government agency NOPSEMA will, in the first half of next month—so in three weeks time—hand down a decision as to whether the Norwegian company PGS can undertake seismic testing in the Great Australian Bight in March next year. That's why this inquiry is urgent.


We heard from Senator Pratt, representing the Labor opposition, a lot of weasel words as to why Labor were not prepared to support this inquiry. They said it was because none of it was urgent; it could be done next year; none of this was important. I can tell you that it may not seem urgent to a senator from Western Australia but it is important to those of us in South Australia who are absolutely horrified that the Norwegian company PGS want to, during March, send blasts through the waters not far from Kangaroo Island, not far from Port Lincoln. We know that the last time this occurred in the Great Australian Bight dead whales washed up on the coast at Ardrossan, right onto the beach. There were seven sperm whales found dead on the beach in South Australia last time seismic testing occurred.


We know, of course, that the fishing industry in South Australia is also very concerned about this testing happening. They're concerned firstly because of the impacts it had last time—dead whales, a decline in scallops, a decline in rock lobster and a decline in types of plankton—but they're also very, very concerned, as is the majority of the South Australian voting public, that seismic testing will be the first step towards drilling in the Great Australian Bight. The application currently before the government agency for approval is to do this type of loud, dangerous testing and blasting in the water, affecting the dolphins, whales and other marine life, is only 90 kilometres from Kangaroo Island and 80 kilometres from Port Lincoln, right in the heart of South Australia's tourism jewel. We're worried. We're absolutely worried that if this testing is to go ahead, it is the first step to drilling these areas as well. We've already got an application for drilling in the Great Australian Bight from the Norwegian company Equinor, and these tests are to set the path for new applications for drilling as well. We don't want it in the Great Australian Bight and we don't want it just off the coast of Kangaroo Island.


Some people might suggest, as we heard the minister do in this place, that the Greens are just scaremongering. I tell you what: most South Australians are scared and terrified of what will happen if we allow drilling in our precious bight. We've got every right to be scared; we've got every right to be terrified, because there was a report from the company, Equinor, with their own modelling, leaked today into the public. Of course, they never wanted it to be seen by the voters in South Australia or by the communities. This report shows that if there were a spill in the Great Australian Bight our entire coastline would be devastated, and not just in South Australia. This report from Equinor themselves shows that oil would drift beyond the South Australian coastline all the way up to Bondi Beach in Sydney and all the way up to Port Macquarie. Every Australian who loves our coastline, who believes in our beautiful beaches, who spends time fishing and swimming, whose industries, jobs and businesses rely on a healthy coast should be terrified that this government, backed up by the opposition, is willing to tick off on an operation that is going to put this at risk.


This isn't just some kind of Greens scaremongering. This is the company's own internal document that has been leaked. Of course they didn't want it getting out to the public. They don't want people to know how dangerous drilling for oil would be in the Great Australian Bight if there were a spill. They say: 'We don't want there to be a spill. It's just that, if there were one, this is what would happen.' It's not a risk worth taking. What this document shows is that, even in the oil company's own full-scale oil spill maps, there is no way they would be able to contain the oil and the sludge and the muck and prevent it ruining our coastline, ruining our beaches and devastating our fishing and tourism industries.


I love South Australia's beautiful beaches, but I also grew up on the coast in Victoria. When I was a kid, I used to go swimming down at Cape Conran. That whole area will be devastated. Further up the coast—the South Coast of New South Wales, Bondi Beach in Sydney, Port Macquarie, South West Rocks—will be devastated, covered in oil and sludge and muck. It wouldn't just cost billions and billions of dollars and thousands of hours of people power to clean up. Some places would never recover. In South Australia, where our coastline is so pristine, there is no way it would ever recover. There is a reason these big multinational foreign companies don't want to have to pay for the insurance of our tourism and fishing industries if they undertake this drilling: they know that the payouts would be so huge that it just makes the whole project unviable. South Australians are absolutely terrified that our coastline, our tourism industry and our precious Kangaroo Island are, right now, being hung out to dry.


This inquiry is the first step in trying to put a spotlight on what is going on. If the seismic testing happens, there will be even more companies drilling for oil and gas, not just Equinor. We already know how devastating one oil spill would be. Imagine if there were more wells popped around the Great Australian Bight, where there are very, very deep seabeds and incredibly deep and rough seas. All of the experts say how difficult it would be to ensure that this could be done safely and without accident. All we need to do is look at what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, where it was much shallower and there were much calmer waters and much more experience; yet BP's oil spill still hasn't been cleaned up from over a decade ago. The fishing and tourism industries in that area have been absolutely decimated. That is what will happen in South Australia if we do not put a stop to this once and for all.


It is extremely disappointing to see the Labor Party and the Liberal Party today voting down a mere inquiry into seismic testing. What are you afraid of? What are you afraid this inquiry might uncover? What are you afraid the Australian people will find out? I heard Senator Canavan, the minister, talking about this issue and saying that people in South Australia don't care about this. Well, he is dead wrong. Labor and Liberal senators in this place from South Australia know that he's dead wrong. There is a reason they are not in here today defending the gutless positions of their parties. Not one representative from the South Australian Liberal Party or the South Australian Labor Party have come in here today to defend this gutless position of their parties. That is because they know that they will be turfed out if the South Australian community gets wind of just how dismissive their parties are being to this issue in South Australia and to our coastline, our beaches and our industries. But it is not just their parties being gutless on this issue; they should be in here standing up for their state—and they are not. They are not standing up for their beautiful beaches. They are not in here defending our environment, and they are not in here defending our tourism and our fishing industries. Instead, we have members of their party accusing those of us who are trying to stop this horrendous activity from happening of being scaremongers.


The company's own private internal documents show that it would be a wipe-out if there was an accident, even if we just allowed that seismic testing to occur, as the first step to more oil or gas wells being drilled closer to Kangaroo Island and closer to Port Lincoln. The last time that happened, dead whales washed up on the beaches in South Australia. That is what happened in December 2014. I don't want to see that happen this summer. I don't want to see anymore dead whales washed up on South Australian beaches this summer because this government and the Labor Party are too gutless to stand up to big oil and big gas in this country. Stop the weasel words, get out of the pockets of the oil and gas industry, and do something for the voters and the community in South Australia. That's what I am here doing. That's what the Greens are doing. We will stare down the interests of these big oil and gas companies, and we will stand up for our marine life and our environment.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:15):  I'll wrap up debate now, in the remaining minutes. I would just like to say we have a really good example tonight of why you need the Greens in this parliament, in the Senate, to hold both Labor and Liberal, the duopoly of Australian politics, to account.


It has been outlined by Senator Pratt and Senator Canavan that there are things going on in the seismic space in this country. There are roundtable meetings going on between the fishing industry and the oil and gas companies. NOPSEMA went through a whole new process in September. They've reopened consultation on seismic applications and the concerns of stakeholders. Guess what: I went to the media in July this year and said, 'I am going to move for a Senate inquiry into seismic testing in this country.' The Greens said they were going to move for a Senate inquiry and, lo and behold, we had a little bit of sunlight and a little bit of scrutiny and things started happening. 


So, while we may lose this debate today—and, sadly, that looks like it's going to be the case—I and my colleagues here can say today that this is why you need the Greens in the Senate. This is why NOPSEMA has gone through a new process that they announced in September, because we stood up for stakeholders. We stood up for the rock lobster industry. We stood up for the tuna industry in South Australia. We stood up for regional communities, and things started happening. We have seen there's going to be a whole new round of consultations and roundtable meetings now between industry and other stakeholders. Senator Colbeck is going to get the oil and gas industries together with the fishing industry.


I would have liked to do this in the public eye through a Senate references inquiry. I said I and the Greens were going to do this in July. We have given plenty of time for Labor to come on board. Unfortunately, they have proven tonight what I, sadly, in my heart, probably knew anyway: that they're in bed with the oil and gas industry. Let me tell you what: this augurs very poorly for when they most likely get into government at the next election, when they have said they are going to bring in a new marine protected areas campaign and strategy. We know that oil and gas got to them last time, and they watered down their marine protected areas program in this country.


This is just more evidence that their donors and the lobbyists who have come from the Labor Party have got to them—the fact they won't even support a public inquiry into seismic testing, even with the fishing industry calling their offices and meeting with them. I know the fishing industry have been to Canberra and have gone to the offices of senators and ministers and asked for this inquiry, but they won't support it. Why did I get denied leave yesterday even to make a statement about this in the Senate when this inquiry went down? I'll leave that to the Australian people and those stakeholders who are listening to this debate to work out for themselves, but that's how it often works in here: those people who call the shots are actually the vested interests. There is nothing wrong with scrutiny of this industry.


Let me finish by saying that seismic testing poses an unacceptable risk to the health of our oceans. There has been almost no research done on this. Senator Patrick, who understands seismic testing, is prepared to admit that. Marine wildlife, including migrating whales, and productive fisheries resources are all at risk, and we had a chance today to actually scrutinise the effect of this massive trillion-dollar industry and the potential impacts seismic testing is having on our oceans at a time in history when our oceans desperately need us to look after them.


I urge senators, in the last few seconds of this debate, to reconsider and to vote for this inquiry. The Greens have done a very good job chairing the Environment and Communications References Committee. There is scope for this inquiry. The claim by Labor that there is no time and no resources for that committee to look at this is a load of rubbish.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 3 be agreed to.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:26):  I'm a strong supporter of the trade union movement, and tonight I rise to lend my support to the national No-one Deserves a Serve campaign being run by my union, the SDA. No-one Deserves a Serve is designed to educate consumers and reinforce the right of workers to do their job without fear of abuse or violence in the workplace. This is something that most of us take for granted in our jobs, but, unfortunately, for many workers, particularly those in the retail and fast food sector, regular abuse is a reality. With only six weeks until Christmas, many of us will soon be heading out to do Christmas or holiday shopping. It's probably going be hot. It could take ages to find a car park. The kids might be clamouring for this new toy or that new video game. Some people might just have had a bad day. Whatever the circumstances, I implore shoppers to keep calm and always be respectful to the staff who are serving you, whether it's in the supermarket, the department store, the food court or the drive-through, because no-one deserves a serve.


I thank the SDA, particularly the national secretary, Gerard Dwyer, and the national assistant secretary, Julia Fox, for organising a briefing for politicians in Canberra during the last sitting week. I particularly want to thank the courageous workers from the ACT area who told us their stories. I will highlight a couple of the stories that workers have told people through this campaign on the SDA's website. Some of the comments that workers are making are very disturbing. People are saying: 'We get yelled at and abused all the time.' Another quote was: 'Screaming, yelling, swearing, hands being thrown around, invading personal space and provocative behaviour when in an even more vulnerable position such as door-greeter. I've been a victim of serious abuse and threatening behaviour when things were thrown at me and security management had to become involved.' Somebody else said: 'I've had customers throw products at me for simple things like product is out of stock.' Somebody else made the comment: 'Once a team member was held up with a syringe.' Another comment was: 'The customers swear at you when they don't get their way.' Somebody else said: 'I have been spat at. I've had a hot roast chicken and a bag of salad thrown at me.' Finally: 'I've been spat on during a theft incident. I've had people threaten to harm me and my staff after we refused service due to intoxication.' These stories are horrifying. No-one deserves to go to work worrying about whether they will be yelled at or have things thrown at them during their shift. It is simply un-Australian. Let's not forget that these are the same workers who will be working for less money during the public holidays this Christmas. I commend the SDA for this important campaign. This is the type of campaign that demonstrates the vital role that unions play in our society.


I will acknowledge another issue that is a major win for the SDA. In September the SDA won a very long running case in the Fair Work Commission that will see penalty rates increase for 350,000 casual retail workers working on Saturdays and evening work. The impact of that decision takes place from the beginning of this month. So casuals working in the retail industry and dependent on the general retail industry award to determine their conditions of employment will start to see some increases in their pay packets.


This case was lodged back in 2015. We know how much effort and work goes into these applications and the arguments that have to occur against opposition from employer groups, and that happened on this occasion. I want to make the point that the work the union did in securing this significant win for 350,000 retail workers not only benefits union members who pay their union fees to the SDA union but also benefits many people who are not members of the union and who work in the retail industry. This illustrates the important role of unions and the benefit they provide to our society.


The pay increases for casuals will be phased in over the next three years, to 2020. It's a great win for the SDA. Once again, it shows the importance of people joining their union to fight for wage increases and for working conditions for Australian workers. We know that Australians need a pay rise, not a pay cut, and unions are there to help people get a pay rise.
