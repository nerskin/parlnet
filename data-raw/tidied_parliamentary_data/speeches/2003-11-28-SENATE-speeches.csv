"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-11-28,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (5), (6) and (7) on sheet 3164:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 71, page 25 (line 19), omit “been involved in”, substitute “committed”.
(6)	Schedule 1, item 71, page 25 (line 31), after “person”, insert “deliberately and without reasonable excuse”.
(7)	Schedule 1, item 71, page 25 (line 31), at the end of paragraph 547J(4)(b), add “within their power or knowledge”.
The proposed new section 547J of the Telecommunications Act allows a magistrate to give an order requiring any individual reasonably suspected of having been involved in a breach of the Spam Act to disclose decryption keys and access codes to computers which may be felt to contain evidence about the breach. While we have some concerns about the coercive nature of this proposed section, Labor's immediate concern is that failure to comply with such a request would result in six months imprisonment. It seems that this measure has been lifted lock, stock and barrel out of the Cybercrime Act, but it sticks out in this legislation as a disproportionate penalty in a bill that otherwise uses civil penalties.
This criminal penalty is exacerbated by the class of people who can be made subject to it and by the strict liability test employed by this provision. Orders can be made to people who are suspected not of committing a breach but merely of being involved in a breach. That is why we think the issue has been exacerbated, because it goes beyond people who are suspects and people who may be involved in a breach and it is reasonable to interpret that as people who may be inadvertently involved in a breach. Furthermore, there is no consideration afforded to the fact that a person may not know, may have forgotten or may otherwise genuinely be unable to access a computer. We note the disproportionate nature of this punishment in the context of the entire regime, as I said. We believe that, if this penalty is to be put in place, the wording of section 547J should be tightened up to prevent its misuse or abuse in the case, for example, of people being unreasonably intimidated to provide access codes. As I mentioned, if somebody genuinely does not know how to access a computer, they would not become, under a strict liability test, guilty of an offence that could attract six months imprisonment. 
Amendment (5) narrows the class of people who may be compelled to provide access to a computer from those reasonably suspected of having been involved in a breach of the Spam Act to those reasonably suspected of having committed a breach of the Spam Act. It is entirely appropriate that actual suspects become the focus of this section, not people merely thought of as being involved in a breach of the act. Amendments (6) and (7) amend the proposed paragraph 547J(4)(b) to ease the strict liability currently imposed by this section. While requiring compliance with the order, the new paragraph limits liability to those people who deliberately and without reasonable excuse omit to perform an act within their power and knowledge. These amendments mean that, if people genuinely cannot remember, they are not going to be subject to a strict liability penalty that is drawn directly from the Cybercrime Act. Quite sensibly, this means that no-one can be imprisoned for inadvertently not obeying the court order or for failing to do something that is not in their power to perform.
Moving on to more general comments, the main point here is that these penalties—whilst I understand that they have been drawn from the Cybercrime Act and it has been a pattern of the government in the drafting of this legislation to rely on many pre-existing clauses in other acts, like the Telecommunications Act and the Cybercrime Act—do not actually fit the regime. They are not a good fit. The government itself has said this act is about changing behaviours. It is about targeting those who make money out of spam. It is not about targeting those people who are not spamming but, in the scenario where an individual is inspected in their own home or suspected of spamming, this clause looks way out of proportion to what needs to be done. These amendments certainly remove any of the unreasonable, disproportionate penalties.
If the government were looking at this through a corporate or business scenario, you could start to see why it has been an easy short cut for them to borrow the definitions from the Cybercrime Act. In some scenarios, how the act is currently worded perhaps would seem to fit but, consistent with our previous amendments, the scenario that Labor have in mind is making sure that there is not undue invasion of privacy, or indeed unreasonable impact on individuals, through an extraordinary array of powers that the Australian Communications Authority inspectors have been given.
Labor believe that this amendment further refines this regime, makes it more credible and more workable and adds to the strength of operation of this bill. It is a constructive amendment, and it sits comfortably with the principles we have articulated relating to our previous amendments, where we want to clarify and tighten up the role and the powers of the ACA inspectors to enforce the spam legislation. To pass this amendment—and I urge the government to consider that—will just remove what I think sticks out as quite an anomaly in the application of penalties. ",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2003-11-28,"—The government has some problems with these amendments. Let me start with amendment (5). As with other Labor and Democrat amendments to be moved in relation to access provisions, the government does not support this amendment for the reason that it makes no substantive change to the current provisions and is technically flawed in its phrasing. Let me explain that. Currently the bill, as drafted, enables a magistrate to require a person reasonably suspected of having been involved in a breach of the Spam Bill to assist in accessing data, where they have the relevant knowledge to do so. The Labor amendment—and I am obviously speaking just to Senator Greig here—attempts to restrict who is subject to an access order to only those persons reasonably suspected of having committed a breach. In terms of coverage of the provision, it makes little difference if one talks of a person who has `committed' a breach or has `been involved in' a breach. This is because persons involved in a breach may include those described in the subsections of the bill describing ancillary contraventions, which cover such activities as aiding and abetting breaches of the Spam Bill. In addition, the amendment has technical flaws, as contraventions of civil penalties are not described as a committed breach. For these reasons, we do not support amendment (5) proposed by the Labor Party.
Turning now to opposition amendment (6), the government does not support this amendment or the similar amendment (7) to be proposed by the Democrats, as their effect is already provided for in the bill. The proposed section 547J provides that where a person breaches a court order to provide information or assistance in accessing a computer or data, that person may be subject to a penalty of up to six months. The amendments proposed are not necessary, by virtue of the application of the Criminal Code, as the offence only applies if a person intentionally omits to do an act. An innocent mistake or a lack of ability to comply with the order is unlikely to be subject to a penalty, as a prosecution of the offence would need to prove that the person intentionally omitted to do something which breached the order. Labor has proposed, in amendment (6), that the offence only apply where a person deliberately omitted to do something. The Democrats propose a similar amendment: that a person must knowingly omit something. I am sure that, once senators understand that the offence provision is already limited to intentional omissions—and this is the assurance that I have received from my advisers; this is not a Senator Kemp invention here, Senator Lundy—they will recognise that their amendments are not necessary and, hopefully, will withdraw them, so we can proceed at full speed.
Let me now turn to amendment (7) proposed by Senator Lundy. The government notes that the intent of this amendment is similar to the intent of the soon-to-be-discussed Democrats amendment (6). As previously discussed, the government does not support this amendment as its effect is already provided for in the bill. To sum up, opposition amendment (7) is already provided for in the bill and is not necessary. Opposition amendment (6) is not necessary. It is already covered in the bill. Opposition amendment (5) is technically flawed and does not make any substantive change. So, we will not be supporting those amendments. I hope that perhaps, when this bill comes back, these things can be dealt with in a way which avoids these debates, which I do not think are necessary. ",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-11-28,"—I thank the minister for that explanation. Minister, you say that opposition amendments (6) and (7) are not necessary. If that is the case then why not expressly state that in the bill? Why not allow these amendments to pass because they clarify the bill? If these are the provisions of another piece of legislation, you might know that but, for the people who are out there enforcing the laws or perhaps are subject to the laws, it makes perfect sense to me to add clarity to this bill by including these amendments in the legislation.
In relation to amendment (5) and this issue about being reasonably involved and how far that will reach—as opposed to what we are arguing, which is that someone has to actually be suspected—again, when we are dealing with the Internet, as I am sure the minister is aware, it is about not just the Internet or email per se but the computer equipment. To suggest that someone is reasonably involved—how far does that go once you are dealing in a virtual and digital environment? Does that mean that someone who was also, perhaps, on the spammer's list is involved in a breach of the proposed Spam Act? That raises the question about the recipient that many of our previous amendments addressed. Is a recipient suspected of having been involved in a breach of the Spam Act? They are involved in it because they have been spammed. It is very unclear what `been involved in'—which is the wording—actually extends to. Rather than a technical flaw, we are asking, again, for a sharper focus and greater clarity.
However, the minister has made it clear that the government do not intend to support these amendments. That is consistent with their approach to all of the Labor and Democrat amendments that have been presented through both this and the previous bill. That is unfortunate. Our amendments seek to improve this legislation—that is their intention. It is very clear from witnesses and submitters to the inquiry that there is a very strong view that this bill is in need of refinement.
I should just say that our amendment (6) conflicts with Democrat amendment (7). If this amendment passes, it might mean that Democrat amendment (7) has no place to go. We would argue, anyway—we know that the Democrats are trying to do a couple of things with their remaining amendments—that we think our amendments manage in a better and more effective way. I just want to signal that the passage of these Labor amendments will override Democrat amendment (7).",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2003-11-28,"—Senator Lundy, that assumes that Senator Greig will vote for your amendment to toss out his amendment. I can assure Senator Greig that we will not be supporting the Labor amendment, so for this brief period of time he may see himself as having the numbers. It is an interesting test for you, Senator Greig. What are you going to do? I thought that Senator Lundy was slightly presumptuous to say that, as a result, your amendment will fall over. Your amendment will fall over, but it need not fall over now, Senator. Let me assure you that, if you join with the coalition, we will toss out this amendment from Senator Lundy.
Senator Lundy, I have to query a number of things you said. First of all, I am not sure that people are calling for these refinements. In fact, my information is quite the reverse: people are desperate to get this bill through. This bill strikes a reasonable balance. I know that the ACTU calls for refinements, but that is like me standing up and arguing that the Victorian division of the Liberal Party wants me to do something. So what? So what if the ACTU wants you to do something? That is part of the Labor Party body corporate. It does not wash with me, and it does not wash in this chamber. 
The problem is that in your response to me, Senator Lundy, you did not deal with the technical flaws in your amendment. I raised the issue of some technical flaws. For example, I said that your amendment had a technical flaw in the sense that contraventions with civil penalties are not described as a committed breach. So, although the intent is covered in the bill, the amendment, again, has a technical flaw. I reject your view that there is widespread demand for this. No information has been given to me by my advisers to suggest that there is any widespread demand for this. We will not be supporting it. Senator Greig, we look forward to your support for the government's position on this so that we can throw out this Labor amendment.",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-11-28,"—Minister, you raise an interesting point in terms of the way in which we progress the amendments before us today. I guess the broader question is: if I were to oppose Labor's amendment and, as a consequence, have the opportunity to propose the better Democrat amendment, would the government accept that? I understand that it would not. While that amendment may succeed in this place, it will, clearly, be removed in the other place. As I understand it, Labor will not insist on any of the amendments when the bill returns—if I am mistaken, Senator Lundy can correct me—and, in that case, the entire debate is moot. However, on the basis that we believe that our amendment (7) is a little stronger in terms of what Labor is trying to achieve—particularly around the notion of what one is knowingly omitting to do on an act—I ask, Chair, that we separate opposition amendment (6) from opposition amendments (5) and (7), and put opposition amendments (5) and (7) first, followed by opposition amendment (6).",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2003-11-28,"—From the point of view of the government, of course we will be very happy to oblige. As Senator Greig knows, I always try to assist senators. But, Senator Greig, I do not want to unduly raise your expectations on this matter. I have noted before that I have difficulties understanding the Democrats' logic on this bill. They are opposed to exemptions, yet they support widening the exemptions. They are in favour of simplicity but keep on making the bill more and more complex. This is another test. We are opposed to the amendment moved by Senator Lundy and we think that it should be thrown out. Senator Greig, this will be a chance for you to act in a way that I would describe as logical; in other words, this is a chance for you to join with the government to throw this amendment out. But, Senator Greig, I do not want you to be under any illusions: we will be opposing your amendment, too.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-11-28,"—I move Democrat amendment (6) on sheet 3206:
(6)	Schedule 1, item 71, page 25 (after line 30), after paragraph 547J(4)(a), insert:
	(aa)	the person is able to comply with the order; and
This goes to the heart of what was recommendation 5 in our minority report: in essence, that the bill be amended to ensure that inability to provide information or assistance is not grounds for being charged with an offence and that this provision is only applied to those deliberately obstructive in the provision of reasonable access. The recommendation relates to the concern we have—certainly, with the bill as it currently stands—that, if a person fails to provide a password to a particular machine or network, they can be charged with an offence. That applies even if they have legitimately forgotten the password or did not know it in the first place. For example, it is unlikely that an employee of the owner would know the network access password. Regardless, they can be charged with an offence and, possibly, imprisoned for six months. We believe that this should be amended. Deliberate obstruction is one matter; unrealistic expectations that people have access to systems security measures are quite another. 
In its current form we believe the bill establishes as an offence a failure to provide information or assistance that is reasonable or necessary. A number of submissions to the inquiry into the bill were concerned that these provisions may extend to a failure to provide a password or encryption key. The Democrats share those concerns and we do not support the provision, particularly as it applies not only to owners but also to occupiers. We maintain that, due to the nature and variety of information stored on computers today, strong security is very much the norm, or it should be. Few company employees—or, in the instance of a private dwelling, few housemates—could be expected to know the full details of password encryption and privacy systems for machines that they do not own. Few people, for example, would know that there are separate passwords for the BIOS, the administrator account and possibly for each individual user. Each of these permissions can be prescriptive, limited in their nature and allowing certain users access to some areas but not others. The bill as it currently stands assumes that any computer operator, or flatmate for that matter, would have access to these pieces of information and therefore the capacity to bypass security and encryption devices. This was a concern that was shared by Electronic Frontiers, which submitted to the hearing. Their submission stated:
The problem with the provisions is that they pay no attention to the fact that a person may have legitimately lost an encryption key and may be unable to provide the sought assistance. The penalties do not give a person any way to prove it. You have the situation where if a person has forgotten a password they can be thrown in jail, in theory, for six months.
Clearly that is something that we find unacceptable. So Democrat amendment (6), and flowing from that in a moment Democrat amendment (7), aim to amend the wording of section 71 of the schedule to ensure that failure to provide security information does not give rise to that offence. It amends section 547J(4) of the Telecommunications Act 1999 by adding an extra subsection (aa) to specify that a person in question must be able—`able' being the operative word there—to comply with the order.",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-11-28,"—I move Democrat amendment (7): 
(7)	Schedule 1, item 71, page 25 (line 31), after “person”, insert “knowingly”.
This goes to the heart of trying to implement recommendation 5 from our minority report, that the bill be amended to ensure that inability to provide information or assistance is not grounds for an offence and that this provision is only applied to those deliberately obstructing the provision of reasonable access. The amendment goes together with the previous amendment, amendment (6), which was not passed, to complete the implementation of that recommendation. Essentially the effect of those amendments collectively would have ensured that only those persons who wilfully—again, `wilfully' being the key word there—seek to obstruct an investigation may be charged with an offence. Only if a person knows the information sought, is able to provide it and refuses to do so can they reasonably be considered to be obstructing the investigation. It is unreasonable to expect those who are unable to provide certain information to do so and then, if they cannot, to charge them with that offence. So these amendments are relatively minor but I believe effective. They change the tone of this particular section and ensure that innocent people who do not have access to passwords or encryption keys are protected.",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-11-28,"—I should say that we will be supporting this, but on the basis that the Democrats did not support our amendment (6), which is very close to this Democrat amendment. Given that the Democrats sided with the government to knock off our amendment (6), which is very similar to this, although we believed ours was stronger, we will in fact support this. We think that adding that word `knowingly' gives the clarity to this bill that the minister says is there anyway in invoking the provisions it does in this section. Again we are strengthening and adding clarity to the bill with a very constructive amendment. We would have preferred to see ours but we are happy to support Democrat amendment (7).",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1

I think we have discussed these arguments at length in relation to the previous motion moved by Senator Lundy and I think it is fair to say that those general arguments apply to this. We will not be supporting this amendment.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-11-28,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (8) and (9):
(8)	Schedule 1, item 72, page 26 (line 23), omit “questions put”, substitute “questions that are relevant to the investigation put”.
(9)	Schedule 1, item 72, page 26 (line 24), omit “documents requested”, substitute “documents that are relevant to the investigation requested”.
These final Democrat amendments go to the heart of recommendation 4 from our minority report, namely, that the bill be amended to require that search and seizure warrants expressly indicate what items or types of files may be searched or seized. The amendments complement and work in relation with Democrat amendments (1) and (3), which we have previously dealt with. These amendments, like our attempt to have warrants specify exactly what investigators are looking for, are primarily targeted towards preventing what we might describe as fishing expeditions. 
As it currently stands, the bill adds a new subsection (1)(a) to section 549 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 and it requires that a person under investigation answer any questions or produce any documents requested by the investigator. Our amendments will ensure that inspectors may only ask questions or request documents that are relevant to the investigation, and this is important. The powers of the investigator are too broad and they need to be tightened to protect the rights of those under investigation. Amendments (8) and (9) insert the relevant words into clause 72 of schedule 1 to ensure that only those questions or documents that are specifically relevant to the investigation can be put or requested. ",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-11-28,"—It is Labor's view that these final two amendments of the Democrats, (8) and (9), would achieve their aim of tightening up the circumstances and orders requiring people to talk to the ACA investigators and to provide documents. The effect would be to limit these orders to apply to issues relevant to the spam investigation and not just anything. As I have said, the current wording of the bill is very broad, and it is not acceptable to have quite extraordinary new powers without relating them back to the investigation. Whilst these amendments are quite separate from other issues we have discussed, we think they are consistent with the concerns that Labor has expressed and reflected in amendments to this bill, almost all of which have been successful. Therefore, we will be supporting these amendments of the Democrats. We want to make sure that in spam investigations and the ability to obtain documents remains directly related to the investigation at hand.",SENATE,<title>SPAM BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,7,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2003-11-28,"—I think these are the last amendments and we will not be supporting them because, as with numerous other amendments moved by the Democrats and the Labor Party, they are simply unnecessary. The effect of these amendments of the Democrats is already provided for in the bill. I have the clause of the bill here. I do not claim to be a lawyer, but a reasonable person reading the bill would suggest that the fears expressed by Senator Lundy and Senator Greig are not justified.
Let me be specific: the amendments relate to an inspector's power to require information or documents when they are conducting spam related research. Proposed section 549(1)(a) as currently drafted only enables an inspector to require a person to answer questions or produce documents to the extent reasonably necessary for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Spam Bill has been complied with. If you read that proposed section, Senator Greig, I regret to say that I do think you have not been well advised on this matter. Senator Greig's amendments support to limit the questions and documents to those related to the investigation. As I have already said, this is already provided for. So we will not be supporting this set of amendments. 
This is probably the last series of amendments, and I would like to make some brief comments on the bill. I think we are all in blazing agreement that this bill is necessary and we are all in agreement that this bill has taken a long time to be brought to this stage. This bill is not one on which there are ideological divides between the parties; it is simply a matter of dealing with a complex and difficult issue in a practical manner. My feeling is that the Senate can work out how it wants to spend its time and, equally, senators can decide how they want to spend their time. I make no particular judgment on that; people's priorities differ—
Senator Mackay interjecting—
—and, Senator Mackay, people can make their judgments as to whom they want as leader in their party. You just keep quiet. You have not been in this debate; you have just wandered in. I am just making a couple of comments. So you just get back to worrying about Simon and we will deal with this bill, if that will suit you. 
—It is your time.
—Stop wasting time and just get on with it.
—Senator Mackay, you have made no contribution to the debate. You are upset and concerned because of the ructions in the Labor Party, so do not come into this chamber and vent your spleen.
—Just get on with it.
—I will, if you will kindly keep quiet.
—Get on with it then.
—Are you finished? 
—Have you?
—No, I have not.
—Sit down if you have.
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—Order!
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I would have thought it a little bit early for someone to be showing the effects of partying last night. But the point I am making—
Senator Mackay interjecting—
—Order! Minister, just proceed with your comments.
—Senator Mackay is upset because of what is happening in the Labor Party and what is happening to Simon Crean, so she comes in and starts shouting in this chamber and behaving in a silly and irrational fashion.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on a point of order related to relevance: what a bizarre departure from the business at hand. We are working to the government's program. We are cooperating with the government by sitting on a Friday to get its legislation through. We have just had an extraordinary example of how the government wants to waste everybody's time. I ask you to call him to order on the point of relevance.
—I thank Senator Lundy for her contribution, but there is no point of order.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on the point of order: I feel aggrieved by the comments that the minister has made, particularly the comments about my activities last night when I was working. 
—What is your point of order?
—My point is that I would like that withdrawn. Secondly, I indicate to the chamber that the minister ought to be relevant. I was aware of his pathetic performance last night—blowing out the government's time—and I ask him to get on with it so that we can proceed with the program.
—Thank you for your contribution too, Senator Mackay, but there is no point of order. I ask the minister to keep his mind and comments on the amendments being considered.
—The point I was making is that this bill has travelled a long way. It is a pity that we have had a wide range of amendments that on one level are flawed and on another level raise issues that have already been dealt with in the bill. I think there is a better way to deal with these types of issues, to be quite frank. The way to deal with them is not to produce amendments of a highly technical nature to a bill on the morning the bill is to be presented. We have the problem that we have had a long debate and these amendments will inevitably fall over in the end. As far as I am aware, they do not have any widespread community support. From my point of view, this bill could have been better dealt with. In the end it is up to the Senate to do what it wishes, but I do not think this has been a great debate. Issues that the government has raised have never been properly addressed in this chamber, as far as I can see. I made point after point which was not responded to. So the bill in its current form is not one the government finds acceptable.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-11-28,"—I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 3225:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 1 page 3, (lines 16 and 17), omit paragraph (b), substitute: 
	(b)	ensure that where appropriate, information about fuel is provided when fuel is suppled, in particular in relation to: 
	(i)	relative fuel efficiency; and
	(ii)	relative effects of fuel emissions on public health and the environment.
This amendment changes the objects of the act. As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, this legislation is about the labelling of fuels. We know that the first fuel to be labelled, according to the government statements, is ethanol. I suggest to honourable senators that this may well further damage the confidence in ethanol blends as a fuel, and this is something that we should be trying to avoid at all costs. There are great benefits to ethanol blended fuels. Ethanol is an oxygenate, which means that it makes fuel burn cleaner; it raises octane levels while eliminating the need for harmful chemical additives to fuel, and they would include benzene, toluene and the like; it reduces carbon monoxide and other harmful greenhouse gases; it is a renewable source of fuel; and it provides rural and regional communities with job creation prospects and farmers with better incomes and an opportunity to diversify their crops.
There is every reason to promote ethanol. In fact, the Prime Minister announced some time ago that there would be a target of 350 million litres of ethanol on the market by 2010. Also, back in July the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, said that he would like to aim for at least 80 million litres of fuel ethanol and biodiesel being available to Australian consumers by June 2004. That is pretty unlikely at this stage with only six months to go. Unless we can build the confidence in ethanol, it is not going to happen.
The Democrats fear that, if the only labelling which is to be required of fuels at the retail level is a warning that this fuel does contain ethanol, we are simply going to add to that lack of confidence. Our approach has been to say that labelling is good and knowledge about content of fuel is also good. I would very much like to know if benzene and toluene have been added to the fuel that I use, because I know how damaging they are to human health. We do support the idea that we know what is in fuel, but the fact of the matter is that petrol has probably 100 or more additives to it, so it is not a reasonable approach to say, `Let's list all the additives.' The question is: why are we isolating ethanol in this whole debate without saying what the benefits of ethanol are?
As I have said many times in this place, I think the Labor Party has been very destructive in this whole debate, adding to the lack of confidence that consumers have in ethanol. I think the government have been extremely slow to move. They have not been prepared to come out and talk about the benefits of ethanol. Now we see the next stage in that process, which is again likely to do further damage. What we do not have is any sort of education or promotion program. We have a committee somewhere that the government have set up to look at building confidence in ethanol, but at this point in time we do not know what is going to come out of that committee. All we have is a stated intention on the part of the government that this legislation will be a framework for putting in place the labelling system and an intention to go first of all with ethanol—and it may be that that is as far as it goes. So we might end up with signs all around the country saying, `Beware: this fuel contains ethanol,' and then get no further. 
We would like to see the objects of the act changed to include the words:
	(b)	ensure that where appropriate, information about fuel is provided when fuel is suppled, in particular in relation to: 
	(i)	relative fuel efficiency; and
	(ii)	relative effects of fuel emissions on public health and the environment.
It seems to us that, provided we are sure that ethanol blends are not going to harm the vast majority of cars—and I think we can be sure of that, although there is a review which is as yet incomplete—ethanol should not be singled out. Again I urge the government not to take any steps at all until we know that, but fuels containing ethanol have been used around the world for a very long time. In fact, there is no evidence at all that engines were damaged as a result of using fuels that were blended with even 20 per cent ethanol in New South Wales. So this whole scare campaign is really about nothing.
—It is a Labor scare campaign.
—It is a Labor scare campaign but, as I said, Senator Abetz, your government have not done much to overcome that campaign, and this bill will not necessarily solve it either, unless we take the approach that all fuels need to have standards applied to them and unless we say, `Let's understand what's in high octane fuels and standard super. What is the difference between those fuels, apart from the fact that one will cost a little more than the other?' I challenge anyone in this place to tell us what the difference is in terms of health, in terms of the environment, in terms of greenhouse gases and in terms of their effect on vehicles. The fact of the matter is that we do not know that as consumers.
This is an opportunity to get across a very important message and that is: if this fuel has three stars as opposed to four stars then you can be sure that it is not going to be as good as the one with four stars in terms of health, greenhouse, environment and many other criteria that we could include. The sorts of questions we should be asking are: is this a renewable fuel or is it just more of the same fossil fuel; does it benefit farmers; does it benefit Queensland cane growers; and does it benefit grain growers in other states, such as Western Australia, Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot? Does it reduce our reliance on imported petroleum products from the Middle East? This seems to me to be a fundamental question.
We could encapsulate all of those questions in a rating system. Instead of that, we have before us a framework which would possibly do it, but we have an intention on the part of the government to go ahead at this stage only with ethanol, simply telling consumers whether ethanol is in or out. It is not telling them that ethanol is actually good, that the blend of E10 is safe, that having it in the fuel will make things like particulates burn up and that it will reduce other substances in fuels which are dangerous, carcinogenic, cause children to have asthma and cause a whole range of problems which cost this country billions of dollars a year in health costs. It will not tell us any of that. All it will do is feed the paranoia which has already been created that says, `Ethanol must be bad for you. Ethanol will damage your car to the point where you won't be able to drive it any more.'
It seems to me that the objects of this act need to be clear and need to explain that this is about the relative effects of fuel emissions on public health and the environment and the relative fuel efficiency, because there are differences across the board. Not all fuels are the same. Not all cars are the same, obviously, either. So we cannot say one way or the other, `This fuel is going to achieve this level of efficiency.' It depends on how you drive; it depends on the car—it depends on all sorts of things. But at least we can make a start and say, `This fuel is more efficient than that fuel, all other things being equal.' 
I would strongly urge senators in this place to get behind this approach. It is not at odds with the current bill; it would sit quite nicely with it. It is a framework, as I said, for standards overall. It would set the government in the right direction and it would set consumers in the right direction because they would be informed. They would know where they were heading. We are not opposed to a system which tells people whether ethanol is in or out. But if you go ahead just with ethanol then you miss the point of labelling. You miss the point of consumers making an informed decision about what fuel they will use. I think we have the capacity and the opportunity to turn people around on this, to get them to understand the implications of their behaviour. It is an opportunity that should not be lost.
I strongly urge the government to seriously consider this. My office has been asking that this happen for some time. The amendments were circulated some time ago, so there has been plenty of time to think about it. This does not undermine in any way the bill itself. It is simply a positive way forward which would give ethanol in particular, but also other alternative fuels that could be part of that mix, a rating. We have not worked out exactly how many stars there should be for what. That is not our job. But it is not beyond the wit of the very good people in Environment Australia and various departments to work out such a scheme. We do it for fridges. We it do for a range of products and we do it because we want people to make decisions based on good information about the environment and fuel efficiency. So I strongly urge the chamber to support our amendment, which, as I said, alters the objects of the act to make sure that this is what we are on about, that it is not about something else. It is not about responding to scare campaigns. It is not about responding to the fear of various people. It is time to show leadership; it is time to show the way.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-11-28,"—The first thing I would like to say is that I just heard Senator Allison suggest that this amendment was circulated some time ago. It was not circulated to us some time ago. The amendment document I have is dated 27 November, 8.48 p.m. That was 8.48 p.m. yesterday. As I am advised, we do not have any record of receiving a draft at any earlier stage. In fact, as I understand it, we saw this document today for the first time. The point that I would make is that giving this matter consideration in the context of a specific form of amendment has not been easy as far as the opposition are concerned. Our understanding was that the Democrats would be pursuing some form of amendment, but the exact form was not known to us before today.
The second point that I would make is that I understand that this is about including further information on a label that might arise from a decision by the minister in relation to the regulations and the form of the label. To the extent that we have been able to, we have considered this matter and have consulted with regard to how industry participants perceive this might affect the labelling regime. We do not know what the label design is. The minister has withheld that information from us. We do not know what the regulations propose to say on this matter. The minister has withheld that information from us.
What we do know is that over a year ago Labor announced a policy that fuel containing ethanol should be labelled, that the ethanol component of fuel should be limited to 10 per cent and that people should know that they are buying it. We have had that position for some time. Nearly a year ago now, the minister promised that this legislation would be promulgated. It has taken us 12 months to get to this point. I make the point again that the opposition waited effectively until August for a chance to look at the detail of the legislation. The matter ultimately went to a Senate committee for a brief hearing. That led to an expeditious report, which has resulted in this matter being before the chamber today. 
We are anxious that a labelling regime come into effect. What we have before us now at the eleventh hour is a proposal which would require, potentially, a range of information to be included on labelling. As I am advised, because of the variety of blends and types of vehicles that might use the fuel containing ethanol—or, for that matter, any other substance—we may as well be talking about a label the size of the flag on Parliament House. That might sound like an outrageous statement, but at this stage, at this late hour, we have to try to understand this amendment in the context of the information that we have.
It may be that there is a regime which can accommodate the concerns that Senator Allison raises without requiring that information to be on a label. It may be that there are alternative mechanisms for requiring the publication of information in some form, through appropriate means, whether it be via a web site and a publication or by requiring information to be supplied in some form to motorists by the proponents of particular additives. At this stage, we think it is very difficult to amend the legislation on the run to require this information to be labelled, as distinct from considering all of the options and perhaps at some future stage making provision with regard to the provision of information.
At the Senate committee there was discussion about the regime that existed at the time that unleaded petrol was introduced and the means by which information was disseminated to motorists about the appropriateness of that fuel for their vehicles. As I recall, that mechanism was quite successful. I do not have all the detail of how that worked; perhaps that requires greater investigation. Perhaps the minister could look at those matters in the context of any regulatory regime he is considering, if indeed he does not already have a final draft before him. As I said, we have not been given the courtesy of seeing that draft.
One thing we do know is that the latest estimates reveal that up to three million cars in the Australian motor vehicle fleet are not recommended for the use of ethanol. For that reason, we think it is urgent that this labelling regime come into place. We would not want to see the circumstance where the minister uses some amendment to this legislation to justify further delaying that labelling regime. We believe a labelling regime is urgent, for the reasons I have just outlined—that there are up to three million cars in the Australian motor vehicle fleet for which the manufacturer does not recommend the use of ethanol. I am not in a position to say that the manufacturers in those circumstances are wrong.
—That's a leaked document; you know it.
—Perhaps Senator Allison has a better idea of what is right for the Australian motor vehicle fleet, but I am not going to pretend that I do. What I do say is that we would like to look constructively at the issues that Senator Allison raises. As I said at the outset, we have had this amendment for a very short period of time. We are not prepared to see this legislation delayed while this matter goes off to be considered, because, inevitably, that would mean the legislation would not pass this parliament this year. So we will not be supporting this amendment. ",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-11-28,"—I wish to respond to Senator O'Brien. It is the case that the amendments were circulated only a short time ago. We were expecting this bill to come on a little later in the day. The government also did not receive the proposed amendments until yesterday, but the government did have our briefing notes with regard to our intention. This issue was flagged in my second reading contribution, which was some days ago, and it was also raised at the inquiry that Senator O'Brien mentioned. The point was made: why should ethanol be singled out in a labelling scheme? Again I reiterate that this amendment is about a system that is comprehensive, not about identifying one fuel and saying that it is problematic.
Senator O'Brien said that there are three million cars on the road that are not suitable for ethanol use. I do not believe that. I do not believe that the document he quotes from is an accurate one; it is certainly not a complete one. I would expect that the review currently under way will show otherwise. In fact, all of the testing that has been done has shown otherwise. Despite the claims by some auto manufacturers, we have not seen backup to suggest that is the case. It is the case that cars in other countries are being happily driven around on far more ethanol than we are talking about here without doing damage. The cars in this country are not significantly different from cars elsewhere. In fact, I agree with Senator O'Brien: there is a smidgeon of doubt, because we have not had this review completed. So I would strongly urge the government not to proceed down this path. If this amendment goes down, and I sincerely hope, Senator Abetz, that it does not, I would hope that we do not start putting warning labels on fuel that has ethanol in it until we know there is a problem, until we have exhaustively proceeded down the path of knowing whether the claims are accurate.
As I said, Labor has taken the opportunity of running a quite effective campaign against ethanol as a result of some auto manufacturers' claims that this would breach warranty and so forth. That has had a hugely damaging effect on the industry, and we really need to avoid that in future. So let us be certain: let us take the information that is available from other countries; let us demand to see the studies where the claims are made that damage will be done. I do not believe they are there. I think there is a degree of conservatism, but we also need to understand that there are places where ethanol is actually mandated, where you cannot buy your petrol without ethanol in it. There is every reason to question these studies, even those done on older vehicles, and the claims made that they are not suitable. People I have talked with tell me that there might be some classes of very old vehicles but that if they are maintained correctly it is not an issue. If there is no water in the tank, it is not an issue. If there is no rust on the various mechanical bits in the engine—and I do not know what they are exactly—it is not an issue.
Ethanol has been blown out of all proportion as an issue. We must not move on this to further damage the industry without having that knowledge. As I said, no-one can claim that damage has been done to their engine as a result of ethanol now, so there is nothing to be lost by our waiting. Let us have a full scheme in place. Let us wait before we stick labels on things telling people that they must not use ethanol and scaring them. Let us start with education: let us start with saying what is good about ethanol and then proceed slowly and carefully down the path so that we do not further damage confidence.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-11-28,"—I want to contribute very briefly to this debate to support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Allison. The ethanol industry, the development of it and the confidence in it, is so crucial to Queensland. People would be aware that only this week 50 mayors from around Australia, particularly Queensland, were in town to urge the parliament to give a viable, sustainable future to the ethanol industry. Mayors from Dalby, Burdekin Shire, Cairns, Johnstone Shire and others from Queensland were in town only this week, urging this parliament to build confidence in the ethanol industry. 
I think that is crucial because there are a whole range of investments in my state, particularly in Dalby, with an $80 million biofuels refinery, and up north in the sugar industry, waiting for some confidence to be built into ethanol. I had my car filled up at a petrol station in Brisbane at the weekend, and every bowser had a sticker on it that said, `This fuel contains no ethanol.' I went in to pay for my petrol and there was a big sign behind the cash register, `None of our fuel contains ethanol'. The Labor Party can be proud that they have achieved the outcome that petrol stations all over Brisbane and all over Australia have stickers saying, `We do not sell any ethanol'. The confidence in the industry has been destroyed by the campaign that has been run, and this bill will do nothing to improve it without the amendments we have put forward.
Bizarrely, in Queensland they are running trials to encourage the use of ethanol. In Cairns, Caltex is running its E10 trial and encouraging people to move to ethanol blends. But they are up against it because, across the state, pretty well every petrol station has posters and stickers urging people not to use ethanol. So it is essential that we do not target ethanol in fuel standards; we should move to confidence building devices.
I was a tad disappointed by Senator O'Brien's comments. I would like to read to the chamber some comments that the Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie, put out in August. They are really worth noting. He said:
Growth in the ethanol industry could particularly benefit Queensland sugarcane farmers. However, we need to grow the ethanol market throughout Australia to deliver a real boost to activity in regional Queensland.
He outlined three things that need to happen:
First, consumer confidence in ethanol needs to be rebuilt. Initiatives such as extending the Cairn's Caltex trial will play an important role. Second, the federal government needs to extend the excise subsidy indefinitely ... Third, a more competitive environment for ethanol production that rewards producers who innovate and reduce production costs must be encouraged.
It is absolutely essential that we get confidence growing in this industry and that we get consumer confidence growing. Over the course of this year damage has been done by the various misinformation campaigns, which Senator Allision referred to, and it now has to be pulled back. And it can be pulled back with decent fuel standards that deal with the issues that people need to know about—greenhouse emissions, health emissions and issues relevant to their purchase of fuel—rather than scare tactics.
I appeal to the chamber, on behalf of my state of Queensland, to support the amendments moved by Senator Allison to ensure that, when we move to a fuel standards regime of labelling, we make it one that will build confidence in an alternative fuel and in an industry which has real potential to create jobs and investments across my state.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2003-11-28,"—I rise to speak on the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003. I find myself in agreement with the Democrats, and I welcome their support for ethanol. This is in stark contrast with the Labor Party, which tried desperately to sabotage this industry because they thought they could get some political gain when ethanol was caught up with Manildra. The ethanol industry had to pay the price. 
I now find that we are moving towards labelling. I have just spoken to the advisers, and they have some doubts as to whether Senator Allison's amendments, while they would give some support, would be a practical way to address this problem. They have explained it to me and, going into detail, I am not sure that we can support Senator Allison's amendments but we certainly support the thrust of what the Democrats are saying.
Senator Cherry spoke of ethanol being sold in Cairns and of ethanol trials. I am glad to advise the chamber today that a service station in the Burdekin will be opening for business and will sell ethanol fuel. We have taken a lot of punishment, mainly from the Labor Party and from the RACQ. I still do not know what their motivation is, but they seem to have some sort of set against ethanol and they have set out to torpedo the ethanol industry. I must admit that it did not cover them with any glory or credit at all, and I told the instigator of that campaign to his face. No doubt I will tell him again when I see him.
But it seems that we are moving towards an ethanol regime now. It seems that it will depend on the amount of excise and it will also depend on when that excise cuts in. I hope that we will come up with an excise regime and a cut-in period that will get the support of the chamber. Once those two things are in and we have decent labelling that does not have a warning saying, `This fuel contains ethanol,' which is tantamount to saying, `Don't put it in your car'—and people will always be careful with their assets—then I think we will be up and away.
If ever there was an industry that needs this legislation, it is the sugar industry. It is relying on corrupted world prices of sugar, at around 5c a pound. While sugar is at 5c a pound, the sugar industry has no future. The only future, when the price is 5c a pound, is to get this ethanol legislation through and get ethanol out into the service stations with decent labelling that has no connotation that there is anything wrong with ethanol. The cars that use ethanol in the United States are the same cars that we use out here. They have the same motor standards. Once this gets going, I think the sugar industry will see some hope for the future—it will get with it and the industry will start up.
We are on the verge of starting something new and great. It is something that will play a significant role not only in the sugar industries but throughout rural and regional Australia—in the grain industry and the sorghum industry. It will keep prices reasonably high. Farmers will not have to depend on corrupted world markets, because they will have a domestic market that will rise or fall in unison with the price. I can only speak very highly of the support of the Democrats for this particular bill. I am very disappointed with the Labor Party, which saw raw politics as a chance to somehow implicate the Prime Minister in Manildra. Having done that, they decided that if someone had to suffer, they would wipe out the new ethanol industry. People are looking for positive steps forwards with answers to problems. I think this bill, which supports the ethanol industry, is the way forward. I commend the bill to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2003-11-28,"—In a dynamic economy such as ours, we need a transport industry. That transport industry relies on fuels and, unfortunately, when they are burnt, those fuels provide toxins and other by-products which are damaging to the environment. What we have to do is ensure that any regime that is put in place allows a diverse country such as Australia to continue to have a dynamic transport system to allow our economy to prosper. In doing so, we need to ensure that we seek to protect the environment as much as we possibly can. I will make a few general comments first about the Democrat amendments and then pass to some of the specific points that have been raised. 
The amendments proposed by the Democrats would mean that the national fuel labelling scheme would take the form of an environmental rating system for all fuels. That system would take into account the relative fuel efficiency and weighted emissions impact of each fuel. While this idea may seem desirable in theory, in practice implementing such a scheme would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. The environmental impact of each fuel varies significantly through factors that go beyond the fuel itself. These include the design of each vehicle's engine and emissions control technology, as well as driving style, vehicle load and engine condition. For example, emissions from premium unleaded petrol, when used in a vehicle designed to run on this fuel, will differ significantly from the emissions from the same fuel used in a vehicle that is not optimised for premium unleaded. Similarly, two vehicles of the same model will have different emissions if the vehicles have been maintained differently.
Analysing greenhouse gas emissions over the fuel cycle presents further difficulties, because greenhouse gas emissions vary according to a range of factors, including the technology and feedstock used to produce the fuel itself. As a result, the greenhouse footprint of a particular type of fuel, such as an ethanol blend, would vary depending on where and how the product was produced. In practice, retailers can source their fuels from different producers, including overseas producers, and the fuels then are combined in their storage tanks. The issue is further complicated by the fact that scientific studies on the environmental impacts of different fuels are many and varied, and the data are often inconclusive. The health impacts of the different pollutants are not known with any certainty, and there is no accepted weighting scheme for the different pollutants. This is an extremely complicated issue that is not likely to be resolved in the near future.
I would say to the Australian Democrats that we accept where they are coming from. We can understand their motivation—and I do not seek to denigrate or belittle that in any way, shape or form—but, unfortunately, the complexities are such that we are not at this stage in a position to give the sort of definition that I think the Democrats are calling for. This makes a fuel rating system vastly more complex than, for example, the energy efficiency rating on appliances. If it went ahead, it would be giving oversimplified information to motorists and would risk giving them a false impression of the actual impact of using a particular fuel in their vehicle.
Once the government has the power to label fuels, the minister will be able to consider the need for labelling other fuels on the merits of the case. However, it must be clear that there is a need for such labelling and that the labelling would be in the public interest. The labelling that we envisage as a result of this legislation is not about putting warning labels on; indeed, it is designed to build and boost confidence. I thank the Labor Party for their support on this issue but, without seeking to get them offside, I do agree with Senator Allison that there was an unfortunate occurrence earlier on where a scare campaign was run against ethanol, which I do not think was helpful or beneficial to either the consumer or indeed the environment. It was a bit of a stunt, but we are hopeful as a government that this labelling regime ultimately will allow confidence to be boosted. I would say to the Australian Democrats: you are not dealing with a Labor government on this labelling; you are dealing with a Liberal-National Party government on this labelling, and we are, in general, supportive of the ethanol industry. 
To take up Senator O'Brien's point, there is no draft label. That is not because of any discourtesy. I can tell you there is no draft label—that is why it has not been shown to anybody. It does not exist. But, as I understand it, this legislation will allow regulations to be promulgated, and part of the regulatory regime would be the label. That label, therefore, would potentially be a disallowable instrument. Therefore, this place would see the label, would be able to pass judgment on it and would be able to disallow it if it did become the size of the Australian flag flying on top of this place, as Senator O'Brien has suggested that it would under the Democrat proposal. I take Senator O'Brien's point on that, and that is why we as a government do not support this Democrat amendment or, indeed, the others that flow from it. All of them are basically covering the same issue. If there is one thing that we as a government are known for, it is that we are a very practical government. We look at problems and look for practical solutions. So I can assure Senator O'Brien and those listening that we will not be looking for labels the size of the Australian flag on top of Parliament House.
In relation to the label and warnings, Dr Kemp has put out a media release in which the only warnings mentioned were to apply to outboard and aircraft engines. For the average motorist we believe the mix will be of benefit but, at the end of the day, a lot still needs to be determined, discussed and sorted out. To get us going down that path we need this bill passed unamended—I would respectfully suggest—and then, when we have the capacity under this legislation to make the appropriate regulations, we can sort out the detail, after a lot of consultation. If there is another hallmark of this government, it is that we are a consultative government. We do listen to the community and the interest groups on various issues and then come down with a practical outcome for the benefit of the whole community. That is the basis on which we are approaching this issue. I thank the Labor Party for their opposition to the Democrat amendment. I understand where the Democrats are coming from but, with respect, it would be over-prescriptive at a time when the information simply is not at hand. I invite the Senate to proceed with this bill without further delay.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-11-28,"—There were a number of comments made in the course of the debate that I must respond to, and I will start with those of Senator Boswell. One would have thought that he was of the opinion that the Labor Party was not supporting this legislation. I can understand that Senator Boswell is not connected with reality this morning. It is often the case that he comes into this chamber and makes comments which are, may I say, a long way from the facts. And that is what he did this morning. I contrast his allegation that the Labor Party does not support the ethanol industry with the fact that the ethanol industry in this country as it exists now was substantially brought about by the ethanol bounty put in place by the Keating Labor government and abolished by the Howard coalition government. Senator Boswell was in this parliament when that occurred. He supported the removal of the ethanol bounty, so he has an absolute nerve to come in here and pretend that the coalition has credentials with regard to ethanol.
With this legislation, of course, we have seen a response to a campaign for consumer information. What was occurring, particularly in the Sydney market, was the inclusion of volumes of ethanol in fuel far beyond that which was considered safe—so far as vehicle manufacturers were concerned—for the vehicles in use in Australia. A point was made that the vehicles in Australia are the same as those in the United States. They are not. There are vehicles in the United States that are manufactured specifically for high quantities of ethanol in fuel. Manufacturers know, in the United States, that ethanol is mandated and they produce vehicles that are equipped to deal with that fact. That is not the case here. It is not a mandated component—at least, not at this stage or in contemplation, as I understand it—and so we have a different motor vehicle fleet here than exists in other countries. I made the point in my second reading contribution that General Motors send a vehicle from Australia to Brazil—it is one of the Commodore range, as I understand it—but they modify the vehicle to cope with the very much higher ethanol concentrations which exist in fuel in Brazil. That is quite appropriate. Now, if that car was generally available here and the motor vehicle fleet generally reflected that, the need to limit ethanol to 10 per cent possibly would not exist. But, at the moment, the opposition believes that that need exists, and the government obviously does now as well, although it took some time to come to that point. 
As to the ethanol trials that are taking place in North Queensland, the Caltex trial, as I understand it, involves a warning label. It lets motorists know, as it should, that they are buying fuel that contains ethanol and that there are facts that they should be aware of in putting that fuel into their vehicles. That has not stopped the trial from going ahead successfully, as I understand it. It does inform consumers that they are putting something into their car and they should understand what the manufacturer of that vehicle has to say about the inclusion of ethanol as a component in the fuel. There is nothing wrong with that. Consumer knowledge, as far as I was aware, was something the Democrats and—I thought—even The Nationals supported.
The worst thing that emanated from Senator Boswell today was the suggestion that the sugar industry is going to be a major beneficiary of any expansion of the ethanol industry in this country. The facts are that, currently, about 96 per cent of the ethanol used in or produced for fuel in this country is manufactured from grain starch—wheat. A number of the proponents of plants—such as the plants at Dalby, I think, talked about by Senator Boswell—are proposing to use sorghum, not sugar, as a feedstock. There may be some benefits over time for the sugar industry out of an expansion of the ethanol industry. In fact, I think there are some proponents of ethanol existing in the industry now who think they will expand their production, and the trial in North Queensland obviously envisages using sugar as a feedstock. But the reality is that, if there is a substantial expansion of the ethanol industry in this country, it is very unlikely to be based on sugar. It is much more likely to be based on grains. Perhaps in some parts of Australia sugar beet may be grown for that purpose. Who knows? It is too early to say. So the Labor Party certainly rejects that sort of scandalous fearmongering by The Nationals.
I turn to the contribution by Senator Cherry. I am pleased that he has now come to the ethanol debate. It is good to see that he has brought himself up to speed on the issues. It is obviously a political issue running in his state at the moment. He expressed concern that some petrol stations in Brisbane advertise that there is no ethanol in their fuel. Obviously, there is a consumer response to the fact that ethanol quantities in fuel were at levels which manufacturers suggested could possibly void warranties. So we see the labelling regime proposed here as beneficial to the development of the ethanol industry. It is an opportunity for the ethanol industry to say, `You're able to understand what you're putting in your car. You're able to understand that it's limited to a certain quantity. You're able to review what the manufacturer of your vehicle recommends as to the appropriateness of that fuel for your vehicle, and you're able to make an informed decision.' 
Every proponent of development in the ethanol industry that I have spoken to has agreed that it is in the best interests of the industry to have consumer confidence and support. The Labor Party believe that that will be achieved by allowing people, when they make a decision to put fuel with ethanol in it in their cars, to understand the volume of ethanol involved and to compare it with manufacturers' recommendations. So we absolutely reject the suggestion that what we are about is in any way inhibiting the industry. We believe that a labelling regime and a regime which limits the quantity to 10 per cent are in the interests of the further development of the industry.
As for the suggestion that the industry has been subject to a scare campaign, the reality is that the scariest thing about what was occurring was that, particularly in Sydney, motorists were purchasing fuel with an ethanol component well in excess of 20 per cent. Motorists were taking risks with the warranties of expensive motor vehicles without knowing that they were taking those risks. So we are absolutely unashamed that we were part of drawing that fact to the attention of Australian consumers, particularly in the Sydney market. We are absolutely unashamed of the fact that we are now seeing legislation go through this place which will lead to motorists knowing that, when they do put ethanol in their car, it is limited to 10 per cent. They will not be unaware of the fact that they may be voiding their warranty or damaging their vehicle.
On the best advice that the motor vehicle industry gives to us—and, I am sure, to the government and to the minor parties—there are vehicles for which the use of ethanol is inappropriate. I think, if there is a debate, it is a debate which should be had. I welcome the contribution of Senator Allison, who has questioned some of those findings. If I were the owner of a motor vehicle for which the manufacturer suggested the use of ethanol was not recommended, I would rather not have an argument with them if they then said that my warranty was voided because of the use of ethanol. I would rather have all of the facts out in the open. I would be cautious about my motor vehicle rather than, at the end of the day, go along and say, `I've had a problem. I want you to fix it under warranty' and then have the manufacturer say, `No, we told you that you couldn't use ethanol, and you did.' I would rather have all the facts than have to argue that I did not know, when I went into a particular service station, that I was putting ethanol into my vehicle, and then need to sue the owner of the service station and prove that there was ethanol in the fuel.
I would rather an open and transparent system, and that is what this legislation proposes. As I said at the outset, we do not want to allow this minister an opportunity to sit on his hands any longer in relation to establishing the regime that is proposed in this legislation. We want it under way as soon as possible, and that is why we do not want to see this legislation delayed. We will not be supporting the amendment, but we are interested in further discussing any measures which can properly inform the consumer without providing for a scheme which is impossible to comply with.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-11-28,"—Senator O'Brien, we agree with you that there needs to be transparency and openness in labelling. That is what our amendments are all about. We are not saying, `Don't label fuel if it's got ethanol in it.' We are quite happy for that to happen. In fact, our amendment (4) says that the labelling should be a graphic representation. I think the Caltex one is a good one. As I understand it, it has a simple little green drop with an `E' in the centre of it, and I think that that is quite appropriate. I also think it is appropriate for there to be a list somewhere at the service station of vehicles for which the manufacturers say ethanol is not appropriate. I must say that I do not believe that that is a very long list. I think we need to go through this process before we rush into it. 
I say to Senator Abetz that, on this issue at least, this is not a practical response. You say that you are a practical government; I would say that you are reactionary. That is what this has all been about: reacting to a scare campaign in an inappropriate way. Senator Abetz says that you cannot do this, because it is too complicated—you would end up with something oversimplified, and we cannot have that. I say that we already have it in the auto industry. If you go to buy a new vehicle these days, you will find that there is a star rating. People are happy to say, `All right, I can see that this car is better than that car in that respect, so that's the car I'll go for.' They do not say, `How did you get to three stars? What does that mean? Is that varied by the way I drive the car or the way it's maintained?' They accept that there is some advice which is properly scientifically based and provided to consumers to assist them in their choices. If you buy a fridge with a five-star energy rating and you put hot foods in it, it will not have the same rating as if you do not. If you leave the door open all night, it will not be as efficient as if you leave the door closed. These are things that consumers understand. We are not talking here about dealing with morons. People are accustomed to having systems in place that do not necessarily spell out all the details.
You do not need to go into matters to do with driving or maintenance. You can tell people it is very good to maintain your car. That way you will improve the efficiency: no matter if it is an inefficient car or an efficient car, you will still improve your efficiency. You can tell them that driving in a particular way is going to save fuel. As someone who drives a Prius, a hybrid petrol-electric car, I know very well that the way I drive affects the fuel consumption, and you do too, Senator Abetz. There is a little graph that comes up all the time and tells you how you are going. You need both the information which allows you to make a judgment in the first instance and the information that says, `In addition to that, this is what I can do to make this fuel safer or more efficient.' So I cannot accept the arguments that you have put up.
Scientific studies are inconclusive. So what? They are probably inconclusive about vehicles as well, but we do not need to know every last bit of detail in order to put together a rating scheme which might be based on four or five stars. I do not think there is a problem with that. We currently have that information. The CSIRO has done a very extensive summary of the relative merits of different fuels. It has reduced it to ticks and crosses and you get two dashes if it is a great improvement on a standard fuel, standard low-sulfur petrol. That schedule is a one-pager which is simple to understand. It does not need to go into fine detail about particular points; it simply gives you the information that you need based on the knowledge that is available at the present time. So it is a nonsense to suggest that this is too complex to do.
That CSIRO study, that schedule, does take into account life cycle. In fact, there is quite a lot of argument about ethanol and its rating in that respect. I heard the other day a suggestion that there were errors in the assumptions that were being made about ethanol, that in fact greenhouse wise it had taken into account all sorts of things that farmers no longer do. Of course there will be arguments around the edges, and that is appropriate too. That sets up a kind of competition so that fuels might improve their rating in order to get that extra star. I can see this being a very powerful force for change for the better. It is not beyond our capacity to do this, Senator Abetz. As I said, with regard to those variations of driving style and design of each of the engines and whether or not maintenance is being carried out, consumers accept that there are those variations but it does not make any difference. If you start with an efficient, low greenhouse emission fuel then, no matter how you use it, it is still going to be better than another fuel which is not. So we are talking about the relative merits—not the absolute outcome but the relative merits—of the fuel that is going into your car. That is what we need to worry about. 
It is clear that neither of the major parties will support these sensible amendments, but I do ask the minister to give the Senate some assurance that we will not just be stuck with a label which says, `Guaranteed no ethanol in this fuel.' I think we do need to know that the government intends to move in this direction. Otherwise, we should not be dealing with a fuel quality standards amendments bill; we should be dealing with a `Let's get rid of ethanol' bill. That is what it should be called.
—Absolutely not.
—Senator Abetz, you say this is practical and this is about boosting confidence in the industry, but it is not. In fact, it is going to do the opposite. If this is about ethanol only, let us have that in the label of the bill itself. If it is not, can you assure us that it is clear that ethanol is going to be first out? We can disagree or agree about what that is going to do to confidence about the fuel, but can we at least have some assurances that we will move from here to having a labelling system which gives consumers more information than they currently have about fuels so that they can make a choice other than a choice about price? That is really all we have at the present time except what petrol manufacturers and retailers want to tell us. We do not know about those other things such as benzene and toluene—all those additives and ingredients in petrol which we know to be damaging to our health. So can we have some assurance that, once we set up this framework, we will not just end up with ethanol warnings but we will have something beyond that which tells us more about the fuels?",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1

I withdraw amendment (5). I do not propose to extend this debate much longer. These amendments put into effect that which I have already debated earlier in amendment (1). Amendment (2) requires the minister to create a fuel information standard for all kinds of fuels. That would ensure that all fuels, not just one type, are labelled. As I have said, we believe motorists deserve to know the effects of the fuel they buy, and it would prevent one specific fuel, in this case ethanol, from being singled out. Amendment (4) requires the minister to create a standard or label for all kinds of automotive fuels. That would be a graphic representation, either a star system or some other. We anticipate it would be similar to the white goods energy efficiency label or, indeed, the existing one for new vehicles on sale. I can see there is no support in the chamber, but I am somewhat encouraged by the minister's response that this will not just be about ethanol. The Democrats will certainly be pursuing this question to make sure that is the case. I believe that to go down this path of letting consumers know about the fuel they are buying and not just whether it has ethanol in it or not is a very positive way forward.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-11-28,"—I rise to speak to the two medical indemnity bills before the Senate today. These bills give effect to promises made to the medical profession by the Minister for Health and Ageing in October this year when the medical profession expressed strong opposition to the IBNR indemnity levy, relating to `incurred but not reported' liabilities. The bills aim to address two concerns that doctors have: that they will be personally liable for theoretical blue skies claims, and doctors contributing to the cost of IBNR claim liabilities that were assumed by the government. The bills address these concerns by providing that claims exceeding $20 million, or the amount agreed to in a doctor's medical indemnity cover, are met by the government and by establishing a moratorium on the IBNR contributions for 18 months so that doctors pay a maximum of $1,000 for the first year and part contributions for the six months thereafter. The moratorium arrangements apply to those members of United Medical Protection, UMP, who were required to pay the contribution imposed in the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Act 2002.
UMP was the largest medical insurer in Australia, with coverage of approximately 60 per cent of medical practitioners nationally and 90 per cent in New South Wales. From its creation it pursued an aggressive market growth strategy, which no doubt contributed to the state it is in today. UMP's history of inadequate provisioning for future claims was a problem highlighted by the Minister for Health and Ageing in his second reading speech on these bills. As is widely known, following the provisional liquidation of UMP, medical indemnity providers were brought under the umbrella of APRA regulation. Legislation was introduced last year to put in place arrangements so the government could, as it had promised, meet the cost of unfunded IBNR liabilities of MDOs for incidents that occurred up to 30 June 2002, which are estimated to be in the vicinity of $460 million. It is the payment of these liabilities over a term of 10 years that has caused the most concern to practitioners in the medical profession, who threatened to cease practice, retire early or withdraw their services from public hospitals. 
A reduction in services, coupled with declines in bulk-billing rates, creates a threat to the health of the community and to those who are the most vulnerable, such as the elderly and the poor. For this reason, and as a result of strong lobbying by the AMA, the government chose to put off the inevitable by introducing the moratorium for 18 months. Depending on the outcome of the government medical indemnity panel, which is due to report on 10 December—after 18 months—doctors will be required to recommence payments in accordance with the original calculations, except that the amount of the outstanding IBNR liability will be recalculated yearly to incorporate changes that may affect the outstanding liability, such as tort law reform.
We think the government's handling of the insurance crisis has been ad hoc and reactionary, to say the least, and the quick change of a few ministers and the 18-month moratorium are testimony to that. In fact, much of the handling of the insurance crisis has been reactionary, including the response by state governments, which enacted a flurry of tort law reforms without knowing the true nature of the claim problems and, thus, benefits it would produce. While the Democrats are supportive of this bill, we would like to emphasise the importance of other health professionals who have been completely overlooked by the government during the insurance crisis. I acknowledge that the medical profession play an essential role in the community; however, I am sure that midwives, who would have appreciated a fraction of the assistance afforded to UMP and the AMA during the insurance crisis, also play an essential role. In fact, a fraction of the assistance was all that midwives had been asking for—yet, unfortunately for them, for those who used their services and for the nation's mothers, their request fell on deaf ears.
As the Australian Democrats have highlighted on a number of occasions, midwives continue to face many difficulties in securing appropriate insurance for their work, which is affecting the levels of services available for expectant mothers. Also, despite the fact that the supply of midwives is only two-thirds of the demand, midwifery education is at risk when universities are unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance for their students. Universities in Victoria and South Australia claim that the demand for midwifery courses was high, but with 1,500 applications for 120 places they lacked sufficient funds to expand those courses to meet student demand.
The World Health Organisation has highlighted that midwives are the most appropriate and cost-effective carers to be assigned to healthy women during normal pregnancy and birth. It is very disappointing that not only are they overlooked by the government in terms of insurance cover but their contribution is not acknowledged in the government's health or higher education packages. This failure is a disappointment to the Democrats but, more importantly, it is a disappointment to the 250,000 women in Australia who rely on the work of midwives when they bring children into the world. I think that, in some ways, there is a moral hazard associated with insurance, such that if insurance is cheap then why worry about doing things better if we can buy our way out of the problem? We must be mindful of this, and an appropriate balance must be reached with regard to reforms during any so-called insurance crisis.  
While risk management has been one of those jargon terms that many people have used in recent years, with very cheap insurance over the years there has been very little incentive to implement these kinds of strategies. That is why we need to take stock of the last few years and start focusing on how we can do things better, and this applies across the board to all professionals, including the medical profession.
I think that the prevention of accidents is an important issue that has rarely been highlighted since the insurance crisis began. Since the collapse of HIH and UMP, so much concentration has gone into arguing about rising claim costs and becoming an increasingly litigious society. But, arguably, while community expectations and standards may have changed over the years and people are becoming more willing to make claims, it is just as plausible that there has been an increase in the number of negligent acts causing injury for which someone is liable, and this matter has to be addressed by all governments.
To conclude, as I have said, the Democrats are supportive of the bills before the Senate. However, the community cannot any longer afford the same ad hoc and sporadic solutions to the insurance crisis that have characterised the government's approach so far. We await the outcome of the panel discussion on 10 December and hope that an appropriate solution can be reached that considers not only the ongoing viability of the medical profession but the safety, health and purse strings of the community.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-11-28,"—Labor supports the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. Nuclear weapons have for decades been both the symbol and the substance of our greatest fears. The questions of nuclear disarmament, nuclear weapons control and nuclear weapons proliferation have thus been among the very foremost of questions that affect our society. The Australian Labor Party has a long and proud history of commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The Whitlam, Hawke and Keating governments made a foreign policy priority of pursuing non-proliferation, disarmament and the banning of nuclear tests. At a time when it seemed all too possible that the conflict between great conflicting ideologies could lead to a war which would consume and annihilate the earth, Australia helped take the lead in fighting to eliminate these weapons, with their vast destructive capacity. The determined and rational opposition to the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons, shown by countries such as Australia, was crucial in reducing the global temperature and the threat of war.  
We are, again, faced with the possibility of the use of weapons of mass destruction. Our nightmares are no longer those of the Cold War. Instead of fearing the militarism of Cold War generals, we dread the fanaticism of those who see the world as divided between the faithful and pagan—the saved and the damned. We live in a new era where small states, such as India, Pakistan and, most alarmingly, North Korea, possess nuclear weapons. We live in an era where we must be alert to the possibility that the next nuclear threat will not come from a nation but from an individual. The potential for the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by terrorist organisations is our newest nightmare. It is consequently vital to ensure the security of nuclear facilities and nuclear material in Australia. It is also consequently vital to continue to work towards the complete elimination of weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear weapons. 
The Howard government has failed on the second front. We must note that one of the first things that John Howard did in this area, in his very first year as Prime Minister, was to fail to support the report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons and its phased program of disarmament. Indeed, since the election of the Howard government in 1996, Australia has ceased to be an international leader in nuclear non-proliferation. Neither non-proliferation nor disarmament have been priorities for the Howard government. Indeed, even now, genuine non-proliferation is not part of the debate. We have no news of John Howard picking up the phone to his great mate George Bush and suggesting that the USA sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
Australia undertook to provide 20 monitoring stations to detect nuclear testing; yet, five years after the treaty entered into force, in January 2001 only three were ready. In October of this year the government voted against the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons at the United Nations. The USA wants to reserve its options. In contrast, Labor believe that we must all strive to completely eliminate nuclear weapons from the world. Labor believe there is no justification for the possession of nuclear weapons. Labor believe there are no circumstances which render their use acceptable. We will continue to urge the Howard government to meet its obligations to the citizens of Australia by working to end the age of nuclear weapons.
The Australian Labor Party will continue to work towards international, multilateral, universal nuclear disarmament. No goal short of that can protect the citizens of Australia or the citizens of the world. However, we do welcome these belated steps by the Howard government to meet Australia's international obligations in ensuring the security of nuclear facilities and nuclear material. The legislation before the Senate today goes a small distance to meeting Australia's obligations as a world citizen. In seeking to further safeguard Australia's nuclear facilities and nuclear resources it can be said, as far as the domestic and non-state actors are concerned, at any rate, to be concerned for non-proliferation.
Australia has a specific responsibility through the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, to protect information that, in the cases of unintended disclosure, may compromise nuclear materials and facilities. The government has had nearly four years to align its domestic legislation with the requirements under the 1999 IAEA standard. The fact that the government is doing so only now is in itself of concern. The proposed amendments seek to strengthen the physical security of nuclear material and facilities in Australia in conformity with Australia's responsibilities as an IAEA member state. 
In order, these are the principal amendments under schedule 1. First, proposed section 25A of the safeguards act would make it a criminal offence to breach the duty to ensure the physical security of material and information that could be used for either nuclear weapons or any other device that could produce a nuclear explosion. This relates to the professional responsibilities of staff at Australia's nuclear facilities. Second, proposed section 26A of the safeguards act would make it a criminal offence to communicate information which could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item. The offence would apply to a person who communicated information to someone else in circumstances where the communication could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or an associated item. Third, proposed section 31A of the safeguards act would make it an offence to enter without authorisation an area to which access is restricted under the act. The area must be clearly signposted to indicate that access is restricted. The offence is one of strict liability, meaning the onus is on the person charged with the offence to establish that there was an honest and reasonable mistake of fact to avoid prosecution.
This amendment bill is broken into three separate schedules. Schedule 1 proposes to create a number of offences surrounding the physical security of nuclear material within Australia. Schedule 2 deals with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998. It repeals section 2 of the CTBT Act and replaces it with provisions that permit parts of the act to be brought into force at the point when all 44 nuclear declared states ratify the CTBT. Schedule 3 deals with technical amendments to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 so that each of the acts administered by ASNO, the Australian Safeguards and Non-proliferation Office, consistently applies the same name for the administrating office. As it currently stands, each of the acts adopts a separate name for the office which implements each act. As a consequence, each act also adopts a different title for the director of that office. The amendment bill is also intended to allow for the practical naming arrangements under the ASNO umbrella to be referred to by a name or title specified by the minister by gazette.
We see that the general thrust of schedules 2 and 3 are non-problematic in their suggested amendments. We have had some concerns in relation to the impact of the proposed amendments in schedule 1. However, I am pleased that the government has agreed to changes to the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 which address and resolve those concerns we hold about schedule 1. Schedule 1 creates a new class of offences which we accept are intended to protect nuclear material and information that might compromise the security of nuclear material. There is no question that the government must take steps to meet its responsibilities to Australian citizens in terms of their safety and security, but the government must also safeguard the civil liberties and political rights of Australian citizens.
The scope of new section 26A, regarding the proposed offence of communicating information that could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material or associated items, has been the subject of some concern. When the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee considered this legislation—and I was there for part of that hearing—a number of submissions and witnesses, particularly from non-government organisations concerned with environmental campaigning and consequently antinuclear campaigning, expressed concern that new section 26A could encompass both legitimate protest activity and the acts of whistleblowers. It is obviously critical in any strengthening of the security around our nuclear facilities and nuclear resources that our civil rights as Australians and our democratic traditions which permit peaceful protest are not infringed. It is clearly also vital that persons working within the industry must be able to expose corruption, unsafe work practices and other serious problems if they do in fact exist. 
The government has been of the view that, because of the implied inclusion of the principles of recklessness and intent through the application of the Criminal Code as the default mechanism for interpretation, legitimate protest activity and the communication of legitimate protest information would not be at risk of being inadvertently scooped up by new section 26A. However, we in the opposition are of the view that the tests of recklessness and intent must be clear.
We suggested to the government that a note be inserted stating that section 26A is not intended to displace the requirements of recklessness or intention which are defined in division 5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. This note, I believe, has been inserted into the explanatory memorandum. That will make the inclusion of the principles of recklessness and intent clear rather than merely implied. We also suggested to the government that at the beginning of section 26A(1)(b) the words `the person knows that' be inserted so that the section would then read:
The person knows that the communication could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material, or an associated item, to which Part II applies.
Again, this change will clarify the application of the Criminal Code in these cases. We are pleased that the government has accepted our argument and agreed to those changes. They mean that the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 balances the need to protect Australia's nuclear facilities and nuclear resources with the need to protect Australia's democratic heritage of legitimate and robust protest activity.
Of course we must be mindful that the security of Australian facilities is only one small part of the challenge of non-proliferation. We look to the Korean peninsula, the Indian subcontinent and prospectively to Iran as well. Responsible governments around the world must rise to meet the foreign policy challenges posed by these flashpoints. Responsible governments must also rise to the challenge of international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction at a time of international tension.
Nuclear weapons control and nuclear weapons non-proliferation are crucial to regional and global security. Labor governments have a proud history of providing strong leadership on these questions. I urge the Howard government to stop being strong only on rhetoric but weak on action and implementation. I urge the Howard government to confront the policy challenges posed by the possession of weapons of mass destruction by many nations, some of them our allies, throughout the world.
The uncertain security climate Australia and indeed the world face today make the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and indeed of all weapons of mass destruction a fundamental part of our quest for long-term global peace and security. While these amendments to the safeguards act are welcome and overdue and, with Labor's changes, the bill balances security and liberty, we call on the Howard government to go further and meet all of its obligations to protect the Australian people. Non-proliferation is not merely a domestic agenda. Our security cannot be sought in isolation from the world. I commend the bill to the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>NON-PROLIFERATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-11-28,"—The Democrats have opposed the use and the development of nuclear materials and facilities for non-medical purposes in Australia for a very long time. We are strong supporters of international efforts to prevent the proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons and indeed of the need to see nuclear weapons eliminated entirely. Nuclear weapons are immoral and illegal weapons of mass destruction.
The Democrats are acutely aware of the importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty—CTBT—the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the agreement between Australia and the International Atomic Energy Agency for application of safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the efforts to control the use and development of nuclear weapons. We are also conscious of the role the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 plays in protecting nuclear materials and facilities and implementing non-proliferation safeguards in Australia. These international agreements and the NNPS Act have so far played a very important role in controlling the spread and testing of nuclear weapons.
It is, however, a great pity that this government has not been able to do more to push the nuclear weapons states to disarm, particularly the United States, who this week passed legislation and a $400 billion or so budget that will actually see the development of new nuclear weapons. Like this bill, it is being done in the name of the threat of terrorism. The United States has refused to sign the CTBT and ratify the NPT, and our government refuses to publicly criticise the US for not doing so. Instead of putting up a bill that wants to restrict the rights of protestors, we think our government should be getting together with the New Agenda Coalition and supporting its resolution that says:
... that nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament are mutually reinforcing processes and that a fundamental pre-requisite for promoting nuclear non-proliferation is continuous irreversible progress in nuclear arms reductions ...
But the government does not, because it is easier for it to pretend that it is using its influence on nuclear weapons states, particularly the US, through polite diplomatic gestures and joining them in what has been an illegal war against Iraq. Our government keeps saying that the NAC—the New Agenda Coalition—resolutions are unrealistic. In other words, Australia has given in on what in the early 1990s were very strong convictions and a willingness to push nuclear weapons states to disarm. I quote Mr Gareth Evans, who argued that the nuclear weapons states should:
... within a reasonable time frame take systematic action to eliminate completely all nuclear weapons.
At the United Nations First Committee on Disarmament and International Security meeting this month, Australia's representative said:
It is simply not possible to conceive of a world free of nuclear weapons in the absence of complete and permanent assurances of nuclear non-proliferation.
This is simply playing the nuclear weapons state game of chicken and egg. In other words, we will not disarm—in fact, we will build our capacity—as long as other countries like Korea and Iran threaten to take up nuclear weapons. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in September this year: 
Unless we are moving steadily toward nuclear disarmament, I'm afraid that the alternative is that we'll have scores of countries with nuclear weapons and that's an absolute recipe for self-destruction.
The government claims that the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is designed to improve the arrangements for the application of non-proliferation safeguards and protection of nuclear materials and facilities. In this regard, the explanatory memorandum for the bill states:
The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill (Bill) strengthens Australia's arrangements for the protection of, and application of non-proliferation safeguards to, nuclear material, facilities and associated information. It will enable Australia to bring into force legislation banning nuclear weapon tests ahead of entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). It provides also for machinery changes to improve the application of non-proliferation measures.
As a general principle, the Democrats are extremely supportive of moves to improve the domestic arrangements for the protection of nuclear materials and facilities and information concerning nuclear materials and facilities. Indeed, we would like to see the phase-out of all non-medical uses of nuclear material and the closure of Australia's nuclear mines. Our nuclear facilities pose an unacceptable risk to public health and the environment. They also pose an inequitable burden on future generations.
The recent incident involving the French immigrant is a stark reminder of the threat that our existing nuclear facilities pose to community safety. Furthermore, it is unacceptable that Australia mines and exports uranium that can be used to create similar problems in other countries. However, if Australia is going to have nuclear facilities, the Australian Democrats are supportive of measures to ensure their safety. Yet, in seeking to ensure greater protection for nuclear materials and facilities and in responding to the increased risk of terrorism, we think that the government is targeting the wrong groups and violating democratic values that form the bedrock of Australian society.
There are several provisions in this bill that infringe upon those values. These provisions relate to the protection of associated technology, the communication of information that could prejudice the physical security of nuclear materials or associated items and trespassing on property that contains nuclear materials or associated items. Apart from these provisions, which are contained in schedule 1, the bill will improve the existing arrangements for the regulation and control of the use and development of nuclear materials and facilities in Australia. We support the inclusion of a requirement to obtain a permit to establish a nuclear facility, a facility for carrying out nuclear activities or a facility for the use of associated equipment. We strongly support the amendment in this bill of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 to enable the proclamation of key provisions of the act prior to the CTBT coming into force.
Before briefly discussing the provisions of the bill that should be excluded, I wish to note the appalling lack of public consultation that has occurred in relation to this bill. It is an issue that was brought out in the Democrat initiated Senate committee inquiry into the bill. The government seems willing to engage in consultation when it intends to introduce laws that would affect a particular industry, but not when it proposes to severely curtail democratic rights. Clearly, one of the primary aims of this bill is to restrict protest activities that highlight the government's failure to address important environmental issues concerning Australia's nuclear policies. However, not one environment group was consulted prior to the tabling of the bill in the parliament; nor were any Indigenous groups consulted who might have had concerns about nuclear or uranium issues. We think this is unacceptable. 
I will turn to the provisions of the bill that we oppose. The most important of these are found in schedule 1, items 21, 26 and 45. They are proposed sections 25A, 26A and 31A. Firstly, proposed section 25A will create an offence for failing to ensure the security of associated technology—which, broadly, is a document containing information that is applicable to the design or production of a nuclear weapon. We think there are three problems with this provision. Firstly, it could result in the imposition of criminal liability in unreasonable circumstances because it focuses on the failure to `ensure the physical security of the associated technology' rather than the deliberate communication of information.
Secondly, this provision will provide a clamp on whistleblowers. There is a need for restrictions on the disclosure of information that could expose nuclear facilities to attack or that could lead to the construction of a bomb. However, there must also be appropriate channels for employees who work in these facilities to report problems, particularly where those problems have a bearing on public safety. At present, these channels do not exist and this provision will serve to further intimidate people who are thinking of disclosing information for legitimate purposes.
Thirdly, section 26 of the act already contains sufficient restrictions on the disclosure of associated technology. However, section 26 contains two safeguards to prevent it from applying in inappropriate circumstances; namely, it applies only to the communication of information, as opposed to conduct associated with the failure to ensure the physical security of something, and it contains a reasonable excuse defence. Proposed section 25A goes beyond these, and there is no reasonable excuse defence at all.
Proposed section 26A suffers from a similar flaw, only the problems with this section are even worse than those associated with proposed section 25A. This section provides:
(1)	A person commits an offence if:
	(a)	the person communicates information to someone else; and
	(b)	the communication could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material, or an associated item, to which Part II applies.
This provision is ridiculously broad and appears to be specifically designed to curtail the activities of protesters and other citizens who are opposed to this government's policies on nuclear material.
There are four points to make about this. Firstly, as stated earlier, section 26 already provides an adequate safeguard against the disclosure of information that could be used to make a bomb or for other terrorist purposes. Secondly, there are adequate laws, including section 26, that cover the situation where a person discloses information concerning the physical location or the security of nuclear materials. For example, if a person discloses information to terrorists about the location of materials at Lucas Heights that could be used to make a bomb then they would be guilty of either conspiring to or being complicit in committing a terrorist act or murder. It is also likely that they would be guilty of contravening section 26 of the act. 
Thirdly, owing to the breadth of the definitions of `nuclear material' and `associated item', it is likely that this provision will apply to a wide range of activities associated with nuclear issues. However, many of these activities have no bearing whatsoever on national security and are not in any way related to materials that could be used to make a bomb. For example, it will apply to uranium mining and milling. How on earth could disclosing information about uranium mining have a direct bearing on national security? A person would need a reactor and an advanced laboratory to enrich material from the mine to a point where it could be used in a bomb.
Fourthly, this provision is appallingly drafted and leaves far too much scope for the imposition of criminal liability in inappropriate circumstances. The most striking example of this is the phrase `could prejudice the physical security of nuclear material'. What does that mean? Again, the operation of the Criminal Code would assist in reducing the chances of a person being convicted of an offence in an inappropriate circumstance. However, owing to the problems discussed earlier, it will not eliminate them. A protester who discloses details of a uranium mine could still be placed behind bars under this provision.
The final provision we oppose is proposed section 31, which creates an offence of entering into an area or onto a vessel that is marked as a restricted area. As with proposed sections 25A and 26A, there does not appear to be any valid reason for the enactment of this provision. There are already sufficient laws that prevent the unauthorised entry onto Commonwealth land containing nuclear materials that could be used to make a bomb. For example, a person who entered the Lucas Heights facility without appropriate authorisation is likely to be guilty of breaching section 89 of the Crimes Act 1914, which prohibits unauthorised entry onto prohibited Commonwealth land. There are also satisfactory laws to capture circumstances where a person enters a property with the intention of obtaining nuclear materials for use in a nuclear weapon, or to sabotage a nuclear facility or to hijack or sabotage a vehicle, aircraft or ship containing nuclear materials. For example, a person who enters a ship carrying nuclear materials with the intention of stealing that material or blowing it up could be guilty of breaching the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act, the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Act 1992, the Criminal Code Act 1995, and numerous other laws of the states and territories.
So if there are already sufficient laws to ensure the safety of nuclear materials that are a genuine security risk, we would ask what is the purpose of this provision. The only plausible answer is that it is aimed at ensuring the capacity for protesters who enter uranium mines or who climb on vehicles carrying radioactive waste to be convicted of breaching a Commonwealth law and to hurl them behind bars. At present, protesters who trespass on uranium mines or on vehicles carrying radioactive waste are usually only able to be prosecuted under state laws rather than Commonwealth. It must also be emphasised that civil remedies are available in these circumstances to protect the rights of the owner and operator of the mine or the vehicle. This provision will ensure that there is a broad Commonwealth offence under which to capture a wide range of protesters who engage in rigorous protests.
This is not about national security or about real security risk; it is about intimidating protesters. I must emphasise at this point that the Democrats do not support illegal protest activities. Protesters have an obligation to abide by the laws when expressing their opinions and opposing nuclear activities. However, a protester who thoughtlessly engages in an illegal activity that has no bearing on community safety or national security should not be imprisoned. There is nothing to be gained by doing this, other than to stymie public debate and to destroy the life of the protester. 
If the government were really serious about protecting the Australian public and the environment from the effects of radioactive materials, it would close Lucas Heights and shut down our uranium mines. Accepting that the government is not willing to do this, a step in the right direction would be to ensure that the Commonwealth cannot stand over the states and territories and force them to accept Commonwealth nuclear facilities in their jurisdiction without their consent. As we saw with the proposal to establish a dump in South Australia, the willingness of the Commonwealth to force nuclear facilities on a state can lead to considerable conflict. In turn, this leads to wasted resources and inappropriate planning. A more appropriate procedure would be to ensure that the Commonwealth has the consent of the relevant state or territory before they decide to place a nuclear facility in their backyard.
States and territories should also be required to give their consent before the Commonwealth decides to transport radioactive waste through their jurisdiction. Furthermore, the states and territories should also be permitted to subject Commonwealth activities concerning nuclear facilities to state and territory environment and planning laws. This would reduce conflict, enable a more orderly planning process and better guarantee environmental and public safety outcomes.
Accordingly, the Democrats will be moving amendments to this bill that do three things. Firstly, they will prevent the construction and operation of a controlled facility, which includes a nuclear reactor and a nuclear waste dump, by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth contractor in a state or self-governing territory without the written consent of the relevant state or territory. Secondly, they will prevent the transportation of a controlled material, which includes nuclear waste or controlled apparatus, into or through a state or self-governing territory without the written consent of that state or territory. Thirdly, they will repeal section 83 of the ARPANS Act, which currently excludes the operation of prescribed state laws to activities authorised under the act. We firmly believe that these amendments will make a valuable contribution to improving the regulation of nuclear facilities.",SENATE,<title>NON-PROLIFERATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-11-28,"—The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 seeks to amend two different acts: (1) the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act and (2) the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act. In a strategy that is becoming commonplace for the Howard government, the parliament is being placed in the vexed position of having to accept objectionable measures in order to ensure the passage of important measures that have cross-party support. Neither the government nor its officials have advanced any policy reason for linking domestic and international issues in this bill. The Greens object to the government tying widely supported measures to implement the comprehensive test ban treaty in Australian law with security measures that have serious implications for civil liberties. This political tactic undermines the parliament's ability to legislate widely supported measures by linking them to excessive security measures that fail to guarantee proper protection for citizens' rights.
The Greens believe it is time for the government to end this negative, divisive and counterproductive approach to law-making and to abandon its apparent preparedness to trample all over legitimate civil and political rights of Australians in an ill-conceived campaign for political advantage. The Greens support the measures in this bill to implement the goals of the comprehensive test ban treaty, and we oppose the measures that hinder the right to campaign and protest about nuclear matters in Australia, including the disclosure of material by whistleblowers. For this reason, I will be moving an amendment to split the bill so that the Senate can support the test ban treaty clauses and refer the other matters to a thorough public inquiry. 
The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee examined this bill in what can only be described as a farcical time frame for public consultation—just 22 days for the entire process of calling for submissions, receiving submissions, having a public hearing and then writing a report. The public hearing was just two hours long. After this rushed process, one may have thought that there was a rush to get this bill in but, for 2½ months—after the rushed process—the government did nothing to proceed with this bill, until today. The Greens believe that measures such as those proposed, with significant implications for public disclosure and the right to campaign against the nuclear industry, deserve far greater scrutiny than the inquiry time frame permitted.
The Greens support schedules 2 and 3 of this bill, which give effect to Australia's international undertakings to support the comprehensive test ban treaty. The Greens oppose the possession of nuclear weapons and the testing of them. Such weapons serve to make our world insecure—not the reverse, which is often claimed by those nations that hold or seek to procure such weapons. We only need to look to the tensions that have emerged recently with North Korea, which aspires to become a nuclear power, or to the illegal war on Iraq, fought supposedly in search of weapons of mass destruction, to see how detrimental to the security and peace of all peoples is the procurement of weapons that have the capacity to kill on such a grand scale. Testing of nuclear weapons is unnecessary unless there is a desire to leave open the option of using these nuclear weapons. Testing therefore contributes to insecurity, as well as causing grave environmental damage and risks to the health of people, yet the United States Senate has still not ratified the comprehensive test ban treaty and the US President, George Bush, has publicly opposed the treaty, even hinting that the United States may resume testing in defiance of the will of the international community and its own moratorium that has been in place for a decade.
The Bush administration's obstinacy on this issue has already had repercussions, with China and Iran withdrawing their involvement in monitoring nuclear tests in protest against the actions of the United States. The funds spent on producing and testing nuclear weapons could be far better employed in addressing a whole range of different issues—poverty, illiteracy, preventing illness and disease, and homelessness and hunger. There is no shortage of worthwhile recipients of the billions of dollars that the world wastes each year on the armaments race.
As a party founded on the principles of peace and non-violence, the Greens are happy to support schedules 2 and 3 of this bill. However, we are concerned about a number of provisions in schedule 1. We believe they strike the wrong balance between protecting the public and the environment from threats against nuclear material and installations and the legitimate right of free speech—in this case, to campaign against the nuclear industry—and the role of whistleblowers, who disclose vital information to the public about the industry. 
Schedule 1 of the bill creates new offences under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act, including a penalty of two years imprisonment for communicating information which prejudices the physical security of nuclear material and/or associated items. Mr Leask, the Assistant Secretary to the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs, told the committee during the two-hour inquiry:
An example of prejudicing the physical security of transport would be revelation of the route, the timing and the type and nature of the vehicle—
to anyone not authorised to receive that information. I will get to that matter a little later on. Another offence that is contained in schedule 1, for which there is a penalty of six months imprisonment, is that of entering without authorisation an area where nuclear material or associated items are stored or transported. This provision includes a reversal of the burden of proof so that the onus is on the person charged to establish that they should not be charged with the offence rather than our traditional innocent until proven guilty principle. The bill authorises Protective Service officers to arrest without warrant a person whom they suspect of having committed one of these offences. Such proposals are reminiscent of the ASIO legislation that we debated in this chamber a year ago now. More specifically, they are also reminiscent of antiterrorism legislation introduced by Bob Carr in my state of New South Wales, which allows for arrest without warrant.
These proposed new offences have profound consequences for the right to protest and the public right to know about nuclear matters. The government says that these measures are designed to strengthen Australia's arrangements for the protection of nuclear facilities, material and related information so that terrorists cannot have access to them. Clearly, it would be of grave concern were such information or material to fall into the hands of anyone intent on using it to terrorise the community, but I suspect that the six months imprisonment that relates to this offence is a very different approach than we have from this government in relation to terrorism issues. That begs the question about whether this is the true intention behind this legislation.
The Greens are concerned that the wide definitions used in the new offences that this bill creates fail to make provision for legitimate protest activity and exposure of unsafe practices in the nuclear industry. We have seen the government adopt this approach before with the ASIO legislation, evoking security threats as a justification for unreasonable intrusion on well-established civil liberties and human rights such as innocent until proven guilty. The experience of the ASIO legislation reminds the Greens, and should remind this parliament, that we need to be vigilant in the face of a government prepared to exploit genuine concerns about security for its own political purposes. It is not a requirement under this legislation that a person communicating information intends the information to prejudice the physical security of the nuclear material or associated items. 
Greenpeace Australia Pacific and the Australian Conservation Foundation have expressed concern about the wide ambit of these provisions, in particular their potential to unreasonably constrain the right to protest and impose heavy punishment on those people who make information available to the public. At the committee hearings, Mr Leask told the committee that whistleblowers raising safety issues `should not be caught by the new offences'. Nor would the bill have any impact on what he described as `lawful, legitimate protest'. But, in further evidence, it became apparent that the offences are designed to curtail protest activity and that they could curtail exposure of information that the public has the right to know. I go back to the comment that Mr Leask made earlier about an example being the revelation of the route. Another example: if someone were to reveal details about poor security arrangements at the Lucas Heights site, they could be imprisoned under the provisions of the bill. This came out in the Hansard of that committee inquiry as well. 
Antinuclear campaigners and local governments are currently engaged, with state governments as well, in a campaign against the transportation of nuclear waste from Lucas Heights in southern Sydney across the state to the site of a proposed nuclear waste dump in South Australia, where there is also a strong campaign against the waste dump. The campaign around the transportation of this material includes publicising the possible routes of trucks conveying radioactive waste. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the public inquiry on this bill said that revelation of the route of nuclear waste would not be caught by this bill, but the transport of spent fuel would. Both these items are transported through communities in New South Wales, coming from Lucas Heights, and nuclear campaigners and antinuclear campaigners will not always know which precise items are on which precise truck, especially if information flows are further tightened by restrictive legislation, such as is being proposed today. According to the New South Wales Minister for the Environment, Bob Debus:
... there is an absolute necessity for the community of this State and especially the community along any possible transportation route to be given proper and full information or an opportunity for transparent discussion and the opportunity for political response to such proposals. 
Numerous New South Wales local councils have stated their opposition to the transport of nuclear waste through their communities, including Broken Hill, Narromine, Nyngan, Cobar, Dubbo, Cobbon, Orange, Bathurst, Lithgow, Blue Mountains, Gundagai, Hay, Holroyd, Narrandera, Liverpool, Parramatta and Campbelltown. Seventeen mayors along the proposed transport route stated:
Given the failure of the Commonwealth to satisfy the issues of safety of transportation of nuclear waste including wastes from the Lucas Heights reactor, the Group of Mayors oppose the transport of nuclear waste on NSW roads on any route through NSW local government areas ...
The mayors noted the `failure of the Commonwealth to satisfy the issues of safety of transportation of nuclear waste' and the `failure of the Commonwealth to comprehensively consult local government and communities along the route'. Australians have a right to know that their federal and state governments are facilitating this transportation of hazardous waste through their communities; yet, under this bill, the publication of the route of nuclear material could become an offence under proposed section 26A, punishable by six months imprisonment.
The concerns that the Greens have about the implications for this bill for whistleblowers are not abstract. The Australian Conservation Foundation reminded the committee that, earlier this year, information about significant construction errors that had occurred at the new reactor being built at Lucas Heights were made public by a whistleblower who provided the information to a journalist. The errors concerned the drilling of holes in the wrong place in the reactor's main tank—the primary safety system. Clearly this had the potential to threaten public health, and the revelation prompted a review by ARPANSA. The recent Senate inquiry into uranium mining in Australia was also sparked off by revelations from whistleblowers who had been engaged in this process. Disclosure of information in the public interest and protests to draw attention to dangerous practices, such as the transporting of nuclear material through settled areas, is as much an essential part of efforts to address nuclear security as the development and implementation of international treaties. 
It is communities of people who live with the threat of serious injury or death from a nuclear incident who have a legitimate interest in safety issues. Yet this bill discourages public scrutiny and debate—activities that are critical to improving the performance of Australia's nuclear and uranium mining industry. Of course, one of the surest ways to reduce the threat of terrorists using nuclear material is not to produce it. But, instead of ending uranium production in Australia, the Howard government has given the industry the green light—apparently unconcerned about the implications for human and environmental health. And, of course, we have research being conducted in Australia on ways to enrich uranium at a lower cost. This work is being undertaken by Silex Systems Pty Ltd on land leased from the Australian government at Lucas Heights. Their purported goal is to make nuclear power production cheaper, but the Greens say the world should abandon nuclear power generation—a goal that is not only desirable but feasible, as exemplified by Germany, which has commenced a program of closing its reactors.
The work of Silex has been conducted away from public scrutiny. It became apparent in the committee hearing that the government wants to keep it that way. Mr Leask referred to Silex in giving an example of associated items and associated technologies to which this bill extends the scope of the safeguards act. Silex Systems Ltd is a subsidiary of an Australian publicly listed company, Sonic Healthcare Ltd, which commenced work under an agreement with the world's largest supplier of enriched uranium, the United States Enrichment Corporation. That agreement has since ended, but Silex continues its work far from public scrutiny.
Enriched uranium is used in nuclear power plants and to make nuclear weapons. The Greens and others believe the world needs neither of these dangerous things. Silex says that its work is solely directed at enrichment for nuclear power, but enriched uranium has the potential, in willing hands, to be used for nuclear weapons. With this bill, the government seeks to impose prison terms on someone exposing unsafe practices in the nuclear and uranium mining industries, while it continues to permit experimentation in a technology that would make a dangerous material cheaper to produce. The contradiction has not escaped the Greens.
Given our concerns about the bill, we are proposing that schedule 1 be referred back to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for a more thorough examination of the implications of the changes affecting the right to protest and the communication of information that is in the public interest. Our proposal is in accord with the views of the Labor members who sat on the first committee, who recommended that the matters in schedule 1 be dealt with in separate legislation. Labor has proposed a minor change to one provision, 26A, which I understand the government has agreed to support. We do not believe that this change is adequate, and neither did the Labor members of the committee who looked at this bill.
We recognise that there are legitimate concerns about nuclear material falling into the hands of people who wish to use it for the purpose of threatening or actually causing harm. However, we believe that the amendments in the bill will unreasonably restrict the right to protest about nuclear matters and the right of the community to know about such matters. Our proposal will not delay the non-contentious segments of this bill, which the Greens wish to support. I move: 
Omit all words after “That”, substitute:
	“(a)	the Senate condemns the Government's attempts to curtail the right to protest against the nuclear industry and to increase penalties for whistleblowers in the industry; and
	(b)	given the serious public safety issues raised by this bill, Schedule 1 of the bill is referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 3 May 2004”.",SENATE,<title>NON-PROLIFERATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-11-28,"—I table a correction to the explanatory memorandum relating to this bill. I know it is not my area of expertise, but I thought I might make a slightly longer speech than simply tabling an amendment to the explanatory memorandum. In Senator Hill's absence, I am taking this bill through. The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 will strengthen Australia's efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The bill will amend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 and the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. It enhances domestic arrangements for the protection of Australia's nuclear facilities, reducing the risk of the proliferation of sensitive materials and information. The bill further underpins Australia's international, legal and treaty obligations and ensures Australia's domestic non-proliferation legislation remains at a high standard.
The government is deeply concerned about the spread of weapons of mass destruction, associated technologies and know-how. It took strong action against the threat of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction and is a key participant in the Proliferation Security Initiative. It has sustained Australia's commitment to the non-proliferation treaties, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Australia has played a key role in non-proliferation bodies, including the IAEA.
International treaties, export controls and other instruments remain critical to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, but the government recognises that further efforts to strengthen domestic protection of proliferation-sensitive materials and information are essential. It is clear that there are few barriers, other than technical and financial ones, to rogue states and groups obtaining WMD related materials and knowledge. Therefore, we must make every effort to deny access to unauthorised persons and protect, to the maximum extent, materials and knowledge which might aid an adversary or place Australians at risk.
The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 improves domestic legislation in three critical areas. Firstly, it strengthens Australia's arrangements for the protection of nuclear facilities, materials and related information and the arrangements for the application of non-proliferation safeguards to them. Secondly, the bill will give legal effect to Australia's actions in support of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty—known as the CTBT—ahead of the treaty's entry into force. The government was instrumental in securing adoption of this treaty by the United Nations General Assembly, having rescued it from the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, which had failed to reach consensus. Under the CTBT, Australia has already established 15 of 20 planned nuclear test monitoring stations. Ten of these stations have already been certified—more than in any other country. All 15 are already providing data to the CTBT's International Data Centre in Vienna. Once the bill's amendments to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 are in place, the government will bring immediately into effect provisions which ban nuclear testing in Australia and any contribution to testing by an Australian citizen anywhere in the world. 
Thirdly, the bill implements changes to the machinery of government, including updating penalties in line with current practice, which will improve the effectiveness of each of the acts affected. The government is conscious of concerns that some new offences listed in the bill, particularly those related to the divulgence of sensitive information and trespass in specified areas, could be applied too broadly. I assure the Senate that this is not the case. The government welcomes the constructive engagement of Labor to further strengthen the bill in this regard. As with all modern legislation, this bill cannot be interpreted without the application of the Criminal Code—that is, part of the Criminal Code Act 1995, which, inter alia, seeks to ensure that criminal offence provisions are constructed, interpreted and enforced in a uniform way by the Commonwealth. The bill's criminal offence provisions are focused, and there is an appropriately high burden of proof required for successful prosecution.
I note that concern has been expressed that this bill will limit the rights of whistleblowers. The relevant proposed section, 26A, is focused on the protection of information which could compromise security arrangements which are clearly vital for the protection of nuclear facilities, materials and the public. The bill does not impact on the right of whistleblowers to report concerns relating to nuclear safety or the management of radioactive sources, which are the regulatory responsibility of state governments and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. Clearly, however, the communication of specific details about security arrangements that could be used to defeat those security arrangements would not be in the public interest. Most people recognise that it would be irresponsible and a possible danger to public safety for a person to publish specific and vital details about security arrangements.
Another concern that has been raised is that the provisions within the bill that deal with unauthorised access to restricted areas could curtail the right of legitimate protest—section 31A. That is not the case. The bill does not limit further the right of protest, as areas likely to be designated under this section are already off-limits to protesters and must be well-defined and clearly marked. However, the bill recognises that some parts of a nuclear facility and some nuclear materials are particularly sensitive, so it increases the penalty for unlawful entry into these sensitive areas, which are designated by a permit requirement. In the government's view, it is essential to ensure that nuclear materials are properly protected against theft, sabotage and terrorist acts. Responsible persons will recognise that their actions should not endanger public or personal safety. There are some places to which access must be tightly controlled.
The government accepts the amendments proposed by Labor. However, the amendments to the bill proposed by the Democrats are unacceptable. First of all, they gut the bill of its real security strengthening measures, leaving essential administrative changes only. Secondly, the proposed amendments listed as `Schedule 4—Transportation of radioactive waste' are likely to interfere with the Commonwealth's responsibilities and operations. In any case, these proposed amendments are unrelated to the purpose of this bill, which deals with the vital issue of non-proliferation. Similarly, the government rejects the frivolous amendment proposed by the Greens, noting that the bill has already been considered by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, and that that committee recommended that the bill should be passed by the Senate in its current form. 
The government is firm on this issue. The bill will strengthen Australia's efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. To this end, all its provisions are necessary and reasonable. It will contribute to efforts to minimise the risk that rogue states or terrorists might access proliferation-sensitive material or information. The bill will do so without impinging on the reasonable rights of all—in particular, the rights of all Australians to freedom of expression and legal protest. The bill is not intended to capture peaceful protests which in the past have been lawful. But governments have a duty to ensure that domestic regulatory frameworks are effective in deterring and meeting possible threats. The Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill will strengthen Australia's protection of proliferation-sensitive material and information. Accordingly, I commend the bill to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-11-28,"—The Maritime Transport Security Bill 2003 is a significant bill for the security of Australians and for the sustainability and stability of our critical international trade. The maritime industry is the linchpin in the import, export and domestic shipping tasks necessary for our economy and jobs. This debate is not just about highly skilled seafarers and waterside workers in a modern Australian fleet but also about the flow-on to support industries like engineering, maritime training, freight forwarding and the like. Labor will support this bill but, in doing so, we take the opportunity to make it crystal clear that we have a very different view on the value of our shipping industry. 
For too long, the Howard government have claimed that Australia is a shipping nation, not a nation of shippers. For too long, they have had their heads in the sand about the importance of shipping to Australia as an industry in its own right. It has been one of the most ideologically driven areas of Howard government policy. There has been a total focus on cheaper shipping costs achieved by busting the unions and sacrificing the Australian industry. The Howard government show their contempt for Australian shipping by refusing to level the playing field.
The Australian Shipowners Association has regularly highlighted 10 pieces of legislation that discriminate against the Australian industry in favour of foreign shipping operators. The single and continuous voyage permits have been manipulated to undermine the legitimate cabotage provisions, which are by no means unique in the world. The United States fiercely protects its domestic coastal trade for security, environment and employment reasons. So too has the Australian parliament endorsed legislation to protect our domestic trade. Those provisions are the cabotage provisions in the Navigation Act.
Labor has continued to identify the security and environmental risks associated with foreign flag vessels and their crew being given unfettered access to Australian coasts and ports. But the Howard government continues to open the door. It was only last year, after years of turning a blind eye to the abuse, that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs took some notice of Labor's calls and placed some restrictions on continuing voyage permits. The situation is still not good enough. The bill before this chamber is about maritime security, but it is only one element of the picture. It makes a good start to putting in place a consistent national and maritime security framework, but the reality is that the stability and sustainability of this industry are also fundamental to our maritime transport security.
The Australian Labor Party and the maritime unions are not lone voices on these matters. The Australian Shipowners Association recently released an independent review of Australian shipping. That review was conducted by two former transport ministers: former National Party minister John Sharp and former Labor Party minister Peter Morris. These former ministers spoke to an extensive cross-section of government and industry players. The foremost priority issue identified by that review was the need for policy clarity. The report states:
If all sectors of the industry are unanimous on any single issue, it is the need for Government to enunciate a clear, certain and consistent policy towards the industry, and for regulatory activities to be carried out in a consistent way.
That review heard concrete evidence from industry players that uncertainty was stifling investment decisions. Specific new and existing projects were at risk, and are at risk as we speak, because the government is not doing its job to provide regulatory certainty. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services should be minded to listen to the findings of his former colleague and predecessor.
The Morris-Sharp review also came to some specific, damning conclusions on security. Conclusion VIII stated: 
The Review notes the apparent inconsistency between the Government's policy for coastal shipping, ie to obtain the cheapest priced shipping services by accessing foreign ships, and its policy of strengthening border protection.
The Review notes measures to be undertaken by the US Government to limit access to its coastline to those vessels and crew from nations regarded as having a high degree of security. The review received evidence that Australia risks losing access to US markets due to the use of foreign flagged vessels and crews that do not have the high degree of security required under their strengthened border protection regime.
That, I stress, is the finding of the review from two former transport ministers, one from the coalition side of politics and one from my side of politics. As we consider this maritime security bill, there are chilling findings and conclusions from extensive discussions Labor has held with Australia's maritime industry players. Also pertinent to this bill is the conclusion and warning of the review in relation to the cost of maritime security:
Evidence was provided confirming that increased security would result in increased costs that will be borne by the shipping task. Australia faces the challenge of remaining competitive, as some competitor's governments will meet all or a portion of the increased security costs. Therefore any new measures would need to be pursued within competitive bounds.
This issue was also brought before the Senate committee.
Australian business and other tiers of government will pull their weight, but it is not acceptable for the Australian government to walk away from all responsibility. The Executive Director of the Association of Australian Ports and Marine Authorities, Mr John Hirst, reminded us in the press that in the United States the federal government had allocated $US1 billion to port authorities to upgrade security. The US government will weigh in the equivalent of $A1.53 billion to batten down the security hatches, and the Australian government will weigh in nothing.
The costs in Australia are not insignificant. The explanatory memorandum advises a conservative estimate. We are informed that the total set-up costs to security related ports, including port facilities within these ports, could be up to $300 million, with ongoing costs of up to $90 million per annum. With the US and other countries subsidising these costs, the level of disadvantage to the Australian industry is high, given that this government is not providing any assistance. To be correct, the government has allocated a sum of $15.6 million over two years for maritime security. It will be spent within the department to put in place a regulatory regime. The Senate committee has agreed that these concerns about costing are reasonable. The committee also suggests the government discuss these funding issues with the states and with the industry.
As I said at the outset, Labor supports this bill. The bill will deliver a national, consistent security framework for the industry. It will enhance maritime transport security in a number of ways. It will establish a maritime transport security regulatory framework, and provide for adequate flexibility within this framework to reflect a changing threat environment. It will implement the mandatory requirements in chapter XI-2—the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code—of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention of 1974 to ensure that Australia is aligned with the international maritime transport security regime. It will ensure that identified Australian ports, port facilities within them and other maritime industry participants operate with approved maritime security plans. It will also ensure that certain types of Australian ships operate with approved ship security plans; issue international ship security certificates to Australian ships which have been security verified so that these ships will be able to enter ports in other SOLAS contracting countries; and use mechanisms to impose control directions on foreign ships that are not compliant with the relevant maritime security requirements in this bill. 
This is a large and complex bill that has had to be finalised in a miraculously short amount of time in response to the events of 11 September. The maritime industry is a global industry. The regulatory regime therefore has also to be a global one. The processes of global rule making have historically been long and protracted. It is a credit to the International Maritime Organisation, its member nations, the industry, the unions and the departmental officers that the ISPS Code and framework enshrined in this bill have reached such an advanced stage in the time frame that has been allowed.
The shadow minister, the member for Batman, has been involved in extensive negotiations with the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to facilitate passage of this bill. We hoped that it would be passed today, but that appears unlikely. To continue to operate in the industry, each operator must have approved security plans and an approved ISSC by 1 July 2004. Labor have been fully cognisant of this deadline and its importance. When the bill passed the House of Representatives, the shadow minister advised of Labor's qualified support for the bill and set out a range of concerns. The Senate committee has extensively reviewed those issues in the bill and the draft regulations. I can advise that the shadow minister, Mr Ferguson, has finalised negotiations with the government to attend to Labor's concerns.
I understand that government amendments will be moved to reflect the outcome of these negotiations. On that basis, I can signal Labor's support for them. The important amendments for Labor are those that address the definition of unlawful interference in maritime security. They are important to Labor. There has been a concern that the bill undermines these established rights. With these amendments to the purpose of the bill and the definition, the bill will now be very clear that this is not the case. When this bill returns to the other place, assuming that it is passed here with those amendments, the shadow minister will outline other understandings reached with the minister to assist passage of this bill and ensure the effective implementation of this new security regime. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-11-28,"—The Democrats recognise the urgency of the Maritime Transport Security Bill 2003 and for this reason we will be supporting the passage of the bill today. The bill introduces at Australian ports new security requirements which are required under the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code under the SOLAS Convention, to which Australia is a signatory. These arrangements must be in place by 1 July 2004. It is necessary to provide the shipping industry and the department with adequate time to implement the necessary arrangements; for that reason, we recognise the urgency for passing the bill.
These provisions were introduced to address international maritime security following the events of 2001. Whilst much attention has focused on aviation security and terrorism in air transport, terrorism at sea and in our ports is also of concern—if not of potentially larger concern—as is the security of shipping containers transported to and from sea ports on land. This bill introduces measures to address those concerns.
It is also the case that international ports may not accept ships arriving from ports which are not compliant with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. Should Australian ports not comply, the implications for foreign trade would be significant to Australia's international trade. As we are all very aware, living on an island continent, we are very dependent on marine shipping for international trade, and indeed for our economic livelihood. 
I note that concerns were raised in the Senate committee regarding the need for ongoing consultation between the department and industry during the implementation of the provisions in the bill. I seek assurances from the minister that this consultation will occur. I note that concerns have been raised by the aviation industry regarding the lack of consultation in relation to the implementation of the aviation security bill, and it concerns me that we have seen lack of consultation in this bill too. When implementing any new regulatory regime or system, the government would be well advised to consult with those affected to ensure that the implementation goes smoothly and that the aims and objectives are achieved. I hope that the department will implement the provisions of this bill with that in mind. The bill in many ways resembles the aviation security bill; as with that bill, the concern has been raised that the bill lacks specificity and that industry participants will lack guidance from the department in implementing the provisions of the bill. Again, as with the aviation legislation, I hope that the department will take active steps to work with industry in this regard.
I note that there are amendments which will be moved in the committee stage and which seek to address some of the other concerns raised during the inquiry of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. These concerns include the need to protect the religious rights and welfare of seafarers. The Democrats will support those amendments.
It is a pity that the Senate has not had more time to consider this bill and to work through some of those issues. I am sure senators are aware that there is currently a large workload before various Senate committees, including the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. The bills have been dealt with in a very tight time frame. However, recognising the importance of the bill in light of our international obligations and potential impacts on international trade, the Democrats will be supporting the legislation.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-11-28,"—Given the time of the day and the time of the week, I seek leave—with permission from the Opposition Whip—to incorporate a speech in which I make some remarks about the Australian Centre for International and Tropical Health and Nutrition at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, in particular the efforts of Professor Brian Kay, and about the awarding of the Ros Bower Award to community art activist Neal Price.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
I want to say something about the great effort being made by Brisbane based researchers in tropical public health and preventive medicine.
I have spoken before about the work done by the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, based in Brisbane.
On this occasion, I want to talk about the public health research undertaken by the Australian Centre for International and Tropical Health and Nutrition at QIMR, a unit that is headed by Professor Brian Kay. 
Public health is concerned with the health of human populations, with the promotion of good health and with the prevention of disease.
In 1986 the Federal Government initiated the Kerr White review, and the Public Health Education and Research Programme (PHERP) was born.
It was a Hawke Government initiative that was good policy and which has more than proved its worth over the succeeding 17 years.
The Master of Public Health degree is the basic qualification for public health professionals.
In 1986, the MPH was taught only at the University of Sydney. But today 20 universities offer the MPH.
This expansion is a direct consequence of PHERP. In consequence Australia now has a strong public health workforce. This needs to be maintained. 
There are still shortfalls in certain key areas such as health economics, biostatistics and biotechnology. We still need to build capacities for the future.
In the public debate on the health care system, public health is often forgotten. It is a cornerstone of maintaining and improving the health of Australians, yet attracts only 2 per cent of the total health budget. 
For this small investment, Australia has one of the best health promotion programmes in the world, a record of food and drug safety that most other developed countries aspire to, and programmes such as the National HIV Strategy have had unparalleled success. 
One of the contributors to Australia's success in public health has been the development of a strong research and education capacity in public health, underwritten by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing. 
Without this support, it is clear that Australia would not have anything like its current capacity.
In the current highly competitive tertiary sector, the basis of University funding is from the Department of Education, Science and Training.
But the funding formula favours large undergraduate classes rather than smaller postgraduate classes and specialist groups in public health.
The simple conclusion is that without PHERP, public health would die.
For example, how do you provide postgraduate students with the necessary field experience, especially in developing countries?
Part of the answer is PHERP. The other is the significant leverage that PHERP funded institutes gain from competitive research grants.
The Howard Government has appropriately identified the importance of prevention and health maintenance as major areas of research if Australia is to meet the challenges of the Intergenerational Report. 
National Health Priorities have been set. 
Moreover, new threats such as SARS and bioterrorism reinforce the need or a strong base for research, education and training in public health.
If we are to support the Prime Minister's `Safeguarding Australia's Health' initiative, we must think of Australia as part of a regional—and global—family.
Not only the health aspects of disease come into play, but also the costs of managing and controlling them in a public health sense. 
SARS, which emerged in late 2002 and became a global problem in 2003, was reported to have cost the Asia-Pacific region something like $190 billion.
So it is no wonder that APEC in August this year recommended stronger working partnerships between the tourism and health sectors. 
In September this year, Access Economics evaluated the Australian medical research sector for the Australian Society of Medical Research.
This evaluation highlighted the remarkable returns achieved on medical research dollars, the high profile of Australian scientists, and observed that Australia commanded 4 per cent of the World Health Organisation's designated Collaborating Centres.
This itself testifies to our great ability in this area of science.
Queensland's geographic position has for a long time given it—and its medical research community—a very practical interest in tropical medicine and tropical preventive health medicine.
The far-sighted collaboration of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research and the University of Queensland in creating the Australian Centre for International and Tropical Health and Nutrition deserves recognition. 
Health and development in low-income countries are overlapping elements of the same problem—88 per cent of the world's low income countries are in the tropics and they contain 95 per cent of the world's low income population.
The World Health Organisation, the World Bank and AusAID are among the global agencies that have recognised the link between health, environment and poverty.
Part of ACITHN's mandate is to help Australia meet its international health obligations in public health.
In this regard I can highlight their status as a WHO Collaborating Centre, their linkage within the regional SEAMEO system, their service on global panels and their networking par excellence to 64 key international institutions.
Some 36 per cent of research students with ACITHN come from overseas.
Both ACITHN partners are also heavily involved in indigenous health. Recently they were part of a successful bid with the Menzies School of Medical Research in Darwin for a Cooperative Research Centre in Aboriginal Health. 
Professor Kay, as director of the Australian Centre for International and Tropical Health and Nutrition and head of the Mosquito Control Laboratory at QIMR, is the architect of world-first eradication of dengue fever mosquitoes in Vietnam.
This effort has, so far, totally protected nearly 400,000 people, especially children, from the potentially fatal form of the disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever, which ravages 46 countries.
A deputy director of the Centre has spearheaded the long-term development of an appropriate health workforce in Papua New Guinea.
The issue of the moment is the sustainability of these efforts, and that comes down, as it always does, to money.
While the NHMRC budget has been doubled under the by the Coalition, the mandate of the NHMRC is not international and tropical health research.
From this perspective, then, support of our international and tropical public health efforts of true national centres such as ACITHN is precarious. 
There are fears that the 2004 future funding review may not take full account of these growing needs because of competing funding priorities at home. 
Australia's investment in PHERP is around $14 million a year for 17 centres.
It is crucial to Australian health, our regional standing—and to regional prosperity and hence ultimately our own security.
The Howard Government made the decision to double the NHMRC budget over a five-year period up to 2005-2006.
This was in recognition of Australia's wonderful record in medical research and the great economic returns it brings.
Our world-class effort in combating and preventing tropical disease also deserves the highest recognition and appropriate funding.
I would like to conclude my remarks in this adjournment speech by making some references to a pleasant duty I performed for the Minister for the Arts and Sport, my colleague Senator Kemp, in Brisbane on Sunday.
On the minister's behalf, I presented the 2003 Ros Bower Award to community art activist Neal Price, executive director of Access Arts Incorporated in New Farm, Brisbane.
Neal Price is a fine recipient of this award, which commemorates Rosalie Bower, who fought so hard to win recognition and funding for community arts.
We proudly claim him as a Queenslander, because like many other Australians, he chose to make our State his home.
He arrived in the 1980s and from 1983 to 1996 was Nursing Artist in Residence at The Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane.
In that job, he initiated and was coordinator of the hospital's creative arts programme for mental health, residential care and physical disabilities.
He developed community festivals, murals, residencies, reminiscence and oral history in the caring context within which he worked.
From 1999 to 2002 he was a board member and deputy chair of the Community Cultural Development Board of the Australia Council for the Arts and this year was a recipient of the Centenary Medal.
Access Arts was chosen to host the first Australian staging of the Asia Pacific Wataboshi Festival, which wound up at the Brisbane Powerhouse on Sunday.
It came to Brisbane, I have no doubt, because of Neal Price's international bridge-building that has been another tremendous element of his life's work.
The Ros Bower Memorial Award was first awarded in 1981.
It was established by the Australia Council's Community Cultural Development Board and the Ros Bower Memorial Trust.
It is designed to recognise distinguished effort in fostering and furthering the philosophies and principles espoused by Rosalie Bower, founding director of the Community Arts Board, the precursor to the CCDB. 
We all know, without even having to think about it, that without community based arts our towns and cities—and even more so, our special communities such as those served so admirably by Neal Price—would be poorer places.
I think we might all agree that art, of whatever genre, is inspired self-expression.
This is something that also has a practical side and it was in that which Ros Bowers succeeded so well.
For evidence that she did we need look no further than the Community Cultural Development Board established to fund the development of community arts, to advise the Federal Government on their value, and to advocate on their behalf.
For evidence that her philosophy has lived on since her death in 1980 we need look no further than the roll-call of winners of the Ros Bower Award—men and women who have shown outstanding dedication and commitment to community cultural development over the past 22 years.
