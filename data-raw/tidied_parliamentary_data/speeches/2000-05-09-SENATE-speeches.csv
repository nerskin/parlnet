"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-05-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) to a question without notice asked by Senator Collins today, relating to the goods and services tax and the housing industry.
I must say that before hearing the answer this action would not have been our intention. The situation with Avonwood Homes, mostly in Victoria, is that some 562 families have had their dreams absolutely squashed. That particular company has $13 million worth of debts. We all, I would have thought, would sympathise with the situation those mostly first home buyers have found themselves in. In addition to Avonwood Homes having $13 million worth of debts, many of their customers now are faced with increased interest rates, none of which was within their control and which was not necessarily within the control of this government. What makes the situation worse is virtually every one of these 562 homes would have been completed before 1 July. Building on them was suspended quite a few weeks ago. And even though there are builders wanting to complete these homes, because of the complexity of the liquidation, because of the fact that Avonwood cannot trade while being insolvent, the alternative arrangements inevitably will mean that those houses will not be completed and the occupants and the owners will not be able to move in until well after 1 July. For them, having all that extra time waiting, paying rent, is an expensive thing. Having all their aspirations tied up in what is the biggest project of their life, having gone through all the concerns about the financial position of Avonwood and whether they would in fact retrieve anything from it, they now are going to have the additional burden of a GST applied to them that would not have otherwise been applied to them but for the failures of this company.
It might have been that a minister with some decency today would have said he would look into the situation. It might have been that some sympathetic words to the plight of these people could have come to us. But what did we get? We got that cynical, bourgeois response from Senator Kemp. He basically could not care less. He said the money is going to come in—that sort of great thing. Where is the compassion from Senator Kemp? We are used to the intellectual torpitude from this minister. We are used to the mumbo jumbo.
—Waffle.
—We are used to the waffle, as Senator Sherry says. We are used to all that. But we would have hoped that deep down beyond all that intellectual torpitude there would have at least remained some empathy with his own constituents, because the majority of these homes are in Victoria. But what did we get? Not one glimmer.
This is a windfall gain for the government. We are not asking the government to forgo normal revenue. This is a $4 million bonus caused by the fact that a building company has gone under, otherwise the government would never have had the money. It is not a precedent setter. It does not go beyond 1 July and have ramifications for a whole range of other industries. This is a one-off situation in which this government could intervene and say they are not going to clip these people for the $4 million-odd extra tax caused by circumstances beyond their control. But what did we get here today when the question from Senator Collins came up? We had cynical interjections from those opposite. How many houses do they represent, these people that interject today in such a cynical way? They have a whole range of investment houses and country properties and country houses. This is not a question of envy—good luck to you—but do not put down those who are buying their first home. Do not put down those that are facing increased interest rates and, through no fault of their own, are going to get slugged with a big tax impost after 1 July. Let us have some sympathy for those people. I will tell you something: sympathy for battlers is not just about winning votes five weeks before the election. Here you have an opportunity to intervene; you will intervene with public support and you will not set a precedent. So get rid of the waffle, get rid of the mumbo jumbo and represent the people that voted you in here.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2000-05-09,"—The Labor opposition continues this perennial attack on the reform of the taxation system which this government has introduced. Senator Ray said it is nothing to do with that. He talked about the GST in relation to homes. Of course it is an attack on tax reform. That has been the standard approach of the opposition to this government ever since this government initiated tax reform, had it endorsed by the Australian people at an election and then proceeded, by way of legislation, to introduce that tax reform. It simply reinforces and reflects the hypocrisy and dishonesty of the Labor Party in their approach to tax reform because they have consistently opposed the government's initiative every inch of the way. They opposed it at the election and were beaten, they opposed the legislation and were beaten in this chamber, and they continue to scaremonger in their opposition to tax reform—they continue that approach.
In the context of that approach they have made no commitment to abolish the goods and services tax; indeed, they have indicated an intention to retain the goods and services tax. But the Leader of the Opposition some months ago proposed a so-called rollback of the goods and services tax. We have not had any details of their proposed rollback, although we have been told subsequently, when the issues arose, by Mr Beazley that he was going to retain a balanced budget or a budget surplus. We have been told that he was going to maintain the revenue promises to the states. As we know, a major part of this tax reform is that it provides a guaranteed revenue stream for the states through the whole of the revenue from the goods and services tax being allocated to states, in an untied way, for them to spend on their needs in relation to services. Mr Beazley said that the states would not have a diminution of their revenue as a result of the GST rollback.
Of course, the consequence of both of those commitments regarding the budget surplus and revenue for the states is that the shortfall has to be made up from some source. And how will the shortfall be made up? Increased income taxes. That is where it is going to come from. We know that only too well. Despite some 60 occasions now on which Mr Beazley has had the opportunity to confirm that there will not be increased income taxes under a Labor government, he has refused to confirm that. The only logical conclusion that you can take from the approach which the Labor Party adopts to these tax issues is that the Australian people will be slugged with significant income tax increases should Labor ever win government again. The Labor Party talk about care and concern. That is the most callous approach that could be adopted by a party seeking government. On the one hand we have got a government that has provided in aggregate $12 billion worth of income tax cuts coming into play on 1 July, yet there is no guarantee from the other side that those income tax cuts will be sustained should there ever be a change of government. So on the one hand in aggregate they are going to retain the GST without having detailed the way in which this promised rollback is going to work. They are going to retain the revenue for the states. They are going to retain a budget surplus. Of course, we know as a consequence of that we are going to have increased income taxes should a Labor government ever—and I stress `ever'—into the future obtain the government benches again.
Of course, we know this because we know Labor's record on tax. We know that after the 1993 election the l-a-w law tax cuts that they had put in place and actually legislated for were withdrawn. Not just a commitment but the actual l-a-w law tax cuts were withdrawn after the 1993 election. More than that, they initiated a massive increase in wholesale sales taxes, again without any compensation being offered to the community for those massive increases and without having put them to the people at an election. That was a decision made after the election, and that is why the community at large know that you simply cannot trust Labor on tax. It was always the understanding that you could not trust Labor with the nation's finances, and we saw that over their years in office, when they escalated our federal government debt to $96 billion from a starting point of $23 billion.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-05-09,"—What a pathetic response from Senator Chapman on behalf of the government and the minister today. It was not only pathetic but also totally irrelevant. Not once in the five minutes that Senator Chapman had did he even mention the name of the company Avonwood. Not once did he mention the plight of the over 100 families that are being affected because of the collapse of this company due to this government's GST policy. Not once did he mention in his speech the issues that were raised in the question by Senator Collins to Senator Kemp. As Senator Ray so clearly pointed out, the issue here is about what this government is going to do to assist those families that have in good faith contracted to have houses built by this company. Because of the impact of the GST the company has gone into liquidation and those houses will now not be completed until at least after the introduction of the GST. As a consequence, those families are going to have to pay for a significantly increased burden, one that they would never have had to pay if their homes had been completed on time.
You really wonder whether Senator Chapman was even here at question time to hear the question and the answer because, as I said, he never addressed the issue once. Then again, I know Senator Chapman was here, and the reason why he did not address the issue in his remarks a moment ago was because he, like every other member of the government, was clearly embarrassed by not only the answer of the minister but also some of the interjections that came from members of the government. I listened closely to Senator Kemp's answer—that was not too difficult, because he never really answers a question anyway—and I also heard some of the interjections. For instance, I heard Senator Macdonald interject and say that this is not a major order item, this is not a front page item. Where was Senator Macdonald last night when the collapse of this building company because of the GST and the predicament of those families in Victoria and in other states was the lead-in item on the 7.30 Report and was a major item on the news last night? Obviously, Senator Macdonald was too busy to even take notice of what is a very important issue as well as a major issue that has been raised yesterday and today. And Senator Hill, who is in the chamber now—
—The government leader.
—The government leader; when the question was asked and it was pointed out in the question that this government would gain a windfall of $4 million because of GST that will be paid that would not have had to have been paid, responded that it was more money for education and health. They were his words. He acknowledges that the government is going to get a windfall from this. But you are going to get a windfall, Senator Hill, from the very battlers who are now going to have to struggle to get their homes completed and pay that increased tax that they would not have had to pay, who are having to pay the increased interest rates that have been introduced that they would not have expected when they entered into their contracts and also find the money to educate their children and afford decent health care for their families. What a cynical response from the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The government will benefit by a $4 million windfall—
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. Misrepresentation must be contrary to the standing orders somewhere. My point of order is, therefore, this is deliberate misrepresentation in that in the question was the suggestion that the government would benefit and I had responded by saying that the people would benefit if the government got more tax, because the GST is being paid out to the states in full to be invested in areas such as health and education.
—There is no point of order.
—It is obvious that this touches a very sensitive nerve.
—What touches a nerve? 
—What touches a nerve is that here we have families that are being affected because of what has happened to this company and because of what is clearly going to happen in the building industry as the impact of this GST bites after 1 July. But this government is not interested in the dreams of people who want to own their own home; this government is only ever interested in raising more and more revenue. As the people know, this GST represents a $30 billion revenue grab by this government. Senator Hill is clearly interested in getting another $4 million windfall out of the battlers, and they should be prepared to make sure they get it back.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2000-05-09,"—  If Senator Forshaw had watched the story on Avonwood on the 7.30 Report last night, he would know that the liquidator was confident that he would be able to find a solution for the home builders and that the majority of the home builders, when they were interviewed by the 7.30 Report, indicated that they were satisfied with the way that the liquidator answered their questions. So most of those houses will be completed. The question is whether these houses, if they are completed after 1 July, will be subject to the GST. The number that has been bandied around is that this would cost an additional $4 million. I am not sure where this figure of $4 million came from. If it came from the receiver, it would be an up-front estimate on their part because nobody knows for certain if these houses will be subject to the GST and nobody knows, if that were to apply, exactly what the amount would be. If you are going to talk about the additional burden caused by the GST, you must also take into account, on balance, the current sales tax burden and other taxation burdens on these new buildings which, with the introduction of the new tax system, will be eliminated. Nobody has done that sort of exercise yet and the figure quoted by the receiver, as is usual in such cases, would be a conservative figure to make sure that he was not wrong. Finally, we should note that, if there were an additional burden, that burden would not exceed $4 million for some 500 houses. What would that come to? It would come to about $8,000 per house, but we should note that that is a maximum figure.
Senator Forshaw made a great play on the fact that Senator Chapman, in his speech in reply, did not mention anything about Avonwood. He took him to task on that. But what that really means is that Senator Chapman actually cut directly to the problem. This whole question of the GST was a furphy raised by Senator Ray. There is no concern on the part of Labor senators about Avonwood or about the people affected by the collapse of this company. Avonwood's collapse is notable only because it is so rare these days. Over the 13 years before this government took over, the collapse of a company was a commonplace occurrence. Nobody would have noticed it if a company had gone to the wall. In the early nineties companies were collapsing left, right and centre and nobody cared—nobody from the then government, anyway. Certainly Senator Carr and Senator Ray did not care. This event is now a matter of importance because it is so rare, but the reality is that the Labor Party are really running out of ideas on what to criticise. The Labor Party have no policy on the GST. They want to keep it because they know that it is a good thing for not only the government but also the country. For political reasons, however, they have to attack it. They have no real grounds to attack it; they can only attach this concern to any other topic that comes along. It is true that the collapse of Avonwood is regrettable, but it is the result of incompetent business practices.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-05-09,"—The point of the question from Senator Collins to the Assistant Treasurer of this country—I emphasise: to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp—was whether or not the government was willing to forgo the windfall GST of approximately $4 million that it will collect as a result of the collapse of the Avonwood company and now apparently of Eastern Park Developments, both housing companies. The government will collect an extra $4 million in GST revenue because the completion date of the houses that the hundreds of families have signed up to will be put back to well after 1 July. We do not know when that completion date will be, but it will certainly be well after 1 July. GST will be collected—up to $4 million in additional GST—by this Liberal government as a consequence of the pushing back of the completion date of the housing contracts. This is $4 million that the Liberal Party would not have collected in GST but for the collapse of these two building firms. 
That was the pointed issue in the question from Senator Collins to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Senator Kemp was asked whether or not the Liberal government would forgo the windfall collection of GST moneys. This is not money that the government would normally have collected in GST moneys. It would not have collected it if these two building companies had not collapsed. What response did we get from Senator Kemp? Senator Kemp does not have an ounce of understanding, sympathy, concern or reassurance for the predicament of the customers of these two collapsed building companies. He does not have an ounce of concern for the families involved with these building companies or indeed for the many subcontractors who, according to reports, are owed amounts of money of between $40,000 and $100,000. He does not take the question on notice to have a look at this particular difficulty or attempt to provide protection from the extra GST grab that the government will make as a result of this building collapse. He does not even make an attempt to look at or examine the particular heartfelt issue that has occurred not just for the families who want their houses built on time but also for the subcontractors.
We had an extraordinarily unsympathetic series of interjections from government senators and from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, who you would have thought would know better. Senator Hill wants the money. He wants the extra GST revenue from these families in this predicament so that the government can spend it elsewhere. You can spend tax revenues in all sorts of areas but to take extra GST revenue in this way from the families and the subcontractors who are suffering this predicament as a result of these two building collapses is absolutely appalling. It is an appalling attitude. It really does show a government totally out of touch on the issue of the impact of the GST on the lives of ordinary families in this country.
What reassurance did Senator Kemp give to the Senate? Senator Kemp says that the families and the subcontractors will get tax cuts after 1 July. That is not a great deal of use to the hundreds of families and subcontractors who either have lost thousands of dollars or will have the completion of their houses, the great Australian dream, put back by many months and have extra GST revenue collected as a result. One other point that I would make is that many of these families will have to rent accommodation for longer periods and they will pay additional GST on the rental. For Senator Chapman to make out that this is an attack on tax reform when the Labor Party is raising the plight of the 900-odd families around Australia, particularly in Victoria and in Queensland—
—What would you do, Nick?
—Well, we have asked the Assistant Treasurer. You are in government. Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, would not even consider waiving the extra GST revenue that will be payable by these families. It is your GST, Senator Abetz. It is your particular problem. You should be honest enough to deal with this particular problem sympathetically rather than laughing in a callous way at the plight of the families and subcontractors who have lost thousands of dollars as a result of this.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2000-05-09,"—On behalf of Senator Gibson and the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit, I present a report on the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 2000-01, and I seek leave to incorporate the report in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The report read as follows—
STATEMENT ON THE DRAFT BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE FOR 2000-2001
In accordance with provisions of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 the Committee is required to make recommendations to both Houses of Parliament and to the Prime Minister on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO).
The Committee, having considered the draft budget estimates for 2000-2001 submitted by the Auditor-General is able to advise Parliament that it is satisfied that the estimates are sufficient to enable the Auditor-General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the Auditor-General Act 1997.  The estimates specifically refer to the provision of assurance audit services, performance audit services and information services.
The 2000-2001 ANAO Budget submission is based on a detailed review of internal and external factors likely to impact upon the ANAO's service delivery and cost of outputs.  The net impact of these factors and other underlying budget assumptions is a 4 per cent increase in employee expenses and an overall increase of 7.8 per cent in the net cost of services in the 2001 financial year.  The total budget allocation being sought for 2000-2001 is  $50.1 million.  The net budget outlay is estimated at $39.3 million after taking account of estimated audit fees of $10.8 million.
The draft estimates indicate a rise in net budget outlays in respect of the ANAO of $4.5 million over the next four years.  This is primarily because the costs associated with attracting and retaining skilled resources, either on a staff or on a contract basis, will rise significantly over this period.  Revenues from audit fees, are expected to remain relatively stable.
The ANAO recognises that the ongoing management and funding of accumulated employee entitlements is an important issue and intends undertaking further analysis to assist in determining both the time and cost involved in reducing the current level of accumulation and the appropriate level of investment required to meet future obligations.  The ongoing issue of the management of leave arrangements will be dealt with in the context of the negotiations relating to the next Certified Agreement.
The Auditor-General told the Committee that in the present difficult market conditions the ANAO had maintained an ongoing  recruitment program.  The greatest challenge currently faced by the Audit Office was to meet the tighter deadlines for audited financial statements imposed under Charter of Budget Honesty legislation.  The ANAO will make greater use of private sector resources as necessary to meet deadlines.
With respect to the ANAO's ability to deliver planned audits listed on the forward performance audit program, the Auditor-General told the Committee that requests for additional audits from Members of Parliament  could not readily be delivered without some adjustment to the level of resources set aside for performance audits.  Any adjustments to the existing program would be subject to consideration by the Committee given its role in providing advice to the Auditor-General on audit priorities.
During this financial year the Committee continued to refine the process by which it fulfils its responsibilities as the Audit Committee of Parliament.  With respect to requests for ad hoc audits it was agreed that the Auditor-General will inform the Committee of any request and indicate the extent of its impact on the overall audit program.  By means of this process the Committee is kept fully informed of the adequacy of resources available to the Auditor-General, a vital element in maintaining effective parliamentary scrutiny of executive government.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-05-09,"—I rise to indicate the opposition's position in relation to the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. I indicate at this point that we will be opposing the main amendments contained in the bill. We oppose the amendments contained in schedules 2 and 3 and part 1 of schedule 5 of the bill, and we support those remaining amendments that we were given advanced notice of. In order that the amendments be passed, we will be moving amendments in the committee stage that allow us to oppose schedules 2 and 3 and part 1 of schedule 5 and then support the remaining provisions of the bill.
I would like to indicate at this stage that the opposition have just been given a set of amendments by the government—literally about half an hour ago—relating to the substantive sections of the bill as circulated but also seeking a number of amendments in relation to the Australian National Railways Commission. This came as a bit of a surprise to the opposition, I have to say. We were not apprised of this prior to the bill coming on; we have just received the amendments that have been circulated in the chamber. I must say that, if the government were keen to get some of these amendments through, it would have been appropriate to advise the opposition in a timely sense, because at the moment we have no idea about what our position is. Of course, we would not be the only ones; I suspect this would also come as a surprise to the Democrats. So at this point, the opposition is confined to talking about what we have been advised about, which is what was considered by the House of Representatives. 
I see that Senator Greig has just arrived. I suppose the amendments that have been circulated in relation to the Australian National Railways Commission may come as a surprise to him as well, because obviously the Democrats have not been advised. As I said earlier, we were only advised of these about a half hour ago, but I will leave it to Senator Greig to make a comment on that.
In relation to the amendments that the opposition has circulated, I will make a brief contribution and outline our position. At the committee stage, I will further explore some of the government's proposed amendments—the ones that we have actually had for some time as distinct from the ones we got only about half an hour ago.
With respect to schedules 2 and 3—the industrial relations provisions—the amendments in schedule 2 and 3 amend respectively the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. The amendments will, one, remove the reference to a court of Western Australia which has been abolished; two, make changes in relation to industrial disputes; and, three, repeal obsolete provisions relating to the removal from and the return to the territories of accused persons and prisoners. What concerns us in relation to these amendments is the second item, which constitutes, in our view, an attempt to bring the majority of workers on Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands under Western Australian industrial relations law. The current situation is that, as Commonwealth territories, the Workplace Relations Act 1996 applies on the islands. 
It probably does provide some useful purpose to go into a bit of the background in relation to some of these provisions, much of which, of course, occurred when Labor was in government. However, it has been substantially changed and, given the ideological position of the coalition in relation to industrial relations, this comes as no surprise to us, but it is a little bit perplexing. In 1992, a review into the legislative arrangements on the islands was conducted and concluded that Western Australian law be extended to the islands, providing them with a living body of law. However, in 1992, the proposal was that the Commonwealth retain power over industrial relations issues as well as maintain the power to expressly apply any other piece of Commonwealth legislation. Under the Commonwealth industrial relations act, there is the requirement of interstateness, which is needed to activate the relevant provisions. This was removed in relation to the islands.
Under the new legal regime, there was also a provision for the Commonwealth to enter into service delivery arrangements with the Western Australian government to ensure the effective application and administration of the Western Australian laws in force in the territories. Agreements have since been reached with most Western Australian state government agencies with regard to a number of service delivery agreements in existence. At the time that the new regime was introduced, the Western Australian government became concerned with the operation of Commonwealth industrial relations law on the islands as many Western Australian public sector employees would be working on the islands under the service delivery agreements. They were also concerned that a dispute arising on the islands may spread back to Western Australia, fulfilling the interstateness requirement and bringing the Commonwealth industrial relations act into operation in Western Australia.
To avoid this, the Western Australian government—we are dealing here with the 1992 issue—sought to have Western Australian public sector employees working on the islands exempt from the Commonwealth industrial relations laws operating on the islands. In responding to this, the Australian Council of Trade Unions at that point gave a commitment to the Western Australian government that neither the ACTU nor the Trades and Labour Council would seek to apply conditions of work on the island to mainland employees, which I think was a very fair summation in relation to that issue. However, the Western Australian government, not surprisingly, was not satisfied. It entered into formal negotiations with the federal government and the ACTU. Early in 1994, it was agreed by all the parties involved that the Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) islands acts would be amended to disapply their industrial relations provisions in relation to Western Australian public servants. The implementation of this agreement did not occur before the 1996 federal election, and in 1996 was delayed by the introduction of the first wave of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. We have not heard from the government since in relation to this matter, until today.
Suddenly we have a bill before us—parts of which have gone through the House of Representatives, and some of the amendments have not been presented to the House of Representatives—that attempts to bring the majority of workers on Christmas and Cocos islands under the Western Australian industrial relations scheme. The amendments contained in this bill not only will disapply Commonwealth industrial relations law operating on the island with regard to Western Australian public servants but are broad enough to actually cover private sector workers as well as public sector workers. In our view, this bill attempts to override an agreement reached in 1994 after extensive negotiations with all relevant parties. Just to recap, we were talking at that point about the then federal Labor government, the Western Australian state government and the ACTU, and clearly consultation had occurred with the people on the islands as well. But now we have a situation whereby that agreement, which we as an opposition, might I say, would have been quite happy to sign up to if that was as far as the amendments went, has gone substantially further and will in fact cover private sector workers as well—something that we will not be agreeing to. 
In seeking to implement what is really a whole new industrial relations regime on these islands, the government, as far as we are aware—and I am happy to be corrected by the minister—has undertaken insufficient consultation with employers or employer groups on the island. But here we are being asked to support the bill today. This is after, might I say, an extremely extensive consultation process which occurred in relation to the 1994 agreement, and that would have gone through the parliament had the unfortunate 1996 federal election not interrupted the flow of good government.
Let me make it very clear that the opposition does not support the overriding of an agreement reached between all the relevant parties in respect of this legislation and these amendments. We do not support the lack of consultation and the fact that there has been very little consideration of this new initiative with regard to the Indian Ocean territories and communities. We are totally opposed to the extension of the Western Australian industrial relations law to the Indian Ocean territories. I will be exploring what we believe are the government's reasons for pursuing this path when we come to the committee stage. I would like to now outline the provisions contained in schedule 5, part 1 of the bill and our opposition to them and what it is predicated on.
Schedule 5, part 1 contains a proposal specifically with respect to parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory government. Currently in the Northern Territory there is one parliamentary secretary formally, as I understand, appointed in 1998. In 1978 the Northern Territory act that set up the Northern Territory Assembly made no reference to parliamentary secretaries at all. This means that the 1998 appointment does not carry a separate salary, nor can the appointee participate as a member of the Territory's Executive Council. The Northern Territory is probably the most governed of all the jurisdictions in our country. Its legislature has 25 elected members—one for every 3,200 voters. There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that it is the intention of the Northern Territory government in establishing formally the position of parliamentary secretary to then proceed to establish a new rate of pay with respect to the position. In fact the explanatory memorandum itself states that this amendment is `to provide for the appointment of parliamentary secretaries and for them to be members of the Northern Territory Executive Council and receive remuneration for their services'. I understand the minister in the lower house attempted to say that this was not the case, that there was no intention in relation to remuneration for parliamentary secretaries, but to obviate any needless time wasting in relation to that debate I thought it might be apposite to point that out at this juncture. 
This amendment is clearly designed to ensure that the parliamentary secretary of the Country Liberal Party government in the Northern Territory is paid, otherwise why would there be reference in the explanatory memorandum? Obviously, in light of some of the very serious issues that face the Northern Territory at the moment, from our perspective these provisions are simply precipitous, to say the least. This government would do better, in the opposition's view, to concentrate its efforts on resolving some of the problems, particularly within the justice system, in the Northern Territory or, more broadly, start addressing the problems that rural and regional Australia are now confronting following four rounds of budgetary cuts under this government. I guess we all wait with bated breath for the budget to be brought down later today. What this amendment seeks to do is put money into the pockets of the Northern Territory CLP, not into the pockets of Territorians. So we do not think there is any need for this to be carried. 
The remaining amendments in the bill are contained in schedules 1 and 4 and are supported by the opposition. I would like to restate for the benefit of those senators who were not here before that we have just received additional amendments from the government that go to a number of our amendments but also include several amendments relating to the Australian National Railways Commission and we have not had an opportunity to consider them. These were not considered by the House of Representatives. So, as I said before, in relation to reasonable management of business, I think this bill ought to have been deferred to give opposition parties—ourselves and the Democrats in particular—some opportunity to have a look at these amendments because it may well be that some of them are worth supporting. We simply have not had the time and, if the government were serious about getting some of these amendments carried, it would have been advisable for the government to either give these to us earlier or ensure that the bill did not proceed at this point.  
We support amendments that have been circulated prior to today to schedules 1 and 4. These amendments concern respectively (1) the implementation of the 1991 Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and (2) the changed quorum requirements for the National Capital Authority. Further, there are minor amendments contained in schedule 5, part 2 that correct drafting errors and remove gender specific language that of course the opposition supports. Schedule 1 makes what are effectively technical amendments to the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992. These amendments allow Australia to legally enforce its obligations under Annex IV of the 1991 Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Arguably, Australia has been in breach of its international obligations since 1998 when the treaty came into force, and these amendments correct the situation. I would say to the chamber that it appears that sometimes the government does take notice of international obligations, and we would welcome this change. 
The amendments contained in schedule 4 remove the requirement for the full-time member of the NCA, the National Capital Authority, normally the CEO, to be present at meetings for a quorum. This change will allow for a quorum where the full-time member has declared a pecuniary interest in the matter being addressed and cannot be present. The amendments contained in these two schedules are practical and sensible and are not opposed by the opposition. In order to facilitate their adoption, we will be moving amendments that remove schedules 2 and 3 and schedule 5, part 1, from the bill to then allow schedules 1 and 4 as well as the provisions correcting drafting errors and removing gender specific language to be passed. 
In its present form, the opposition cannot and will not support this bill. Schedules 2 and 3 of the bill seek to override an agreement reached between all of the parties concerned in 1994 and from our perspective there has been inadequate consultation with the very people that they affect. The member for the Northern Territory, whose electorate includes Christmas and Cocos islands, has consulted with the islanders over the contents of these amendments—he would urge the government to do so as well—and has been told that they are opposed. Obviously the government seeks to impose its view in relation to this, except when it is dealing with the Northern Territory government; then the government says that the communities must be left to make their own decisions about what they need. For this government it is not a matter of interfering or not; it is really about what suits any particular given point. 
These schedules are about forcing rejecting reforms in the area of industrial relations on to a group of workers in the IOTs. We believe the money would be better spent in relation to the remuneration for parliamentary secretaries in terms of providing additional assistance to the Northern Territory—certainly money that the Northern Territory is crying out for. Just to reiterate to the chamber, we will be moving amendments that will remove the schedules of the bill that we will not be supporting, but we will support the schedules in the bill that represent, in our view, sensible and practical changes. 
In conclusion, seeing that the minister has just joined us, I wish to reiterate that we received some amendments to this bill only about half an hour to three-quarters of an hour ago, which has meant that we have not had the time to consider the amendments, some of which may be supportable by the opposition. More explicitly, I suppose, we are curious as to where the amendments relating to the Australian National Railways Commission came from because, as far as we are aware, this is the first time that the opposition has received them. As I said, these may be amendments that we would support, but we simply have not had the time to look at them to determine their impact and to see how they actually interrelate to this bill. I understand the Democrats are in the same boat. Hopefully, at the expiration of various speeches on the second reading of this bill, we might be in a position to sort some of this out and at least have some time to consider the government's amendments. But at this point we are completely in the dark as to what the implications are. I would urge the government and the minister to consider deferring the committee stage of the bill in order that we can have consultations with the government and the Democrats in relation to these amendments. At this point, we are unfortunately not in a position to agree. ",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-05-09,"—The Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 before us today has considerable scope, being an omnibus bill. With perhaps the exception of Norfolk Island, almost all territories are having something tinkered with in their various structures of self-government. As far back as 1991, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquired into external territories and published their report Islands in the Sun. The following statement about process was made regarding the Cocos (Keeling) Islands—one of the subject matters of the bill. The House of Representatives committee said in its report at points 4.9.2 and 4.9.3:
Before examining possible options, however, it was essential that the Cocos Malay community and other Cocos residents be consulted, in order to determine their wishes in this regard.
The need for direct consultation with the residents of the Territory was considered crucial for a number of reasons that are unique to Cocos (Keeling) Islands Territory. First, it was clear from the submissions to the committee that the Cocos Malay community itself places considerable emphasis on the need for and the importance of consultation. Second, such consultation is consisted with the spirit of  the Cocos Act which specifically provides for the preservation of the institutions, customs and usages of a Territory. Third, the community submitted to the committee that they had `no expertise in the area of laws' and wished their inexperience to be taken into account in the committee's consideration of the legal regime of the Territory. In addition, the Council submitted that it was of paramount importance for any proposals and their implications to be explained.
The Australian Democrats concur with these comments but would add that those principles contained in the Islands in the Sun report, as they applied to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, should also apply to other remote Australian territories, such as Norfolk and Christmas islands.
My colleague Senator Bourne touched upon some of these issues when the Senate rejected the Norfolk Island Amendment Bill 1999 [2000]. As recently as 9 March this year, Senator Bourne said:
It is interesting to note that the Norfolk Island Amendment Bill is not supported by the Norfolk Island government, nor is it supported by many members of the Norfolk Island community. The Norfolk government has said that it does not want Australia interfering in its local government or its electoral laws, both of which have worked well for 20 years. The government's firearms provisions have now been withdrawn by the government, and these too were said by the Norfolk Islanders to be quite unnecessary. The Senate Selection of Bills Committee last year found that this bill contained contentious issues and referred it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The minority report of that committee, signed by Senator Lyn Allison of my party, found no compelling reason to support the bill and recommended against it. The Democrats will therefore not be supporting the bill.
What Senator Bourne identified during that debate—and what is evident with the bill currently before the Senate—is that the government is not inclined to consult with the smaller and more vocal communities that comprise some of Australia's external territories. That is an unacceptable position for the Australian Democrats. The contrast that the provisions of this bill represent are quite stark.
In the case of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the government is seeking to impose the draconian Court government's either second or third wave of industrial relations reforms. Chair, as a Western Australian, you would be aware of that particular contentious and unpopular piece of legislation and the extent to which it motivated many in the Western Australian community to rally in numbers in opposition to that bill—the likes of which have not been seen before—and I was one of the many people there in opposition to that legislation. Even more curious is why the government considers its own legislation—the Workplace Relations Act 1996—to be in some way unworthy for the people of the Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands. The Democrats disagree. As a preferred option, we believe that the safeguards which are inherent in the Commonwealth act should remain. The Democrats will be supporting the opposition's amendments in that regard. 
It is perhaps salient to pause for a moment and consider the process by which we saw the enactment of Western Australia's controversial and interesting industrial relations laws. I note that Senator Lightfoot is not here to join in this part of the debate. The Senate may recall that, until the state election in Western Australia in December 1996, the entire history of the Western Australian Legislative Council was one of conservative domination. It had since Federation been dominated through the gerrymander in the upper house system in that state. Until that time, unlike the Senate, there was no effective house of review. It was simply a rubber stamp for conservative governments and a blocking mechanism for non-conservative governments. The government's then agenda in the Western Australian parliament was significant. In the 1996 Western Australian election, we saw for the first time conservative politicians faced with the reality of an accountable upper house following the success of, particularly, the Australian Democrats, and then giving them the balance of power in the Western Australian Legislative Council. It saw the election of my state colleagues the Hon. Helen Hodgson and the Hon. Norm Kelly that moved WA, I think, out of the political dark ages and into a much more democratic paradigm that previously did not exist in that state.
Unfortunately, the late senator for Western Australia Mr John Panizza died on 31 January 1997, resulting in the creation of a Senate casual vacancy, which was ultimately filled by Senator Lightfoot when he was chosen on 19 May 1997 by the parliament of Western Australia under section 15 of the Constitution—that is very much on the public record. What is generally not realised is that, although Senator Panizza passed away on 31 January, the balance of power in the Western Australia upper house was about to change.
To recap the time line, the state election was in December 1996, with fixed terms commencing on 22 May 1997. Senator Panizza passed away in January. Western Australia's industrial relations laws were passed on 15 May 1997, after which then MLC Mr Ross Lightfoot became Senator Ross Lightfoot. So there was this extraordinary period—I think you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan—of some five months between the untimely death of Senator Panizza and the appointment of Senator Lightfoot. It was during that period that Premier Richard Court and his industrial relations minister, Mr Graham Kierath, rushed through what is arguably the most regressive industrial relations legislation in the country. While Premier Court may have thwarted the democratic intention of the people of Western Australia—who voted for a non-government controlled upper house in December 1996—we are not about to let that happen again. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the opposition's amendments as they relate to industrial relations on Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands.
With regard to Norfolk Island, I wish to briefly refer to some of the matters as they concerned that island because, although it does not impact directly on the legislation before us, I think the bill is symptomatic of the government's attitude to some of our smaller external territories. The minister and his predecessor persisted with this bill against the advice of the very people it concerned. That legislation went to the very heart of the Norfolk Island community. They did not want Australia interfering in their local government and their electoral laws, both of which have worked remarkably well for 20 years. As a parliament we are greatly diminished when we seek to interfere in small communities with unique histories and cultures. The Norfolk Island community is a self-sufficient population of some 1,700 people dependent on tourism and services, with a stable government, a strong economy and an enviable social services structure. The population is a unique blend of Tahitian and Anglo-Saxon origin. They seem to manage their place, with all its differences, a lot better than the present government seems to be managing some of its departments.  
The Australian government gave them partial self-government in 1979, with a path to full self-government promised `within five years'. It has not happened, and there is no good reason why it has been delayed. The government should not have brought that legislation before the Senate. It was drafted without consultation with the Norfolk Island community. Once the Norfolk Islanders became aware of the contents, their response was to strongly oppose it. So it has been the case with the people of Christmas Island. In answer to a question, No. 717 on 21 June 1999, the minister stated:
... consultation with the Norfolk Island Government concerning the drafting of the Norfolk Island Amendment Bill 1999 has been ongoing since the government's announcement of the proposed changes on 5 March 1999.
What that really says is that we sent them the bill; and they objected strongly and kept objecting, and still do. There was no consultation. The Chief Minister and ministers of the Norfolk Island government came to Canberra twice last year to try to persuade the minister to abandon that legislation. They had also objected strongly when the former minister raised it in early 1998. The Norfolk Island government and the Shire of Christmas Island held a day-long external territories conference here in Parliament House last November. Here, among other long overdue requests of the minister, they again sought to have the legislation abandoned on the grounds it was not wanted by the community, it achieved nothing for Australia and it diminished their progress towards self-government.
In 1998, when the legislation was first announced, the Norfolk Island community held a referendum, in which over 80 per cent of the people opposed the outcome of the bill. The Commonwealth, not content with that, said they might take more notice of a referendum with appropriate wording. Again, in May 1999, the community voted by a majority of some 74 per cent against these proposed changes. The Senate Selection of Bills Committee last year found that the bill contained `contentious issues' and referred it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The minority report to that committee found `no compelling reason' for the bill and recommended against it. Yet the minister has still persisted with that bill and the one before us.
There is still a great deal of confusion and irrationality surrounding the issue of powers held by both the Australian and Norfolk Island governments in regard to the administration of that island. A Commonwealth Grants Commission report on the island in 1997 said that: 
... a future Norfolk Island would be simpler and easier to administer if the powers reserved to the Commonwealth were specified and the powers available to the Norfolk Island Assembly remained unstated.
There at least needs to be some attempt to further the question of an appropriate system of self-government. This bill does not do that. It has caused offence to many islanders and it does not warrant animosity between the Australian mainland and the community on Norfolk.
The Norfolk Island Act 1979 begins with a unique and lengthy preamble. It is clearly intended to clarify the position of Norfolk Island with regard to the Commonwealth of Australia. The island has responsibility for a wide range of matters, including child, family and social welfare, labour and industrial relations, social security, public health, education, telecommunications, immigration and customs, and lotteries and gaming. Federal laws do not apply to the island unless specific provision is made in the relevant law. All transfer of powers has been at the initiative of the Norfolk Island government, and the last applications for consent occurred some seven years ago. The list of powers is now complex and lacks clarity as to separate responsibilities. 
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I appreciate that in speeches on the second reading a very wide discretion is allowed. I simply raise the issue—in case Senator Greig is talking about a different bill from the one I think we are talking about—that the bill before us has absolutely nothing to do with Norfolk Island. Senator Greig is giving us an interesting discourse on a previous bill that was before us, and it is an interesting historical account, but I raise the issue only in case Senator Greig has misdirected himself as to what this bill is about. If he has not, perhaps I have been uncertain as to the contents of this bill. But, as I understand it, this has nothing whatsoever to do with Norfolk Island and the debate Senator Greig is embarking upon is one we had a month or so ago in relation to other issues.
 (Senator McKiernan)—As I understand it, from a cursory glance at the bill, Senator Macdonald, the bill contains an amendment to the Norfolk Island legislation, so I rule that there is no point of order.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. That had always been my understanding, given the omnibus nature of the bill. As I was saying, federal laws do not apply on the island unless special provision is made in the relevant law. The time has come when Australia must nominate the powers it wishes to retain and devolve the remainder of those powers to the Norfolk Island government. It is now time to seriously consider such questions as the granting of powers equal with those of other states and self-governing territories; recognising that some federal powers will always remain with the Commonwealth; allowing for the devolution of some federal powers, taking into account the island's requirements for self-sufficiency and the lack of federal funding; and having federal laws not apply on Norfolk Island unless specified, as at present. It is a constitutional evolution and not a revolution that we are arguing for.
In concluding, I wish to restate that Norfolk Island is, to all intents and purposes, a different place from Australia, and that that, in and of itself, is not a bad thing. Australians by now have learnt—particularly from the experiences of indigenous peoples—that heavy-handed treatment of small communities is frequently catastrophic. Minister, one thing is quite clear out of this process: there is a significant degree of animosity between Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the department and your office. Perhaps a more conciliatory and consultative approach may gain greater support from the Australian Democrats on the next occasion that you seek to deal with the constitutional framework of the external territories.
In terms of other territories and amendments, other parts of the bill also apply to the internal territories—that is, the Northern Territory and the ACT. In so far as the amendments which apply to the ACT are reasonably procedural and are to that end cosmetic, they have the support of the Democrats. The Northern Territory is quite another matter. In short, the amendments that apply to the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act of 1978 are to create the position and, I presume, the salaries of parliamentary secretaries. How ironic, then, that the administration of the Northern Territory sees no inconsistency with the upgrading of political perks while at the same time maintaining on its statute books laws which require the mandatory sentencing of both children and adults. Whatever the amelioration that the deal between the Prime Minister and Mr Burke may bring about, while those laws remain on the books for adults and children alike the Northern Territory continues to demonstrate its unworthiness for greater progress towards self-government and even statehood.
Accordingly, I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments consistent with the cosponsored legislation from Senators Bolkus, Brown and me that did pass the Senate—in so far as it applied to the Northern Territory—as well as with the sentiments expressed in Mr Andren's private members bill and in the bill of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. I look forward to the support of the Senate on that. In terms of the very late amendments moved by the minister in relation to railways, I must confess that I too have not had time to seriously look at or consider them and consult with others on them, and I wonder if—picking up Senator Mackay's suggestion—they could not be deferred or delayed in some way so that I could do that. The introduction of those amendments at this very late hour is unreasonable. 
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I apologise to Senator Greig. I see that the Norfolk Island Act is involved. We are changing a colon to a full stop and adding the word `or'—
—Order! That is not a point of order. Senator Macdonald, please resume your seat. There is room for explanations such as that at the conclusion of the debate.",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-05-09,"—I specifically want to go to three sections of the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, those which relate to my areas of interest, coming as I do from the Northern Territory and having responsibility for Christmas and Cocos islands in the federal jurisdiction. The first of the parts of the bill that I actually want to talk about this afternoon are schedules 2 and 3, which seek to amend the Christmas Island Act of 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act of 1955. These amendments seek to ensure that Western Australian workers and employers working on Christmas Island or Cocos (Keeling) Islands will not be subject to the Workplace Relations Act of 1996. These changes endeavour to bring all workers on Christmas and Cocos islands under the Western Australian industrial relations laws. 
In historical terms, in 1955 and 1958, some years ago, the Cocos and Christmas islands acts respectively realised the hand-over of the islands to Australia. The Commonwealth government then assumed legislative responsibility for the islands; however, Commonwealth acts were not to apply on the islands unless it was expressly requested that they do so, and the power to make ordinances was reserved to the Governor-General. At the time the new regime was introduced, the Western Australian government became concerned with the operation of the Commonwealth industrial relations law on the islands, as many Western Australian Public Service employees would be working on the islands under arrangements established by those service delivery agreements. They were also concerned that a dispute arising on the islands could, for example, spread back to Western Australia, fulfilling the interstateness requirement and bringing into operation the Commonwealth Industrial Relations Act. For those reasons, the Western Australian government sought to have the Western Australian public sector employees working on the islands exempted from the operations of the Commonwealth industrial relations laws.
However, unfortunately, the Western Australian government was not satisfied with those undertakings, and it therefore sought to enter into formal negotiations with the federal government back then and with the ACTU. Accordingly, as I understand it, in early 1994 it was agreed that the Christmas and Cocos islands acts would be amended to apply their industrial relations provisions in relation to Western Australian public servants. The implementation of this agreement, however, did not occur before the 1996 federal election; and, of course, in 1996 it became caught up with the introduction of the Workplace Relations Act. Unfortunately, we have not heard from the government on this issue since. The truth of the matter is that for those reasons—that is, the failure to act after the 1996 election—the issues remain unresolved; hence one can deduce the reason we have the current bill before us.
The problem is that today we have before us an attempt to bring Christmas and Cocos islands under the Western Australian industrial relations scheme, which to my understanding clearly was not the intent of the discussions entered into back in 1995. The amendments contained in this bill are not only to apply Commonwealth industrial relations law operating on the island with regard to Western Australian public servants; they are also, unfortunately, broad enough to cover all private sector workers as well. This, I believe, goes far beyond the original agreement of the Western Australian government, the Commonwealth and the ACTU representatives at the time. This amendment is not something that is accepted by the people of Christmas Island or the people of the Cocos Islands. There has been no appropriate process of consultation or deliberation about these proposals by those communities, and there certainly has been no consultation over this issue with the unions concerned—the Union of Christmas Island Workers and the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union in Perth—or the employers on the island. So the question that is begging is: what is wrong with the current system? 
The Western Australian government have had a commitment from the ACTU since 1994 that the industrial relations situation in these two territories was of no relevance to WA, and neither the ACTU nor the Trades and Labour Council would seek to apply the territories' conditions of work to mainland employees under service delivery arrangements. So, whatever the concerns of the Western Australian government, they are unwarranted. No evidence has been forthcoming as to why these amendments should be legislated. There is no evidence that any of the unions have sought to apply island conditions of work to mainland employees. I want to read out the definition of what a Western Australian employee is under section 3 of that state's Industrial Relations Act 1979. That says:
An employer shall, for the purposes of subsection (1), be connected with the state if that employer—
(a)	is domiciled in the State; 
(b)	is resident in the State, normally or temporarily;
(c)	being a body corporate, is registered, incorporated, or established under a law of the State or is for the purposes of the Companies (Western Australia) Code deemed to be related to such a body; and
(d)	in connection with the industry concerned, has an office or a place of business in the State ...
So not only is this definition very broad but also it applies to an employee whose employer is connected to Western Australia.
These amendments go well beyond the original agreement of 1994 and would potentially allow all island employees to move to the Western Australian industrial relations system. That includes private sector workers who will be brought under the Western Australian law in this case. The employees of the island administration are Commonwealth employees. The amendments would result in two industrial jurisdictions on the island, and there is absolutely no need for that. It is the Labor Party's view that in developing our relationship with these territories we should accept that they need to be able to make decisions themselves, and that we should be moving along a path which provides for them the capacity to determine which laws of Western Australia apply and how they apply after consultation with the Western Australian legislature and with the Commonwealth minister.
Another point is that the people of Christmas Island have no voice in the Western Australian parliament and would have no access to any amendments which the Western Australian industrial relations legislation may afford them. Their only voice is through this federal parliament. They have not chosen to be, nor do they want to be, part of the Western Australian legislative system. They do not want to be part of the political system in that state either. This government and this parliament should be respectful of that wish at least. Currently we know that there is an administrator responsible for both Christmas and Cocos islands. That administrator is responsible directly to the minister in the chamber this afternoon, and there is no compulsion on the Administrator—or indeed the minister for that matter—to negotiate over issues to do with the community. There is no compulsion upon the Administrator or those he works with to seek a consensus over what should happen on those islands in terms of the legal regime, and there is no compulsion on the government to see how these communities would like to advance themselves.
This bill also demonstrates that the people of Christmas Island and the people of the Cocos Islands will not be consulted and in fact have not been consulted. They will not have a role in decision making. Their views will not be properly accommodated. What the government should be doing, rather than imposing its view and its will and the view of the Western Australian government on these territories, is sitting down and talking with those people and finding out what they want, what their priorities are and how this government can work with rather than against their interests. Too often we have seen this government go down this track and disregard the will of the people, particularly on Christmas and Cocos islands, and it is about time it started to listen to that community. It is hypocritical to talk about self-government for the Northern Territory—and we do this constantly as we uphold the democratic rights of Territorians—but not apply the same standards for the people of Christmas and Cocos islands. 
I turn now to schedule 5, which seeks to create the position of parliamentary secretary in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. These amendments give legislative recognition to the position of parliamentary secretary in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. This provides payment of salary. Contrary to what you said a moment ago, Minister, when you corrected Senator Greig, if you turn to page 2 of your own memorandum in relation to this bill, the fifth dot point explains the amendment to the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act and goes on to say that this amendment provides for the appointment of parliamentary secretaries and for them to be members of the Northern Territory Executive Council and receive remuneration for their services. So the intent of this amendment is that it would go to the payment of salary. You should also be aware that Northern Territory parliamentarians have their salaries and conditions directly linked to federal politicians, and your own explanatory memorandum points out that this will enable them to receive remuneration for their services. It also allows them to be part of the Executive Council as parliamentary secretaries. The Northern Territory government has one parliamentary secretary—Steve Hatton, the member for Nightcliff, who is Parliamentary Secretary to the Chief Minister on Statehood, which in itself is fairly absurd given that the people of the Northern Territory voted overwhelmingly against the statehood referendum in October 1998, a clear slap in the face for the Northern Territory government, which was pushing for statehood but failed to properly consult the people on this issue at the time.
This amendment is open ended. It does not restrict or limit the number of parliamentary secretaries that may be appointed by the Administrator. This amendment will be opposed because it will mean an additional expense to the taxpayer in the Northern Territory, an expense that we believe is unwarranted and unjustified. It exacerbates the existing high level of expense of running the Northern Territory government. There is no way we should provide an open-ended commitment to the Northern Territory government for them to appoint as many parliamentary secretaries as they like. It is not only unjustified but also ludicrous. It is an attempt to introduce backdoor pay increases to its backbench MPs. The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly only consists of 25 seats. I should not say `only consists of 25 seats', because each of those seats have in fact only at a maximum 3,500 voters. It is already the most overgoverned jurisdiction in this country. When this matter was raised in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 2 March this year the Chief Minister was asked, and I quote from their Hansard:
This Country Liberal Party government has asked their mates in Canberra to amend the Territory's Self-Government Act to provide for unlimited parliamentary secretaries. Each secretary will, of course, be entitled to a substantial pay rise. We already have 9 well paid ministers to oversee the affairs of just under 200 000 Territorians. There are far more urgent priorities in the Territory, calling for government funding, than a pay rise for politicians. Is this the Chief Minister's way of delivering a pay rise to his entire backbench?
I think it is interesting to put on the record the response from the Chief Minister, who said:
Mr Speaker, I have never, since I've been Chief Minister, written to the federal government with regard to the appointment of parliamentary secretaries. That avenue is available to me. There is one parliamentary secretary, Mr Steve Hatton, assisting the Chief Minister on statehood. 
He went on to say:
That position carries no—and I would emphasise no—remuneration and no benefits. The title that's been given to him simply is to ensure that everyone is aware that he is assisting me directly on this most important issue. So in terms of the nature of the question, I know not from where it comes.
In an article in the Northern Territory News on Friday, 3 March the Chief Minister again reiterated that he had not approached the federal government about this issue and he in fact knew nothing about this issue. It seems strange that on one hand a few weeks ago we were very happy to comply with the wishes of the Northern Territory government and ensure that the federal parliament did not intervene in the issue of mandatory sentencing. We stood on a platform some weeks ago of saying that the federal parliament has no jurisdiction or authorisation to meddle in the affairs of the Northern Territory and the Northern Territory parliament yet now we have before us a bill that seeks to create parliamentary secretaries which has not been asked for by the Chief Minister, which has not been at the request of the people in the Northern Territory and which does not have the support of the opposition or the government in the Northern Territory.
This is a clear sign of the hypocrisy and the contempt with which the Northern Territory is continually being dealt by this government. You cannot have on one hand an argument that we will not meddle in mandatory sentencing and the jurisdictional nature of the Northern Territory in respect of correctional services and governance of its laws in that area yet on the other hand produce a couple of weeks later a bill that seeks to create parliamentary secretaries. It may well be a different argument if we had the Chief Minister requesting you to do it and we were arguing about the rights of the Northern Territory government to create parliamentary secretaries, but the Chief Minister himself has admitted he does not want it done and he has not requested you to do it. So why have we got this bill?
—You know that's not true. Be truthful.
—Senator Macdonald, are you suggesting to us that the Chief Minister of the Territory has lied to us, has lied to the opposition, that in fact he did request you to create the position of parliamentary secretaries?
—You know that the request came from a previous Chief Minister. You know the truth.
—Are you trying to tell us it was a previous Chief Minister and Denis Burke is covering up for your now President of the Liberal Party? Is that correct?
—A previous Chief Minister.
—Well, somebody is certainly not telling the truth in respect of who requested this. From the response of the Chief Minister in the Northern Territory you can assume that there has been no communication between the Northern Territory government—although we have Senator Macdonald actually saying now it was a previous Chief Minister that requested this—and the federal government about this question. But here we have this amendment before us. Has the current Chief Minister been asked about the creation of parliamentary secretaries? Has the current Northern Territory Legislative Assembly made a decision about the creation of parliamentary secretaries in the year 2000? The answer is no. The Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, wrote to the Prime Minister on 6 March this year—and also, I understand, sent you, Senator Macdonald, a letter—requesting some explanation for this bill. At this stage I believe she has received a reply from neither you nor the Prime Minister. She goes on to say in her letter:
There is no justification for the creation of paid Parliamentary Secretaries in the Northern Territory.
...		...		...
The capacity to create paid Parliamentary Secretaries for the Northern Territory is not worthy of support. Further pay rises for Territory Politicians simply cannot be justified.
In the article I referred to on 3 March the Chief Minister said that if the Commonwealth legislation was passed parliamentary secretaries in the NT would not be awarded a pay rise. That cannot be so, because there is legislation that requires that politicians in the Northern Territory have their salaries and conditions directly linked to federal politicians, and this year we have seen your parliamentary secretaries in government for the first time receive in excess of $22,000 a year for picking up the tag of parliamentary secretary. So that is not correct. I cannot imagine there would be one parliamentary secretary appointed in the Northern Territory who would be happy to do it for nothing, for no additional remuneration, when their colleagues at the federal level were picking up in excess of $22,000 for the same privilege and when their wages and conditions were linked to those federal politicians. So as of today, two months down the track, we have got no response from either you or the Prime Minister, although advice was received from Mr Howard that he had acknowledged her letter. As well as not answering questions in the chamber, Senator Macdonald, it seems that you also do not respond to correspondence, particularly from leaders of the opposition in the Territory. 
So where does this leave the taxpayers in the Northern Territory? We have a Chief Minister—the current Chief Minister—who claims to have no knowledge of this proposal about parliamentary secretaries being put forward in the parliament; we have a Prime Minister who acknowledged receipt of correspondence and passed it over to another minister, who has not responded to date; and we have legislation before us which proposes to give an open-ended cheque to the Northern Territory government to appoint as many parliamentary secretaries as they please. There are currently 18 government members in the Northern Territory, of whom nine are ministers, one is the Speaker and one is the whip. That leaves seven members, one of whom is a parliamentary secretary who is currently unpaid. That then leaves six members. We could have a situation where all 18 were members of the Executive Council if they so chose. Let me tell you that it would not be too long before they actually chose to go that way. We might well have a situation where we have a Northern Territory government made up of no backbenchers if this legislation were passed. 
I absolutely reject the notion that we should provide an open-ended commitment to the Northern Territory government for them to appoint as many parliamentary secretaries as they please, and that is exactly what this legislation does. It does not put a limit on the number that they can appoint. Under this proposal a new section 43A would be inserted which would allow the number of parliamentary secretaries and their respective responsibilities to be determined from time to time by the Administrator. If there is a need for these parliamentary secretaries, this is a debate that should be argued in the domain of the public in the Territory.",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-05-09,"—I rise this afternoon to join my colleagues in opposing aspects of the legislation that has been presented to us here today. One area in particular that I wish to speak about follows on from Senator Crossin's excellent contribution in relation to this rort about parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. To put the debate in context, in 1978—under a coalition government of course—the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act was passed giving the Territory extended powers of self-government. In 1982, once again under a coalition federal government, the size of the membership of the Legislative Assembly was increased from 19 to 25. Currently the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly comprises 18 members from the Country Liberal Party and seven members from the Labor Party. The 25 electorates are single-member electorates and there is compulsory voting. As I understand it, the Administrator appoints ministers on the advice of the leader of the majority party. The Administrator is advised by an executive council comprising all the Territory ministers. Currently there are nine ministers in this government and an unofficial parliamentary secretary, Mr Hatton.
I want to highlight to the Senate this afternoon the current salaries that the government members, and indeed all members, of the Territory parliament receive. Currently all 25 members of the Legislative Assembly receive $80,000 each—that costs us $2 million. The Chief Minister, in addition to his MP's salary, earns $88,788; the Deputy Chief Minister earns $62,089; the Leader of Government Business receives $54,684; and the six ministers each receive $45,324, which comes to $271,944. In addition to this, as we all know as people who have been in government, there is one Speaker, who earns $45,324, and a Government Whip, who earns, in addition to his MP's wages, $11,331. The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly also has three committees and the three committee chairpersons each receive an additional $15,108. The Leader of the Opposition earns $45,324, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition earns $22,662 and the Opposition Whip earns $11,331. Currently several zones attract electoral allowances. Fifteen zones attract an electoral allowance of $14,736, two zones attract $17,018, one zone attracts $31,922, two zones attract $32,761, two zones attract $33,924, two zones attract $35,962 and one zone attracts $37,788. That comes to a grand total of $3,188,881 to run the Northern Territory parliament. 
That may not seem all that significant to the Northern Territory government because 18 of the current 25 members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly are government members. Of those 18 members of the Legislative Assembly, there are nine ministers, one Speaker, one Government Whip, three committee chairmen and one unofficial parliamentary secretary, who must be out of some Gilbert and Sullivan opera, called the Minister for Statehood, even though on the occasion that the Territorians had an opportunity to vote on that matter they rejected it and rejected it soundly.
From my adding up, that means that at the moment only two members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly do not have jobs. I have their names here. Maybe we can express a bit of sympathy for those two people. They have obviously been left out because of some difficulty of the government. I could get their names, but maybe you will be able to assist me in your reply, Minister, by giving me their names. It does seem a bit unfair that these two people have been left out. Maybe they do not support the Chief Minister. More likely, if as a result of the amendments that we are debating today Mr Hatton is given access to and becomes a member of the Executive Council and is thus given an opportunity to receive remuneration for it, one could only expect that these two other members of the Legislative Assembly who are currently not on the gravy train will have the opportunity to get on the gravy train.
—Would Dr Lim be there? Is that his name?
—I think Dr Lim is one of the gentlemen. In fact, I have their names. I am so lucky. They are Dr Richard Soom Huat Lim and Ms Susan Jill Carter. It does seem unfair that we cannot at least look after them in one form or another, and I suppose they appreciate the fact that the government is seeking to introduce legislation so that Ms Carter and Dr Lim can at least get a start on the Northern Territory gravy train. They are the only two who do not get any extra money out of the Northern Territory parliament. They are the only two Country Liberal Party members who have been discriminated against. I am sure that Senator Macdonald feels that he is duty-bound to open up this gravy train for the remaining two Country Liberal Party members.
If you have a look at the ministries in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, you have nine ministers and one unofficial parliamentary secretary. You have the Chief Minister, who is also the Attorney-General, as we know. He is also the Minister for AustralAsia Railway, whatever that is or whatever department that is administered by. He is the Minister for Young Territorians. Do you realise that there is a ministry up in Darwin for young Territorians? So that there is no discrimination, there is another minister too. The Hon. Stephen Dunham MLA is the Minister for Senior Territorians, in case you felt that they had been discriminated against like Ms Carter and Dr Lim. The Chief Minister is also the Minister for Women's Policy as well as the Minister for Constitutional Development. He is no doubt assisted by the Parliamentary Secretary assisting the Chief Minister on Statehood.
These people are clearly overgoverned. I went through this list of ministers. We have five ministers, in one form or another, for development. We have five ministers, in one form or another, for services. As I mentioned to you earlier, the Hon. Denis Gabriel Burke is the Minister for Constitutional Development. The Hon. Timothy Denney Baldwin is the Minister for Defence Support and Regional Development. The Hon. Daryl William Manzie is the Minister for Resource Development. The Hon. Michael James Palmer is the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Development. The Hon. Loraine Margaret Braham is the Minister for Aboriginal Development. 
Then we get to the Deputy Chief Minister. In addition to his role as Treasurer and Minister for Tourism—once again, it is the five services ministers that we are going to assist in one form or another—the Hon. Michael Reed is the Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services. We have the Hon. Daryl Manzie again as the Minister for Correctional Services. The Hon. Peter Francis Adamson is the Minister for Corporate and Information Services. The Hon. Stephen Dunham is the Minister for Health, Family and Children's Services and the Minister for Essential Services. I do not think I have missed anybody at this stage except the Hon. Christopher Dennis Lugg, who has the expanding education portfolio. There is a ministry of School Education, a ministry of Tertiary Education and Training and a ministry of Sport and Recreation. After all that work, I am sure that Mr Lugg does need a bit of recreation.
Let us have a look at some of the other ministries. We actually have a Minister for Arts and Museums in the Northern Territory parliament. His name is Mr Adamson. We also have the Minister for the Territory Insurance Office. In addition to the Minister for Sport and Recreation, we have a Minister for Tourism, whom you would have thought would be involved in sport and recreation. We have a Minister for Racing, Gaming and Licensing. We have a Minister for Asian Relations and Trade. We have ministries of Primary Industry and Fisheries; Territory Ports; Communications, Science and Advanced Technology; and Ethnic Affairs. I have already mentioned that we have a great institution in the Northern Territory parliament run by the Country Liberal Party where you have one Minister for Young Territorians and another Minister for Senior Territorians. What a ridiculous position for public administration and policy in Australia to have so many politicians and so many people looking desperately for titles that we have to come in here today to create yet another opportunity for, it would appear to me, at least two people who have missed out on the gravy train.
In the Northern Territory, there is something like one parliamentary representative for every 3,200 voters. The Territory has just over 200,000 people. The salary for these representatives is just over $3 million. There is an opportunity being presented today for good loyal Country Liberal Party members who do not have anything to do up in the Northern Territory. At the moment in the federal parliament, parliamentary secretaries like Ian Campbell—maybe Senator Campbell receives a bit more—get an extra $21,375 per annum. Ministers in the outer ministry at the moment receive an extra $49,163 per annum. I roughly equate the parliamentary secretary extra salary to be 40 per cent of the outer minister extra salary. So, if a minister in the Northern Territory government is on an extra $45,324, 40 per cent of that would be roughly $20,000. That is what we may be called upon to pay. If we support the government's resolution, we will possibly be called upon to fork over about $20,000 for Mr Hatton as the unofficial parliamentary secretary for statehood. Then we have Dr Lim, who does not have anything to do, so he must be entitled to at least an extra $20,000. Then we have Ms Carter; she must be entitled to an extra $20,000 as well. That would give every member of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly a job. It is discriminatory at the moment when only three of them are missing out. I am sure the government is motivated by that here.
I really object to the fact that the Northern Territory clearly want it both ways. They want authority to make binding laws free from Commonwealth intervention in relation to mandatory sentencing, yet they expect us to financially support them. At the moment, the Northern Territory government receive $1.4 billion in assistance from the federal government each year, and part of that assistance is paying the wages and salaries for the Territorian parliament. I come from an area in Greater Western Sydney which has about as many people in it as the Territory. I am not attacking the Territory people in this. This is a grubby attempt by their politicians to look after themselves. Where I live, out in the city of Penrith, we have a council elected each year which costs the ratepayers of Penrith $220,000 a year. That is $220,000 as opposed to $3.2 million a year that is probably going to be paid on behalf of the Australian taxpayers to look after the government's mates up in the Territory. That equals about seven per cent of the Territory's running costs. So we have a council for an equivalent sized population receiving $220,000 a year to run their elected representatives, and we have representatives for the same sized population costing nearly $3.2 million a year in the Northern Territory. 
I am shocked by the way the government has handled this in the House of Representatives. It has not sought to answer any of the charges that have been made by our shadow ministers or members querying it on this. I do not know what more we can do today except encourage the Democrats to join with us and reject this. There are three members of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory parliament that are not getting any extra money, and this is what the government wants to do with this amendment—give them an opportunity to get that $20,000.",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-05-09,"—I rise to speak on the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, particularly on schedules 2, 3 and 5. Having heard the contribution by Senator Hutchins this afternoon, I am as surprised as he is and also shocked and dismayed at the extraordinary amount of money that seems to be heading to the Northern Territory not only in respect of the issue currently before us but also generally for them to maintain their unprincipled approach to mandatory sentencing. As I recall, in the speech that was just provided to the chamber the amount was in the order of $1.4 billion. I will say that again, in case you did not hear: $1.4 billion is going to the Northern Territory to support a self-government regime. I call it a `self-government regime' because it does not really want self-government. It says, `No, we don't want self-government.' Why wouldn't it not want self-government while this government gives it $1.4 billion to maintain something in the order of one politician per 3,200 voters? Why wouldn't it want to maintain that situation? Why wouldn't it want to continue to have employment generation through politicians? Senator Hutchins talked about, in particular, the Minister for Young Territorians and the Minister for Senior Territorians. He left out whether there was a minister for the baby boomers. Perhaps Senator Macdonald can provide an update as to whether there is a minister for baby boomers in the Northern Territory.
—Don't give them any ideas!
—I take that suggestion. That may very well be one of the duties that the parliamentary secretary is given. They may need a minister for baby boomers, given there is the Minister for Young Territorians and the Minister for Senior Territorians. The Northern Territory might be able to take something from that, but I think in truth they would reject it as being outright silly and nonsensical. I will look at what has been said about these very issues in the House of Representatives. Mr Cameron Thompson, the member for Blair, when speaking to the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, said:
I have quite a bit to say in my short contribution ...
He went on to say:
We keep on setting up situations in Canberra where, I think, we shield the Northern Territory from the impact of its own decisions.
Let us dissect that quote before I continue. What he is saying, I think, is that we are going to shield the Northern Territory from the impact of its own decisions. So we are going to cushion it. What are we going to do? Continue to give the Northern Territory $1.4 billion so that it can do with it what it likes and then say that it needs shielding from its own decisions? Mr Cameron Thompson seems to be saying that the Northern Territory legislative processes simply are inadequate, and they are inadequate. When you look at mandatory sentencing, when you look at the parliamentary secretaries debate currently before us and when you look at other decisions that government has made, it does need shielding from its own decisions—a big plastic shield with the words `give us more money' on it. That is the shield Mr Cameron Thompson is talking about. 
But it is not good enough when you look at the $1.4 billion and ask: how is it going to be meaningfully spent? Is it going to be spent on ensuring that regional and remote area issues are addressed in the Northern Territory and that assistance to Aboriginal communities is addressed? I see Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, is the minister at the table. Perhaps he can explain why the $1.4 billion is not going to the Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, why mandatory sentencing is not being addressed in a serious manner and why we will not pass legislation in this house to deal with mandatory sentencing. The Northern Territory government say, `We can do what we like because we have a shield'—the shield provided and named by Mr Cameron Thompson, who goes on to state:
If you want to have a government in a remote place like the Northern Territory it should be allowed to govern. There is a great tradition up there, just as there is in my home state of Queensland, of Canberra-bashing. 
There is not a tradition of Canberra-bashing from this side. Perhaps Mr Cameron Thompson and his colleagues are used to Canberra-bashing. We are concerned with looking at the policies that this government puts out, dissecting them, being critical of them and addressing the concerns of Labor people. We do not want to Canberra-bash, as Mr Cameron Thompson seems to want to do. He then says that it is not a bad idea to Canberra-bash. In fact, he thinks Canberra-bashing is such a great tradition that not only the Northern Territory should be allowed to do it but also his own state of Queensland should be able to do it. I think Queenslanders would find it insulting, to say the least, to find Mr Thompson referring to them in that way when he mentioned not only that the Northern Territory is a remote territory that needs his protection and that has a tradition of Canberra-bashing but also that Queensland should adopt the tradition as well. 
But Mr Thompson does not stop there. The interesting part of the speech that he gave in the lower house on this legislation was this statement:
Whenever the evil bureaucrats in Canberra set out to interfere in activities of the Northern Territory, it provides, I think, a cushion for democracy in that state, and I do not think it is appropriate for us to continue to do that. We have put training wheels on that government up there and I think it is time those training wheels were taken off. 
What a curious thing to say about the Northern Territory government: that their training wheels should be removed. I think perhaps they should not be. They themselves voted against self-government; they themselves appear to want to keep their training wheels on; they themselves seem to want to continue to spend the $1.4 billion in the way that they deem appropriate; and they also seem to not want to enter proper, informed debate about issues such as mandatory sentencing. They seem quite clear that they want to maintain a level of bureaucracy that is unsustainable and, in fact, add to it. This very legislation before this house sets up a parliamentary secretary position—or positions as the case may be—so they can then fulfil what I guess is their dream of ensuring that there are no backbenchers and that there is no person without a particular title. It appears that we have found a new coined phrase in relation to the Northern Territory government. It seems that a `political title patronage system' has been invented up there where political titles can be handed out by the government to ensure that everybody gets one. I wait with bated breath to see whether the baby boomer minister or parliamentary secretary is similarly created. 
Not to leave the area there, we find that Mr Brough, the member for Longman, also provided us with some snapshots about industrial relations in relation to the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. Unfortunately, when Mr Brough spoke about the changes on Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands from the workplace relations perspective, he stated: 
Western Australian based employers and their employees should have the same choices between federal and state workplace relations coverage as they do on the mainland. 
Do they have a choice on the mainland, and what is that choice? The Workplace Relations Act 1996 that this government introduced was not, in my view, the pinnacle of a legislative scheme of workplace relations that people would be proud of. It is not a scheme that you would bandy about as being a true government initiative that has bells and whistles on it, that you could be proud of and that you could speak about. 
But not to be content there, what this government then set about doing was to say, `It is not bad enough. We need to introduce a second wave.' We are fortunate that the second wave collapsed on the sand in this house and did not proceed. We are fortunate that the second wave was found to be deficient, was found not to provide the protection that employees require in the workplace. We also found that the choices contained in the Workplace Relations Act were not as broad and not as well-meaning as some people might think. What we find here is that, similar to the Workplace Relations Act and the way the second wave turned up, the people on Christmas Island were not consulted. Mr Brough says that the Union of Christmas Island Workers was not consulted. He seems to agree to it. He seems to think that it seems to be one of those things that are simply able to be done. His reasoning behind that is as follows:
The amendments will not affect the workers of the Christmas Island union; the amendments will affect only those people in the territories who are Western Australian based employers and their employees.
It is a brave statement to make. However, does that mean that, because there is a narrow import, it should only require consultation on that narrow frame? I think Mr Brough is misguided. I think the level of consultation in that area should be far broader; it should stretch across the issue that needs to be dealt with. Both the union and other people interested in the workplace on Cocos and Christmas islands should be informed about the change. Also, the public servants and those for whom there might be a subsidiary effect should be informed. There might be families where family members are employed in both that area and the Public Service, and their concerns need to be met and they need to understand what is actually going on. It is not enough to simply say, `We won't need to consult because we don't think it will actually have any impact upon them.' It is simply not good enough for a government to say that, and it is certainly not for Mr Brough to say that. 
What Mr Brough then went on to say about the parliamentary secretaries is interesting and curious. He stated: 
There is no provision for any additional money for parliamentary secretaries. That is a mechanism, as I said earlier, for the self-governing territory, a decision for them, not for Canberra. It is up to the Northern Territory government and the Northern Territory remuneration tribunal. It is simply misrepresentation by those opposite, mischief making of the facts, to represent it in the way that they have—
I think Mr Brough is misrepresenting the facts there. Is he seriously suggesting that if this amendment is passed—and Senator Hutchins has asked that the Democrats join with the opposition in opposing and defeating it—the parliamentary secretary will not have remuneration? If that is the case, if he is seriously suggesting that, then we should see an amendment from this government on this very point. This government should say, `We're going to have a parliamentary secretary but that person doesn't need to have remuneration. It will continue on.' If that is the point he is making, why doesn't he make that amendment? Why doesn't this government pick it up and make that amendment? If that is the position that the government want to adopt—if he says that we are misrepresenting the position by saying that no money will apply—that is the position that should be put.
What we are saying is that, as night follows day, if you have a parliamentary secretary, the Remuneration Tribunal will be required to provide remuneration. If I am misinformed about that and if Mr Brough is correct, perhaps during the committee stage of this bill or at the end of my speech this afternoon the relevant minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, might provide an explanation as to how the parliamentary secretary is not going to be remunerated according to Mr Brough. 
Perhaps it is worth dwelling on Mr Brough's speech in the House of Representatives, because he then went on to mandatory sentencing. He managed to weave that into his speech in the second reading debate. I have also done that, mainly because I think it highlights the inadequacy of the Northern Territory government and it highlights the inadequacy of this government to take the initiative and address the findings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999. That committee provided a clear direction for this government to progress human rights in the Northern Territory and to ensure that there was consistency across all states and that the excesses the committee saw in the Northern Territory were addressed.
What I will say in respect of that very fine issue is that the bill that we had to address went to a very narrow import; it went to an issue that some might argue was not the underlying cause of the problems that existed in the Northern Territory. However, having been to the Northern Territory during that inquiry and having had the opportunity to speak to many of the people who made submissions and to the community groups that had an interest in mandatory sentencing, what became obvious was that there are underlying structural problems that the Northern Territory government is not addressing. There is a lack of initiative, a lack of courage, a lack of fortitude, and a lack of will to address those underlying problems.
The people thought, as I understood it, that mandatory sentencing was but one of those underlying problems and that, if you could start to move the Northern Territory government on these issues which went to structural or legislative difficulties, they would understand that they could not hide behind simple, old-fashioned legislative means to deal with crime or to deal with population problems in the Northern Territory but would have to look at the underlying structural problems and start to address those in a meaningful way. That is what those people were going to, and that is one of the issues that I think has been lost in much of the debate on this—that is, the bill itself would not fix the problems but it would send a clear message to the Northern Territory government that they needed to make changes, that they needed to catch up to the rest of Australia and that they needed to address not only the concerns of the legislation offending international covenants but also how the legislation was really out of step with the rest of Australia.
I also wanted to speak about the amendment in schedule 5A—amendments relating to the sale of the Australian National Railways Commission—far more cogently. We have also recently been provided with a report of the Inquiry into Progress in Rail Reform. Queensland is crying out for the federal government to deal with rail reform in a logical and strategic way. The report itself provides an overview to give some understanding of where we are going. At 2.1, Rail transport in Australia, it states:
In Australia, rail transport represents around 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product and 8 per cent of total transport value added... In 1998, there were at least 36 500 full-time workers employed by the railways. 
There are some 43100 km of broad (1600 mm), standard (1435 mm), narrow (1067mm) and dual gauge track in Australia. Most of Australia's railway network is centred on capital cities or ports, extending to rural areas and mining regions. 
In Queensland there are initiatives, and I had the opportunity of speaking to the Gold Coast mayor before his election. I congratulate him on his re-election and hope that he will continue to press for rail reform.
—A progressive person at the Gold Coast, perhaps I should say. His major initiative in terms of rail reform is a light rail track around the Gold Coast. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-05-09,"—We are dealing with what is, in effect, an omnibus bill. We used to have a lot of omnibus bills in this place a while back, but the decision was made not to persist with them because it was said that an amendment might be put through without proper consideration being given to it. The Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 is a bill of comparatively few pages and, having heard the debate that has taken place so far, I do not think it could be said that the matters being put through this omnibus bill should have been given more consideration.
I simply raise that because I think it is an interesting point. When I first came here, there were quite thick omnibus bills whereby all sorts of acts were amended and, within those omnibus bills, you would get an amendment to an act that was not appropriately put through with the sort of debate that took place. In other words, the debate was not long enough. Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, you would remember that because, like myself, you have been here for some time. May I say, you have worn the journey better than I have. In the event that this is a trend for omnibus bills, I sound that warning but, as I say, it does not seem to be of a size that would occasion that alarm.
Some issues have been raised so far, and I perhaps should reiterate some of them. It does appear that the issue of parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory ought to be commented upon. It has been already commented on, and an analysis has been made of the number of people who have executive positions in the Northern Territory government compared to the number of Northern Territory government party members. Out of 18 members, nine are ministers, one is a whip, one is the Speaker and one is a parliamentary secretary. The real problem is that the concentration of the people in the governing party in the Northern Territory should simply be on governing. But that party really has become a party of administrators. There is not that devotion to legislation that there ought to be.
In this chamber, for example, there are a number of people who are in the executive and a number of people who are parliamentary secretaries, but there is also a very significant number of people who are there to legislate. That is what parliaments are about, after all, and the parliament of the Northern Territory should be a parliament not only in name but also in reality. But it is hard to see how that can be the situation, given the number of people who have executive work to do. I would have thought that, instead of encouraging more appointments to the executive, such as this bill does in making provision for parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory, more attention should be given to legislation, more attention should be given to those principles that should guide any legislation. One of the results of this shortcoming of the parliament of the Northern Territory—that is, that it does not have enough parliamentarians as such—may be that you do not get the principles brought forward that you ought to. Maybe that is really behind the problem of mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory, which has been commented on here today and in the past.
It occurs to me when I look at this legislation that is now before the parliament and the emphasis that is given to the executive function of the people who are elected that those principles that should be emphasised in debate fall by the roadside because what is happening is that the whole thing is dominated very much by the executive. I am not saying for one minute that the executive is not a very powerful force in this parliament; it is. But when you have nine ministers, as previous speakers have said, and one parliamentary secretary already, then 10 out of 18, more than half the members of the governing party in the Northern Territory, are administrators in the sense of being members of the executive. That is a very bad balance to have when you are talking about issues such as mandatory sentencing. Mandatory sentencing is all about conscience, all about doing the right thing, all about looking at people as they really are with all their faults and also all their goodness. Those sorts of things are not considered in debating a bill such as the bill that brought in mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory, and what happens instead is that the administrators sit down around a table and say, `Yes, we have this problem. Bang—let's just do this.'  
I think this bill, insofar as it encourages the appointment of parliamentary secretaries and rewards people for becoming a parliamentary secretary, sets a bad trend, particularly in a parliament of this size. If you look at the wage structure for parliamentarians, you will see that it starts with paying people because they are legislators and then the other functions they perform attract remuneration after that. But, if we pass this bill, we are simply sending people to the Northern Territory parliament as supplies to the reservoir of people who then go on to become ministers or parliamentary secretaries. As Senator Hutchins has said, there are only two people there who are not rewarded with extra money—only two people who are there as legislators purely and simply. I think there were some chairs of committees, but I am not sure what particular function they perform. Perhaps it is the same as people do here. Perhaps it might be better to count them as legislators as well, but that then brings the number to five out of 18. That is the issue regarding the Northern Territory. 
Then we have issues about the Cocos Islands, Christmas Island and indeed the Northern Territory to do with what laws are to apply to people who go from Western Australia to work on Christmas Island and on the Cocos Islands. Senator Crossin spoke eloquently about this. She pointed out that there were agreements in place that provided for people from Western Australia who go to the islands to work. The situation was that they were to be covered by the Western Australian Industrial Relations Act. But now it seems that legislation is going to be brought in specifically to cover all this. That is set out in schedule 3 of the bill insofar as it applies to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and schedule 2 applies to Christmas Island. Those schedules set out a new regime for what happens on those islands in terms of the Workplace Relations Act, and that has been dealt with by Senator Crossin, Senator Hutchins and Senator Ludwig. 
If you look at the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act, you will see that amendments were made in 1992 which made the law of Western Australia largely applicable on the islands. As I remember it, the rules of evidence and procedures that applied in the Western Australian courts would apply in a court operated on the islands. I think it should be recognised that there is a lot of cross-fertilisation between Western Australia and the islands, even though in the federal elections the islands vote in the Northern Territory jurisdiction. I know the member for the Northern Territory, Mr Warren Snowdon, goes and does work on those islands, as no doubt do the senators from the Northern Territory.
The reality is that those islands are subject, in the end, to the laws of the Commonwealth—the laws that we make here. The laws that operate on the islands, insofar as they apply to workplace relations and to the Workplace Relations Act, are satisfactory at the moment, and the change is precipitant as there has not been enough discussion, as I understand it, with the ACTU and other unions. As a result, the opposition is opposed to the way this matter is being dealt with, and properly so, because the working conditions on the island—as with working conditions everywhere—are fundamental matters for parliament to deal with, so that people are able to work in decent surroundings, with decent conditions and with proper wages.
As some amendments have been suggested to the bill by the Democrats, this matter will go into committee and perhaps we can develop these issues further then. The opposition opposes these matters, as set out by Senator Mackay, and again that will provide further opportunities for having some words about this. 
Senator Greig from the Australian Democrats turned to the issue of mandatory sentencing again. No doubt that will be an ongoing matter for this parliament to deal with, and to think about, in terms of various human rights conventions and, ultimately, in terms of the decency of the situation. It is just wrong to lock young children up in a capricious fashion, and what I mean by `capricious fashion' is in a fashion that is not guided by principles and is not guided by the consideration of the particular situation. In any event, this bill has raised some fundamental issues, and I am looking forward to further discussion of them during the committee stage. I think I will give Senator West just time enough to deliver her eloquent address. ",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-05-09,"—Thank you, Senator Cooney; I thought you were going to speak for your full time. In beginning this debate and discussion, I think it is very important to realise that the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 was introduced into the House of Representatives, as I understand it, on 9 December 1999. It is now 9 May 2000, and today, according to the amendment sheet, this government comes up with another 11 amendments on something that is not even in the original bill—it is just as well this is an omnibus bill. But one has to wonder where the government and Minister Anderson have been for the last six months. These would appear not to be relatively new issues that the government did not know about; it does not strike me that they were new issues. Some of them, of course, are simply to correct technical drafting errors—there are several of those. But one has to assume and draw a conclusion that we are looking here at sloppy government.
I know that the correction of simple errors does take place, but one really does have to wonder. This relates to the Australian National Railways Commission and the winding up and the sale of it, the preserving of authority for the issuing of essential land identification certificates and making amendments so that the South Australian Registrar-General will be able to register the title accurately and appropriately. Really and truly, some of your basic criteria, basic pieces of knowledge, I would have thought, would have been the knowledge that registrars-general of land titles require fairly detailed and specific identification of the pieces of land which they are going to be involved in registering. Whenever you go and do something with your house—sell it, buy it or whatever—there is always a need to have it surveyed. But we are having to move this as it is expected to take some years to complete the surveying and documentation processes necessary for the issue of the certificates.
If I have this incorrect, I would be happy for the minister to correct me and explain why it will take this time, because we are told that it is essential for section 67AZJ to remain in effect. This is important. For six months the government has had this legislation in the parliament and at the eleventh hour—at the 59th second, of the 59th minute, of the 23rd hour of the day—this government discovers it has to move some amendments. Really and truly, the sloppiness never fails to amaze me. When we are ready to discuss this bill, we suddenly discover we have 11 new amendments from the government. That is not good administration of this country when the government has to do that. It is important, I think, that governments know when they are going to sell assets—and this government has had plenty of experience in selling. One would have thought that it would have known that it was going to be essential to have all the land title changes under control but, no, apparently not.
 One of the amendments also plays around with the definitions of `WA Act' in section 8P of schedule 2. It would appear that the government are a bit confused as to what the WA act is and the definition of a WA employee in relation to South Australia as well. Amendment (4) is also very interesting where it says:
This will ensure WA employees covered by enterprise bargaining agreements are included in the amended definition of WA employee.
One might almost get the impression that perhaps the government have given up on trying to force people into AWAs and that they are recognising that enterprise bargaining is still the way many people are going.
That is enough of these new amendments to this legislation that the government have introduced. Let us look at some of the other aspects of the legislation. They are looking at fulfilling our obligations under the 1991 Madrid Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. This is vitally important. It is an amendment that is not at all controversial and one we support. The environmental protection of that particular piece of territory is important because it is a fragile area; it is as close as you are going to get to pristine. The research and the work that the Australian Antarctic Division are doing down there is highly commendable. A couple of weeks ago, the National Capital and External Territories Committee did an inspection and briefing from the Antarctic Division in Hobart and were able to see the very vital and valuable work that is being conducted down there on our behalf. So we have no problems with that particular amendment. 
There are a couple of other aspects of the legislation that really are appalling. One relates to extending the number of parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory. It strikes me that it has got to the stage in the Northern Territory that if you are a member of the Country Liberal Party and you have your backside on a seat in parliament you are going to get a job, no matter what. I do not think there are too many who do not have a job, and this is probably going to extend the jobs to everybody on the government side. I guess that is one way of shutting up those who might be a bit dissident—you keep them all with a bit of the nose into the pork barrel. That keeps them happy and secures your tenure. We certainly know what people in the Northern Territory would think about that and we have grave concerns about it.
The amendment I want to deal with relates to some changes the government are endeavouring to make to the Cocos and Christmas islands employment and workplace relations arrangements. A number of years ago, starting in 1992, a review into the legislative arrangements on the islands was conducted. It concluded that Western Australian law should be extended to the islands, providing them with a living body of law. But the Commonwealth retained power over industrial relations issues, as well as maintaining the power to expressly apply any other piece of Commonwealth legislation.
Under the Commonwealth industrial relations act, there is an interstateness requirement which is needed to activate the relevant provisions. This was removed in relation to the islands. Under the new legal regime, there was also provision for the Commonwealth to enter into service delivery arrangements with the Western Australian government to ensure the effective application and administration of the Western Australian laws in force in the territories. Agreements have since been reached with most WA state government agencies with a number of SDAs in existence.
When the new regime was introduced, the Western Australian government was concerned with the operation of Commonwealth industrial relations law on the islands, as many WA public sector employees would be working on the islands under the SDAs. They were also concerned that a dispute arising on the islands might spread back to Western Australia, fulfilling the interstateness requirement and bringing the Commonwealth industrial relations act into operation in relation to WA. When we had a good Labor government in the Commonwealth, that was probably a good thing—not now.
To avoid this, the Western Australian government sought to have WA public sector employees working on the islands exempted from the operation of the Commonwealth industrial relations law operating there. Responding to this, the ACTU, the Trades and Labour Council on the island and the WA government undertook quite a deal of negotiation and consultation. The WA government was not satisfied with all of that and entered into formal negotiations with the federal government and the ACTU. In 1994 an agreement was completed that the Christmas and Cocos islands acts would be amended to disapply their industrial relations provisions in relation to WA public servants. The implementation of this did not occur before the 1996 federal election, and in 1996 was delayed by the introduction of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. We have heard nothing from this government since then. Now we have this bill before us which attempts to bring the majority of workers on Christmas and Cocos under the Western Australian industrial relations scheme. This is without consultation with anybody—no consultation at all. It is interesting to note that when people live in a democracy they expect to be able to elect the people who are going to represent them. In this case, people are not going to be able to do that. If their industrial relations is under Western Australia law, there is no way that the people of Christmas and Cocos islands will get any democratic say on that issue, because their representatives come from the Northern Territory. To me, this seems to be a very great anathema and problem for the people of Christmas and Cocos islands.  
I am aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, that we have a couple of issues to finish before 6 o'clock and I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date.

—Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place the Budget Speech for 2000-01.
As we enter the new century, Australia's economic prospects are strong.
We have done some hard yards and they are now starting to show results.
We have weathered the Asian financial crisis. Our economy has grown—above 4 per cent for 11 quarters—with strong and consistent growth in a way we have not seen for the last three decades.
Today there are 650,000 more Australians in jobs than there were four years ago. Unemployment has fallen below 7 per cent—the lowest level in 10 years—and this year it will fall further. By June next year, unemployment is forecast to fall to 6¼ per cent.
The Budget the Treasurer is presenting tonight is in surplus for the fourth year in a row, a cash surplus of $2.8 billion. This means the Government is acting responsibly. It is not spending money it doesn't have. It is not running up debts that would weigh down future generations. In fact it is not running up debts at all. In net terms this Government has not borrowed a dollar since it was elected. 
When the Coalition Government was first elected four years ago in 1996 it was given a job to do—the job of fixing the financial mess caused by Labor's splurge which ran us $80 billion into debt over five years. We set out three goals—to get the budget in surplus, to halve the ratio of debt to the economy, and to do this without increasing taxes.
We have met all these goals. And by June next year, the end of this Budget period, we will have paid back $50 billion of Labor's $80 billion debt. We will have more than halved it. This has secured a better financial future for the Nation.
When the Government came to office, nearly $9 billion of taxpayers' money was needed to pay the interest bills on Labor's debt. Today net interest bills are around $6 billion—a saving to taxpayers of $3 billion year after year. Back in 1995-96, the Commonwealth spent about the same on interest payments as it did on schools and hospitals. It spent nearly as much on interest payments as it did on defence.
But today we have different priorities. Paying off the debt and reducing our interest bills means that today we can spend on more important things. Spending on hospitals and schools has grown by $3.7 billion while interest payments have fallen by $3 billion. Today defence spending doubles the Government spending on its interest bills.
It has always been Government policy to fix the financial mess so we can spend taxpayers' money on more important things, on higher priorities. This Budget targets our most important priorities with measures for better health care and help for families. This is a Budget which secures their future. And this Budget cuts taxes.
East Timor Levy
This time last year, we did not know that Australian troops would be required to lead a multinational force to restore order and save lives in East Timor. When the level of the engagement and the costs became known, the Government announced a one-off 12 month levy to cover the unexpected costs and keep the budget in surplus. The levy, to apply from 1 July next, phased in at 0.5 per cent after $50,000 of income and 1.0 per cent after $100,000 of income.
Our forces performed magnificently. INTERFET was able to hand over smoothly to a new UN peacekeeping force. This meant a saving on the expected cost. And our economy has grown stronger than we expected back in November last year. We can now afford to maintain the Australian Defence Force role as part of the UN force and keep the Budget in surplus. Since the levy was announced as a measure to keep the Budget in surplus and the Budget will now be in surplus without it, it would not be right to proceed with the levy. Tonight I announce that there will be no East Timor levy as from 1 July. It will not be introduced.
Tax Reform
Like the last four Budgets, this Budget contains:
no increase in company tax—in fact, company tax will be cut from 36 to 34 per cent on 1 July;
no increase in the rates of wholesale sales tax—in fact, all wholesale sales tax will be abolished in 53 days;
no increase in income tax—in fact, in 53 days the largest income tax cuts ever to come into force in Australia will take place.
On 1 July every taxpayer will receive an income tax cut. 80 per cent of Australians—some on top rates of 43 per cent—will pay a top rate no higher than 30 per cent. Families will have their benefits increased as part of the largest overhaul of family assistance—ever—and these changes will give families more disposable income to outweigh any price rises from Goods and Services Tax.
On 1 July pensions will be increased 4 per cent. All pensions, aged pensions, service pensions, widow pensions and all allowances will increase 4 per cent. This is an advance to cover any price effect of GST. After 1 July pensions will be indexed to keep them 2 per cent higher than they would have been without tax reform.
On 1 July we introduce a New Tax System, one of the largest structural changes to the Australian economy—probably the largest—since World War II. It reforms income tax, indirect tax, family assistance, business tax and Commonwealth-State financial relations. 
Every dollar raised by Goods and Services Tax is paid to the State and Territory Governments. It is the money that will provide the schools, the hospitals, the police, and the roads of the future. The days of State Governments relying on Financial Assistance Grants from the Commonwealth are now over. From 1 July they have a revenue base that grows in line with the economy. It will provide a secure base to fund their services. And from 1 July they must start to abolish narrow, inefficient taxes which they no longer need to rely on. First to be abolished will be bed taxes, then after 12 months stamp duties on shares and Financial Institutions Duty will be abolished on 1 July 2001.
Australia's outdated, inefficient tax system has held back our economy. It has chained our exporters who have taxes built into the price of their products when the rest of the world lets their exporters sell on world markets tax free. Our tax system has chained the manufacturing industry with a disproportionate tax burden on goods. From 1 July the New Tax System will break these shackles on our exporters and manufacturers.
The current tax system has also penalised business with high costs for transport. On 1 July diesel costs for heavy transport will fall 24 cents per litre and diesel costs for medium transport vehicles will fall by the same amount for transport outside the major urban areas.
On 21 September last year cuts in capital gains tax came into effect. Individuals are now liable to pay capital gains tax on only 50 per cent of their gain if they hold the asset for at least 12 months. When a small business owner wants to retire, from 55, he or she can sell any active business asset held for 15 years free of any capital gains tax. This is part of building a business tax system that is efficient and competitive, that helps business get on and create jobs. By abolishing wholesale sales tax, lowering capital gains tax and lowering company tax rates we are building an internationally competitive business tax regime.
The big changes—the hard yards of reform—are not easy. If reforming the tax system were easy it would have been done some time previously in the last 70 years. But the Government has taken the view that it should do the right thing—even though it might be the hard thing—where that is necessary for our country and our people to achieve their full opportunities.
Reform is hard. Some have tried to use that to their advantage—to pretend tax reform is not needed or pretend that while the rest of the world changes Australia can just stay the same. Of course that is false. Some are cynical enough to say this even when they know it is false. And there are some who oppose reform while hoping that one day they can take the benefits of it. But you can't have the benefits if you won't do the work.
The hard work of Budget repair has given us the opportunity to bring about some benefits in priority areas—families, health and improving services in regional Australia.
Regional Health Package
There are many problems faced by those in regional areas. Not all regions, but in many regions, where prices for rural products are low, times have been hard. Sometimes people outside the cities feel left behind as the service sector and the new industries of the economy grow so strongly.
A Government which claims it has a cure-all for all the problems of the regions is not being honest. It is better to focus on particular problems and try to make a real difference—to make a big difference in a defined area—than to have ill-defined proposals across a large area—which is to promise a lot but deliver little.
In this Budget, the Government has decided to focus on a particular problem—the lack of medical services in the regions of Australia. In the metropolitan areas there is an average of 1,000 people for each GP. Outside the cities it is 1,500. This is an area where we want to focus and make a real difference.
Tonight the Treasurer is announcing a major new four year Regional Health Package of $562 million. This Package will address a key concern of rural and regional communities—more doctors and better services. 
The number of general practitioner (GP) services in rural and regional areas will be significantly boosted by increasing the number of training places for GPs and increasing the distribution of training places to rural areas. We will boost the number of GP registrars in rural and regional Australia by at least 75 in 2000-01 rising to at least 225 in 2002-03. Many of these registrars are likely to practice in rural and regional Australia after their training has ended.
The Regional Health Package includes a longer-term strategy to increase the number of doctors in rural communities. We will encourage students from the country to study medicine and support medical graduates who go out to practice in rural areas. To enable more students from the country to undertake medical training, the number of Rural Australian Medical Undergraduate Scholarships will be doubled.
The Government will also create 100 new University places for medical students who are prepared to enter a bond to practise in rural areas for at least six years after they have qualified. The students will be paid a scholarship of $20,000 per annum for the period of their undergraduate training. During the bond they can only practise in rural areas. The scholarships and places will cost $32 million over four years.
People in rural areas have difficulty accessing specialist medical services. This Budget introduces financial incentives and payment of travel costs to specialists to go out and deliver services to regional areas—a cost of $48 million over four years—and it funds communities to employ practice nurses, psychologists, physiotherapists and podiatrists at an additional $49 million over four years.
This Budget also provides for the establishment of nine new clinical schools and three new university departments of rural health to make sure every Australian medical faculty has a regionally based clinical training facility and every Australian medical student has the opportunity to train in rural service delivery. This will support rural health practitioners.
Madam President, Regional Health Services have proved a successful way to deliver a range of medical, community health, mental health and aged care services to smaller communities which could not support stand-alone services. The Government will build on these successful services with 85 additional services over the next four years costing $69 million. In recognition of the important role of pharmacists in rural health infrastructure, additional assistance of around $42 million over four years will be provided to improve access to quality pharmacy services in rural and remote Australia.
Other Regional Measures
In addition to the Rural Health Package, this Budget contains a range of measures to strengthen the economic base of rural areas and improve the access of all Australians to important services.
The Agriculture Advancing Australia (AAA) package has played a major role in improving the competitiveness and profitability of the farming sector since it was introduced by this Government in 1997. The Government will therefore continue it and enhance it over the next four years. This $309 million program will give farmers skills training, encourage innovation, improve market access for our agricultural and food exports and enhance support to families in financial difficulty.
In recognition of the high costs of education for people living in remote parts of Australia, the Government is increasing Assistance for Isolated Children. The Basic Boarding Allowance paid to children who cannot get to a government school on a daily basis will be increased by a further 10 per cent, which builds on the 20 per cent increase to this allowance announced in last year's budget. 
Improving the access and participation of students from rural and regional areas to quality education is a high priority. So the Government will modify the Youth Allowance family assets test to increase access to Youth Allowance. An income test will still apply but the assets test on farm and business assets will be relaxed. Youth Allowance has proven to be successful in encouraging young people's participation in education.  
To ensure that advances in technology extend to regional areas the Government is providing regional television broadcasters with assistance to convert to digital broadcasting—starting from this year. The Regional Equalisation Plan will provide assistance in the form of annual licence fee rebates and some small taxable grants to cover the relatively high digital conversion costs of these broadcasters which have a smaller audience reach. Assistance will also be given to the ABC and SBS to televise in digital format from 1 January 2001.
Education
Madam President, our education and training system must focus on giving students skills to have the opportunity to find meaningful jobs. This Government recognises the importance of education to ensuring our nation's future and our children's future. The apprenticeship system had been left to wither until this Government revived it in 1996. This Budget provides a very heavy investment in apprenticeships providing $2 billion over four years for the highly successful New Apprenticeships initiative.
It continues the Government's heavy investment in schooling, both government and non-government. Outlays are projected to rise by nearly a third over the next four years—one of the fastest growing areas of the Budget. This expenditure is aimed at lifting literacy and numeracy. It is aimed at improving the core elements of education. And this Government wants to make sure schools are accountable for this high level funding—that children are being given the skills they need for the future.
Stronger Families and Communities
Madam President, a stamp of this Government has been its commitment to helping families.
Before this Government came to office the Commonwealth spent the same amount paying interest bills on its debt as it spent on family assistance. In this Budget spending on families doubles the spending on interest payments.
From 1 July over 2 million families will benefit from increased family assistance—$2.4 billion a year. A single income family on $40,000 with two children, one under five years of age, will receive tax cuts and increased family payments equal to $50.63 per week from 1 July.
From 1 July twelve different types of family assistance will be simplified into three. The assets test on family assistance will be abolished. The income threshold for family payments will be eased and as a family's earnings increase less of their family assistance will be clawed back. Most importantly the level of family assistance will increase. 
Families need help—and investing in families is the best way of helping children. That is why the Government has the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. This Strategy substantially funds initiatives to support parents and try to prevent family breakdown. The Strategy will seek to reduce the incidence of serious social problems such as family violence, and child learning problems, by prevention and early intervention where there are problems.
A major component of the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is an additional $65 million over four years to assist families fulfil both work and family responsibilities through increased flexibility and choice of childcare. Subsidies will be provided for in-home care and incentives will be increased to establish childcare centres in rural areas. Families who will particularly benefit from this proposal include families working outside standard business hours; families who have a sick child; and families who live in rural and regional Australia.
The Budget also includes a package of Child Support measures. These include measures to encourage child support payers to maintain contact with their children after separation and to improve relationships after family breakdown. The measures also assist child support payers in the task of supporting the children of their subsequent families.  
A Fair and Effective Welfare System 
Madam President, the Government is committed to maintaining a fair and effective social welfare system. The Government wants to make sure there is help for those who need it but also to make sure our welfare system does not become a trap preventing self-reliance and self-improvement. The Government has set up an independent review of the welfare system and a final report will be released later this year to provide principles for the future reform of the welfare system.
This process will build on the Government's considerable record in this area with the work-for-the-dole initiatives and the concept of mutual obligation—the obligation of the community to the individual and the obligation of the individual, in return, to the community.
Since coming to office, this Government has worked to improve compliance, cut down on fraud and put in place eligibility criteria to ensure social welfare only goes to the truly disadvantaged. In total we now save $750 million per year of taxpayers' dollars through these efforts.
This Budget introduces further measures to ensure that assistance is provided only to those genuinely entitled to it. In particular, we are introducing Preparing for Work Agreements to ensure those claiming unemployment payments understand their responsibilities and comply with eligibility criteria. This is expected to deliver savings of $212 million over four years. The agreement will deliver a strong `up-front' message to all job seekers that they must meet their obligation to actively search for work and participate in a range of additional activities in return for receiving unemployment payments. One-to-one assistance with the same designated Centrelink officer will encourage the economic participation of the unemployed people involved.
The Government will also introduce measures to ensure those who hold their assets in private trusts and private companies are treated comparably to those who hold them directly. There will not be the advantage, as there is now, to have assets in trusts and companies so they are not fully taken into account for social security purposes. This is expected to deliver savings of around $300 million over the next four years by reducing benefits to those with access to substantial assets.
Border Integrity
The rapid increase in the number of unauthorised immigrants arriving in Australia has placed considerable pressures on the Budget. The Government announced a major package last year to detect, deter and prevent the entry of illegal immigrants into Australia, including increased coastal surveillance. In this Budget, an additional $49 million over four years is allocated to further measures to control these arrivals.
The growth of organised people smuggling underpins the recent increases in unauthorised boat arrivals. We will tackle this problem by a coordinated effort across government agencies to identify and combat people smuggling at its source. We are also introducing initiatives for transit countries to protect displaced persons until repatriation or resettlement in third countries becomes possible. Mutual obligation and other welfare requirements are also being expanded to temporary protection visa holders. 
In addition, a long-term strategy focusing on future detention requirements for unauthorised arrivals and visa over-stayers is being introduced. The Government will build a new detention facility at Darwin to ensure appropriate detention capacity will be available in the future.
Defending Australia
The Government places a high priority on maintaining a modern and capable defence force. We have maintained defence funding in real terms since coming to office and have achieved a shift in defence resources towards combat capability and readiness.
The Government is in the process of a major review of Australia's defence requirements and will release a Defence White Paper later in the year. In this Budget, however, a one-off increase of $100 million in 2000-01 has been provided to address immediate priorities in defence force reserves and improve information management systems and logistics. 
This Budget also contains $128 million additional funding in 2000-01 for the enhancement of two Collins Class submarines. The upgrade will result in two operational Collins Class submarines when the final Oberon Class retires in 2001. The Government will make a decision about the level of capability of all six Collins submarines in the context of its Defence White Paper deliberations.
Veterans
Madam President, it is time the nation gave our Vietnam Veterans the recognition they deserve. This Budget carries through the Coalition's commitment to Vietnam veterans, with a $32 million package of measures to support them and their families through the illnesses to which they are especially susceptible. 
And the care of veterans in their own homes under the Home and Community Care Programme will be transferred to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will give them special care. It will also free up additional places in the general programme for other elderly citizens. 
The Budget also grants entitlement to full repatriation benefits to around 2,600 veterans for their service during the Malayan Emergency and other South-East Asian conflicts during the period 1955 to 1975.
As we mark the Centenary of Federation, Australians will have the opportunity to remember with pride the role that our service men and women have played in shaping the nation with new funding for a commemorative program for our service men and women.
East Timor
Madam President, during the Australian-led INTERFET operations from September 1999 to early this year, around 6,500 personnel from the Australian Defence Force helped to restore peace to East Timor. Over 2,000 ADF personnel remain in East Timor as part of the United Nations peacekeeping effort, along with many other Australians performing important security and humanitarian tasks. We can be very proud of the outstanding efforts of these Australians.
In 1999-2000 Australia will spend approximately $900 million as part of its commitment to East Timor. The bulk of this cost relates to the substantial deployment of the Australian Defence Forces as the lead force in the INTERFET operation. While the expected cost of Australia's deployment in 2000-01 has declined from previous estimates it is still substantial, at $831 million (net of UN reimbursement).
This Budget extends Australia's assistance to relieve the suffering of the people of East Timor and rebuild the country. It provides $150 million for humanitarian relief and reconstruction for East Timor over the next four years, $100 million of this being new funding. The focus of aid in East Timor has shifted from emergency relief to long term development, to restore basic services and to improve governance.
Australia is also making an important contribution to East Timor's civil security. Last year, the Government agreed to increase its commitment to the United Nations Administration's civilian police force from our first detachment of 50 personnel to 80 personnel. This Budget has allocated around $104 million over the next four years to continue this commitment.
Economic Outlook
Madam President, Australia is set to continue its strong economic performance in 2000-01 with solid growth, new jobs, and low ongoing inflation.
Following three years of economic growth above 4 per cent, growth is expected to remain strong at around 3¾ per cent in 2000-01.
While domestic demand is expected to grow at a more moderate pace than in recent years, net exports should make a bigger contribution to growth flowing from a strengthening world economy and the tourism associated with the Olympics. 
This shift in growth from domestic demand to exports will reduce the current account deficit, forecast to average 4¾ per cent of GDP in 2000-01, down from 5½ per cent of GDP in the previous year. 
The strong economic growth of recent years and moderate wage outcomes has reduced the unemployment rate to around its lowest levels in a decade. The unemployment rate is expected to fall further, to 6¼ per cent by the June quarter 2001. From there on we would be on the verge of the lowest unemployment rates in a quarter of a century.
Leaving aside the one-off price-impact of changes in indirect taxes, inflationary pressures are expected to remain low. `On-going' inflation is forecast to be around 2½ per cent through the year to the June quarter 2001. 
The New Tax System is expected to add around 2¾ percentage points to the CPI through the year to the June quarter 2001. Households will be more than compensated for these one-off price changes through income tax cuts and increases in payments. The changes to indirect tax arrangements are therefore not expected to have any significant impact on wage settlements or ongoing inflation. 
Concluding Comments
Madam President, this Budget lays a strong economic and social foundation to secure the future for Australia. 
We enter the new century with a budget in surplus and a debt reduction strategy better than any comparable country in the world.
We have strong prospects, and if the economy continues to grow at current rates historically low unemployment is within our reach.
We are about to accomplish the historic reform of Australia's failing tax system.
This Budget brings together our economic and our social goals: lower taxes, more jobs, better health care, stronger families.
I commend the Budget to the Senate. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the Budget statement and documents.
