"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,1998-11-10,"—It is with great pleasure that I propose to the House for its Speaker the honourable member for Wakefield, Mr Andrew. I move:
That the honourable member for Wakefield do take the chair of this House as Speaker.
—Is the motion seconded?
—It gives me great pleasure to second the motion moved by the member for Corangamite that the member for Wakefield be the Speaker of this House.
—Does the honourable member for Wakefield accept the nomination?
—Mr Clerk, I accept the nomination.
—Is there any further proposal? There being no further proposal, the time for proposals has expired. I declare that the honourable member proposed, Mr Andrew, has been elected as Speaker.
—Hear, hear!",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1998-11-10,"—I wish to express my grateful thanks for the high honour the House has been pleased to confer upon me.
Mr Speaker having seated himself in the chair—",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-11-10,"—Mr Speaker, can I, on behalf of the government—and I know that I will speak perhaps on this one occasion on behalf of the entire House—extend very warm congratulations to you. The House has made an excellent choice. You are a person who is widely regarded in this House. You are regarded as a person of deep commitment to your electorate, a person who deals honestly and candidly with people. You bring to the office of Speaker a long parliamentary history, having entered the parliament in the 1983 election as the member for Wakefield. You have previously served as Chief Government Whip and in a variety of other positions within the coalition parties.
The position of Speaker is a very important one. It is a difficult role. The robust nature of political debate in the Australian tradition ensures that it will always be a difficult role. Let me say, on behalf of the government, that we will support very much any attempts you make to bring greater civility and dignity to the proceedings of the parliament. We naturally expect robust debate. It is the Australian tradition, and people who imagine that you can have debates in this parliament that are free of very strong and on occasions acrimonious exchange are misunderstanding completely the character of this chamber. But I do think there is within the Australian community a desire, where appropriate, for higher levels of civility in parliamentary behaviour. I have a responsibility and the members of the government have a responsibility to contribute to that. The Leader of the Opposition has a responsibility and the members of the opposition have a responsibility to contribute to that.
You come to this very high office, this very important political and parliamentary office, with one very great commodity, and that is that you have the respect of your colleagues. Respect is the golden commodity in public life, and you bring to this office that golden commodity. It is an excellent start. I congratulate you. It is properly a great source of great personal satisfaction to you and your family. I wish you well. You will do it well. You will have our goodwill and you will have our support.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-11-10,"—Mr Speaker, can I join the Prime Minister in congratulating you and agree with almost everything that the Prime Minister said in the remarks that he made. He did speak on this occasion for the whole House; I speak on this occasion for the largest party in this House.
—But you didn't win the election.
—We are pleased to see you in that position. The reasons why we chose not to oppose you were many and varied. Not least of the reasons was because of the parliamentary service to which the Prime Minister referred. It is always pleasing to those of us who have been in this parliament for a while, and I suspect too for those who recently 
 joined it, to see somebody who is diligent in his or her work in the House, who represents the parliament effectively on parliamentary delegations, who devotes themselves to detailed committee work, who has the understanding of his peers that allows him to be appointed to a position such as Chief Government Whip, being accorded the high office of Speaker ultimately as an accolade and an indication of confidence that that person knows the procedures of the House and the spirit of the place, and knows the attitudes, the foibles, the difficulties and the problems that are going to beset a person in that office. We have confidence that you understand all those things. That, as I said, is one of the reasons that we chose not to oppose you.
We also, however, note that you come with a chequered background in terms of your predecessors in relation to the last chamber. It was the Prime Minister's earnest good faith at the beginning of the last parliament to see an independent Speaker emerge. We on this side of the chamber still share that desire, but it is yet to be demonstrated as far as the other side is concerned. You will recollect, no doubt, the stands we were obliged to take in defence of Speaker Halverson at different points of time. We do note that, despite all his vicissitudes and the fact that he found it impossible to sustain his independence to the end, at least he has ended up as Ambassador to Ireland. It reminded me of Disraeli on his elevation to the peerage after long service in the House of Commons. One of his colleagues asked him what it felt like being elevated to the peerage and he said, `Well, I am dead; dead, but in Elysian fields.' I suspect the same applies to Mr Halverson now.
There has, of course, been another Speaker since that point of time, a Speaker whom many of us liked but who got to that position not necessarily because of a decision to uphold the independence of the place. His fate was to lose a preselection in the course of it. Those are the two precedents before you on independence.
On the other occasion when I congratulated a Speaker here, I quoted the words which we all know in this chamber from the person who actually defined the role of speakership in the 
 Westminster system, Speaker Lenthall. When Speaker Lenthall sat in parliament and the king's men approached him and asked for the whereabouts of a number of recalcitrant members of parliament, he responded, `I have neither eyes to see nor mouth to speak nor ears to hear except as the parliament directs me.' He was a courageous definer of the office at a point of time when there was no clear-cut division between the executive and the parliament and no clear determination of the rights of the two in relation to each other—it was, indeed, about to be tested in civil war. I looked into Speaker Lenthall, understanding that you would be here, to see how he ended up after all those years of diligent definition. He ended up dead, basically. The king's men finally got him. He was accused unfairly of being a regicide. I thought it was worth quoting from his confession to the Vicar of Whitney, who was later Bishop of Chichester. He said:
I confess, with Saul, I held their clothes while they murdered him; but herein I was not so criminal as Saul was; for God, Thou knowest! I never consented to his death; I ever prayed and endeavoured what I could do against it; but I did too much. Almighty God, forgive me!
He then went on to say:
Three things are especially laid to my charge, wherein indeed, I am too guilty: that I went from the Parliament to the army; that I proposed the bloody question for trying the King; and that I sat after the King's death.
He goes on to talk about Presbyterians. However, given the church service that we held this morning, it would not be appropriate for me to quote that, but he did say this:
For the second no excuse can be made, but I have the King's pardon, and I hope Almighty God will show me his mercy also. Yet, sir, even then, when I put the question—
that was the question on the king's death—
I hoped the very putting the question would have cleared him, because I believed four for one were against it; but they deceived me also.
That is an important lesson on comprehending the numbers in the House before you put a question before us. He goes on:
To the third I make this candid confession, that it was my own baseness and cowardice and unworthy fear to submit my life and estate to the mercy of 
 those men that murdered the King, that hurried me on, against my own conscience, to act with them, yet then I thought also that I might do some good and hinder some ill.
He did indeed establish a proud record but was less proud in his death. He asked that there be only one inscription on his tomb when he departed and it was the inscription `Vermis sum'. I am no Latin scholar—in fact, I know no Latin at all—but I am told by those who are that that means, `I am a worm.'
That is, however, not to be your fate. In one sense it is to be the fate of all of us, but in another sense I do not think it is to be your fate as Speaker in this chamber.
Let me say in conclusion: we accept the view that you stand here as an independent arbiter of proceedings here and that it is the duty of us all to assist you in that charge. We note, too, the fate of those who have been before you and we will be encouraging the government, as the Prime Minister admonished and encouraged us, to ensure that you have every protection of that independence. We note that there were some innovations in relation to supplementary questions and the brevity of answers: we regard those innovations, of course, as the test of true independence.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Fischer, Tim, MP",NP,1998-11-10,"—As the federal Leader of the National Party of Australia I join in congratulating you on your election to the high office of Speaker. The unanimous election of a new Speaker is a great way to start the 39th Parliament and we wish you well in that challenging role.
You come from South Australia—you are proud of that fact—and you follow in the footsteps of some very colourful former members of this parliament, including one former Speaker, Archie Cameron, who was at one stage a member of my party and at other stages a member of a raft of groupings. He was a very colourful Speaker. I do not necessarily recommend that you follow in those footsteps; I simply take the opportunity to wish you well.
I know the retired member for New England and former Speaker, who is on the floor of the chamber at this historic moment, would 
 want me to impart his congratulations to you as we salute the service that he gave as Speaker in the closing stages of the 38th Parliament. It is a challenging job, as all the occupants of your chair have found over the years. We congratulate you on your election.
I recall vividly the proximity we had to share in an experience which had its moments when we travelled on the MV Icebird as part of an inspection of Antarctica by the Joint Committee on Public Works many years ago. We spent three or four weeks in the one cabin as we travelled down to Casey base and back. There was no problem in our cabin; the problem was from the adjoining cabin occupied by Gary Nehl when he flooded us out one night. Mr Speaker, congratulations and good luck.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,1998-11-10,"—Mr Speaker, as your proposer, I add my congratulations on behalf of all your friends and supporters from Wakefield and your family. This is a historic moment in this parliament—you have been elected Speaker without another candidate. Like you, I have been here some 14 years and that has not taken place before in my time in this House. So that speaks well of your impartiality and the respect in which you are held by both sides of this House and augurs well for your speakership.
As the member for Wakefield, you bring to the parliament many qualities. We all note your free trade credentials that Bert Kelly would be so pleased you have brought to this House. Of course, you will now be impartial on those matters. You bring a sense of good cheer and a sense of humour. You are a man of honour and principle and, Mr Speaker, I wish you well for a long and distinguished career in your post as Speaker.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1998-11-10,"—Mr Speaker, I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister and my good friend the member for Corangamite in congratulating you on your election, particularly on being unopposed. I join in supporting you with some of the comments from the Prime Minister. They are very appropriate—you are someone of honesty and integrity who has the respect of all 
 members of this chamber. I have no doubt that you will indeed carry your position with dignity and with civility. The words of the Prime Minister, when he spoke of the responsibility of all members to help in upholding the standards of this chamber, certainly should be heeded by all members. There is no doubt that you as Speaker will give a lead, but I am sure that all members realise that there is a responsibility on us to support that.
It is a very special occasion, particularly as the opposition chose not to nominate someone. That augurs extremely well for your future. It is also very special to me, because of some personal connections, to have the member for Wakefield as Speaker. I think you will do great dignity to the electors of Wakefield.
While the Leader of the Opposition is to be commended on his support and on the fact that the opposition chose not to nominate someone, it was unfortunate that he then chose to make some critical remarks of your two predecessors. That was a little unfortunate, particularly considering the new Speaker has not even had the opportunity to demonstrate the great skills that he will bring to the job. Again, I congratulate you. I am sure you will do a truly outstanding job.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Nehl, Garry, MP",NP,1998-11-10,"—I rise to offer you my heartfelt congratulations. I indicate to the House that, while I was unopposed in the party room, I will be opposed later this afternoon—but of course, like you, I will win. Anticipating events later this day, I know we will work together as a very effective team.
—It has got nothing to do with ability.
—Daryl, I can still make that appointment for you. Mr Speaker, congratulations. I am delighted that you have the position and I look forward very much to working closely with you in the ensuing parliament.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1998-11-10,"—I seek the indulgence of the House to respond to the gracious remarks made by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Corangamite, the member for Wannon and the member for Cowper.
Honourable members, when Speakers come to the chair with some historic reluctance many people think it is simply feigned, but let me tell you, as someone who stands here now with a great deal of trepidation, that it is not entirely feigned. You do me a great honour in inviting me to take this chair and electing me to it, but with that goes an enormous responsibility. With the help of all of you, I hope I can discharge that responsibility effectively.
I want to respond to the gracious remarks of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Prime Minister. I also want to thank the member for Mallee for his preparedness to second my nomination. The member for Mallee and I are electoral neighbours. We have shared many mutual issues and mutual representations to various ministers and I have been grateful for his friendship.
I single out the member for Corangamite for special mention. Let me tell those who have come to this chamber and been sworn in to the 39th Parliament for the first time today—with sentiments that will be shared, I believe, by the member for Corio—that you can ask for no more fearless advocate than the member for Corangamite. The member for Corangamite will be honest with you whether you like it or not. He has this remarkable ability of ensuring that people continue to respect him while he is being brutally honest with them. I say to the member for Corangamite that, in this office and in this chair, I will need that quality and that friendship more than I have needed them at any other time in the past 14 years.
I also seek your indulgence to make a personal observation or two. My family is in the gallery. All who know me will know that, but for the support of my wife Carolyn and our three children, but for the affection that they continue to shower on me no matter what I pursue, and but for the constant reassurance that she gives to the four of us, I would not be here and the family would not be the cohesive unit that it is. On this public occasion, I express our appreciation, particularly to her.
—Hear, hear!
—I do not have a monopoly on happy family life. It is something that most of you are grateful to have experienced at some time and to be experiencing now. Nor do I have a monopoly on the security of having parents who were committed to each other and who surrounded all of us in the family with love and affection. I suspect, however, that I share with the Prime Minister and with the Leader of the Opposition the reality of being a child of the 1950s who grew up with the traditional Sunday lunch. Sunday lunch in the Andrew house was always either fried parson or fried politician, depending on how the sermon had run two hours earlier. I grew up steeped in some sort of philosophic tradition, as I know both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition did, and as most of you did as well.
Frankly, we come into this place with a great deal more in common than we have dividing us. All too frequently what the public sees is the political divide rather than the aspirations and the hope for all Australians that we share in common. As the Prime Minister alluded to, I will be seeking a great deal more civility in the House. It is inevitable that when at least two opposing political perspectives meet there will be tensions and heated debate. That is entirely responsible and defensible. What is totally indefensible and intolerable, and what the standing orders do not allow, is the sort of scorn and derision that sometimes emerge in the heat of the moment. I abhor scorn and derision. I intend to reinforce the standing orders to ensure that those characteristics do not emerge in the 39th Parliament.
I ran through all the comments that other Speakers had made and found that on this occasion they had exercised their right to much the same sentiments as I have expressed. Friends, let me indicate that it is not possible to raise the standards of this parliament unless we all genuinely desire that it should happen, unless there is peer group pressure to help make it happen, and unless as individuals we exercise some discipline, mutual respect and individual restraint.
As I come into this chair, I want to acknowledge a very happy coincidence. The 
 first occupier of the chair of the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the history of the Parliament of Australia in 1901 was Sir Frederick William Holder, who was also the member for Wakefield. I consider it a very fortunate coincidence that, at the end of this century, I should be occupying this chair as the present member for Wakefield. South Australia has had a proud tradition of members occupying this chair. As has been mentioned, Mr Makin, Mr McLeay and Mr Cameron have all been in this chair.
I have had the opportunity in 15 years in this place to witness the speakership of former Speakers Jenkins, the father of the member for Scullin; Child; McLeay; and Martin. I want to acknowledge their role in exercising an impartial judgment as Speakers of the parliament. But I want particularly to focus on the speakership of friends of mine, former Speakers Halverson and Sinclair. As the deputy whip I worked closely with Speaker Halverson. I know him well and I believe we would all join in wishing him every success and a long retirement, and express an appreciation for the role he played in this parliament.
Honourable members, we are here today for a unique glimpse of history because this is the first time that any one of us has sat in this chamber without the presence on the benches of the member for New England, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. Can I say to Ian and to his wife Rosemary: you will be sorely missed in this chamber, Ian. Your role as the Speaker was appreciated. You brought to this chair a unique presence that no-one else can quite hope to repeat. We will miss you enormously and I hope the reforms you so courageously instigated can be continued.
Honourable members, it is a privilege to be elected as the Speaker of this chamber but it is an even greater privilege for all of us, me included, to be here representing electors from 148 electorates across this country. I resolve to do all I can to fairly uphold the standing orders so that those people who have elected you and me will know that they have a voice in this place without fear or favour.",REPS,<title>SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1998-11-10,"—I move:
That Mr Nehl be appointed Deputy Speaker.
—I second the motion.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,1998-11-10,"—I move:

—The time allowed for nominations has expired.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1998-11-10,"—I have pleasure in nominating Garry Barr Nehl, the member for Cowper, for the position of Deputy Speaker. Before entering this place in 1984, the member for Cowper led a wonderfully full life which undoubtedly prepared him for the rigours ahead. He has been a racon 
 teur, journalist, author, grazier, newspaper proprietor, editor, publisher, town alderman and long-serving and distinguished member. Those are just some items from his curriculum vitae.
The member for Cowper is well known to all of us here as a most capable orator devoted to his committee work, and a conscientious and formidable representative of his electorate's needs within the National Party. Anyone who had anything to do with the Pacific Highway needs no convincing of that.
The member for Cowper has been a member of this House since 1984. During that time he has been Deputy Chairman of Committees, a member of the Speaker's Panel and Deputy Speaker for the 38th Parliament. He has served on no fewer than 12 standing, joint standing and statutory committees of the parliament and has represented the parliament on five important delegations. In addition, he has been the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the National Party, Deputy National Party Whip in the 36th Parliament and National Party Whip in the 37th Parliament.
I raise these points, Mr Speaker, to demonstrate that outside the ministry there is probably no-one in the parliament, other than yourself, better equipped to assist you in maintaining the high standards and behaviour that the Prime Minister, and I have no doubt the people of Australia, desire to see of this House.
I echo your own comments this morning, Mr Speaker: we do not need, nor do the people of Australia need, the scorn and derision associated with this place. I am sure the member for Cowper, a passionate advocate for his own electorate, would be the first to commend passionate advocacy for the House. Nevertheless, he has demonstrated in the last parliament an ability to be forceful, deliberate and fair on the one hand and urbane, counselling and witty on the other.
On the basis of his parliamentary performance, service to the House and demonstrable skills in mediating debate, I commend the member for Cowper to the House as the person best equipped to aid you, Mr Speaker, in your quest to maintain the efficient management and integrity of the parliament.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,1998-11-10,"—Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment and endorse the remarks of my colleague.
Mr Melham interjecting—
—The member for Cowper has 15 years experience in this parliament and for the last 10 years of those 15 has been dealing with problems of the parliament, including those caused by the honourable member for Banks.
I know that the member for Cowper feels passionately about the parliament, its administration and the cause of democracy. He is committed to, and absolutely enthusiastic about, the proper running of the parliament, a fair go for everybody and the full democratic process. I have great pleasure in seconding the motion.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,1998-11-10,"—Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity to also congratulate you on your ascension to high office and wish you all the very best in what is a difficult task. I hope you can last longer than your two immediate predecessors—in terms of, simply, this term, but obviously, of course, longer.
—I remind the member for Bruce that he is speaking to the motion on the nomination of Mr Jenkins.
—I want to endorse the candidacy of Harry Jenkins, the member for Scullin. I have known Harry for over 10 years now, and his brother before him, in other walks of life that I have been involved in. I have certainly found him to be a very genuine person—a person who has been an honest broker in the affairs of the Labor Party that I have been involved in. He has certainly exhibited a great deal of impartiality and a capacity and experience in the running of this House which certainly exceeds that of the other candidate, in this case the member for Cowper, who is, I admit, also a worthy candidate.
The choice today I think is quite clear. Harry Jenkins, with his experience as Deputy Chair of Committees and then as Deputy Speaker between 1993 and 1996 and Second Deputy Speaker in the last parliament, has a 
 great deal of experience. When you look at his performance in these roles over time he has shown a capacity to be able to do the job more than fairly.
I am a bit worried about moving this particular motion. I am from the Victorian SL and I lose a lot of ballots, so I am not sure I am quite the right person. It probably does not augur well in terms of the overall result on this occasion. But one thing is for sure: this one is going to be a hell of a lot closer than the last one.
As for the member for Cowper, I suspect he may succeed on this particular occasion. I certainly look forward to supporting him in the next parliament, if he is still here, for Second Deputy Speaker.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1998-11-10,"—Mr Speaker, may I also offer my congratulations to you on your appointment as Speaker of the House, and I offer you my best wishes.
It is my pleasure and honour to second the motion that the honourable member for Scullin, Mr Jenkins, be appointed Deputy Speaker. On seconding this motion, what is uppermost in my mind is the requirement that the position be filled by a member who is well qualified and in whom we have confidence that they are capable of carrying out this important role in an appropriate and deserving way.
The member for Scullin has created for himself an enviable record in this House since he became a member in 1986 at a by-election. Since then, he has been successfully returned to office on five occasions and has held an impressive number of positions in those parliaments. He has worked on more than nine different committees over various periods, some as chair, and he has served as Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker, as well as ably representing this parliament and this country on parliamentary delegations and visits.
While much of this service occurred prior to my time here, my experience of working, both in this chamber and on committee work, with the member for Scullin has given me an appreciation of the ability and dedication to the task at hand that he continues to display. 
 He also has a wonderful sense of humour—something we all need to display occasionally. I well understand why the member for Scullin is held in high regard by members on both sides of this House.
This morning I was interested to hear the member for Cowper refer to the fact that he fully expects to win the ballot this afternoon. That may well be the case. However, I strongly support the motion that the honourable member for Scullin be appointed Deputy Speaker. I take this opportunity to remind the member for Cowper and his colleagues—in a friendly fashion—that the outcome this afternoon will be much closer than it was last time and that it will in no way reflect the outcome we can expect next time.
—In accordance with the standing orders, the bells will be rung and a ballot will be taken.
The bells having been rung and a ballot having been taken—
—Order! The result of the ballot is: Mr Jenkins 66 votes; Mr Nehl 79 votes. Mr Nehl is appointed Deputy Speaker and Mr Jenkins will be the Second Deputy Speaker.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-11-10,"—On behalf of the government I would like to extend my congratulations to the member for Cowper. The member for Cowper has served in this position in the past. He has done so with enormous dedication and great professionalism. He is a robust parliamentarian. He commands authority in the chair. You always hear him, you always know what his rulings are and he is very dedicated to the task. I think he is an excellent person to fill this position, and I think the combination of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker that the parliament has chosen today is an excellent combination.
I say to the member for Scullin that my congratulations to the member for Cowper are in no way critical or reflect in a negative fashion on his own candidature. You are a person who is very conscientious when you are in the chair and you conduct yourself in a very fair-minded fashion. You do command some respect on this side of the House for 
 that. In the nature of things, I felt on balance that the member for Cowper should command my vote. I reflected on it for a moment, it hung in the air for a few minutes and, in the end, Harry, I decided to go for my friend the member for Cowper. But no offence meant. You were a worthy opponent. We wish you well as the opposition candidate for Deputy Speaker for years into the future. I congratulate the member for Cowper.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-11-10,"—I congratulate the member for Scullin and the member for Cowper on their continued presence as Deputy Speakers in this chamber. Both of them grace that office and both of them are experienced chairs of this parliament. But, of course, my heart was with the Second Deputy Speaker as opposed to the first in this instance, and he has experienced both those positions. Heart and vote go together on this occasion.
Harry Jenkins is a graceful occupant of the chair. It is in the breeding, basically, in this particular instance. I well remember his father in the chair as our first Speaker with a lengthy period of time in office. He had an interesting expression which he used to extend to both sides of the House: `You're not helping the chair.' It is a very old-fashioned reading of standing orders that the principal duty of a member of parliament when entering this chamber is to assist the chair. Whether or not honourable members help the chair, Harry Jenkins has proved himself a most effective occupant of it. He has many of the attributes that you yourself have. In fact, Mr Speaker, that wealth of parliamentary experience, that solid commitment, is there to make all the various parts of the parliamentary process work, and a deep love and affection for the forms and status of the House. He will, as he has done in the past, do remarkably well in this position.
His counterpart, who is at this stage of the game the first Deputy Speaker, will no doubt continue in exactly the shape and form that he has managed over the last little while. The best thing—not the best thing; that is a patronising and dreadful thing to say—or one of the useful things about the fact that you 
 have taken on those responsibilities is that we will not all get bored to tears about the Antarctic. You seem to have developed another interest in life, and it is all to the good that that is the case. But we wish you well in the position.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Fischer, Tim, MP",NP,1998-11-10,"—As federal Leader of the National Party of Australia, I congratulate the member for Cowper especially. I have had a very good and close working relationship with the member for Cowper over the years. I know he will meet the challenges of this position once more with great dignity and with great professionalism.
To the member for Scullin, my congratulations also. It has been a pleasure to know your father and you in the various roles that you have performed as members of this House, particularly in your roles as the Second Deputy Speaker and head of the second chamber or Main Committee, as it is referred to in the standing orders.
I make the point that the family of the member for Cowper—and, I think, the family of the member for Scullin—are in the galleries. To the families of all of those elected today I extend a degree of sympathy because the schedules and commitments associated with these high offices are very demanding on those families. We salute the contribution that you make, including the wife of the member for Cowper, Sue Nehl. We wish the families well as they carry the burden associated with those who are on the front bench or, indeed, in any of the presiding officer positions associated with both houses of this parliament.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1998-11-10,—I seek the indulgence of the House as the Speaker to congratulate both the member for Cowper and the member for Scullin. I have worked with them both in the past and look forward to working with them now and in the future.,REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Nehl, Garry, MP",NP,1998-11-10,"—Mr Speaker, thank you very much indeed for your congratulations. I also thank the Prime Minister for his very kind comments and the Leader of the Opposition. It may well be true, Kim, that there are not as many motions about Antarctica as there used to be, but the 
 interest is abiding. I noticed that the Leader of the National Party this morning made some reference to our visit to Antarctica in 1986 with Mr Speaker. I hasten to say that the flooding of the ship did not sink it; it was merely the toilet that misfired. Actually, I did have a cabin mate who was a Finnish engineer, and I think it was he who made the mistake.
I would also like to say to the Leader of the Opposition that he forgot the Pacific Highway when he was commenting on what I normally speak about at great length and frequently. The Pacific Highway is an endearing and continuing occupation for me to make sure that the expenditure continues.
I do want to say thankyou to the Prime Minister, to the Leader of the Opposition and to my very good friend Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, for their congratulations.
As for my nominator and seconder, I say to those of my friends on the other side who suggested that I may have written the speech delivered by the member for Hinkler that, if I had, it would have been much more moderate. I thank him and the member for Mitchell for their very kind words and I thank the House for the honour which it has bestowed on me.	I note that both the member for Bruce and the member for Canberra were pleased, in their speeches nominating the member for Scullin, to also say kind words about me, and I thank them for that.
I remember well at this point in the last parliament that the member for Scullin said that this was the only time he went up for an election knowing that he was going to lose but, in so losing, winning what he was going to get anyway. That is the way the standing orders are. I say to Harry Jenkins that I, for one, am delighted that we will be working together again. Along with Mr Speaker, we will be a very good team indeed. 
I endorse all of the nice things said about Harry Jenkins by his colleagues in the opposition. He is indeed an excellent occupant of the chair. His father, of course, was an excellent Speaker. I was very pleased and proud to have the opportunity of serving in this House under the speakership of Harry Jenkins Sr. I 
 say to all of you that Harry Jenkins will probably also end up being Speaker of this place a long time in the future.
I want to comment very briefly on the words used by my nominator and seconder. They both used the word `passionate'. I am passionate about democracy. I can recall the very first time I entered the chamber, when I was very much younger than I am now, and my blood tingled. It still does, because this is the absolute representation of freedom and liberty. We all are charged with the wonderful responsibility to maintain that for Australia and as an example for the world. I am very, very privileged and honoured to be elected by the House to the position of Deputy Speaker, and I thank the House.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,1998-11-10,"—Standing order 13 is a wonderful standing order. It is, of course, the standing order that covers the election of the Deputy Speaker and allows for the person who gets the second highest number of votes to achieve the position of Second Deputy Speaker. But whilst I am comforted by standing order 13, I am much more comforted by the fact that the result on this occasion was a darned sight closer than on the last occasion.
I was a bit worried when the honourable member for Mitchell made a person's ability to control the honourable member for Banks part of the selection criteria for Deputy Speaker. Back in 1993, when I was able to win a ballot against the honourable member for Cowper for Deputy Speaker, I have to admit, for those who do not realise it, that the honourable member for Banks was my proposer. On that occasion I did warn those who were my greatest urgers that they would not get any special dispensation from me when I was in the chair. For the honourable member for Banks, I want to indicate to the chamber that that continues.
I say to the honourable member for Cowper that I am pleased that he has again been the nominee of the National Party to be Deputy Speaker. I look forward to continuing to work with him. I thank the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and, more importantly, the Leader of the Opposition for their gracious words on the occasion of my re-election 
 as the Second Deputy Speaker. I thank the honourable members for Bruce and Canberra for their gracious and valiant attempts to try to get for me a majority of votes. I appreciated their support in this attempt by me to become Deputy Speaker.
Mr Speaker, may I offer you my sincere congratulations. I have had the opportunity to work with you in different capacities—whilst you were a member of the Speaker's Panel and in other capacities around the chamber. I understand your great interest in what happens in this place and your great understanding not only of the standing orders but of the traditions and the atmosphere in which occupants of the chair operate. Sometimes it is very difficult to look strictly at the black and white of the standing orders and to implement them in the fairest way. I think people should understand that, in a way, the standing orders support the attempts of what the majority in this place are trying to do, whilst at the same time trying to protect the rights of the minority. That is a very difficult task.
It is often dependent upon the ability of the occupant of the chair to do things that are within perhaps not the words of the standing orders but the traditions of this place. I know that you will be able to bring to your high office the types of attributes which will ensure that you are able to endeavour to make this place operate in a most efficient way, to operate in the way in which the Australian community would expect, to operate—to use your words—with a great degree of civility.",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-11-10,"—I move:
That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Saturday, 24 October 1998, of the Honourable Charles Edward (Ceb) Barnes, member of the House of Representatives for the Division of McPherson, Queensland, from 1958 to 1972, Minister for Territories from 1963 to 1968 and Minister for External Territories from 1968 to 1972, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. 

Charles Edward Barnes was born on 13 November 1901 at Einasleigh, Queensland, therefore dying close to his 97th birthday. Ceb was educated in Sydney. His family moved to their Canning Downs property near Warwick in 1917. He left school in 1918 aged 17 and gained employment with the Union Trustee Company.
Ceb bought the Canning Downs property from his father after World War II and lived there until his death. Canning Downs is a horse stud where Ceb and his family have bred fine race horses including Tails who, on his third attempt, finished third in the 1971 Melbourne Cup. In fact, Ceb credited one horse, Basha Felika, the 1951 Caulfield Cup winner, with winning him an election when his constituents found out that he owned him.
During World War II, Ceb served in the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in 1942 and was discharged in 1944, having reached the rank of Flying Officer, after serving in Australia and New Guinea.
Ceb was elected as the Country Party member for McPherson in 1958. His maiden speech to the House was full of praise for the farming industry in Queensland. He remarked on how Queensland had gone from importing flour to growing some of the best wheat in Australia and how Queensland had changed from relying solely on its mining industry to sustaining a thriving agricultural sector. His parliamentary career was distinguished, serving for 14 years in the parliament, eight of which as a minister.
Ceb's association with New Guinea did not end with his war service but continued through this parliamentary duties. As Minister for External Territories, he will be remembered for his dedication to the economic and political development of Papua New Guinea and its progress toward self-government. He had responsibility for a difficult and controversial portfolio which would have tested any minister, but he discharged those duties with great honour and distinction.
During his 14 years in this parliament he contributed to the work of parliamentary committees. He was a member of both the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines and the Select Committee on Griev 
 ances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve. He also attended the inauguration of the Papua and New Guinea House of Assembly in 1964 and led a parliamentary delegation to the South Pacific in 1971.
He retired from federal politics in 1972 and returned to Canning Downs and to his love of horse breeding. He has been quoted as saying that he gained so much from his years in parliament that he would not have missed them for anything, but in the end was a farmer at heart. He will be remembered by those who worked with him as a man of integrity, dignity and honesty, and he had many other virtues as well.
On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Barbara, his daughters Patricia and Jill, his son John and their families our deep sympathy, our respect for the contribution he made as a member of parliament and to his nation and our bereavement on his passing.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Barnes, Hon. Charles Edward `Ceb'</title>",Condolences,15,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-11-10,"—I would like to join the Prime Minister in his remarks and his expression of condolences to Ceb Barnes's family. It is one of the valuable things in my life to have had a parent in parliament because it enabled me to meet a number of the people who, unfortunately, we are now farewelling. Ceb Barnes was one of those people. I met him on a large number of occasions and that was because my father had, from our side of the House, so much business with Ceb Barnes.
It is impossible now to imagine the parliaments of the 1950s and 1960s, given the focus of parliaments these days. These days parliaments focus intensely on social and educational policy in particular, on management of the economy and on employment programs. These are the things which dominate the affairs of parliament and really form a post-Whitlam era focus.
The parliaments of the 1950s and 1960s focused enormously on defence, on territories and on pensioners. There were five defence ministers until 1972 and one of the most powerful positions in the country was the Minister for External Territories. The Minister for External Territories ran Papua New Guinea—which was really a nation in itself; 
 it became a nation shortly after Ceb Barnes ceased to be the Minister for External Territories—and the level of control over the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory was much more intense than it is now. The Minister for External Territories effectively ran two states.
No more sensitive set of relations did Australia have than those with the emerging nation of Papua New Guinea. It happened to be an interest of my father's. He got to know Ceb Barnes before he got that position because they served together on two of the critical committees in terms of changing race relations in this country: the Voting Rights of Aborigines in 1961 and the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve in 1963. Ceb Barnes was not quite the ranking member from the government on those committees; my father was from the opposition.
Ceb Barnes had a reputation in relation to race relations which did not please editorialists or necessarily people on our side of the House. He had what was for many people a very old-fashioned view of affairs. He always had, my father tells me, the enormous value of great courtesy, a willingness to listen and an ability to set aside what might have been views that he began his life with in order to comprehend what was being put to him. My father's recollection of him on those two committees was of enormous courtesy to the Aboriginal witnesses who appeared.
The Aboriginal witnesses were, of course, appearing for the first time ever before parliamentary committees. There was no set form or fashion for those appearances—committees were few and far between in parliament in those days—and there was from Ceb Barnes an enormous personal courtesy which allowed ease of presentation of evidence at that time.
He then became the Minister for External Territories, a very powerful position. In that position, he succeeded Paul Hasluck, who had really made it his own portfolio for more than a decade. He was not, it might be said, popular in that position either with our side of the House or with the Liberal Party, but he was strongly defended in that portfolio by McEwen who insisted that he should be 
 sustained in it when Menzies got annoyed with him and then insisted that he should be elevated to the cabinet—it was a slightly different National Party.
He had his critics but none could fault his willingness to listen and the courtesy with which he conducted himself in the positions he held. My father had a deep interest in New Guinea and wrote a foreword to Ceb Barnes's biography—really in gratitude for the relationship he had with him at the time. When a crisis would emerge from time to time, my father was able to communicate to Ceb whatever was being communicated to him and get a response. He cites an occasion when an extremely difficult situation had developed on Rabaul. The potential was there for quite a systematic riot among some thousand Toli people—all armed with machetes—and the Pacific Islands Regiment was in the process of being deployed to quell it. Many were concerned about the possibility of a bloodbath. The Prime Minister had given authority for force to be used. Again, reflecting the extent of the power of the Minister for External Territories, Ceb Barnes effectively stayed a prime ministerial order—he had that level of local control. In the process, he delayed any intervention by the military. A storm took care of the ardour of the politics on the occasion, and nothing untoward emerged.
He was criticised for his handling of the portfolio, but it has to be said that, in the time he held the portfolio, spending on Papua New Guinea trebled, the first steps were made towards the creation of a more powerful parliament in the Northern Territory and in Papua New Guinea. From his record, nothing would suggest that he necessarily highly valued a great reputation for statesmanship or that he regarded his parliamentary career as necessarily the primary of his pursuits. Nevertheless, because of the way in which he conducted himself and the portfolios he held, he left a substantial mark on Australia's political history. With the Prime Minister, I extend condolences to his family on his passing.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Barnes, Hon. Charles Edward `Ceb'</title>",Condolences,15,1
"Fischer, Tim, MP",NP,1998-11-10,"—It reflects another era that Charles Edward Barnes entered parlia 
 ment at the age of 57 and stepped down from parliament at the age of 71. Having entered parliament at the age of 57, he had the privilege of serving in cabinet and in the ministry for some eight years of his 14 years as a member of the federal parliament. I commenced politics at the age of 24 in another parliament, and there are many on both sides of the House who are commencing their first day formally in the House of Representatives at much younger ages. I wish them well. I do not think we will see an era again where someone enters parliament at the age of 57 and has the privilege of serving eight years as a minister of the Crown—so much fundamental change has taken place in the decades since that time.
I did not know Charles Edward Barnes—or Ceb Barnes, as his initials led everyone to call him—that well, although I did meet him on two occasions, I think. But he was undoubtedly a gentleman. As Kim Beazley Sr wrote, he was a gentleman to his fingertips. He reflected a dignity about the purposefulness of being a representative for the seat of McPherson and a dignity about the purposefulness of being a minister of the Crown—for Territories and then External Territories. He carried that dignity throughout his career in politics, as an engineer involved in the mining industry in the northern part of Queensland, in his horse breeding after he left politics, and in a range of other activities pursued over the decades of his long, illustrious life.
In terms of his war service, he did not start too well. Landing at Townsville airport in a crosswind, he elected to use the wrong runway—not the one the tower had directed him to. It was just at the build-up towards Pearl Harbour—there were a lot of US aircraft in the area, and the arrangements for radio control were not all that adequate. He managed to do what is called a ground loop upon landing. But as a consequence of doing that ground loop he headed directly at a newly arrived US aircraft, the crew of which had still not got out after arriving a couple of minutes earlier. There was almost a total collision and wipe-out. But Ceb, having hung on grimly and managed to just miss the American aircraft, got out and shook hands 
 with them, as you would imagine that he might do. You could imagine the exchange.
He went on from that to serve in Australia and in New Guinea, and had the privilege of then helping to fashion the way ahead for independence and the early years of independence of our northern neighbour. Ceb Barnes is well regarded around Papua New Guinea. He is well regarded around Queensland. I am pleased to see Don McDonald and Ray Braithwaite, who have been directly involved with him over the years, in the gallery on this occasion. He was committed, dedicated, determined and, as such, a parliamentarian who made a contribution which was above average and one which would be well recognised and is well recognised by this motion today. I have much pleasure in extending a salute to Ceb Barnes on this occasion and in extending sympathy to Barbara and members of the Barnes family.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Barnes, Hon. Charles Edward `Ceb'</title>",Condolences,15,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1998-11-10,"—In speaking today to this condolence motion, I would like to mention that the current member for McPherson, Margaret May, would like to have spoken on this motion but could not do so because she has not yet made her first speech. I hope I can convey the sentiments which I am sure she would wish to convey regarding a predecessor in the seat. I grew up in the Warwick district in the electorate of McPherson. The 39 new members who took their oaths of office or their affirmations this morning could learn a great deal from Ceb Barnes. I certainly did.
In those days, McPherson stretched from the Gold Coast to Inala in Brisbane across the Fassifern valley to Warwick and Stanthorpe. It was a very diverse seat. I can remember as a teenager and junior delegate to the Country Party going to meetings at Boonah and Beaudesert in the back of his old green Rover car. Even in those days, when the young Labor movement, the young Liberals and the young Country Party, as it was then, were emerging—with some trepidation, I might add, from the senior hierarchy of those parties—Ceb Barnes was a mentor for young people in politics.
Ceb was a true Australian. He always exhibited those most appealing characteristics 
 of the Australian country gentleman. He was resourceful and passionate. He had a self-deprecating sense of humour. He had ingenuity, modesty, dignity and a great sense of community obligation and compassion for his fellow man. He was offered a knighthood but declined it because he believed he had been remunerated for public office, and I understand that his family declined a state funeral for the same reason. He was an ingenious mechanic, a handy schoolboy boxer, a world traveller, a skilled pilot—or not quite so skilled if the Deputy Prime Minister is correct—a successful goldminer, an innovative farmer, an accomplished racehorse breeder, a genuine philanthropist, an outstanding politician and an excellent minister.
Ceb Barnes was a minister in the Menzies, Holt, Gorton and McMahon governments, and he proved to be somewhat of a visionary. As the Prime Minister said, he served as Minister for Territories from 1963 to 1968 and then as Minister for External Territories until his retirement in 1972. He oversaw Papua New Guinea's path to independence and was often criticised—I believe wrongly, as recent events in that country have demonstrated—for not hurrying the process. He believed it was not something that should be imposed on the people of Papua New Guinea but was something that should evolve and that they should work towards.
Not an ambitious man, he was reluctant at first to accept the Country Party nomination when the then federal Treasurer Arthur Fadden—or Artie Fadden, as we knew him—offered it to him. I was in the Warwick Town Hall the night that Artie Fadden handed over to Ceb Barnes, and his speech was memorable, like all Artie Fadden speeches were memorable. He had his speech notes marked in different colours and, in the middle of the presentation, he got them mixed up. He then, on the stage of the Warwick Town Hall, flicked them out into piles, restacked them—with his backside to the audience the whole time—never missed a beat, turned around and went on with his speech. That was the night he introduced Ceb Barnes as his successor. Ceb Barnes represented the electorate until 1972, as the Prime Minister said. He was 
 famous for his racehorse Tails and it was interesting that his retirement in 1972 was the same year that he turned Tails out to stud at Canning Downs.
I last saw Ceb Barnes on 17 May this year when I returned to Warwick to open a wing at a nursing home. My wife, Margaret, and I drove to Canning Downs unannounced, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that although he had suffered a slight stroke he strode out to meet us. He was a very imposing man—he was about six feet three or six feet four. He came out onto the verandah and greeted us. He recalled, not in any maudlin way but very lucidly and with great clarity, his time here, and he spoke very positively about the current Prime Minister and the then Speaker, Ian Sinclair.
It is interesting too that, although he had a great respect for the House, he once had a question ruled out of order. In November 1960 he attempted to ask the then Treasurer, Harold Holt, if the then member for East Sydney, Eddie Ward, had been appointed financial editor of the Sydney Morning Herald. The question was ruled out of order despite the fact that Harold Holt was itching to respond to it.
I also recall an incident on the steps of the Warwick Town Hall when Ceb Barnes had come back from Canberra. I think the story has become somewhat apocryphal, but the Chief Hansard Reporter, Bernie Harris, and I could not find it readily in Hansard. The story goes that on one occasion—as Ceb Barnes told me—Eddie Ward asked Bob Menzies whether, prior to the next election, he would swim a crocodile-infested creek in North Queensland, because in the kingdom of Siam at that time to take your place in the legislature you had to show a mark of courage by swimming a crocodile-infested river. Menzies was reputed to have said that he would swim the creek provided the then honourable member for East Sydney went first, because no self-respecting crocodile would stay in the same stream.
Ceb Barnes's wry sense of humour even extended to his deathbed. He made the point that he had outlasted the C.E. Barnes Grandstand at the Warwick showground—you will 
 recall there was a tornado at Warwick about two months ago that took the grandstand. A day or two before his death, someone said something about the grandstand, and Ceb Barnes said, `Well, at least I outlasted that.'
Warwick journalist and friend of mine Gerard Walsh in his Daily News obituary described Ceb Barnes as `a man with a wonderful memory, a great problem solver, the perfect gentleman, a fair dinkum Aussie who made a lasting mark on Australian life, politics, racing, mining, agriculture and aviation'.
Mark McGinness, who penned Ceb's obituary in the Australian, hit the nail on the head when he said that Ceb Barnes was `a quintessential Australian gentleman: tall, vigorous, adventurous, well dressed, wellmoustached, well read, self-contained but never strident in his opinions'. I cannot help thinking that if more of us strove to follow his example there would not be the community disenchantment with this House that we have heard over the last two or three years. He certainly set the bar high for the rest of us. Along with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Prime Minister, I extend my sympathy to the Barnes family on the passing of this great Australian.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Barnes, Hon.

"Moore, John, MP",LP,1998-11-10,"—Ceb Barnes was a friend of my father's and a person I knew quite well. He was one of nature's gentlemen who frequently came from the rural countryside of Queensland. His family, the late J.H.S Barnes, owned a station in North Queensland and, if history serves me right, in 1917 it was acquired by the then state government at a time when they were taking on any number of private enterprise projects, including coke ovens, mines, smelters and other things, and from that he moved to Canning Downs.
As the Prime Minister outlined, Ceb Barnes left school in 1918, but the Prime Minister did not outline the fact that, after that, Ceb Barnes went exploring. He walked around Cape York and did quite a number of goldmining operations on his own. In that time he grew to know the bush in the north particularly well, and that is why he took such an 
 interest in Aboriginal affairs when he came to this House.
As the Leader of the Opposition said, Ceb Barnes was interested not only in the Aboriginal people of Australia but also very much in the development of New Guinea, where he was interested in, firstly, mining and also in the people in the area. When he came here to take up the ministry of external affairs, as the Leader of the Opposition quite rightly said, he was not particularly well liked by the southern press, particularly the Sydney Morning Herald, which used to refer to him as `Mr Charles Barnes' and then go on to the many derogatory comments that went with it.
When Artie Fadden decided to retire, Ceb Barnes was a very well-known identity on the southern downs. As the Member for Hinkler said, Ceb Barnes very reluctantly—because he was not that sort of guy; he was not the sort of person who sought publicity—took on the nomination and came here in his quiet way and succeeded at quite a late age. When he retired in 1972 he took with him, I think, an ideal life of a country man of that age. My sympathy to his family.

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1998-11-10,"—I move:
That the address be agreed to.
It is a great honour for me to respond to the speech of His Excellency the Governor-General. To respond when His Excellency lays out the future program of a new government is an honour that has been awarded to just 38 Australians in the history of our Federation. I thank the Prime Minister for his confidence.
Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment today, and I hope my comments reflect the moment of the occasion.
As the first member to represent the federal division of Blair, I am a proud addition to this place. Covering an area of about 15,000 square kilometres, Blair includes the shires of Kingaroy, Nanango, Kilcoy, Esk, Gatton and Laidley and includes part of the City of Ipswich and Rosalie and Crow's Nest shires. Across this area, traditional primary industries, including beef and dairy farms, peanut, fruit and vegetable growers, are under considerable pressure. Drought and decades of rising costs and falling returns have undermined these industries and the communities they support.
The urban and near urban areas in and around the city of Ipswich make up 30 per cent of Blair's voting population. Development in the city is a matter of priority. In recent years, there have been serious concerns about the future of Ipswich, but lately the city has scored a few home runs that  are worth recording. In particular, we have the establishment of the Ipswich campus of the University of Queensland, and the Global Information Links Internet Project pioneered by the City Council is generating a lot of interest and activity. Now we have plans for an innovative global arts link venture and a rail technology centre, both of which provide an impetus for tourism that has been lacking in the past.
The RAAF Base Amberley is also a source of pride and future growth in the electorate. Currently there is uncertainty about the future of RAAF personnel and their accommodation. The changes that lie ahead must be handled sensitively, recognising the opportunity for growth but providing support for people and families caught up in the process. Blair is a beautiful and productive region with tremendous potential for new growth in areas such as tourism and downstream processing.
Blair received its name from the celebrated Aboriginal opera singer, Harold Blair, who won recognition across the world but never forgot his upbringing. Harold Blair grew up in the small community of Purga near Ipswich. His life took him to the great concert halls of the world, but even at the height of his career Harold Blair was a regular attraction at the old town hall in Ipswich. All members must take a leaf from the book of life as lived by Harold Blair. This is the House of Representatives and each member arrives courtesy of a community of electors whose hopes and dreams we must always place first. We must fight on their behalf, we must show leadership on their behalf, and always we must remember that our neighbours will be the judge when we give account of work done on their behalf.
The reasons according to which each of us are honoured to be selected as a community representative and therefore a member of this House are many and varied. Australia is the world's greatest democracy. Many countries 
 live by democratic principles, but we are especially privileged. In our society Australian values such as mateship, a fair go, a helping hand and a fair day's work remain the unwritten code we all respect. His Excellency referred to the same tradition when he spoke of decency, openness, tolerance and a fair go for all.
The people who are the real source of parliamentary power in this place are our neighbours back at home. The people we meet in the supermarket and on the sports field all aspire to those Australian values and respect those who live by them. When we rise on behalf of our electorates, we should always speak in line with those great Australian principles—in a spirit of mateship, ensuring a fair go, offering a helping hand and never giving or expecting less than a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.
I am here because the people of Blair share those great Australian principles and because they believe that of nine candidates I am the one most capable of being a strong, dedicated and appropriate representative over the coming three year term. I thank the people of Blair for that decision. They did not choose the most controversial candidate, the most divisive candidate or the one with the best publicity. Their choice was for the candidate that came closest to representing the community as a whole. For the great silent majority in Blair, this election result proved that we are supported by a voting system that truly reflects the community mood. It is a system that represents those Australian principles that I salute in this address.
Today the most important challenge I face is to address the needs of that significant minority of people in Blair who did not go to this poll with moderation in mind. By and large, these Australians are not prone to radicalism—they are true conservatives who love this country and want to see a better life for their children. The fact that such a group can be stirred to vote in a strident manner regardless of the consequences is a warning to all in this parliament. Rebuild faith in Australia and our democratic government, rebuild respect for each other, rebuild those 
 longstanding Australian values, or much more could be at risk.
I am truly blessed because my wife, Sharen, has real faith in me. Together, and with the incredible support of my mother-in-law, Betty Grove, we entered a political colosseum 12 months ago and we emerged strong, healthy and in one piece. Because of Sharen's faith, I never ducked a blow in the contest and I know our two sons, Fletcher and Ari, and number three, who will join us in April, will always speak with pride of what we have achieved as a family in the past 12 months. 	I hope that, in the time ahead, there will be many more achievements that help the people of Blair and that our family will regard with pride.
Naturally, my thoughts at this time turn also to my parents, Dorothy and the late Norm Thompson. Much of what I am I owe to Dot and Norm. They instilled in me an understanding and an appreciation of what is great about family life. I hope I can pass some of that appreciation on to my own boys.
Others I must thank include my campaign manager, John Andrews, and workers Christine Trevett and Roy Hopkins-Deacon. These three gave everything to the campaign and deserve three hearty cheers from me.
Peter Clarke, who is the Liberal Party branch development officer in Queensland, moved to Blair for the duration. He lent me his organisational and engineering skills, his car and boundless enthusiasm. Without Peter, assisted by Jeff Matijasevic, all 71 booths in Blair would not have been manned on 3 October and the result may well have been different.
For me a feature of the campaign was the discovery of friendship in places where it was not expected. True friends do stand by you when the chips are down. Daryl Butler, his young son and those many other hard-working friends, like Mark and Sue Phelps and Liberals from across south-east Queensland, will certainly always be welcome at my house.
The President of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Bob Carroll, deserves a great deal of credit. He recognised the importance 
 of the seat of Blair and the fact that it was unique in this campaign. He helped structure campaign activities and material to make the concerns of the people of Blair count.
I also thank the Liberal Party State Executive. I was preselected ahead of a fancied rival. It is easy to speak in hindsight, but plainly the preselection decision taken by the State Executive was right for Blair and the future of the party. The support I received from State Director, Greg Goebel, National Director, Lynton Crosby, and their staff was at all times dedicated and professional.
I place on record special thanks to the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Shane Stone, who campaigned with me in Blair. Shane attracted strong financial support and flew the flag for change and a better future at a dinner in his honour at Kingaroy. His sage advice was a boon to my efforts.constitution
Similarly, I received valuable support of a different character from the Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett. Jeff chased One Nation down every burrow, and he took up the charge early in the campaign when the strength and direction of my main opponent was impossible to predict. As a result of experiences stretching back over many years, I also salute many in politics who encouraged me. Apart from Shane Stone, these include: former Northern Territory education minister Tom Harris; the member for Fisher, Peter Slipper; and former Deputy Premier of Queensland, Joan Sheldon.
In the campaign, I received encouragement and support from another former Queensland Deputy Premier, Bill Gunn, who did more than anyone else to preserve the strength of the coalition's spirit. An unexpected ally, whose words from out of the blue helped to guarantee a One Nation defeat, was former Governor-General Bill Hayden, who spoke in a forthright manner in support of his community and their interests.
Apart from building many strong and supportive friendships, my background in state and territory politics has shaped my thinking. It has helped me to set goals about building a better future for residents in Blair, particularly those frustrated and disappointed with recent progress. Today, the harsh realities of life are impacting on all Australians, 
 but not all are given access to benefits that compensate for the heavy costs brought about by change.
Many of those who feel the most pain have been made the targets of reduced services and backdoor tax increases by all levels of government over many years. They are the easy marks who are exploited again and again, usually because, after many years of falling revenue, our system has become adept at finding those who will suffer pain in silence. That is a prime source of the fire that has Australian politics in hot water today. Governments cannot continue to be driven by annual bouts of financial blood lust. The victims are out there in Blair and in many other Australian electorates, and they are no longer silent.
That is why I strongly support the government's tax reform package. This system would finally redistribute some of the burden of tax onto the prominent individuals who regularly dodge it. It would create an orderly growth of revenue and balance our budgets without recourse to proxies like speed cameras, user charges, road funding cuts and a whole host of other things that I could name.
Today, I was thrilled to hear His Excellency make the clear point that this government will ensure that the benefits of reform are fairly shared. But as we demand greater competition and improved efficiency on farms, in small businesses and among local and state bureaucracies, so we must do more in this parliament to put our own house in order.
While members of this House go back to their home towns after every sitting, the source of bureaucratic power in this country remains constant and truly remote from most Australians. The depth of duplication between state and Commonwealth departments remains a national shame and a burden that ordinary Australians in my electorate have carried for too long.
I acknowledge that at one time former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke advocated a serious reallocation of resources between these two levels of government. I also acknowledge that the government's tax reforms will direct more funding to state authorities, 
 which are the ones that actually provide the vast bulk of services. But it is just not enough. In key areas like health and education, the Commonwealth must begin to look at handing back in their entirety many of the resources that are duplicated.
I do not advocate job losses as part of this process but the state-level integration and staged conversion of duplicated resources to the sharp end of service delivery. In this way, at last, Australians who have campaigned long and hard for many years really would see a significant drop in class sizes and a strong and uniform influx of doctors and health professionals—even in country areas.
I am not a fanatic for states rights nor am I a flat earth economic nut. I have simply witnessed wave after wave of change breaking over the lives of less fortunate Australians—generally those who live in regional areas. The result has been a disastrous flow of population out of those areas, which has sapped confidence and left many wondering whether their communities have a long-term future in this country.
Rising property values and high powered salaries like those offered in our capital cities do make the national economy look good and strong. Unfortunately, they come at a tremendous cost in terms of falling values, salaries and prospects across the vast bulk of the Australian landmass. We should begin to remember the massive investment Australia has made in infrastructure across these areas and the importance of generating regional growth to support that infrastructure in the long term.
In defence of the system, I recall a couple of recent examples where the miracle of telecommunications technology has been used to help turn the tide. Obviously, the government's proposed transaction centres are one example—and I am keen to see a firm commitment to those in Blair. I mark His Excellency's words in that regard, where he noted those transaction centres as a priority for the government.
Another decision was taken by the former coalition government in Queensland to build a departmental call centre at Emerald. That is excellent work, but it is a very small drop in 
 a very big bucket. I know it feels good here in Canberra, but centralism is a cancer that is eating away at our country. I am surely not the font of wisdom on the subject, but we need to lift the debate, and I look forward to hearing from other members on these issues.
When I began this address I referred to the plight of the many important rural industries in Blair. It worries me that, as current population trends continue, the number of MPs speaking on behalf of the dwindling number engaged in these industries is also reducing. Those of us with rural and regional electorates need to work together more strongly and build links with leaders in other levels of government who share our constituency and our concerns.
In Blair, I have vowed to work closely with local authorities to strengthen our hand. In preparation for this address, a number of local mayors agreed to contribute a few lines to highlight areas of mutual concern. Gatton Shire Mayor Bernie Sutton wrote:
Hopefully the Government will recognise the disillusionment and frustration in all rural areas and positively respond to that feeling.
Mayor Sutton gave priority to funding councils and roads. He believes that financial assistance and tax incentives should be given to improve water supplies and that young residents need access to better sport and recreation facilities.
Kingaroy Mayor Roger Nunn wants the Commonwealth to construct new infrastructure to provide jobs. He wrote:
Money spent on infrastructure is never wasted, provided it is carefully planned.
As a local example, Mayor Nunn said building a standard gauge railway to serve the Surat Basin coal development would advantage industries in Kingaroy. It would also link producers in New South Wales with bulk export facilities in Queensland. Ipswich City Mayor, John Nugent, wrote:
The Ipswich region would benefit enormously if the Federal Government restored in real terms the amount spent on road funding to 1983 levels.
Mayor Nugent called for increased financial assistance grants to councils, equal to or better than levels of funding that applied in the mid-1980s. Other local representatives to 
 contribute included Laidley Mayor, Shirley Pitt, who joined the call for improved road funding following community meetings that declared a major intersection at Plainlands on the Warrego Highway a deathtrap. Rosalie is another local shire to advocate road funding as the Commonwealth's top priority.
At Kilcoy, Mayor Alex Brown is campaigning for lower meat inspection fees to promote stability at the Kilcoy Pastoral Co. abattoir which provides 300 local jobs and sustains the Kilcoy community. I recognise that funding and projects of this magnitude do not just materialise, but I endorse these comments from the mayors. Infrastructure, jobs, appropriate industry support and a campaign to boost the morale of people in communities like Ipswich, Gatton, Kingaroy and other centres such as those in Blair must be a high priority for the government and necessary funding should be found.
Mr Speaker, in closing I want to advise members that the words I speak and views I express today are mine. I do give credit to the mayors, however, for their contributions. There is no speech writer, bald or otherwise, hiding away back in my office. I will continue to write my own speeches and I will continue to represent the views of the people of Blair to the best of my ability and in my own words.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1998-11-10,"—In the adjournment debate tonight I would like first to put on the record my sincere congratulations—which I have already done privately—to you for the high office which you now hold. I feel sure you will do an excellent job in the years to come. I would also like to congratulate the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker on their appointments today. 
What I would like to raise in the adjournment debate tonight is the fact that on the 8th day of this month, last Sunday, I attended what was classified as the blessing of a nursing home on the border of my electorate, in the electorate of Fowler. I raise this particular case in the House to bring to the notice of the government what can be achieved with seed funding of $1.2 million—I might add it was given in the previous government's time—offered to a community to build a nursing home. In this case it was a Croatian village and His Lordship came out from Croatia to do the actual blessing. I would like to put on record my appreciation to Archbishop Josip Bozanich. More importantly, I want to explain to the House that this community, when they first built their church in 1985, having bought the land, had a dream to provide aged accommodation for their community. They were then given a grant by the previous government of $1.2 million to build a hostel. Having then raised something like $1½ million themselves, they completed that hostel and it was opened officially in November 1989.
In June 1995, they applied for, and were given, another grant of $1.2 million to go into what was then the third stage of the dream, to build a nursing home within this village area. That nursing home, I am proud to say, was officially blessed last Sunday and has been licensed now to have in occupation something like 40 residents. The government provided $1.2 million out of a total cost of something like $3 million. The community raised the rest among themselves. They have done that because over 900 families contributed in excess of $1,000 each.
We had another group of certificates given out last Sunday to families who had given over $5,000 each. People who did not have the financial means gave of their time, whether in building, doing pathways or in other accommodation areas that were just so essential to bring this dream into a reality. I would like to commend quite publicly the Australian-Croatian community that worked so hard in the Kardinal Stepinac Village and also place on record my sincere appreciation to the 
 hardworking community and to Father for his work in uniting that community.
I say to this government: look around and see what you can do if you come forward with small capital grants. The community will then rally to provide the proper accommodation for the aged that they care about. This government, I am ashamed to say, since 1996 has stopped all capital funding that would enable anything like this to ever happen again. I know, because I have been working with an Italian group in my area—Italian-Australians—to try to raise money to build an Italian village for the aged. They cannot get the original seed funding that was normally required and so freely given by governments in the past. I think this is a shame. I think this government has to reassess what it is doing with expenditure. I think we have to reassess how communities can become involved and do so much to care for their loved ones and their aged.
I think anybody on the government benches who doubts it has only to take a very short visit to the Kardinal Stepinac Village in St John's Park to see what has been achieved by that hardworking community. Again, I praise them. I praise the young in that community who also had functions to raise money, again to support both the hostel and the nursing home. I say to that community: stand with your heads high. You have done a wonderful job and really achieved so much.
Government members, please look at what can be done with a bit of financial generosity in providing a certain amount of capital funding. We have not seen that in the 1996-97 budget nor the 1997-98 budget. I would like to say to this new Prime Minister—he has now resurrected himself: he is going to be a new Prime Minister, a new leader who is going to look more at social structures and the social structure of the community as a whole—and to his ministers: start by contributing some of the capital funding that is required if we want to see bigger and better nursing homes throughout Australia.
Our people are getting older, our communities are aging. Where government cannot provide either the finance or the resources that are required to house the aged within our 
 community, communities are willing to bear the burden and to raise the finances, as has been proved by the Kardinal Stepinac Village last Sunday, and has been proved by them in the previous 10 years. What they need is just a little bit of assistance at the beginning, a little bit of help, and to know that the government cares about them and cares that they are doing this work within their own community.
I thank that community. I know that the people who are going to occupy this nursing home in the future will thank them and the happy community in that hostel accommodation thanks them so much for the work that they have done. I understand that their next course is to provide self-contained accommodation in a hostel environment as well, and I commend and congratulate them on that because I know that they will achieve it. Congratulations to the Kardinal Stepinac Village on a job well done.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Nursing Homes</title>,Adjournment,18,1
