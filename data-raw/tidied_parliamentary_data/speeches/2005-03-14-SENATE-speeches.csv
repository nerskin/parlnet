"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-03-14,"—I join my colleague Senator Ridgeway in indicating the Democrats’ very strong opposition to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005]. We oppose it because it goes against the fundamental objectives of self-determination. ATSIC was elected by Indigenous people and, imperfect an organisation as it might or might not be, in our view it is not for government—this government or the next—to dismantle it. Self-determination means exactly what it says. The problem is that the government does not mean what it says when it talks about practical reconciliation for Indigenous Australians. There can be no greater expression of practical reconciliation than to allow people to make their own decisions, such as who represents them. In fact, this country went to war in Iraq for that very reason—in order to give the Iraqi people the right to be represented democratically. Apparently, it is okay for Iraqis but not for Aboriginal people.
I was surprised, listening to Senator Carr last week, to know that the ALP will support this bill. I think that is a great disappointment. The Democrats hold the view that ATSIC was capable of being reformed. In fact, we think that going along the lines recommended by the ATSIC review report would have been a good start. But for the ALP to join the Howard government in collapsing ATSIC, wiping it out altogether, is going entirely in the wrong direction. Senator Carr said that the Howard government had failed Indigenous Australians. He talked about Prime Minister Paul Keating, who said that if you can imagine injustice then we can have justice. He said that in 1993. Twelve years later, it is disappointing to see that the ALP has not followed that claim.
We think a structure that reflects the interests of Indigenous people is important. We think it is also important that people get what is rightfully theirs as part of a democratic country. So it is hard to understand how it is that the ALP—condemning the government, as we do, throughout this second reading debate for its lack of will in addressing injustice for Indigenous people—has so readily joined the government in axing the structure set up by the ALP when it was in government. As the one Indigenous parliamentarian in this place, Senator Aden Ridgeway, said earlier, the government has been deceitful, paternalistic and, in the case of ATSIC, grossly overreactive. It is quite obvious that the government and the ALP are not listening to Aboriginal people. Apparently, they do not want to see an elected body in place.
I think it is pretty obvious that the attack on Indigenous Australians came very early on in this government’s first term. Native title came under attack and was watered down so greatly that it means very little now. ATSIC funds have been cut. ATSIC board members were demonised and blamed for failures in the government’s own departments. The government spread the message that Indigenous people could not be relied upon to handle financial matters and that they could not be trusted to manage their own affairs. The catchcry now is that we must have shared responsibility and mutual obligation, as if there is none at present. I think Aboriginal people are being treated like children: ‘We’ll give you petrol bowsers if you’ll wash your children’s faces.’ In other words, it is a handout mentality in return for good behaviour.
But we never hear about the decisions that have been made on behalf of Indigenous people that have been disastrous and have led to so much disadvantage in Indigenous communities. The stolen generation saw decisions made by non-Indigenous people that still affect lives today. Past deeds moved people off traditional lands. The sale of grog right now in many places cynically exploits addiction and dependence. There is also the lack of services, the discrimination that says that Indigenous people are overlooked for opportunities that we take for granted and the lack of understanding about language and culture. I have spoken in the past in this place about the fact that, as a child, I knew much more about New Zealand Maoris than I did about Indigenous Australians. That continues. Today it may be slightly better, but, as I move around, I do not see any evidence that there is a great deal of understanding or knowledge of the language or culture of our Indigenous Australians. I think we lack pride in this ancient heritage in this country.
There are different rules for Indigenous people. In the Northern Territory, for instance, the way schools are funded is different for Indigenous community schools. The result is that they are disgracefully underfunded. The education committee is midway through an inquiry into the changes that the government has made to Indigenous education funding. We were astounded, both this time and the previous time that we looked into Indigenous education, to see schools where, quite frankly, Third World conditions apply, where very little funding has been injected into those schools and where different rules apply to the way the funds flow. For instance, in the Northern Territory, schools are funded for average attendance, which means that they are often grossly overcrowded, which is a disincentive for children to go to school.
The raiding of an Aboriginal radio station in more recent times, the decision to seize artworks, the tying up of ATSI Cultural Education and Advancement Trust funds to keep them out of the hands of ATSIC trustees are examples of government interference and unreasonable attacks on Indigenous structures. There are countless cases of government decisions adversely affecting Indigenous Australians. That is apparently the black armband view of history, which has to be forgotten in this new era of what is called ‘shared responsibility’. We never hear about where Indigenous decision making is working very well and where Indigenous people who are allowed to make decisions for themselves are doing so with great success—the regional councils, for instance.
In our inquiry, we saw very good examples of groups of parents and Indigenous counsellors in largely Aboriginal schools getting together and determining their priorities for things like getting their children to school and providing nutrition so that they are able to better concentrate on their work. We found plenty of examples where this structure works extremely well, and yet this is another example of the government taking away that empowerment and that decision making. The decisions that were made on funding will be the subject of a report from our inquiry. I do not want to pre-empt that report but it was pretty obvious that those schools that had good decision making had better attendance, better school environments and far better levels of learning than those schools that had none. There is enormous disadvantage in those communities. One way of overcoming that disadvantage is to let people be part of the decision-making process. It is fundamental in everything we do. It is the same in an ordinary classroom. The more you involve people in the decisions which affect them, the greater their empowerment to make good decisions and improve their circumstances.
The Democrats are very disappointed to have to be debating this bill. We think that there are much more sensible ways of improving the governance of Indigenous affairs than to completely remove an elected body from its role. It is not as if we can say that Indigenous people have the same opportunities as the rest of us. They do not. It is not that we can say that they have got the same education levels or the same level of health. They still die 20 years younger than the general population. Drastic measures need to be taken, but not drastic measures to remove the only structure which is in place to give Aboriginal people a say and a chance to be represented democratically. This is a step entirely in the wrong direction and one which I think the two major parties in this place should be ashamed of.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2005-03-14,"—The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] formally legislates for what is in fact already happening. The government has made funding decisions and also structural decisions that ATSIC is no longer going be supported, that it is in fact being abolished, that the delivery of services is going to be done by other means and that it will be done community by community.
I was one of those who heartily supported ATSIC. It was set up before my time in this place. I know that the hopes of many people, particularly Indigenous Australians, rested with ATSIC when it was set up in the late eighties. It has made a real difference to the lives of some Aboriginal people and to some Aboriginal communities, but unfortunately it has not been able to make the real difference that was hoped and dreamed for. The reasons that it was not successful are complex. Some of the key problems that it faced included a substantial lack of resources. But I refer in particular to the lack of power to be able to influence decisions by state, territory or federal departments and in some cases the total lack of any local government authority with which it could work and from which it could get some support for essential services—or, indeed, missing essential services—in the communities. That includes everything from roads to a variety of infrastructure programs. As I have travelled I have particularly noticed a lack of ability on the part of ATSIC to really influence education. I know it was not a key responsibility but, as I saw it, it was hindered in its attempts to really provide appropriate support. Although there were a number of successful programs, particularly cultural programs, that it funded, overall the results have not been very good.
I believe we do need a national, elected Indigenous body that represents Indigenous views, consults with Indigenous people and reports to various levels of government. But I believe that the actual delivery of services is a different issue. As I said, the idea in the eighties was that one body would do it all. But whether you look at housing, employment opportunities, education, training or sanitation—the list goes on—Indigenous communities are struggling to have their very basic, essential needs met. I constantly receive in my office letters from people who have visited communities or who have read articles. One I received recently was from a young student who had recently been in the north of South Australia. She wrote to me saying that she was appalled at what she saw on her visits and expressed her frustration that needs are still going unmet in this new century.
It is just over 15 years since ATSIC was established. On 5 March 1990, it came into being. We have to accept that, despite the huge and dedicated efforts by many Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, Indigenous leaders and communities, we still have this enormous gap between what Indigenous people are entitled to and what is actually out there. There are some positive results and pockets of work. The Future Leaders Program and the CDEP programs are just some examples of good community programs that have been implemented and have got good results. But, unfortunately, as I have travelled through Indigenous communities, I have seen that they have been few and far between.
I believe that we now need to take the next step in so many areas. The resources that ATSIC had access to were simply not sufficient. As I said, those resources were frequently held on to by state and territory governments. As we have already heard, particularly in the Northern Territory, those resources were not shared adequately and fairly with Indigenous people. Just look at education. It is a prime example of where there was no ability to influence what was happening. Primary schools and preschools must cater adequately for all students who do not have English as their first language. But, often in Aboriginal services and Aboriginal schools that I visited, this was not the case.
To give some examples of what I have seen, I have visited a number of schools in the Northern Territory over the last few years and I found schools with 21, 25 or 26 kids and with only one teacher. In Adelaide, ESL requirements are that there is one teacher for every nine students who do not have English as a first language. Those schools would have had three and, in some cases, four teachers so that students could really have the opportunity to learn. In some schools that I visited, English was not even their second language; it was their third or fourth language. I am not suggesting for a moment that this was ATSIC’s fault. I am saying that we need another approach to deal with these problems. ATSIC simply had no power to negotiate through all of this. It was not their responsibility.
There are certainly some positives that are happening in Aboriginal education. In particular, I highlight what is happening at Woodville High School in my home state where approximately 50 talented students from the Pit lands have come down to Adelaide. They are based in a specific unit at Woodville High, boarding in Adelaide, with tremendous results. They have been joined by roughly 50 local Adelaide based Indigenous students, and it is a tremendously successful program. But this is not widespread.
Some remote communities have taken action into their own hands. On my reading of this legislation, and looking at what is already happening, this will be enhanced. I believe the opportunities for communities to step in and actually get what they want in education will be enhanced with this legislation. The Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation was established back in the mid-nineties by the Aboriginal communities of Imanpa, Mutujulu and Docker River. These communities are at the very southern part of the Territory, south of Alice Springs and in the northern part of the Pit lands. Two elders from each of these communities make up the board. Their priority from the beginning has been education. They do this by raising funds however they can scrape some money together. They run a roadhouse and they now have several tourist facilities. The money goes into Nyangatjatjara College.
They started with nothing. They borrowed dongas, caravans and prefabs that were used at a construction site. They were pretty dilapidated but they kept the sun off and a roof over the kids’ heads. When I visited, Indigenous kids were packed in and sleeping in bunks. There were 11 students per donga. You can imagine the stifling conditions in the summer without air-conditioning, but the kids were still going to school.
Previously, out of the whole southern part of the Territory south of Alice Springs, there have only been one or two students a year who completed year 12 in Alice Springs High School. When I visited Nyangatjatjara College in 2002, they had over 100 students enrolled. The way they run this school is different. It is the way they want to do it. The Aboriginal community want to run the school. For one term, boys are on the main campus at Yulara and the girls are back at the three community schools, which, in all bar one case, are temporary prefab buildings. Then they swap over. The next term the boys go back and the girls go to the campus. They keep swapping so that, in any one year, they each have two terms boarding at the college campus and two terms back living with their families in the communities.
They are already having very successful placements for work experience and are getting students ready to move on from the college through their last year or two and into employment. At the beginning of last year, they opened the first three classrooms so that they can get rid of some of those old portables and prefabs. I was able to secure nearly $2½ million in funding from the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, to put in some proper accommodation so that students and teachers did not have to stay in caravans and dongas any longer. There is still an urgent need for more funding for that community and for that school. Hopefully, through the changes in this bill, that will be facilitated.
I will move on from education and look at some more general issues. As speaker after speaker have said, whatever statistics you use, Indigenous people are far worse off than the general population. The fact that most Indigenous people live more than 20 years less than the general population is but one example of that. Recent figures for the Territory show that the average life expectancy for Indigenous men is 47 years and 50 years for women. I think this sums it all up. I want to look specifically at health services. I actively supported the ALP, in the mid-1990s, taking responsibility for Indigenous health from ATSIC and placing it with the department of health. People have since asked why, although I find very few people opposed to what happened. The answer is simple: because the resources had not followed the responsibility. The states and territories were basically buck-passing and ATSIC, with few resources, was making terrible decisions, having to decide whether one community would have a basic immunisation program or whether another would get some money to buy some four-wheel drive vehicles to get elderly folk in for services and into hospital when it was needed. Since then, resources have flowed into Aboriginal health services far more than ever before and we are beginning to see results.
There have been some improvements in Aboriginal health—in particular, in infant mortality. In my home state, infant mortality rates have dropped from 12.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1995-96 to 9.1 deaths by 2001-03. This is still unacceptable. It is still far worse than in the Australian population generally where the figure is 4.4 deaths per 1,000 live births, but it is a move in the right direction. It is not just health services that are going to influence Indigenous people’s health. It is going to involve housing, sewerage, water, good roads, jobs, opportunities for education and training—and on and on. These all need fixing urgently and there is a very long way to go in most of those areas.
I did not take the decision to support the move of Aboriginal health services away from ATSIC easily. I visited many Indigenous communities at that time and I made the recommendation to my former party on the basis of those visits, and they supported my decision. I travelled in particular through the western and northern parts of New South Wales, from Broken Hill to Bourke and on to Brewarrina, with Barb Flick. I want to mention Barb here as she is one of the many highly talented and committed Indigenous women who have made such a difference to their communities. She was one of those at the time who were wholeheartedly in support of the responsibility shifting from ATSIC. At that time I also visited the North Coast of New South Wales, Alice and some other places in the Territory. There was angst, at that time, about the move of those services. Now, as I again move around Indigenous communities—I have not been back to all of those, but I have been to most of them and on to others—I see that it is supported. I think Indigenous health services are working better than they have ever worked before.
Let us look at housing, where I know there have been changes over very recent times. Just two or three years ago, the gap between what was out there by way of resources and what was needed, and what communities actually wanted, was still absolutely massive. I have seen some excellent housing programs, particularly in the Wadi Packi communities in the south-west of New South Wales, where the local people had a say in construction. They have been involved in training their young people to be a part of the construction teams and to also then be able to do repair work in the future. But I have seen far too many communities with dilapidated, overcrowded, inappropriate housing and this sets, I believe, a tone of hopelessness and frustration.
I have also seen some very badly designed new houses that have been foisted on Aboriginal communities, basically because they had no choice. I hope that, with the community involvement in this new method of delivering services, that too will be a thing of the past and that we will not be foisting triple-fronted brick veneers on people in remote parts of the country—that they will actually work from the drawing board and all their young people will be trained to help to build those houses and to maintain them in the longer term. There are huge numbers of jobs waiting to be done in Aboriginal communities. A lack of training and a lack of opportunity are stopping Aboriginal people from fully participating in their communities.
Looking at the new model that is evolving, it will be quite some years, I would imagine, before we see any significant impact right across Australia. I have been involved with an overseas aid agency, Plan—or what was known as Foster Parents Plan—for over 25 years. Their program has always involved consultation with local communities and breaking through the red tape so that you do not have various ideas, disconnected opportunities and pockets of money. It involves actually sitting down with communities and looking at what their hopes and dreams are for the next 10 or 20 years, putting in place the basics and then letting the communities get on with it. Hopefully, the new programs that are evolving will involve cutting through some of the red tape here in Australia and not any longer having 20 or 30 visits to communities from different programs or different departments at state, territory and federal levels. All of the pilots we have seen over the years seemed to vanish and need heaps more paperwork.
Senators on both sides of this argument, both those supporting this bill and opposing this bill, have listed the statistics detailing all of the areas where Indigenous Australians are falling so far behind. I argue that something has to change. It was, after all, the Labor Party who said that they would abolish ATSIC—not reform or restructure ATSIC, but abolish ATSIC. We now have the government doing it. This is not the way that I would have liked to have seen it done. Those of us on the crossbench have major concerns about the lack of consultation and involvement. But there do seem to be, as you go through what is planned, opportunities down the track for further involvement and for Aboriginal communities to have a lot more say than they have in the past, community by community. I am not talking now about a national elected body, which I think should go hand-in-hand with this; I am talking about service delivery.
As I have travelled, I have not really found in most Aboriginal communities a strong attachment to ATSIC. At best, I would say most people were ambivalent or noncommittal. In some communities there has been a lot of support, but in a lot of communities there has been some real angst about what was happening and about the lack of services. I think this has been driven by the lack of resources that ATSIC has had to survive with. The Indigenous coordination centres that have been established and the trials that we are seeing in each state now seem to be attracting support. One indicator is that we seem to have more kids going to school in a number of cases. In the Territory, where underfunding of education has been a historic reality, it seems that there are more kids attending school at the trial site there. Indeed, there are so many that they need more desks.
I conclude by saying that a part of all of this is that we cannot just focus on service delivery, where I think the government has got it right. I think we also need to look at a national Indigenous body that is elected and that is resourced properly—and also at an apology. Unless we get all parts of this right, I do not see that we will get the quick answers that we need as far as Indigenous people are concerned. Hopefully, this new body will see the end to the buck-passing, cost shifting and blame shifting between all the various departments at state, territory and federal levels. In particular, one of the reasons that I will be supporting this legislation is that basically the buck stops over there—although the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs is not with us at the moment. Basically, Senator Vanstone is saying to us: ‘Leave it to me. It is with the federal government now; if services don’t improve, that is where the buck will stop.’ So, hopefully, on the service delivery front, we will see major improvements and we will see Aboriginal communities involved in the planning for their future. Hopefully, we will see Indigenous people, particularly young people, trained in the service delivery and also in putting the infrastructure in place in their communities.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-03-14,"—Many years ago when I was a doctor at the Port Hedland Regional Hospital, way back in 1975, I was invited to attend an Aboriginal bush meeting on the banks of the Coongan River near Marble Bar. The Pilbara Aborigines used to hold these meetings every quarter. They would have about 300 people there who would come from all over the Pilbara—people from around Onslow and people from the desert communities in the east, some of whom did not speak English. There was no agenda at these meetings—anybody could raise any issue that they wished to—and they lasted for three or four days until everybody had talked themselves out. I was invited there to talk about the health service at the Port Hedland Regional Hospital. They had concerns about the way some Indigenous people were treated in the outpatient department which I had to answer for and explain away, which I did my best to do. But it made me conscious of the fact that the Aborigines were very aware of the rest of society and that we were perhaps a little naive to think that these people did not understand how the rest of mainstream Australia worked.
The issues identified by the people gathered there over that weekend as being the most important problems faced by Indigenous people were health, housing, education and what they described as ‘the grog problem’. Alcoholism was recognised by them as the biggest problem facing the Aboriginal communities in the north. It was equally made clear that the issues that the politically active white advisers and their politically active Aboriginal friends were pushing, such as native title and land rights, were not the priority issues of the ordinary Indigenous people of the Pilbara. For me, this meeting was a turning point in my understanding of what the objectives of ordinary Aboriginal people really were. I came to the conclusion that in fact these objectives were really no different to those of the rest of the Australian community. As I said, they saw health, education and housing as their chief problems.
I thought that the problem then was one of implementation in order that benefits could be brought to Indigenous people in terms of health services, education, housing and so on—these very practical measures and very practical matters. I thought that when ATSIC was set up in 1990 the new organisation would be able to take leadership in delivering better on-the-ground services to the Indigenous people of Australia and ensuring that the needs of the Aboriginal people of Australia were adequately provided for. But, sadly, this proved not to be the case.
I have to start by saying that, after all the high hopes which surrounded the establishment of ATSIC in 1990 by the then ALP government, ATSIC lost its way. It forgot that its primary responsibility was to improve the quality of life of the Indigenous people of Australia. It is sadly all too evident that it failed in that task and diverted its efforts in various ways, which I propose to go into to some degree. The report of the review of ATSIC, In the hands of the regions—a new ATSIC, commented: ‘Perceptions of failure permeated every meeting with the review panel.’ The review found that there was a perception that ATSIC was failing in its advocacy and representative function. As put by the report:
In some regions of the country, the relationship between ATSIC and the people it is designed to serve is tenuous at best.
A disconnect was seen between the board and the regional councils and between the regional councils and their communities, and even more of a gap was seen between the communities and the body of ATSIC. Even the Labor Party has acknowledged that the body it created, ATSIC, has been a failure. In an interview on PM on 30 March last year, the then opposition leader, Mark Latham, said:
ATSIC is no longer capable of addressing endemic problems in Indigenous communities, it has lost the confidence of much of its own constituency and the wider community. Unhappily, the current model has not delivered sufficient gains to Indigenous communities ...
The Bennelong Society notes that ATSIC essentially imposed a Western style construct on Indigenous people that was alien to their culture, asking them to engage in a political process that involved nominations, campaigning and elections. This is typified by the fact that 80 per cent of those people entitled to vote in ATSIC elections, which cost between $7 million and $9 million to run, chose not to vote. In its submission to the ATSIC review the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council of Western Australia stated:
The selection process itself is modeled on the Westminster system and does not take into account traditional methods of selecting leadership or spokespeople from within the community. In addition, the people elected through the ATSIC system are not necessarily the same people from within a community who have the traditional authority to represent the area.
The result has been a lack of effective governance within ATSIC and what might best be described as nepotism. As the Bennelong Society stated in its submission to the ATSIC review committee:
The politicisation of Aboriginal service provision ... has created a Tammany Hall style of grace and favour politics. The politicians have constituencies that are so small, and so dominated by clan allegiances, that votes can be bought en bloc. Placing more services at the discretion of Aboriginal politicians is against the interests of needy Aborigines.
In practice, some ATSIC politicians have used their control of funding to benefit particular family groups, with the result that funding and grants have not necessarily been directed to areas of greatest need or in the most effective and transparent manner. Mr Jack Waterford, Editor in Chief of the Canberra Times, wrote in the March 2003 edition of the Public Sector Informant: ‘One group’s grant is another group’s grant refused. ATSIC politicians fit into a new mould of being people who can deliver, who make deals, who horse-trade, who buy favours and remember grudges, who can reward friends and punish enemies.’ In 2003, the government moved control of funding away from ATSIC to a new body: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services, ATSIS. Dr Lowitja O’Donoghue, a former chair of ATSIC, welcomed this as a positive development. According to a Parliamentary Library paper:
Lowitja O’Donoghue ... suggested the changes were the only way to end the ‘pork-barrelling’ and ‘nepotism’ which she suggested were currently rife within ATSIC ...
The previous Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, said that, prior to the creation of ATSIS, ‘There was a perception that ATSIC elected officials were making funding decisions that lacked transparency and may have involved patronage or personal gain.’ He went on to refer to the ATSIC review panel’s finding:
The governance of ATSIC, its Board and Regional Councils was raised particularly by Indigenous participants who exhibited a level of overwhelming concern.
ATSIC’s funding has not always been allocated in the most effective way to bring about lasting benefits to the Aboriginal people. Minister Ruddock has referred to policies and procedures in respect of ATSIC’s programs and grants that have not accorded with best practice, which he says has resulted in ‘significant losses of funds from failed businesses and Indigenous organisations’.
An example of ATSIC placing less emphasis on its basic charter of providing services to the Indigenous people of Australia has been its focus on participating in international forums. Not only does ATSIC send representatives to participate in overseas conferences and United Nations forums; it also funds a permanent presence in Geneva. This must necessarily come at the expense of putting resources on the ground in order to fund practical measures to overcome Indigenous disadvantage. It is symptomatic of a loss of direction, and of a lack of focus on what should be ATSIC’s main priority. Participation in these international forums, which might be labelled talkfests, does not bring any practical benefit to those living in remote Indigenous communities or to those living in poverty in the cities.
One of ATSIC’s functions was to develop policy proposals to further develop and improve the quality of life of Indigenous Australians. The ATSIC review noted concerns about ATSIC’s lack of policy effectiveness. It said that there were widespread concerns about ‘ATSIC’s policy input, influence and capabilities’. It also said that ATSIC’s senior leadership admitted that the organisation had not always responded to requests for policy input in a timely manner and in some cases had failed to respond at all. The review panel found that stakeholders had little faith in ATSIC’s ability to influence the policy agenda and achieve positive outcomes for Indigenous Australians. Concerns were expressed to it about the quality of ATSIC’s policy advice. It said that stakeholders ‘believe that the organisation does not have the requisite skills and understanding of government to drive a policy agenda’. So ATSIC had a lot of problems and it was necessary to change the way in which services were delivered to Aboriginal communities.
In travelling around the north-west of Western Australia over the last five or six years, I have had endless complaints about ATSIC from ordinary Indigenous people living in both towns and communities. Let us look at what the government is doing. The government has made sweeping changes. It is concerned that, while there has been some improvement in the quality of life of Indigenous Australians, overall the progress has been slow. The new approach is based on all of us accepting responsibility. We all need to do better—Commonwealth, state and territory governments and Indigenous people themselves.
This government is strongly committed to improving the lives of all Indigenous people and ensuring that they enjoy the same opportunities as all Australians. In 2004-05, $2.9 billion has been directed to Indigenous-specific programs. This represents an increase in funding in real terms of 39 per cent over and above the funding by Labor in its last year in office. It represents what is an undeniable commitment by the Howard government to improving the life of Indigenous people.
The government has appointed a National Indigenous Council, whose members have been selected on the basis of merit. Minister Vanstone announced the make-up of the National Indigenous Council on 6 November. It had its first meeting in December. The council consists of men and women who bring with them a range of expertise, including in business, native title, the resource sector, the military, academia, education, tourism, sport, health, local government, the law and criminal justice.
A criticism of ATSIC has been that there was insufficient participation by women in its organisational structure. Of the current 18 ATSIC commissioners just one is a woman. By way of contrast, five of the 14 members of the National Indigenous Council are women. Additionally, the chairperson is a woman, a distinguished Western Australian magistrate, Sue Gordon, who I happen to know personally, as she comes from Port Hedland.
The programs that were being delivered by ATSIC—or, in more recent times, ATSIS—are instead going to be delivered by mainstream agencies; that is, existing agencies of the federal government will, as a component of their service, provide programs for Aborigines. This will mean that there will be greater transparency of funding decisions and no scope at all for patronage, personal gain or nepotism.
The government is determined to work cooperatively and in partnership with local communities to identify their aspirations and priorities and to develop appropriate solutions. Funding decisions will be made on the basis of need. In particular, the government is determined to overcome the culture of passive welfare dependency that has proved so pernicious for many remote communities and for Aborigines living in towns and cities. The principle of mutual obligation has been extended so that the government will negotiate shared responsibility agreements with local families and communities. These agreements will be based on a long-term community vision, looking at 20 to 30 years into the future.
In conclusion, it has become increasingly obvious that ATSIC failed the Aboriginal people. This was clear from the findings of the ATSIC review, which revealed some serious deficiencies along with widespread disillusionment by Indigenous people over its performance. The general failure of ATSIC simply cannot be ignored. The government has decided, as I said, that we all have to do better and that ATSIC will not be part of the solution in the future. In a sense, ATSIC very much became part of the problems faced by Indigenous people in Australia.
The government’s reforms are well intentioned and have only the welfare of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at heart. It is hoped that the mainstreaming of services will result in enhanced service delivery and better value for money, which will in turn hasten the progress of overcoming Indigenous disadvantage while at the same time ensuring that we as Australians in general can feel that at long last something is being done in a very real and practical way to improve the lifestyle of the Indigenous people of Australia and the conditions under which they live.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-03-14,"—Today we have been invited by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to share in the death throes of ATSIC. She has invited us to this place to share once again in the rhetoric and to look at the final abolition of a noble organisation—one that is not perfect; no-one pretends it is perfect. It is increasingly frustrating to hear the speeches that are being given in this place that seem to pretend that anyone is claiming that any organisational or administrative structure could possibly be a perfect solution. What we have is one more round of discussions in this place to demonise and to politicise what has gone before and to laud the future—to come out with great statements about why what is going to happen next is going to be the magical solution to impose upon the Indigenous people of this country.
I am not happy to be here and to be part of this process. I am actually frustrated by the process through which we have gone, because in reality what we are seeing now is the death throes of ATSIC. To all intents and purposes, the administration, the people, the buildings, the files and the corporate knowledge have all gone. They went last year, straight after the minister announced the decision to kill ATSIC. In an amazing show of speed—something that, as an ex public servant, I was quite amazed to see—within two months we had a decision announced and we had the administrative arrangements in place to move the budget and people to new programs. That came about on 1 July last year. Subsequently we have been exhorted by the government to hurry up and get through our process so we can pass this legislation so that the government can get on with their business, which is to impose a structure and a process on the Indigenous people of this country.
That is just not right. It does not reflect the past and the hopes of the past, but it does seem to reflect the resigned feelings we were dealing with on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs. The committee started with a clear expectation that we would be looking at ways that this legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005], could be considered and that Indigenous affairs could be managed in the country. But, from the time it started, there was already resignation to the fact that the government wanted to move on. We had known that since 1996 and now we had the process: they were going to move on and they were going to move on now, despite the wishes of the people who were going to receive the services that we all agree all Australians—not just Indigenous people but all Australians—should have. The legislation, with its divisive nature, has been pushed through, the images have been built up, the media has had its role and all of us are indeed now part of the death throes of ATSIC.
I just want to put on the record my acknowledgment of the people who worked in this body—they seem to have been forgotten through this whole process—the people whose careers were dedicated to the delivery of programs to the Aboriginal people of the country. Their wishes and their skills were dismissed and they were moved to other departments. The expectation was that they could be moved just like chairs and would maintain their enthusiasm and commitment. All too often, that is exactly what happens: the people who work in this field, who identify with this area, do have a commitment to the work they do. They have a commitment to service delivery. They have a commitment to the true sense of public service.
No-one who is working in the Public Service believes that any structure should be sacrosanct. We have all survived many restructures in the public sector. We take it as a part of our careers. But what has been particularly concerning in this process is that it is not just an administrative process. We are talking about an organisation that was set up as a representative body and that gave people in the Aboriginal community the chance to have a voice in the determination of their futures. In fact, in many ways it is the symbolism of ATSIC that we are mourning more than any administrative changes. We are mourning the death throes of a true symbol of self-determination in our country, one that was brought in with much fanfare, with speeches in this place in the late eighties and early nineties which were celebrating the hope that there was going to be a new way forward for Indigenous affairs in our country. As a public servant at the time, I was caught up in the enthusiasm, the hope and the expectation that there were going to be real changes.
The first round of ATSIC elections was widely publicised. In fact, the way the process was going to work was internationally publicised. To see that hope dashed is for me one of the more disappointing things that has happened over the last 20 years in Australian politics. The process of destroying ATSIC has in many ways told the Aboriginal people of our country that they are able to move forward now, we can wipe out the past, the years of self-determination can now be moved aside and we will move into the next round of government decisions on how Aboriginal affairs should be handled. This happened throughout the whole of the last century, but particularly from the 1970s.
I really hope that people who are interested in this whole process will read the Senate select committee report, because we attempted through that committee to listen to people who had knowledge and interest in the field and who came to talk to the senators about what they hoped for their future and in many ways about what they mourned—the things that had not worked in the past. Once again I want to defy the government speakers who continually claim that we on this side of the chamber want some kind of protection of ATSIC. That is not what we are asking for. We are asking for some acknowledgement of the things in ATSIC that worked, not just a demonising of the things that failed.
It is my argument that, if you take too close a look at any administration in any area, you will be able to find fault and you will be able to mark that as the reason why something has not worked and why it is absolutely essential that it has to change. In fact, last year I believe some people did that kind of investigation into the operations of this place, the Senate. There is a certain argument that perhaps we belong to the past, perhaps we should do better and perhaps we have not been operating as well as we ought. If we allow without argument a simplistic proposition that everything ATSIC did was wrong and failed and that anything the new process will do will automatically work, then we as senators have failed. There would be no question about that. We would be taking the easy way out, once again all too simplistically imposing on the people who should be represented here but who are not when we talk about the future of Aboriginal affairs. People are once again talking for them.
We hear a lot about the consultation processes. Mick Dodson, in one of the hearings of our Senate committee, said:
In my experience, what the government means by consultation is, ‘We, the government, have an agenda. Let’s go out and run that agenda past the Indigenous community organisation.’ ... In that model there is no place for Indigenous decision making. It—
that is, the government consultation—
is a process by which the government or bureaucratic agenda gets some sort of legitimisation.
Given that environment, how can the new wave of Indigenous affairs have hope of success? The key element in any change is participation and the acceptance of those people who are going to be most affected by it. We have the abolition of an administrative structure, but more than that we have an attack on the spirit that formed that administrative structure. We have the simplistic—and I keep saying that word because it is the core of the argument that is being used about this whole activity—allegation that ATSIC has failed and therefore the people of ATSIC have failed. If that is the full argument, there can be no future. If we can just say, ‘There was an elected process and it didn’t work, therefore there won’t be any further elected processes,’ there will be no hope for the future. Those concerns that were raised about the place of Indigenous voices will be justified. Where we are moving forward must include the voices of Aboriginal Australia. They cannot be silent and they cannot be invisible in this process.
The key to the future is acceptance of what happened in the past, learning from that and moving forward. It is not another layer of legislation, another layer of rhetoric or another layer of rules. What we must have is an acceptance that people will be able to operate in various flexible ways. That is what Dr Shergold has been saying through the whole process: we need to be more flexible and more inclusive. We accept that. I am questioning how we can encourage people to be part of this new inclusion if we have automatically said that what has gone before has failed and that they are part of the failure.
In the determination of the select committee we were able to see evidence by a range of authoritative bodies about where there has been genuine disadvantage in Aboriginal and Islander communities across our country. No-one challenges that, no-one disagrees. Everyone accepts that we must do better. But that cannot be a process of doing to others; it must be a joint participative process. The key message that came out of the Senate select committee was not ‘protect ATSIC’, it was ‘protect the future’ and ‘involve us in the future’. But, unfortunately, the cynicism out there is overwhelming.
Just after the government made their announcement and just after all the people and the equipment and so on of ATSIC were moved on to other departments, I was fortunate enough to attend a community gathering in Brisbane which highlighted the concerns of the community about their future. I was overwhelmed by the genuine emotion at that place. For the first time I was involved in a smoking ceremony where the elder women of the community included me in their hopes for the future. They gave me to understand what they hoped would come out of whatever deliberations the Senate was going to undertake in the future. They hoped that we would:
1.  oppose any legislation for the abolition of ATSIC unless and until an alternative elected representative structure, developed and approved by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples is put in place and which would, at the same time assume the functions of ATSIC.
2.  oppose any move to appoint an Advisory Committee as contrary to the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People to elect their own representatives.
3.  oppose any move to Diminish, Dismantle and Destroy and or/Erode the principles of self determination and self management since any such action would turn back the clock on hard won rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
4.  strongly defend these rights of self determination and self management of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People previously supported by the Australian Parliament.
5.  oppose any move to mainstream services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People as this would severely disadvantage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People.
These were the people of metropolitan Brisbane; they were not from remote areas. Their claims were reflected across much of evidence that we had at the Senate select committee. I am fascinated by hearing people quote what happened at the Senate select committee because it seems sometimes that we must have been in different places. The bulk of the evidence can be seen in the transcript. We did not have people come in and say, ‘Let the government do whatever they want.’ We did not have people say, ‘Take away ATSIC. It’s failing. It’s no good to us.’ We had people say there were faults with ATSIC—absolutely; there is no doubt about that—but the key point in this claim from the Aboriginal people of Brisbane was that they wanted something to replace their representative voice. They did not want appointed people. Senator Eggleston, I am interested in the term ‘appointed by merit’. As a public servant, I am quite clear about what I thought merit meant and I would like to see the selection criteria and the job description for people on the advisory group, because that in itself creates some concern. Questions raised in evidence to our committee were: how were the advisory group created and on what are they going to advise? How are they going to involve the other people across the community in this process?
There was a degree of anger expressed by the Aboriginal people with whom I met, and I know that other senators from all parties have expressed the same thing. We need to ensure that the anger and disappointment do not blind people to the future, because we will not be able to succeed as a government if we do not have the engagement of Aboriginal and Islander people in this country. That is not just some kind of rhetoric to engage people in the political process; it is some sense of trust that there are programs to help them. We all acknowledge there is a need across the whole range of government service delivery to consider ways to bring the expectations of Aboriginal and Islander people up to those which we all have in education, health, housing, political involvement and daily life. We must have a process which gives people hope that their voices will be heard and respected and not just dismissed.
The key issue of mainstreaming which came out of the government’s plan for the administration has caused major worry with the people who have already experienced mainstreaming in many of the key service delivery areas over the last 50 years and longer. It is not that people reject mainstreaming; they are fearful that mainstreaming will not provide the services that they need. Throughout this process we saw very little rejection by Aboriginal people of the proposed changes. We saw concern and we saw some anger about the fact that all things past seem now to be failed, but we did not see people saying, ‘We will not be part of the process.’ We saw people saying, ‘We want to be part of the process and we want to have a voice that is truly representative.’ There was no false hope or particular aggrandisement of the past.
Concern was expressed about the lack of information about the future arrangements, and that was shared by many of the people on the Senate committee. It is one thing to have the past abolished; it is another thing to know what we are leaping into in the future. We have heard previous speakers talk at length about the lack of knowledge and accountability of things like SRAs and regional agreements. They sound good, but some of the things that were in ATSIC sounded good as well. At this stage, it is not enough to have strong, effective rhetoric. We must have much more detail about what the hopes of the future are.
I was particularly interested in the concept put forward by Dr Shergold about the ‘new’ mainstreaming, which must be significantly different to the ‘old’ mainstreaming. The degree of difference is not yet clear to me—and I do not think it is clear to many people in the community. There is hope that whatever is coming next is going to be new because we are damned sure that what came in the past did not work. The new mainstreaming in the best possible world would be a shared hope. But in the current environment, without the detail and without that core element that no-one can measure and no-one can impose, which is genuine trust, I am worried that where we are going will have no real hope for the future and no real engagement of the people who are definitely the most important in this argument—that is, the Aboriginal people, who have the right to expect more.
Commissioner Allison Anderson, when she came before our committee—and she has written about it since—talked about her concerns as an ATSIC commissioner. She was told, as were all other elected Aboriginal people at both the regional and commissioner levels, that their jobs were going to be terminated halfway through their current terms. She was concerned that their voices would not be heard and her worry was that in a number of years in the future we would all be back here again talking about the new program that would be imposed on people because the latest plans have not worked. I think that we have a responsibility to do better than that.
My friend Jackie Huggins, who was part of the ATSIC review—and we have heard much about that in this place before—said in a letter to us on the Senate select committee:
I ask you to consider and to promote the following point to your parties and to the bureaucracy who will implement the post-ATSIC changes in the administration of Indigenous Affairs: Indigenous Australians are engaged now in an historic process of determining the structures they want and need to represent them to make their communities healthy.
Do not expect it to fit within a western model of process or timing. If it is to work, if it is to provide some guidance on the leadership our people so desperately need, the process must be conducted on our terms.
We as a Senate should encourage that cooperation so that together we can make a new process which will adequately, effectively and positively fulfil the expectations of Aboriginal people in our country. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2005-03-14,"—I rise in great sadness to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] today. I have been through the stage of being angry at what is happening with ATSIC and where it is going to go. At this stage I have reached simply a position of sadness. We have heard in this debate some very high rhetoric and high-minded opinions from both sides about what needs to happen with Aboriginal affairs, where we need to go in terms of providing genuine self-determination, and the possibility—as the letter just read out from Jackie Huggins suggests—of a new organic form of representation coming up from the bottom. But at the end of the day it comes back to this parliament, or the two major parties, having the political will to actually allow Aboriginal people to represent themselves effectively and successfully and, importantly, to listen to them on issues that concern them. Instead of talking down to Aboriginal people and Indigenous communities, we need to start listening and accepting in our hearts the principle of self-determination.
I do not believe that will happen. I do not believe that, with the demise of ATSIC, it will be replaced by something better. I believe we will go backwards on issues of providing that self-determination. And that saddens me because I genuinely believe that, if we are going to raise our Indigenous brothers and sisters out of the vice of abject poverty, of discrimination and of being at the bottom of every single indicator of social and physical wellbeing, we need to provide self-determination. Ultimately, white society cannot impose a solution on black society. Ultimately, it will need to come from Indigenous communities and Indigenous people themselves as to how self-determination is going to work and how we are going to ensure that their community reaches a position of improvement vis-a-vis the white community.
ATSIC in many ways—and this has been spoken about by many people—was a structure that was flawed from the start. We were imposing an elected model on Indigenous representation that in some ways cut across traditional forms of leadership in Indigenous communities. But, as Winston Churchill once said, ‘Democracy is the least worst form of government yet invented.’ That fundamentally represents what we were talking about. In the absence of the very formal structures of representation and leadership—the structures we destroyed by our patterns of white settlement in this country—an elected model was probably the best model that could operate to provide genuine representation that had credibility among Aboriginal people. True, there have been flaws, particularly in my home state of Queensland, in the way that representation has ultimately played out. But, at the end of the day, almost every ATSIC person I have met at regional and national levels was someone who was generally committed to the improvement of their people. I want to join with Senator Moore in thanking those people who have made an enormous commitment to, done an enormous amount of work for and obtained enormous achievement in ATSIC over the last 14 years. I think we need to thank those people and acknowledge their commitment and their hard work in a very difficult environment where this government and the previous government made their work harder and harder for them.
It was another ATSIC chair—I forget which one—who said that ATSIC gets 100 per cent of the blame but is responsible for only 15 per cent of the programs. I think that is a fundamental problem which remains in this country. ATSIC has become the whipping boy: blamed for problems with health and education, which are primarily state government responsibilities, and blamed for problems with employment outcomes, which are predominantly a federal government responsibility. It is blamed for everything. It is blamed for domestic violence, which is a matter that comes right down into the home as opposed to boardrooms in Canberra. It is blamed for everything, yet responsible for not very much.
What that highlights to me is that lack of genuine self-determination and that lack of actually saying to Aboriginal people, ‘You are responsible.’ The structure which we ultimately finished with for ATSIC, where it was responsible for only 15 per cent of the programs going out to Indigenous people but was blamed for 100 per cent of the problems, is a structure which we have allowed to develop and which has not ultimately been in the best interests of Aboriginal people. We really need to ensure that, if we believe in self-determination, we should practise it. We need to say, ‘You are going to be accountable for outcomes in your areas, communities and organisations right through to national representation. You need to be held accountable for achievement.’ That has not occurred and it will not occur under the proposals the government is putting in place.
I read with some interest in the select committee’s report the comment from the government senators—I notice that Senator Heffernan follows me in this debate—that the government’s reforms include ‘provision for regional partnership agreements which would allow formal recognition of such arrangements’; that is, arrangements which may be established at a local level to provide representation. But will they? Will the national government listen to organically developed local representation of Indigenous people? I really do not believe they will. When you look at structures already emerging in my home state of Queensland as to who is providing the representation, shall we say, for Indigenous communities, you can see that pattern emerging.
In Queensland I think there are 16 Indigenous community councils, which are elected by their local people and provide representation on a wide range of issues. They have now formed into their own Indigenous local government association following the abolition of the Aboriginal Coordinating Council by the Beattie government—again, another attempt at destroying strong voices for Indigenous people. They provide representation for people right across Cape York—right into Woorabinda, Yarrabah and Cherbourg—and into the Gulf of Carpentaria, yet who is the government listening to when developing its plans or proposals for Cape York? Is it the Indigenous local government association? Is it the community councils? No, it is a self-appointed leader, Noel Pearson. The government picks the people that it is going to listen to. When there is legitimate, valid representation, will it actually provide recognition of that voice? No, I do not believe it will, because it does not suit its agenda to do so.
When you move into other areas, you will find that there are many Indigenous organisations across this country providing good work and good representation for their communities. In the absence of ATSIC, will they be heard? Will the government listen to these people or will they prefer instead their self-appointed experts, whether they are the people who happen to run a political agenda whom the government happens to find useful or the people the government has decided to nominate as its preferred voices? From ATSIC, I believe what we are entering into with this new structure, or lack of structure, is going to be a very backward step. It is going to be a step that will see those Indigenous voices lost from debates about Indigenous policy. We will move back to white ministers and white bureaucrats telling Aboriginal people what is good for them and where they should be going. We see that already emerging in the welfare reform debate in which ministers are saying what they believe Indigenous communities should be doing and how they should be responding. We see it in health debates. We see it in other areas. I do not believe that is going to result in better outcomes. We know from previous experience that will not result in better outcomes.
The experience of Indigenous communities around the world is that ultimately only self-determination, self-acceptance and self-management can deliver those outcomes. When communities and individuals take responsibility for themselves, when governments support them in doing that and when governments provide the resources for that to happen will be when you start to see movement in a forward direction. Interestingly, in abolishing ATSIC the Australian government also abolishes any sort of government commitment to self-determination. We now have Indigenous coordination centres run by government bureaucrats responsible for money. We now have mainstream departments responsible for Indigenous programs. We now have ministers appointing their own people who tell them what their views should be on Indigenous policy. None of this is self-determination. None of this fulfils the international requirements of self-determination of Indigenous people.
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in article 1 says that Indigenous people are entitled to self-determination as a fundamental principle in all of their dealings with government. Australia is going backwards in that regard. I will read briefly from the report to the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination by Les Malezer of the Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action in Queensland. It was noteworthy that that particular committee found in 2000 that Australia was in breach of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination over the Native Title Act and changes to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. CERD is currently reconsidering Australia’s status in regard to compliance with international conventions, and it is reconsidering that having finally received—four years late—the response of the Australian government to its findings in 2000. What will it say about what the Senate is doing today? What will the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination say—the committee which has international responsibility for the promotion of self-determination—about the abolition of ATSIC and the fact that we are replacing it with white bureaucrats who will determine Indigenous policy? Will they see that as a positive advance? Will they see that as a move towards self-determination? I believe they will see that as another backward step: Australia thumbing its nose at the world in terms of our position on human rights.
The submission from FAIRA to the committee said: ‘Given Australia’s failure to comply with the convention and the committee’s decision to examine the situation under the early warning measure and urgent action procedure, Australia’s tardiness should be regarded as a serious matter not least out of concern for the interests of victims of racial discrimination. The seriousness of this situation is further exacerbated by the absolute lack of participation by Indigenous peoples and civil society groups in the preparation of the current report.’ It goes on to say that Australia remains in serious breach of international conventions dealing with Indigenous people. The world is watching and the world will not like what we are doing here today.
Also today I should acknowledge the marvellous report produced by the ATSIC review that was conducted by Jackie Huggins, Bob Collins and John Hannaford. I thought it was a very interesting report, because it actually tried to take up what was best about ATSIC, get rid of what was the worst about ATSIC and move forward. It recognised that, whilst there will be a variety in terms of what is moving through, the regional representation of ATSIC—the regional councils—is probably where the best work is occurring, where the representation is closest to the people and where the advocacy is at its most effective. But they are being abolished in this bill. The government is actually rejecting the recommendations of its own ATSIC review. It is rejecting the recommendations and the outcome of that long, multimillion dollar process of consultation. It is rejecting the view that there should be formal representation at a regional level and that we should listen to that representation. It is true that the ATSIC commissioners probably have squandered an opportunity to provide effective national representation. Certainly the current commission is one which is impossible to defend. But to abolish the regional councils and the work being done at that level is a case of overkill and it sets back self-determination to a great degree. I think that this very disappointing.
I noticed the argument is constantly raised in the report and even in the media that ATSIC was never an effective representative body because only 20 per cent of Aboriginal people voted. If that is the criterion, let us abolish Western Australian local government because only 20 per cent of people vote in their voluntary elections. Let us abolish all the rural commodity representative organisations where less than the majority of people vote, even though compulsory taxes are collected from groups like the Meat and Livestock Australia and Australian Wool Innovation. Let us abolish any other organisation. Let us remove the legal privileges from shareholders because a majority of them do not vote in elections.
To dismiss it as irrelevant when 20 per cent of people have voted but when there are clear relationships between ATSIC, its councils and its communities is most unfortunate. People have the right to vote, people have voted, and people have put their faith in these organisations. The fact that so many people have voted should be celebrated. To say that it reduces the legitimacy of ATSIC is something which I find difficult to accept when what is replacing it is non-existent.
I do hope that, out of this process, the government will surprise me and come up with a structure of representation that does actually work; and I hope that, when the proposal by the Indigenous organisation on the north side of Brisbane to establish a community council gets a bit more beef on it, the government funds it. I hope the government actually recognises it, funds it and provides it with a strong voice. When they have got something to say on behalf of their community, I hope the government will actually listen. But that will not happen. It is not part of this government’s agenda to do that. It is not part of this government’s agenda to provide a strong voice for Indigenous people—unless they happen to agree with what that voice is saying. It is not part of this government’s agenda to provide funding to contrary voices which might be disagreeing with what the government is saying, or to voices which are making life difficult for ministers in terms of what they are doing. If it were the government’s role, ATSIC would still be there and the regional councils would have been maintained. The ATSIC review recommendation to set up a national council to replace the ATSIC commissioners would have been adopted and funded to provide that advocacy work.
That is not what the government’s agenda in this debate is about. The agenda is about getting Aboriginal voices out of the debate on Aboriginal policy and ensuring that, if they are to have a debate, they are in the role of supplicants applying for funding and grants from programs that ministers have already determined. It is about applying for the crumbs off a table which has been set by federal cabinet and in which Aboriginal people have no say or standing in terms of determining what is on that table.
That is the sadness of this debate and this bill, and it is with sadness that I speak. It is with sadness that I know that it is not going to solve the deep problems we have in Indigenous policy, it is not going to solve the issues that we have in respect of ATSIC, and it is not going to help promote self-determination. I will be voting against this bill—not because I think ATSIC is perfect but because I think that what is replacing ATSIC is going to be a great deal worse than what we have already got.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2005-03-14,"—It is depressing. What has happened to Indigenous people since the 1770s is very depressing. Part of it has been brought about simply by the adventures of white men and the way those adventures have interfered with the natural way for Indigenous people. What this legislation today is about is just another sad episode in hundreds of years of sadness and not much outcome for a lot of Indigenous people. It is not necessarily the case that the further you get from the bus stop in a city the greater the disadvantage and unfairness. There is a lot of unfairness in the cities but there is heaps of unfairness in remote communities.
This debate is really about the shutting down of ATSIC; it is not really about the future. I commend everyone on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, who put their hearts and their minds in a generous way to the issues that we face. I think there is a lot of goodwill on the committee to what is going to happen in the future. I am interested in what is going to happen in the future. The outcome of this bill is inevitable.
Professor Larissa Behrendt from the University of Sydney said something that made sense to me when I asked her, ‘If we had compulsory elections and we did all those things, what would be the difference in the outcome?’ She is an Indigenous academic—a smart young lady. She did not think there would be much difference, because, as in all elections, the winners are usually the key political thinkers—the people with the time and the motivation to get the numbers together. She observed in her answer that, on the data we looked at, one of the things that seemed to get lost was that a lot of women who had quite high primary votes were not getting through the regional council process; so we thought there might be one way of reforming that system. I agree with her, because a new election would probably produce the same outcome: politicians, politics and political operations which would overpower policy thinkers, intellectual firepower and outcomes on the ground for thousands of Aboriginal people in remote communities that have got nothing to show for all the hundreds of years of failed effort. As a matter of fact, there is a mob down at the tent embassy now—the Kalgoorlie mob—that I have been talking to this morning. They say that they warned ATSIC some time ago that by removing the money for the small programs in remote communities they would get the problem that we have now. We have a lot of Indigenous people who are fringe dwellers in cities and who live in ghastly circumstances.
You could go on for hours about this, but I do not think there is much to be said about the bill itself, because the bill is inevitable. But I would encourage everyone to participate in the thinking process for the future for Indigenous people. I would like to think that people like Boni Robertson, Melva Kennedy, Pam Greer and Les Bursill could be part of the thinking for the future. I do not think I need to say much more than this: if we really want to look at what has gone wrong in the past, it should be compulsory for every person interested in this debate to read the report Child sexual abuse in rural and regional and remote Australian Indigenous communities: 
a preliminary investigation to see the failings for the children and women that have been provided by the present system.
I do not think this is a very complicated piece of legislation. I think it is inevitable that ATSIC will be shut down, and I would encourage everyone to look to the future. There is a lot of goodwill in the community now; there is a lot more knowledge than there used to be about the plight of Indigenous people, and I think it would be fair to say that the goodwill should carry forward in the debate to make sure that we do not continue to make the mistakes of the past in our deliberations on what the future should be and what system will provide fairness for Indigenous people—where you can walk to the corner and a bus turns up, or you can turn on a tap and the water comes on. Those sorts of privileges should be afforded to people who live in remote communities where currently none of that happens. Thank you very much. I think it is time that I sat down and shut up.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-03-14,"—My question is to Senator Patterson, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing. In light of three consecutive annual premium rises of up to eight per cent, can the minister explain to the Senate why the private health insurance system in this country should be seen as sustainable?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health Insurance: Premiums</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-03-14,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. In relation to the sustainability of the private health insurance system—and I remind the minister of the intent of the first question—does the minister recall the following statement from the Liberal Party’s 2001 election policy:
The discouraging of ‘hit and run’ membership of health funds will lead to reduced premiums over time and to the stabilisation of the private health insurance industry ...
How does the minister explain the recent declines in membership for those aged under 45 and in particular those aged between 30 and 44 and children aged between five and 14? Doesn’t this suggest that families are struggling to maintain their private health insurance in the light of ever-increasing premiums, and won’t these continuing trends cast increasing doubt on the long-term sustainability of the system?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health Insurance: Premiums</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-03-14,"—It is an interesting question that Senator McLucas puts to me. It pays to have been around here for a while. I remember, when Labor was in government, that private health insurance providers could put up their fees at any time—and did, sometimes three and four times a year. From memory, I would say it was by over 10 per cent on average in most years. On average, I think it was 11 per cent. In one year alone, private health insurance went up 17 per cent. I remember former Senator Richardson sitting right here—maybe in this seat—and saying that the level that private health insurance membership was at or about to get to under Labor was unsustainable. Senator McLucas was not here then, so she may not remember that. But those of us who took out private health insurance and have had it for a long time remember very clearly private health insurance going up under Labor at a rate of between 10 and 11 per cent a year and, in one year alone, by 17 per cent.
Private health insurance premiums will rise by an average of 7.96 per cent this year. Most funds will increase premiums from 1 April. If you take an average across the last six years we have been in government, it is nowhere near the increases under Labor. I am not going to join in a discussion about individual funds, but the health insurance premiums have not been rubber-stamped. The government, through the Private Health Insurance Administration Council and the Department of Health and Ageing, scrutinises all the applications for increases carefully. The Australian Government Actuary has also been asked to give a second opinion on some funds, and further advice has been sought in one case from the actuary before the proposed premium increase was allowed.
Nobody wants increases in prices in private health insurance, but they are necessary in order to ensure that the funds stay viable. All of us know that there is more and more occurring in terms of provision of services and the type of surgery that can be done, and we have had a debate here about prostheses used. These all put pressure on private health insurance. The minister was satisfied that rate increases sought by the health funds should not be disallowed because, in all cases, they were no more than required to meet the expected payments to members and to maintain capital adequacy.
It is important to remember that the average increases are across all products. Some premiums will increase by less than the average; others will increase by more. In the coming weeks, funds will advise their members how premiums will be affected. As I said before, the cost of health care is rising, largely due to increasing technology and rising wages, which I did not mention before, including rising wages of other health professionals. It is unrealistic to think that private health insurance can be isolated from price increases, particularly where the nation expects better and better benefits from the latest technologies.
Private health insurance still provides peace of mind for nine million Australians who are covered. In 2003-04, one fund paid almost $300,000 for a single member claim. Few families could afford this expense without the benefit of private health cover. We are committed—I do not know what Labor’s position is; it has had various positions on this—to the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance and the higher rebates for older Australians, which ensure that private health insurance remains affordable and sustainable.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health Insurance: Premiums</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-03-14,"—I would rather stand our record on private health insurance up against Labor’s record any day—a record of an over 10 per cent increase per annum, while in one year alone it was 17 per cent; a record where we saw numbers at a point where even the then minister said it was unsustainable. We have seen more people and more families in work and able to pay their private health insurance, a 30 per cent rebate that Labor has never said it would support and increased assistance to older people. They are the measures we are using. Just recently we put through a bill to ensure that we could contain the costs of some of the prostheses covered by private health insurance. It contained measures to make this sustainable. It is unrealistic to expect that private health insurance prices will not increase, but they increased more under Labor every year, on average, than they have ever increased under us.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health Insurance: Premiums</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-03-14,"—Senator Greig asked me a question on 9 March in relation to victims of trafficking. I have further information in relation to that question and I seek to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
During Question Time on 9 March 2005, Senator Greig asked me a question regarding victims of trafficking.
The Australian Government is committed to eradicating the despicable practice of trafficking in persons. One of the most important initiatives is the new Australian Federal Police (AFP) mobile strike team (Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team (TSETT)) is operational and is proactively investigating trafficking-related offences. There are currently five matters before the courts, with a total of 14 offenders facing charges in Australia for sexual servitude and slavery-related offences. The AFP’s TSETT is investigating a number of other cases.
In relation to the specific question asked by Senator Greig about visa arrangements for trafficked persons, I can confirm that women trafficked to Australia before 1999 are eligible for the full range of visas available under the Government’s package which includes Bridging Visas F, Criminal Justice visas and Witness Protection (Trafficking) visas.
The extent of that protection depends on whether they can assist investigations into slavery offences that existed before the 1999 reforms.
Such women are also eligible for support under the comprehensive victim support program.
In addition, the visa arrangements are not restricted to victims of trafficking; they are also available to witnesses who can provide assistance to a trafficking investigation.
Of course, since the modem slavery and sexual servitude offences were introduced by the Government in 1999, it is easier to prove offences relating to trafficking and those amendments will be enhanced further by the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 which is currently before Parliament.
In relation to the women detained in Villawood Detention Centre, I can confirm the Australian Federal Police investigated the allegations made by the two women concerned.
These were lengthy and comprehensive investigations. As a result of these investigations the support package was withdrawn.
It would note be appropriate to comment on the reasons for this. I can say however, this action was in line with the appropriate policies to address the problem of sexual servitude.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Crime: People Trafficking</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,4,1,speech

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-03-14,"—This is an extremely important matter, which I am pleased the Senate is allocating some time to. The Australian public have every right to be alarmed at the escalating costs consumers are facing with respect to private health insurance and they have every right to question the Howard government’s failed reforms, which have seen, as we have heard today, massive hikes in premiums along with a growing imbalance in the membership cohorts of private health insurance providers. Less than two weeks ago, on 2 March 2005—the very same day that interest rates rose—the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, announced the fourth consecutive increase to private health insurance premiums. Mr Abbott announced an average increase of 7.96 per cent to private health insurance premiums nationally. Maybe Mr Abbott thought he could hide this latest private health insurance rise while the public were trying to digest the financial impact of an interest rate rise. It has since come to light that many people face premium increases far exceeding the 7.96 per cent national average announced by Minister Abbott. A nearly eight per cent price hike is bad enough but, for many people, this premium increase has been significantly more. We have heard today of 17 and 19 per cent increases in premiums.
As a consequence, more pressure is being put on household budgets, particularly with an interest rate increase to cope with as well. I bring to the attention of the Senate what was said by Ms Sharon Bullock, who was reported in the Cairns Post on 5 March as saying that she thinks they will probably manage the $18 per month interest rate hike to their household mortgage. Then she says:
I will need to cut out my health insurance.
That is what Ms Bullock is facing. Mr Abbott’s response seems to be to shrug his shoulders and say, ‘What am I meant to do about it?’ This is from a health minister who complained about the bills and paperwork that he himself had to deal with after his hospital treatment recently.
Australians with private health insurance will soon be receiving more than bills and paperwork; they will be getting a letter from their respective funds telling them just how much extra they will have to pay each month. We know that many people took out private health insurance because of the Howard government’s health policies, particularly the Lifetime Health Cover, or ‘run for cover’ initiative. These people are now facing the continuously increasing cost accompanied by increasing gap fees and exclusions.
Private health insurance is now 33 per cent more expensive than in 2001, totally wiping out the government’s 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. Furthermore, in 2004, gap fees increased across the board by 19.2 per cent. Under the Howard government, you end up paying more for your private health insurance and getting less out of it when you need to. In 2001, Mr Howard promised that his policies would reduce premiums for private health insurance. Yet, every year, premiums go up. This is another broken promise from the Howard government, and it is the community and consumers that end up paying the price.
Let me mind the Senate that, in 2001, John Howard’s election policy booklet promised that his government’s policies would ‘lead to reduced premiums’. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised their policies would create ‘downward pressure’ on premiums and that private health insurance would be more affordable and attractive to consumers. You may recall Minister Wooldridge saying in July 2000:
We’ve got so many extra people in—that will keep downward pressure on premiums. They won’t go up five to eight per cent a year as they did under Labor.
Since the minister made that laughable prediction then, premiums have risen not by five or eight per cent but by over 30 per cent. The recent increase rubberstamped by the minister for health is the highest premium rise since the Howard government implemented its changes to the industry four years ago. It is now obvious to everyone—especially the many thousands of Australians who, in good faith, took out private health insurance—that those reforms were ineffectual at best.
The Australian Consumers Association summed up the situation best when it said: ‘Everyone is doing well out of this except for consumers.’ The current cost to taxpayers from the government’s 30 per cent rebate exceeds $2.25 billion every year. The Australia Institute argued in a recent paper that the Howard government’s reliance on private health insurance as a public policy tool is ‘delivering a disproportionate benefit to high-income earners and those who reside in high-income households’. The government claimed its policies would increase participation in private health. In particular, there was that initial increase following the ‘run for cover’ campaign, but there has been a marked and ongoing decline in the number of younger Australians with private cover. Again, the Australia Institute states that this compositional change is helping drive up the cost of health insurance premiums due to the substantially higher average cost of claims by older Australians.
If you look at the graph in their document, you can see that, for people aged 30 to 45, there has been a seven to eight per cent decrease in take-up of private health insurance. People in that age group are leaving the industry. Those are families with children. They are the people that we want to be in the private health sector. At the same time—this is the period December 2001 to December 2004—the uptake of people aged 70 to 84 years has been around 18 per cent. There has been inordinate growth in older Australians joining private health insurance at the same time that families are withdrawing.
If you look at the average costs of hospital benefits paid out by private health insurers in the December 2004 quarter—
—How can you come in here and say something that is so untrue? That is so untrue!
—I quote from the PHIAC figures, Senator Knowles. The average cost of hospital benefits for the family age group paid out by private health insurers in the December quarter 2004 is around $100. The average cost for older Australians’ hospital benefit starts at $750 and grows for people over 85 to about $850. That questions, in my view, the ongoing sustainability of private health insurance if we continue down this track of families and younger Australians withdrawing and older Australians, whose draw on the funds will of course be higher, increasing in their membership. Private health subsidies have not reduced pressure on our public hospitals, as the government claimed they would. Statistically, privately insured Australians continue to use public hospitals at the same levels. It is not shifting the burden from the public sector to the private because, when you need acute and high-level surgery, a lot of that is still always going to happen in the public sector.
In 2004, gap fees across the board also increased, as I said earlier, by 19.2 per cent. In addition, the Australian Private Hospitals Association has estimated that out-of-pocket costs for Medibank Private patients in a private hospital not approved by the government-owned insurer will increase by up to $400 per visit under their new competitive selection processes. The potential out-of-pocket costs for privately insured Australians do not end with these changes and the premium increase. Unless the increased fees flow through to those actually providing the health care, private hospitals will have no choice but to raise the patient gap fees. Australians who have chosen private health insurance deserve to get better value for their money. It is clear they are paying more but getting less from their private health insurance funds.
The Howard government will still not take responsibility for the rises in private health insurance premiums. In today’s Financial Review, for example, it is reported that employees of the NIB Health Funds were warned not to blame the Howard government for this latest premium increase. It is reported that an email instructed employees not to say that the government had approved their rate increase when dealing with its members or the general public. They are saying, ‘Don’t say that. When people ring up, don’t blame the government.’
According to Annabel Stafford’s article, NIB has told its employees that, ‘The government is obviously going to be sensitive to this type of suggestion and we are not allowed to say it.’ From the behaviour of senators in this place at the moment, and during question time today, that is absolutely true. There is a level of sensitivity that is being shown from those who sit on the other side. I have to say that is typical of the Howard government’s response to the massive rise in private health insurance. They say: ‘Don’t blame us. It’s not our fault. It’s the consumer’s fault. It’s the rising cost of medical procedures or prostheses. It’s the states’ fault. It’s anyone but us that must take responsibility.’ And now we have one industry player so browbeaten, obviously, telling its staff not to blame the Howard government’s policies for this massive premium hike.
I am afraid to say that the Howard government have got it wrong from day one with this policy. They promised premiums would decrease. They promised that the more people there are in the system, the more pressure would be brought to decrease premiums. That has just not happened. We have seen a 33 per cent increase over the last three years. And this is what Treasurer Peter Costello was saying back in 1998, and they are saying it again today. On 29 November 1998 Mr Costello was interviewed by Glenn Milne on Face to Face. Mr Milne asked Mr Costello to respond to the view that the Labor Party was putting at the time, which was that they were going to give them a 30 per cent rebate but the funds would probably just jack up the premium and absorb the rebate. ‘What can you do,’ he asked the Treasurer ‘to stop the funds from doing that?’ Mr Costello said:
I don’t think that’s the case, Glen, because one of the reasons why premiums keep rising is that membership keeps falling—this is insurance.’
He went on to say:
... one of the best things you can actually do to bring premiums down is to (1) stop the decline in membership and (2) turn it around and put it back up because then you’ve got more people paying more premiums sharing the risks, and this is a very big part of the private health insurance proposal.
I put it to the Senate that Mr Costello got it wrong in 1998. While there was an increase in membership as a direct result of the ‘run for cover’ campaign, we are now seeing a decrease in membership, particularly of younger Australians joining private health insurance, while we are seeing a growth in membership of older Australians. As I explained, of course, their call on the funds is much higher than that of younger Australians.
The Liberal election policy in 2001 got it wrong when it said that there would be downward pressure on premiums and that they would not see increases that previously had existed. So Mr Costello got it wrong, the Liberal Party election policy got it wrong and Minister Wooldridge got it wrong when he suggested back in 2000 that there would be no increase. The Prime Minister got it wrong and now Mr Abbott has got it wrong. I am afraid this is a policy that is simply not working. We have seen a 33 per cent increase in three years. It has completely wiped out any benefit that the 30 per cent rebate has provided to health consumers. The real question that should be answered that was not answered today in question time is the question about the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance industry in this nation.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Private Health Insurance</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,10,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2005-03-14,"—Today we have heard a very interesting contribution by Senator McLucas, little of which, I have to say, is accurate. But then that comes as no surprise either. One of the most stunning things that I think the Labor Party have a record for in this place is trying to drive down private health insurance membership. Do you know, Mr Deputy President, that none of them admit to having private health insurance, and that is part of the problem, because everyone over there is earning more than $100,000 and they want to clog up the public system. They do not declare their private health insurance status. I think that is atrocious—to think that they want to bleed the public system while trying, in a policy sense, to drive down membership of private health insurance.
Senator McLucas cited an example from someone or other very early on in her contribution, saying that more pressure is being placed on household budgets because of the increases and because of interest rate increases. Isn’t it amazing? As Senator Patterson said in question time, Senator McLucas has not been here all that long, but some of us have and some of us have memories. I wonder if Senator McLucas remembers 1991-92, when the average increase in private health insurance—not the highest increase, but the average increase, which means, of course, that there are lots higher to get an average increase—was 17 per cent. Guess what? Interest rates were exactly the same.
So do not come in here lecturing this government about interest rates and levels of PHI increase because the average increase under the Labor government was 11 per cent. They had a system where the private health insurance companies could just say, ‘Think we might increase the premiums today.’ There was no control, there was no vetting system and they did not have to prove, in any way, shape or form, to the government, that it had to be increased. But the Labor Party just lived with it and said, ‘Who cares?’ They drove down private health insurance from around 70 per cent to around 30 per cent in 11 short years—it was 11 long years if you were in opposition, let me tell you. That is their record, and they come in here and talk about the fact that more pressure is being placed on household budgets. How hypocritical is that, when they only tell half the story?
The other half of the story is what the real rates of increase are. I want to give the Senate some examples, because listening to senators opposite you would think that the real rates of increase are going to absolutely blow people clean out of the water. From the Hospital Benefits Fund in Western Australia, one of the largest funds in Australia, rate increase examples are as follows: for young single savers, an extra 40c per week; single intermediate hospital with $100 excess is an extra 65c per week; intermediate hospital family cover with $100 excess is an extra $1.25 per week; single top hospital with $100 excess is an extra 75c per week; and family top hospital with $100 excess is an extra $1.45 a week. And the Labor Party come in here and say: ‘This is outrageous! It’s absolutely and utterly outrageous!’
But what Labor also do not take into account is that those increases are even less for people over 65 and over 70, because those people over 65 and over 70 get a rebate of 35 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. They get a larger rebate, which the Labor Party want to abolish altogether. So elect the Labor Party as a government and you will have no 30 per cent rebate, the over-65s will not have a 35 per cent rebate and the over-70s will not have a 40 per cent rebate. Labor will have none of that, because their interest, as we can see from this debate today, is to drive down private health insurance membership. As I say, increases under Labor were simply a flick of the pen. There was no approval process in place at all—they did not see a need to have it.
The other interesting thing that Senator McLucas said was that there is a reduction in the number of younger people. I could not help myself—I had to interject and say that that is absolutely wrong. But she did not correct it. She simply went ahead and told the story the way she wanted to tell it. The fact of the matter is that the review of Lifetime Health Cover, for example, shows that coverage of people aged 30 to 39 years is now 12.7 per cent higher than it was when Lifetime Health Cover was introduced—so do not come in here and say that it is less—and the coverage of people aged between 40 and 54 years is now 14 per cent higher. The very age brackets that Senator McLucas said were lower are not lower; they are higher.
—Is it going down?
—And here we go, saying, ‘Is it going down?’ The fact of the matter, Senator Marshall, is that private health insurance uptake is considerably higher than when the Labor government was in office, and it will continue to stay higher than it was. The fact of the matter is that Senator McLucas came in here and tried to convey that the number of young people with health insurance was lower than it used to be, and it is not. And here we go: Senator Marshall will no doubt try and swing the lid again to try and convince people that it is lower.
The other fact of the matter is that people are voting with their feet: 56 per cent of hospital episodes are done in the private sector. And Senator McLucas said, ‘It is not taking the weight off the public hospital system.’ Well, put all those people back into the public hospital system and see what weight it has taken off! Look at the number of hip replacements! Look at the number of cardiothoracic procedures! Just have a look at the whole range of procedures that are done in private hospitals. Take them out of private hospitals and stick them back into the public hospital system and see what it does to the public hospital system!
The public hospital system was groaning at the knees—and the ankles, the hips and everywhere else—when Labor left government. We have brought it back up so that private hospital insurance is affordable again. And what do the Labor Party want to do? They want to drive it back down again, and they are part of the problem. People earning over $100,000 a year on that side of this house choose to clog up the public hospital system by not taking out private hospital insurance. That is a disgrace, because they then take the place of a person who is on a low income and a very long waiting list. They may well say, ‘I’ll self-insure.’ Let’s see whether they do. There are some notable members of the Labor Party who have been hospitalised in recent times. Did they go to a private hospital? No. They went to a public hospital—at the expense of low-income earners, I might add—and they should be ashamed of themselves.
Let us not forget in this debate that the average rate of increase in private health insurance premiums under Labor was 11 per cent. Let us also not forget—and come in here with this cry of ‘woe is me’—that they have a record, from 1991-92, of a 17 per cent increase in private health insurance premiums and interest rates of 17 per cent. I would be ashamed if I had been a member of that government. Fortunately I was not, but I would be equally ashamed if I had been a member of that government and now, in opposition, I was coming in here and trying to chastise a government that has provided the incentives for people to take out private health insurance.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-03-14,"—I am one of those people who Senator Knowles thinks should be ashamed of the fact that they do not have private health insurance. I do not have it, not because I cannot afford it but because I think it is important for everyone to support the public system. The problem with Senator Knowles’s approach is that public equals poor in her mind, so the public system is to be left for those people who cannot afford any other kind of health care. I take exception to that. That is a shameful approach in my view.
The problem is that we get a two-tiered approach. It is not universal at all when you start saying, ‘Public hospitals are for the poor and anyone who can afford it ought to go where they can shell out money to do so. They should go to the expensive system. They should go to the system that charges two and three times as much for the same procedure as you get in a public hospital. They should go where there are private rooms and where you can get on the waiting list a bit quicker than those people who have to queue up in the public hospital system.’ If a fraction of the money that is spent not just through the rebate but through the tax concessions that are provided to people who sign up for private health insurance was spent on reducing waiting lists, we would not have the problem that we currently do.
The most significant feature of the coalition’s health policy since they came into office some nine years ago has been their approach to private health insurance—the most expensive but least effective sector of health in this country. The 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and the Lifetime Health Cover policy reforms were introduced by the government to subsidise the private health care industry. In last year’s election campaign more money was thrown at the private health insurance rebate, despite growing evidence that it is inequitable and that it has made health no less expensive or more affordable. The 30 per cent rebate now costs more than $2.5 billion every year. That is because the rebate is calculated on the annual cost of premiums. As a result, the cost to the taxpayer continues to increase with every premium hike.
The big problem with private health is the lack of price controls. As a result, private health insurance premiums and the cost of the rebate are increasing at two and three times the rate of the CPI. Following minimal price increases in the first couple of years after the introduction of the rebate, private health insurance fees have taken off with a bang over the last four years. There is no sign that there will be any diminishing of that increase. They have risen at an average of around seven per cent in each of the past years—6.9 per cent in 2002, 7.4 per cent in 2003, 7.82 per cent in 2004 and 7.96 per cent in 2005. That is an increase in premiums of 30 per cent since 2001, which is roughly equivalent to the rebate.
There is no evidence to suggest that these increases in premiums and the growing cost of the rebate to the taxpayer will not continue. The OECD paper in 2004 examining private health insurance in Australia reported that private funds ‘do not exercise control over the quantity, quality and appropriateness of care provided’. The paper also found:
... there are limited constraints on expenditure growth.
The recent report by the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman into the state of health funds found:
Most contributors appear to be resigned to some annual increase in premiums and have probably come to expect rises of between 5 and 9 percent.
The government’s rebate is therefore taking money that could be used to provide public health services that all Australians would benefit from and giving that money to the private health industry and primarily to well-off individuals and families. That is what the government has opted for. While figures on 31 December 2004 indicate that 43 per cent of the Australian population have private health insurance, there is lots of evidence to show that those on higher incomes are the most likely to have private health insurance and to benefit from the 30 per cent rebate. A recent paper by the Australia Institute found that fewer than one in four Australian families with incomes below $25,000 have private health insurance while more than two-thirds, or 69 per cent, of families with incomes over $100,000 have private health insurance—something that Senator Knowles advocates.
Not only are these people more likely to have private health insurance; they can also afford the more expensive forms of health insurance and therefore receive a larger rebate. The paper also found that only 13 per cent of young single parents have private health insurance and 20 per cent of young low-income couples with children have private health insurance. That is quite a stark contrast to the 48 per cent of young couples with children earning more than $40,000 a year who have private health insurance. This rate is more than double that of those on lower incomes. Rates are even higher for older couples with children who earn more than $40,000—65 per cent have private health insurance.
So not only are the wealthy receiving the biggest direct benefits from subsidies to the private health insurance industry; those who rely on the public system are being doubly disadvantaged through the redirection of resources from the public to the private system, which results from an injection of funds into the private system. As there are real constraints on the resources in the health care sector—a limited number of doctors, nurses, specialists and beds—in order to provide these services to those with private health insurance, resources must be redirected from the public system. We know that this is absolutely the case when it comes to doctors. This transfer of resources from the public to the private sector does not relieve pressure on the public sector but rather exacerbates it. Ultimately, it also increases the costs of hospital and medical services to the whole community through the greater competition for limited resources. So we end up with an inflationary effect on health costs across the public and private sectors.
The OECD paper that I referred to found that the 30 per cent rebate had posed pressures on public costs by utilising tax revenue that could otherwise have been used to meet health needs. Directing resources to the private sector also directs resources not to those with the greatest need but to those who have the money to buy services. The principal reason that people take out private health insurance is because they fear that public services will not be available to them. (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-03-14,"—I support the matter of public importance which has been raised in the Senate today by my colleague Senator McLucas. Before I begin my contribution, let me turn to some of the comments made by Senator Knowles, who seemed to want to argue in this place that the health insurance premium increases that we have just experienced somehow do not put pressure on the family budget. Senator Knowles then quoted some figures from a Western Australian fund in weekly terms as a matter of cents in order to deliberately trivialise the amount of the increase. I want the indulgence of the Senate for a minute to put these increases into perspective.
Let us look at one of the major funds, Medibank Private, and the actual increases in its Smart Choice Hospital and Extras cover. In the ACT there is an increase of $153.75 per year for that cover. In New South Wales it is also $153.75. In Victoria there is an increase of $256.20 per year; in Western Australia it is $167.15; in South Australia it is $131.85; in the Northern Territory it is $102.45; in Tasmania it is $201.65; and in Queensland it is $142. They are significant increases for any household budget to have to find if that household has private health insurance.
Senator Knowles should remember that in 2001 Mr Howard promised that these policies—the Howard government’s policies—would reduce premiums for private health insurance. Yet every year premiums go up. This is simply another broken promise, as Senator Knowles should well know. Let me remind the Senate and Senator Knowles that, in 2001, John Howard’s election policy booklet, called Heading in the right direction, promised that his government’s policies would ‘lead to reduced premiums’. Senator Knowles must have forgotten that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised their policies would create downward pressure on premiums and that private health insurance would be ‘more affordable and attractive to consumers’.
Senator Knowles may recall the former health minister Michael Wooldridge saying—and she indicated to the Senate that she had been around a long time and I am sure she does remember this—in July 2000:
We’ve got so many extra people in that’ll keep real downward pressure on premiums. They won’t go up 5 to 8 per cent a year as they did under Labor.
Since the minister made that laughable prediction, premiums have risen by well over 30 per cent. Senator Knowles wants to take no responsibility for the last nine years of this government and wants to hark back to previous governments, but the reality is that premiums have gone up recently by over 30 per cent and they have clearly eaten up the private health insurance rebate. This policy of the coalition costs the Australian taxpayer $2.25 billion a year, and the government want to keep saying that somehow it is working. Clearly it is not working and it is putting more and more pressure on private health insurance.
On the morning of Thursday, 3 March this year, millions of Australians woke up, made their way to their kitchen tables and opened up their morning newspapers to be hit with a barrage of bad news and shocking headlines. On the front page of the Courier-Mail, people read, ‘Double blow for families: interest rate cranked up, health insurance costs soar’. In the Herald Sun, they read, ‘King hit: up—interest rates by $33 a month; up—private health insurance by 8%’ and ‘Private health fund rises hurt: premiums soar out of reach’. That is what is happening in our community today. In the Daily Telegraph they read, ‘Double trouble: families feel pinch as home loan rates, health premiums rise’. If they turned to the editorial, they would have been met with, ‘Unhealthy increase’. In the good old reliable West Australian, forever the apologist for this coalition government, people read, ‘Health cover up but is good value: Abbott’. But in the Australian people read, ‘Families hit by $200 health premium hike’, and in the Age, ‘Double slug as economic boom falters’. The Adelaide Advertiser’s headline read, ‘Double hit: rates, health insurance rise’.
Wednesday, 2 March, was a disastrous day for Australians in private health insurance. On top of the one-quarter of a per cent interest rate rise announced by the Reserve Bank earlier in the day, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, thought he would hide behind Treasurer Costello’s bad news and secretly announce, only 5½ hours later, his own slugging of Australians—this time through their private health insurance premiums, by an average of eight per cent. Regardless of what Senator Knowles might like us to believe, that is the average across the board—an eight per cent increase.
As Nicola Ballenden, the health spokesperson for the Australian Consumers Association, was noted as saying in the Herald Sun on 3 March:
Clearly, they are hoping that people won’t notice.
Well, I think Australians with private health insurance are certainly going to notice the big hand of Tony Abbott reaching into their wallets for a further eight per cent on top of their premiums—the highest rise since the private health insurance rebate, the $2.25 billion rebate, was introduced.
I think Australians are going to notice that this announcement marks the fourth consecutive rise in health insurance premiums in four years. I think Australians are going to notice that over the past four years—the four years since the Howard Government claimed it had reformed private health insurance to make it more affordable—their premiums have risen by an average of 33 per cent. I think privately insured Australians have noticed the 19.2 per cent increase in the gap expenses they are forking out to doctors. And I think Australians will have worked out that the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate has now been well and truly eaten away by the 33 per cent increase in premium costs over the life of the rebate.
Mr Abbott recently described himself as feeling like a constitutional monarch—that is, powerless when it comes to dealing with the real health issues in our society. Well, Minister, here was a chance for you to get your hands dirty and come up with a real fix for the private health insurance industry. But what happened instead? The minister chose to sit back, tick off on yet another of the private health insurance industry’s requests to increase premiums and demand that people shut up and take it on the chin.
According to the front page story of the Age on 3 March this year:
Health Minister Tony Abbott said he had reluctantly approved rises in health insurance premiums to ensure health funds stayed afloat. “The job of government is sometimes to face up to difficult news. Government’s job is not to pretend that you can have everything for free all the time,” he said.
For free? Try telling Australian families with private health insurance who have been slugged with 33 per cent rises in the cost of their premiums over the past four years that they should shut up, stop expecting everything to come their way for free and start paying. Australians are already paying and they are paying 33 per cent more than they were when the private health insurance rebate was introduced. Try telling that to a family in Victoria with Medibank Private’s Smart Choice Hospital and Extras cover who will be required to fork out an extra $260 this year on top of the $2,180.60 they had to find last year.
Millions of Australian families have been paying through the nose for their private health insurance under the minister’s stewardship for years now and they are getting even less for their money than they used to. Last year, private health insurers received on average a 7.58 per cent increase in premiums; however, private hospitals claim that the deals done with them were at best two per cent better than the old deals and at worst minus 10 per cent worse than the old deals.
There seems to be something patently wrong with the current system when year after year Minister Abbott turns around to people with private health insurance and says, ‘Pay more,’ when private hospitals end up getting squeezed more and when people are offered less when they use their private health insurance. Just last month, the Australian Private Hospitals Association estimated that out-of-pocket costs for patients in private hospitals not approved by Medibank Private will increase by up to $400 a day under their new competitive selection process. Gone from this type of cover is choice of hospital—enter rising costs. Australians in private health insurance are paying more and getting less under this government. (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-03-14,"—It is a pleasure to rise to speak in this debate this afternoon with regard to the importance of the private health insurance rebate and the process that the government has in place to ensure a minimum cost increase. Under Labor the increases for private health insurance were in the order of 10 to 11 per cent on average. Under the Howard stewardship of the Australian government, we now have an independent objective assessment that is put in place to ensure that the premium increase is kept at a minimum.
I wanted to advise the Senate and the members opposite in particular that it is the government through the Private Health Insurance Administration Council and the Department of Health and Ageing that scrutinises those applications for increases that are made, and they are scrutinised very carefully. Just recently the Australian Government Actuary was given advice to provide a second opinion to ensure that the increase is kept at a minimum.
I wanted to make one point about the increase and where the money goes. Do you think it goes into a big black hole, into the pockets of just the private health insurers? Based on the Labor Party senators’ arguments, perhaps you would think so. Let me tell you where the money goes: premiums are rising because the funds are paying out more in benefits to members. The statistics and the evidence has shown that over the years—that is a fact.
What are some of the reasons for increased costs? Obviously we have the rising wages of the relevant people in the public service and the private sector—for example, nurses and the other health professionals. The increase in technology costs—for example, the increased costs in the use of prostheses—are relevant. I have a vested interest in and know a little bit about prostheses, and those costs have increased markedly. That takes care of the ALP argument that there is some way that we are forcing this on families or that this is being done without due concern. It is being done with careful consideration and great cautiousness in the best interests of families.
Senator Allison made a comment earlier to the effect that she does not have private health insurance and that she supports the public hospital system. Goodness me! The whole point is that we want a balance in this country between public and private. We want a balance where we get the mix just about right. If you can afford it then you should have private health insurance. That is why the government has a 30 per cent private health insurance rebate—to encourage people to have private health insurance. That is the whole point. We have the balance right now and it is improving, with 44 per cent of the Australian population, or about nine million Australians, now with private health insurance. If you include ancillary cover then that number gets up towards 50 per cent, or 9.9 million Australians.
We need to try and take the pressure off the public hospital system, and that is what is happening with the investment in private health insurance, which has been accurately reported during the debate at about $2.25 billion a year. Bill Glasson, the President of the AMA, 18 months ago was reported as saying:
The only reason the public hospitals are surviving to any extent that they are at the moment is because of the 30% private health insurance rebate.
That is from a man with a background in health and an interest in health and the consumer, the patient. He is saying that we are getting the balance right. Do know what would happen if we did not have the private health insurance rebate? I can see Senator Nettle getting a little bit irked on the other side, ready to make her contribution, and we look forward to that. But of course the Greens do not support the private health insurance rebate at all; they would prefer to have it abolished. We know that the secret policy of the Labor Party is to remove it altogether. What would happen if that rebate was removed? It would increase for those people who have the private health insurance rebate by 43 per cent. The benefit is about $750 per year for those people with the 30 per cent rebate. It flows through to all those people.
There is a misconception in the community, particularly from the other side. The Labor Party is saying that this is merely a sop for the rich. That is not demonstrated by the facts or the evidence. Let us have a look at the benefits for those in a lower socioeconomic group in Australia. Let us have a look at the one million Australians who are earning $20,000 or less who have the private health insurance rebate. Isn’t that amazing? It is a tremendous credit to those Australians that they believe that there are benefits for them in maintaining and holding on to that rebate. That is fantastic. That kills off the Labor Party’s accusations and allegations that it is only a sop for the rich—that is absolute nonsense.
I am thrilled about, and thankful for, the benefits for older Australians, as are other senators on this side of the chamber. The benefits will flow from 1 April this year. For those aged 65 to 70 the rebate will go from 30 to 35 per cent. Those aged 70 and over will have a 40 per cent rebate. That is fantastic. That shows that we care. It demonstrates that we are looking after older Australians. They deserve it. That was recognised in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare. Senator Knowles, Senator Gary Humphries and I recommended that there be a special increase in the rebate for older Australians. That recommendation has been taken up. It was a policy position at the election on 9 October. And guess what: the Australian people decided. They threw down the mandate to the Howard government and said: ‘Please, Mr Howard and Mr Abbott, maintain and retain with all your might this 30 per cent rebate. Implement this policy to look after older Australians.’ Do you know what? We are delivering these benefits for older Australians and we will not be put off by accusations or allegations from the other side that this is a sop for the rich or just for some others. It is going to benefit older Australians—it will benefit all Australians—because we have got the balance right between the public hospital system and support for the private hospital system. It is a good mix. (Time expired)

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-03-14,"—There is no question that the Howard government’s private health insurance policy is a failure. The motion today criticises one component of it: the large rises in private health insurance premiums, well in excess of the consumer price index. The private health insurance industry association says that the rises are being driven by rising costs and demand for new technological interventions, as does Senator Barnett, who has just spoken. The government wants people to retain their private health insurance and it penalises people who do not. When it introduced its private health insurance rebate policy in 1999 the government said that its rebate would take the pressure off premium increases. That has not happened. It also said that the rebate would take the pressure off public hospitals. That has not happened either.
Younger people are abandoning their private health insurance while older people are signing up, which further skews the age profile and has implications for the long-term viability of the industry, which receives, let us remember, $3 billion of public money every year. After four consecutive years of hefty premium increases it is time for the government to accept what most health economists in this country have been saying for years: the private health insurance industry is a black hole. Pouring more scarce health resources into the private health insurance industry is socially and economically irresponsible. With health insurance premiums continuing to rise at this rate, private health insurance becomes even more the domain of the wealthy.
Senator Barnett obviously has not read the research by Richard Denniss of the Australia Institute which was reported in a paper that was released this month. It shows that almost seven in 10 people with incomes over $100,000 per annum have private health insurance whilst only one in four people earning less than $25,000 have private health insurance. The 30 per cent rebate is an enormous transfer of public funds to the well-off. But it is people on low incomes that are suffering the most from ill health. As long as the government funnels more public money into propping up the private health insurance industry it will deprive society of the funds that are desperately needed for essential public health and medical services. The current policy of trying to expand the private health sector and leave a residual public sector as a safety net is unsustainable. Australian National University academic Dr Gwen Gray, in her book entitled The Politics of Medicare, states:
... the health system, as reshaped by the Howard government, cannot work. The combination of Medicare and a large private sector is a highly unstable arrangement which cannot survive. Eventually, the Commonwealth will be forced either to spend even more tax money to subsidise private insurance or to abolish Medicare altogether.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-03-14,"—The underlying, inherent dishonesty in this motion which has been moved today by the Australian Labor Party is the implication that the Australian Labor Party has some kind of answer to this problem. Nobody on this side of the chamber and certainly not the Minister for Health and Ageing or anybody in the private health insurance industry likes to see increases in private health insurance premiums. They are regrettable because they inevitably cause some people to decide not to continue with or not to take up private health insurance. But a fact of life is that the increase in the cost of health in this country and in every other country in the world is greater than the increase which is occurring in the cost of general services or goods that the consumer consumes; that is, medical inflation is significantly higher than general inflation.
Between 2000 and 2004, for example, the cost of medical services and goods in this country rose by 22.8 per cent. That is more than double the rate of inflation for general goods and services consumed by the Australian community. It is that rising cost of health services which has driven the increases in private health insurance premiums. No-one on the other side of the chamber can realistically propose to do anything about that. If they can, we have not heard it in this debate. With those sorts of increases it is necessary for the inputs—the costs that we as a community contribute to the maintenance of our health system—to rise also. Just as private health insurance premiums inevitably have to rise to keep up with that level of medical inflation so too do other costs, such as the amount that the taxpayer contributes to the running of the health system, also need to increase.
The amount that the community has spent on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has risen enormously in the last few years. In the last nine years, for example, the cost of the PBS has risen from around $2.6 billion to $6.2 billion; that is almost double in real terms. The cost of health care for older Australians has risen commensurately as well. Those opposite are in no position to complain about rises in health insurance premiums unless they can provide an alternative—and they cannot. Labor’s position is extremely unclear. If it has some alternative system of price setting for premiums, first of all, we have not heard what it is and, secondly, it would fly in the face of what happened each and every year when Labor was last in office—that is, average increases in private health insurance premiums were in the order of 10 or 11 per cent; sometimes they were as high as 17 per cent in a single year.
The second point is that we know very clearly the Labor Party do not like the one major policy setting that this government has put in place to make health insurance more affordable for Australians, and that is the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. We know they intensely dislike that particular policy device; we also know it is only because they are too timorous that they are not prepared to go to the Australian community and say that in as many words and promise to abolish it. We know they are extremely reluctant to keep that measure in place. But the fact is that it makes private health insurance affordable to many millions of Australians—the almost nine million Australians who have private health insurance in this country.
Senator Allison and then Senator Nettle commented on this being a device for subsidising the costs of the rich. Of course, the rich are in a position of being able to contribute to the health care costs they incur, and the government’s Medicare levy is designed to encourage them to do that. But the important point here is that over one million Australians on an income of less than $20,000 have made the decision also to contribute to the cost of their health care by taking out private health insurance cover. The measures we are talking about here—measures we have put in place as a government to make health insurance more affordable—benefit them too; they benefit them directly and, importantly, they ensure that the cost of the health system of this country is shared on an equitable basis. Quite frankly, it is shameful that people like Senator Allison say proudly that they do not have private health cover when I think, to be perfectly honest, that is a responsibility of those on higher incomes. I wonder how many on the Labor benches of this place have private health insurance.
—So it’s not freedom of choice.
—You do have a choice, Senator. You can make a decision. It is not compulsory.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Humphries, you should ignore the interjections and address your comments through the chair.
—I shall attempt to.
—And you should desist from interjecting across the table, Senator Evans.
—People have that choice and it is a matter of good policy that people make the decision to take out insurance. If premiums do not rise, the cost will fall back on the general population of Australia. As taxpayers, we will meet more of that cost.
Those opposite, as I have said, would like to see the private health insurance rebate abolished. They will not say so in as many words, but we know that is what they want. What they do not properly advert to when they secretly countenance that policy is that, if it were abolished, not only would you see a drop in private health insurance but you would also see a huge shift in cost from the private hospital system to the public hospital system. The savings made by abolishing the rebate would more than be eaten up by the extra payments that would have to be made to the states and territories to maintain a hospital system that would creak and groan, if not collapse, under those higher costs.

I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I am pleased to present the third review of the administration and expenditure of ASIO, ASIS and DSD by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD.
Under section 29 of the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Joint Committee has an obligation to review the administration and expenditure of ASIO, ASIS and DSD including the agencies annual financial statements.
All members are aware of the on-going war on terrorism and the threat it poses to Australians and Australian interests both here and abroad. In response there has been a very a substantial increase in the budgets, operations, administration and organisational structures of Australia’s intelligence agencies. ASIO, ASIS and DSD face major new challenges which must be managed through the appropriate administration of resources.
Given the nature of the review and the classification of much of the material submitted to the Committee by intelligence agencies, the review was conducted in private. The sources of evidence for the review were various. The three intelligence agencies made submissions and gave evidence to the Committee. In addition, the Committee relied on the Australian National Audit Office, ASIO’s unclassified Annual Report to Parliament and the Portfolio Budget Statements from the agencies.
However, there are still some deficiencies in this process.
The Committee is aware that it is not in a position to conduct a detailed examination of the financial resources of ASIO, ASIS and DSD and relies heavily on the reporting of the Auditor-General in relation to matters of expenditure. The Committee has also recommended that the annual audits of the agencies be provided to the Committee along with any additional information that might be relevant to the Committee’s review of administration and expenditure.
The Committee remains concerned about the financial accountability of DSD. This matter was raised in the first review of administration and expenditure. DSD is part of the Intelligence Output Group of the Department of Defence and, therefore, there is no requirement for DSD to prepare a separate financial report; rather it is incorporated as part of the overall financial reporting of the Department of Defence. The Committee has recommended that the Government give further consideration to an alternative mechanism to allow for a separate financial statement by DSD.
In addition, the Committee does not have access to other key documentation, notably the classified annual reports of ASIO, ASIS and DSD. Only ASIO produces a full, unclassified Annual Report to Parliament. Minor references to ASIS and DSD are made in the Annual Reports of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence. The Committee therefore has reservations about its ability to review adequately the administration and expenditure of the agencies. It has recommended that the Government consider providing the Committee with the classified Annual Reports for all three agencies. These, as with the other classified documents presented to the Committee, would be treated with proper regard to their classification and to the limits of the Committee’s areas of responsibility as defined by the Intelligence Services Act.
The Committee supports the strengthening of ANAO oversight of ASIO, ASIS and DSD through the development of a rolling program of performance audits and through amendments to Section 10 of the Auditor-General’s Act to reflect the importance of the ANAO in assisting the Committee to discharge its responsibilities to review the expenditure and administration of the agencies.
In the context of ASIO’s investigation of possible terrorist activity in Australia, the Committee recommends as appropriate, greater liaison between the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth and State Ombudsman including the development of a memorandum of understanding or protocol governing possible joint reviews of combined ASIO/police operations.
Much of the evidence before the Committee concerning Australia’s intelligence and security agencies is of a highly classified nature. This is right and proper in relation to information that may involve matters of national security. However, it is also the case that unnecessary secrecy hinders proper scrutiny. The Committee recommends that a review should be undertaken into the extent of public reporting across intelligence agencies overseen by the Committee. In a related matter, the Committee has also recommended that ASIS produce an unclassified version of its code of conduct and that this should be tabled in Parliament by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
In conclusion, I would like to thank ASIO, ASIS and DSD as well as the ANAO for their cooperation in and contributions to this review.
I would also like to thank members of the Committee who have undertaken their duties in a bipartisan fashion and who recognise the need to put the national interest and effective Parliamentary scrutiny of highly sensitive matters before any partisan political interests. The work of the Committee continually presents the members with the challenge of reconciling the demands of national security with Parliamentary and public scrutiny.
It is the belief of the Committee that the report before you is an appropriate balance between the two.

However, there are still some deficiencies in this process.
The Committee is aware that it is not in a position to conduct a detailed examination of the financial resources of ASIO, ASIS and DSD and relies heavily on the reporting of the Auditor-General in relation to matters of expenditure. The Committee has also recommended that the annual audits of the agencies be provided to the Committee along with any additional information that might be relevant to the Committee’s review of administration and expenditure.
The Committee remains concerned about the financial accountability of DSD. This matter was raised in the first review of administration and expenditure. DSD is part of the Intelligence Output Group of the Department of Defence and, therefore, there is no requirement for DSD to prepare a separate financial report; rather it is incorporated as part of the overall financial reporting of the Department of Defence. The Committee has recommended that the Government give further consideration to an alternative mechanism to allow for a separate financial statement by DSD.
In addition, the Committee does not have access to other key documentation, notably the classified annual reports of ASIO, ASIS and DSD. Only ASIO produces a full, unclassified Annual Report to Parliament. Minor references to ASIS and DSD are made in the Annual Reports of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence. The Committee therefore has reservations about its ability to review adequately the administration and expenditure of the agencies. It has recommended that the Government consider providing the Committee with the classified Annual Reports for all three agencies. These, as with the other classified documents presented to the Committee, would be treated with proper regard to their classification and to the limits of the Committee’s areas of responsibility as defined by the Intelligence Services Act.
The Committee supports the strengthening of ANAO oversight of ASIO, ASIS and DSD through the development of a rolling program of performance audits and through amendments to Section 10 of the Auditor-General’s Act to reflect the importance of the ANAO in assisting the Committee to discharge its responsibilities to review the expenditure and administration of the agencies.
In the context of ASIO’s investigation of possible terrorist activity in Australia, the Committee recommends as appropriate, greater liaison between the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth and State Ombudsman including the development of a memorandum of understanding or protocol governing possible joint reviews of combined ASIO/police operations.
Much of the evidence before the Committee concerning Australia’s intelligence and security agencies is of a highly classified nature. This is right and proper in relation to information that may involve matters of national security. However, it is also the case that unnecessary secrecy hinders proper scrutiny. The Committee recommends that a review should be undertaken into the extent of public reporting across intelligence agencies overseen by the Committee. In a related matter, the Committee has also recommended that ASIS produce an unclassified version of its code of conduct and that this should be tabled in Parliament by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
In conclusion, I would like to thank ASIO, ASIS and DSD as well as the ANAO for their cooperation in and contributions to this review.
I would also like to thank members of the Committee who have undertaken their duties in a bipartisan fashion and who recognise the need to put the national interest and effective Parliamentary scrutiny of highly sensitive matters before any partisan political interests. The work of the Committee continually presents the members with the challenge of reconciling the demands of national security with Parliamentary and public scrutiny.
It is the belief of the Committee that the report before you is an appropriate balance between the two.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-03-14,"—‘Practical reconciliation’ is a term that all Australians should treat with a great deal of concern, if not contempt. Practical reconciliation, which is used extensively by the Howard government, and has been especially over the last five years, is nothing more or less than weasel words. Confronted by the millions of people who marched across bridges throughout Australia in the year 2000 on behalf of reconciliation, the government had to do something. What they came up with was a new term: practical reconciliation. It was first used by the Prime Minister at the national launch of the National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy in Sydney on 29 March 2000. Many of us here are still unclear as to what it actually means.
What has practical reconciliation delivered? Here in this chamber today we are seeing what this term means. We now have before us the abolition of ATSIC. ATSIC, established by an act of parliament in 1989, came into existence in March 1990. It was an organisation which, for the first time in Indigenous affairs in Australia, established directly elected representative councils in 35 regions, with a national board of commissioners. ATSIC was charged with providing the means to allow the involvement of our Indigenous people in the processes of government that affected their lives. For nine of the 15 years of its existence, ATSIC has been the responsibility of those opposite: the Howard government. If there has been a failing of Indigenous affairs, especially of the administration, then it has been a failing of this government. It is not in a position to argue that the failing has been solely the fault of ATSIC. This government has been in charge and the failing has happened on its watch.
What is ATSIC to be replaced with? Its replacement is to be an appointed advisory body selected by the minister, with no regional structure yet announced. The National Indigenous Council is to provide expert advice, we are told. But how will the members of the National Indigenous Council be resourced to ensure that they can represent the views of Indigenous Australians? I for one am not sure how they are to go about providing expert advice to government unless they are effectively resourced to do so.
The government is replacing a democratically elected organisation with an appointed advisory council. That is practical reconciliation, apparently. At the same time that this government is sending 450 or more Australian troops into Iraq to help safeguard the new Iraqi democracy, it is presiding over the abolition of ATSIC. The irony of this escapes those opposite. It does not escape the rest of us here. There is no doubt that it was time for ATSIC to be reviewed and time for reform, leading to new structures. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that ATSIC had reached the stage where a new representative structure was needed. Indeed, the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs recognised that there were a number of problems with ATSIC’s structure and organisation. However, the Labor Party do not accept the government’s view that ATSIC should be abolished and replaced by an advisory group. In our view, there does need to be a democratically elected representative structure for Australia’s Indigenous people.
It is nonsensical for this government to send our armed forces to Iraq to help nurture democracy when at home it abolishes a democratic body. What the government is saying is that we will put Australian men and women in harm’s way to protect democracy on the other side of the world but we cannot replace a democratic organisation in our own country. The Indigenous people of this country deserve, at the very least, a representative, democratic organisation that is able to not only represent their views but also administer the programs.
What we are seeing is the ultimate failure of this government’s practical reconciliation. From the moment that they were elected in 1996 they have pursued an agenda that has been about getting rid of ATSIC and eroding Indigenous rights—not because of the problems within the organisation but because, from the very start, they had opposed the establishment of ATSIC. ATSIC, to the Howard government, is something that was never supported, always vilified and to be ultimately abolished. The Labor Party, on the other hand, believes that ATSIC needs to be reformed and replaced by a better organisation, because Indigenous people in this country deserve adequate representation.
There is no doubt that many of ATSIC’s regional structures have worked well since its inception, and we have heard about many of them in this debate. The local links with states and territories as well as local governments have worked very well. It beggars belief then that the regional structure is able to be maintained in the Torres Strait but not anywhere else in Australia. One has to ask who is to represent Indigenous people in negotiations with regional and state level agreements in the future. This of course is still unclear. We are now facing a situation where all the benefits that have accrued through the relationships built up by ATSIC’s regional structures are going to be lost.
There is no question that a one size fits all approach in Indigenous affairs, as in many other areas, is doomed to fail. A policy may work very well only in a single community. One of the problems has been the level of local autonomy within the context of regional and national structures. That problem is not being addressed by abolishing ATSIC. The government carries on about a whole-of-government approach—in other words, back to the days of a one size fits all approach as determined by government departments in Canberra. How does this government begin to pretend that it is devising a program approach that will deal with the differences in Indigenous communities around the country? We all know that they are diverse enough within my home state of Western Australia, never mind throughout the entire nation. A methodology that involves decision making in Canberra for remote communities is one destined for failure.
One of the big problems in my home state of Western Australia is that, for many non-Indigenous people, Indigenous consultations involve visits to Broome in the winter. I recognise that, in the debate of the committee’s report, Senator Johnston alluded to the fact that the committee had not visited Western Australia, though I am informed that they visited Broome. But visiting Broome is no more representative of visiting all Indigenous communities in Western Australia than visiting Cairns would be for all of Queensland or Katherine would be for all of the Territory. You cannot expect that this level of consultation will deliver reasonable outcomes for people in Kalgoorlie, the Pilbara, the Central Desert or even the south-west.
Practical reconciliation here is a failure. In fact, Indigenous affairs in this country is a failure under the Howard government. This government’s whole approach over the last nine years has been to blame ATSIC for any failings in Indigenous affairs—forget about ripping hundreds of millions of dollars out of ATSIC’s budgets over the years; no, we are not to actually consider that at all. Practical reconciliation has meant reducing the funding for ATSIC over the nine years they have been in power and then blame ATSIC for the outcome. And now we see practical reconciliation in its ultimate form: these weasel words of ‘practical reconciliation’ are replaced by direct government control of Indigenous programs. Yet again when confronted with a problem this government have no alternative other than centralising the power in their own hands—and in this case I refer to their approach of shared responsibility.
The late Puggy Hunter of the Kimberley once famously described Aboriginal community partnerships with governments as ‘like going out for a drink with a bunch of Jehovah’s Witnesses—no-one wants to buy the drinks’. This government can go on and on about how the relationship will be with individual communities, but we have been here before. We run the risk of repeating history because, rather than true reform of ATSIC—reform that Labor acknowledges needs to take place—what we are going to get is a return to the past.
There are compelling reasons for giving control of Indigenous programs to Indigenous communities. Ultimately, the success or failure of programs always depends on the community’s active participation. This government cannot legislate for a community’s active involvement in projects and programs that they are not involved in from the start, nor can they guarantee the communities will take up programs or projects simply because those projects or programs have worked somewhere else. Without a better understanding of the needs of a community, we are at risk of forcing solutions onto a community who need something else entirely.
How can the government suggest that this practical reconciliation will be effective simply because they are abolishing ATSIC? For all of its faults, ATSIC provided Indigenous Australians with not only a representative voice but also the ability to design and implement programs at the local or regional level. For all the good intentions, we are going back to a system that is about outcomes, based on programs and projects that Indigenous Australia does not have any voice in until the bureaucrats turn up to negotiate agreements. Puggy Hunter also once said:
You white people keep telling us Aboriginals we have ear problems. You keep showing us the graphs and the research. You know, I think you mob are the ones with the ear problems ... we keep saying the same things and you don’t seem to hear.
The government’s approach is a return to the days described by the late Mr Hunter. Indigenous communities will once again be shown the research and the graphs and then told by a mob from Canberra how it can all be fixed. Indigenous people will once again be excluded from meaningful involvement in the development of programs and simply be asked to sign agreements to fix the problems identified in the research. This new so-called practical reconciliation is something that in some cases is offensive to Indigenous communities. Recently, an ATSIC commissioner from Western Australia said in a media statement:
Mutual Obligations or Responsible Agreements aren’t new, our people have been working for the dole for over 25 years and it has been a catalyst for the Government’s own Work for the Dole program.
And now this government wants us to believe that service agreements for Indigenous communities are the way forward. The government would have us believe that these service agreements will provide the solution to the problems of health, education and unemployment in Indigenous communities.
The Indigenous people of this country are now entering into these service agreements without any democratic representation at the regional or national level. Their voices are to be hand-picked by this government. Well-meaning bureaucrats remote from any Indigenous community will design programs for these service agreements without any Indigenous input. These service agreements may or may not suit the community in question. So practical reconciliation in the future will mean that, other than expert advice being provided to government by people hand-picked and appointed by the government, Indigenous affairs will be reduced to communities signing service agreements.
The biggest failing in Indigenous Affairs in the last nine years has been by this government. ATSIC, for all its faults, was a democratically elected organisation with a regional structure that aimed to involve Indigenous people in the processes of government that affected their lives. It was an organisation in need of review and reform. This government has used ATSIC’s failings to mask its own complete and utter failure to advance Indigenous affairs in this country. What is needed is a new democratic structure for Indigenous people—a better, more effective representative body. What is not needed is a return to white people telling Indigenous people what is wrong and how to fix it. What is needed is an approach that allows Indigenous people to be actively involved not only in the delivery of programs but also in their design and control. Otherwise, yet again, it will be a case of non-Indigenous Australia having the hearing problem.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-14,"—There is no doubt that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission had its failings, but that should be no reason for throwing out the whole thing—certainly not until a clearly worked through alternative had been considered with consultation with Indigenous Australians. If we scrapped every government department that had its failings there would be no department left standing. It is very unfortunate that the controversies over some of ATSIC’s leaders have not just been used to mask this government’s own failings in Indigenous areas. Of course, the fact is that the vast majority of responsibility for programs dealing with Indigenous Australians was and is the responsibility of this government, not ATSIC.
The other problem is that the controversy over some of ATSIC’s leadership has also obscured the very significant positive stories, particularly amongst many of the regional councils. It is the failure to recognise the positive actions of many of the people within ATSIC, the significant achievements that have occurred and the potential that has been built up for more progress to be made that is the real tragedy here. I could focus a lot on how this government has failed to deliver on the group in the community that has by far and away the biggest disadvantage out of anyone in our whole nation. Of course we could focus on some of the failings of ATSIC in recent times, but we do have far too much focus on the negative in political debate in this country; we certainly have a lot of focus on the negative when it comes to Indigenous Australians. That is appropriate because their disadvantage is so enormous, but we should not forget that there are many good news stories out there that are not given the attention they deserve. In my view, that is because of the issue of ensuring that Indigenous Australians throughout the country—city, regional, remote, northern, western and southern—are given the priority that they are entitled to.
The only time Indigenous Australians get priority is when there is some scandal—when there are some political points to be scored. There is never priority when there are just long hard yards to be dealt with in overcoming entrenched disadvantage. There is never priority when there are successes or are good news stories—when there are advances and achievements—unless perhaps you have some sort of one-off celebrity situation like a sports star, musician or film star, when you might get some attention. But if we are looking at the positive achievements of Indigenous communities it is very rare that they get the attention that they deserve. I would say frankly that that is a failing of all of us, not just of political parties and parliamentarians. It is a failure of the media focus and of community focus. That is because in so many ways Indigenous Australians’ day-to-day lives are not connected with the rest of the community anywhere near as much as they should be.
If there was one area that I found more frustrating than any other in the election campaign—and it was a pretty frustrating election campaign for the Democrats, as I am sure people would appreciate—it was the inability to get recognition for the absolute priority that we should be giving to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. When all the facts are so stark and you have a group of people in the community whose life expectancy is 20 years less than that of the rest of us, I find it astonishing that it is not a national scandal. Not only is it not a national scandal but it did not even rate any mention of significance from either of the political party leaders during the last election campaign. Once the election was over we had some statements from the Prime Minister, prompted, it appeared to me, by actions such as those of Michael Long and his walk to Canberra from Melbourne, but neither Mr Latham nor Mr Howard launched his party’s policies on Indigenous issues. There was very little effort on the part of the mainstream media to press them on what they were going to do about what should be the most significant national issue, and that, in my view, is a sign of why we continue to fail.
Of course it is a hard issue and of course nobody has all the answers, but those should not be reasons to not give it priority and not try to address the issue. I will certainly continue to do what I can to ensure we give it priority, because you can come out with all the greatest sounding statements you like about all the new programs, the new policies and the new funding arrangements, but if it is just a one-off exercise with no follow-through as a top priority then we will continue to fail. That is something that, as a nation, we really cannot afford to do.
We have a lot of talk in this parliament about a whole range of policy issues and the opportunities for us to move forward as a nation. As I said before, I believe we focus much too much on the negative aspects of things. Part of that is the nature of politics and representing concerns that people have, but I for one feel actually quite optimistic about many of the opportunities we have as a nation going into this new century. In many respects we are well positioned in the world to do far better and have people living in Australia do far better in a quality of life sense than people in most other countries. The one thing that is going to prevent us from realising our potential as a nation is having a group in the community that cannot share in the prosperity, the achievements and the quality of life of our nation. It is quite clear that Indigenous Australians—Aboriginal people around the country and Torres Strait Islander people—are in large majority not able to share in that prosperity and in those opportunities. There are many indications that that disconnection, that inequality, is actually getting worse.
The government may use that as a reason to say, ‘That’s why we’ve got to scrap ATSIC and try something different: it hasn’t worked,’ but, as I said at the start, you do not throw out something lock, stock and barrel until you have sorted out what you are doing next, and you do not decide on what you are doing next until you consult with the people that it is meant to be affecting more than any other. The total lack of any consultation with Indigenous Australians has made this move almost doomed to produce far less positive results than it might otherwise have done. The government, of course, set up their own review with Jackie Huggins, Bob Collins and John Hannaford and then proceeded to completely ignore it, wasting not only taxpayers’ money in running that review but the time of all the people who communicated with it.
An aspect of ATSIC’s achievements that I think should be emphasised, and which is at very big risk of being lost as a result of this legislation, is the build-up in experience and expertise amongst both black and white people. ATSIC and ATSIS certainly gave younger and older Indigenous people experience in dealing with the white bureaucratic world, which can be bamboozling even for people who spend their whole lives working within it. It was a place that enabled and provided a more effective opportunity for many Indigenous people to increase their skills in this arena which they could then take elsewhere. The atmosphere within many of the ATSIC offices at the regional level was actually supportive, with mentoring and an understanding of cultural differences and cultural requirements, and those things were given some priority in the workplace rather than being tacked on as afterthoughts or tokens.
Equally importantly, it gave many white people experience in working in that environment as well. Most white Australians—and I would include myself in this group—do not have much experience in working in a meaningful way with Indigenous communities and Indigenous cultures, with the different issues and the different reality. Getting connected with that reality, from both sides of what is still an unforgivably large divide, is what we need to be doing. Frankly, I cannot see anything in what the government is doing now that is going to do very much at all to improve that, and quite a few things are potentially going to make it much worse.
When you are required to deal with the health statistics and the reality of race relationships on a day-to-day basis and face-to-face, there is the reality of white people actually having black bosses for a change, instead of the other way around, and the procession of funerals that so many Aboriginal people have to deal with and work through as part of their lives. There are not many other bureaucracies where mainstream Australians have to deal with those types of situations, and that one opportunity is now, if not completely lost, very much diminished. It seems to me that the government, with its so-called ‘mainstreaming’ approach, in large part is taking just another bureaucratic approach.
It is all very well to talk about focusing on results and so-called practical reconciliation. I do not have any objection to half of the message that is meant to be communicated with that. Of course we want practical results. Of course getting improvements in health, educational opportunities, employment opportunities and housing is critical. But it is a simple fact that those things do not exist, operate and succeed in isolation from community, society and the world view of the people who are supposed to be being addressed in these matters. To try to separate them out and disconnect them is to repeat the mistakes of the past.
Sometimes I feel that, in this debate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues, there is a perception that we are talking about the long-gone past; that it is all very sad and tragic but it was a long time ago. In some ways it was a long time ago. But I was reading a book just last night about my own area, where I live and have lived basically all of my life—that is, around Brisbane in inner-city suburbs like Windsor and Albion—and the last sizeable Aboriginal corroboree in that area was in the 1890s in the Kedron area. That is maybe three or four kilometres from the centre of the city of Brisbane. That still might seem like a long time ago, but people who were alive then and witnessed that would have spoken and communicated their experience of it to people who are alive today. So, in some ways, there is still a direct link to first-hand eyewitness accounts of traditional Aboriginal life in the heart of a city like Brisbane. It is not that long ago.
When you think of the absolutely enormous dispossession that was involved there, it is not surprising that the world view of many Indigenous Australians is still affected by that massive loss not just of land but also of culture, family and history, and that sense of injustice. Australians sometimes shake their heads in quite a patronising way, I think, about centuries-long hatreds in parts of Europe. They say, ‘Why don’t people just get over it—they’re still arguing about wars of the 15th century or whenever.’ But the fact that those types of traumas can run deep over centuries shows just how significant a thing it can be to a people when they feel that they have suffered such a massive hurt or injustice. Certainly, in the Australian context, there is nothing that comes anywhere near the level of dispossession and human tragedy that Indigenous Australians have faced not just through dispossession but also through death, disease and family destruction.
To just try to sweep all of that to one side and say, ‘We’re just dealing with practical matters now,’ is not practical or real. It is unrealistic. It is really just going to be repeating the mistakes of the past. I do want to emphasise that, on top of that, we are actually throwing away very good things as part of this process. Sure, people will think, ‘We’ve gotten rid of the problems that were in the headlines of the newspapers.’ But we have also gotten rid of a vast network and a mechanism that has not only provided results on the ground in different parts of the country but also built up that expertise. That takes a long time. That is not something that can be done in a few years. To just keep chopping and changing I think is incredibly short sighted. That is the real tragedy of what is being done here.
I take the opportunity to note the contribution of my colleague Senator Ridgeway, particularly on the report on this area called After ATSIC—life in the mainstream? by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, and the extra comments he has provided here. I take the opportunity to note his work in a whole range of areas in Indigenous issues over the last six years. It is a sad irony that the passage of this bill will see the end of elected Indigenous representation in this country. On 30 June we will see the end of ATSIC as a directly elected body. Also, that is the day the only Indigenous member of federal parliament ceases his term. That is an unfortunate indication that things are not necessarily progressing in getting a clearer, stronger voice for Aboriginal Indigenous Australians.
I want to mention briefly, given that I am from Queensland, an issue relating to representation of Torres Strait Islanders who live outside the Torres Strait. We have a bit of an irony with this legislation: Torres Strait Islanders in the Torres Strait retain control of an organisation that both represents them and delivers services while Torres Strait Islanders throughout the country lose that representation. I think that is an issue that we need to consider also when we are looking at the representation of Indigenous Australians. The Torres Strait has its own specific and unique issues. I know there are always varying views about how closely or otherwise it should be intertwined with the main processes in ATSIC and in Aboriginal affairs more widely. Certainly, we want to make sure that, if we are talking about representation, Torres Strait Islander people who are outside the Torres Strait region still have the opportunity for representation. We need to make sure that happens. I understand that an amendment has been circulated in the chamber which I would like to move.
 (Senator Moore)—You are foreshadowing that, Senator Bartlett?
—Yes. It goes particularly to the issue of the structure of the regional councils because of their strong benefit and the role that they have played, as I said. It also goes to issues to do with Aboriginal women, the committee of ATSIC and the need for that aspect to be reconsidered. It also calls on the government to implement accountability and evaluation mechanisms for these new arrangements. In closing, it is a sad outcome in a whole lot of ways. It is unfortunate that, given all that the Labor Party senators have said, they will also be nonetheless supporting the legislation. If it passes, as looks likely, we certainly still need to continue to focus on addressing that disgraceful gap and disadvantage in the Australian community. It is certainly something that the Democrats will continue to do.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2005-03-14,"—In talking on this very important piece of legislation—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005]—I commend those in this chamber who have contributed up to this point. This area of public policy is one of our most challenging and, indeed, I am disappointed that more senators have not participated in this debate. The needs, requirements and exigencies of Aboriginal communities should occupy this chamber and have this parliament’s full attention probably more than any other issue. I say that because, when one looks at the outcomes—and the outcomes over a very long period of time under both Liberal and Labor administrations—one sees that they have not been good. When I look at one of the principal reasons—not the only reason—for that failing, that shortcoming, one has to be drawn in an even-handed way to say that ATSIC as an experiment has been a failure.
I participated in the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, which investigated—and I am abbreviating the terms of reference—the abolition of ATSIC. Both Senator Crossin and I, together with you, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, sat through a number of hearings. Sadly, I was away on other committees, but I attended as many as I could. The thing that amazed me was that in Alice Springs and Darwin, and all around Australia, there was no outrage or opposition to ATSIC’s abolition. There was no indignation. There was largely apathy and an expectation that we can do better. That is a legitimate expectation—an expectation that knows that ATSIC, with a voter turnout of 20 per cent, is not only unrepresentative but simply failing to understand the diversity of its constituency.
ATSIC had no great mandate and, therefore, had no great accountability to firstly remote communities, which are very difficult to understand, to legislate for, to provide services for and to administrate. It then had no real understanding of the difference between remote communities and regional communities. Central wheat belt towns in Western Australia, for example, are totally different from outback, isolated, remote communities in the central reserve. They are absolutely chalk and cheese in their day-to-day functioning, in their facilities and in the integration that they have with the wider community. ATSIC never came to terms with that difference. Lastly, of course, it is fair to say that ATSIC never really came to terms with urban communities, although it was dominated by and preoccupied with them, particularly in Sydney, Melbourne and, to some extent, Perth and Brisbane.
That is the great irony of this, at the end of the day. I said to Geoff Clark in the committee hearing: ‘Mr Clark, how is it that, when the legislation is introduced, you don’t appear to have a friend in the world? The Labor Party are not willing to side with you; the government has certainly had enough of ATSIC. Nobody in public administration is prepared to put their hand up and say, “We must preserve this institution.” How has it come to this after such a long time?’ The answer I got—and I am paraphrasing what he said—was, ‘It’s not our fault; it’s everybody else’s fault.’ Leadership in this institution has failed, and it has failed for any number of good reasons. It simply failed to understand its constituency, and it was not determined to see good outcomes.
No-one is sad at ATSIC’s passing, and people particularly in Western Australia are looking forward to the changes. It concerned me that a number of commissioners who came before the committee were quite angry at ATSIC’s demise. But when I realised what it meant to them on a personal level—they lost substantial amounts of income and allowances, usually approaching figures in excess of $200,000—I understood why they were some of the loudest opponents to the demise and abolition of ATSIC. I hasten to point out that it is not about the fee. I do not mind paying the fee. The fees—the travel allowance, the living away from home allowance and all that—are fine, if I thought they were doing the job, if I thought there was an outcome, or if I thought there was some earnest application of public administration, skills and ability but, sadly, there was simply not.
We have outrageously high rates of child mortality, and we have domestic violence figures that are absolutely appalling. Indeed, we have two reports that absolutely stagger any semblance of proper public administration. We have Third World health conditions and chronic unemployment. The outcomes were against the backdrop of the ATSIC budget, which in 2002-03 was $1.1 billion—that is, $A1,100 million was given to ATSIC in 2002-03.
That is not the end of the matter, because the Australian government had a total expenditure, independent of that figure, of $1.3 billion. So $2,400 million was spent on Aboriginal and Indigenous programs and affairs in one year, yet we still have this failure of public administration. Let us be perfectly frank: it is not all ATSIC’s fault. The changes that are on foot in this legislation are the beginning of a new dawn, the beginning of a new day and they are positive in the face of the hand wringing and platitudes that we get from the opposition and from senators in the minor parties.
I am trying as hard as I can to be the least bit provocative in terms of politics but, by any measure related to health, education, housing, child welfare or domestic violence, ATSIC was a failure and had to go. The first person to come out publicly from the other side and say that and bring the debate to a head was the former Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham. He said: ‘It’s got to go.’ This legislation would not be here if it had not been for the Labor Party coming to the conclusion that ‘enough was enough’.
This legislative framework was put in place in 1989 by the then Labor government. It has all the hallmarks, all the similarities and all the foibles and complexities of the national native title legislation. We all know, and those people who have some empathy with Aboriginal people in these areas all know, what a chronic failure it has been in terms of having expectations dashed, in terms of holding out the torch of self-determination just to see it not work, because the organisation and the institution became subverted in peculiar, internal political wrangling.
I want to talk about the new start. The current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, needs to be heartily congratulated on grasping this very difficult nettle. The legislation focuses on outcomes, it focuses on funding from the ground up, not the top down—which was the ATSIC model—and it focuses on direct funding into communities. It provides a better capacity to address the diverse needs of Aboriginal people. The people in the central reserve of Western Australia, the people up in the Kimberley, the people living in Redfern need a certain degree of understanding and a perception of what their requirements are in order to make the funding meaningful and to get a good bang for the buck that we put into Aboriginal and Indigenous affairs. The minister must be congratulated on her approach. As I said, we can do better and I believe that this is the first step on the right path towards doing that.
I pause to say what that means in terms of parliamentary oversight. We all participate in the estimates process; we all go along to Senate committees. The opportunity that this presents to ordinary members of the Senate back benches to go along to estimates hearings, and to scrutinise what is happening in individual communities, to raise issues, to follow them up, is an opportunity that we have not had before. The principal reason why we have not been able to get to the bottom of the problems in the management and the public administration of Indigenous affairs is that ATSIC has been totally unaccountable. It has been funded entirely by the Australian government—of whatever political colour—but it has not been accountable to the parliament.
We go along to estimates, we go along to our inquiries, we can call the witnesses and we can see that mainstreaming achieves the intended outcome. We can ride behind the Commonwealth officers, the senior departmental secretaries, the SES officers and we can ask: ‘How many times have you been out into the communities this year? I want to know whether you have been to Balgo. Are you going to Balgo? Are you ever planning to send anybody to Balgo?’ Balgo is a very important Aboriginal community. I want to know whether public servants will do the right thing and see that the services that we all hope will get delivered to these places are actually being delivered. We have never had that opportunity.
This legislation, this scheme, this plan gives us a chance to be there, to be part of the game and to seek the outcomes that we all want. That is why I think this legislation is very good. I think it is interesting that the opposition come into this place and say, ‘It’s terrible that we’re going to forsake the democratic institution of Indigenous people.’ The only reason this legislation is here today is because Mark Latham committed the Labor Party to support the abolition of ATSIC. That is why it is here. We would not get the legislation through if it were not for the opposition and the minor parties. We have it here because Labor has realised that the system is not working. When you have people’s livelihoods, their health, their future, their education—those sorts of things—in the palm of your hand, Senators, that is when you need to act. I say to Labor—notwithstanding that it is trying to dress it all up and hide behind some sort of Clayton’s abolition of ATSIC—congratulations; support the abolition. Let us get on with this new scheme and let us see if we can deliver some outcomes to Aboriginal people that are long overdue.
I am looking forward to attending estimates and I am looking forward to visiting communities, with senior public servants, to see that delivery is taking place. I am looking forward to asking departmental heads: ‘How many times have you been to Redfern? How many times have you been out there talking to Aboriginal people on the ground?’ I am looking for a much greater engagement between Commonwealth and state departments. We now can open up that dialogue. I think that has been a problem: ATSIC has not been able to communicate with state departments. There has been a ‘my empire versus your empire’ attitude: ‘Don’t get on my turf. We do this.’ I am hoping that a lot of the emotional guardianship of one’s turf is now coming out of the argument and we can look to delivering services properly. I hasten to say that none of this is easy. I look forward to joining the opposition in scrutinising government on how we deliver services to Aboriginal and Indigenous communities.
I have great respect for many members of the opposition. Senator Crossin, Senator McLucas and indeed Senator Moore are just a few people who take the time to come along to the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, sit up all hours of the night reviewing annual reports and do the sorts of things that Aboriginal people need us to do to ensure that they are getting a fair crack of the whip out of what is a very successful economy. We all enjoy a magnificent standard of living but we can do better about what Aboriginal people are seeing in terms of their slice of the pie.
The need for change has been explained. In saying why we had to move in such a way I refer to the Gordon inquiry report to the Western Australian state parliament, and to a further report which was produced in Sydney, entitled Child sex abuse in rural and remote Australian Indigenous communities. Those two very interesting reports indicate the urgent need for this parliament to arrest what has been a failure in the delivery of service with respect to a number of fronts, particularly state and federal and ATSIC. ATSIC is the first step; we are on the way to really getting stuck in to fix this matter up.
I now turn to the Labor Party’s approach. I have complimented them on the fact that they are supporting the abolition of ATSIC. I see a number of amendments come floating through. That is not the way to deal with Aboriginal and Indigenous affairs. It is not the way to go forward to give a proper lead. You have to have a plan; you have to have a policy. What is Labor’s policy? We have seen that ATSIC was unrepresentative of people all over Australia. We have seen that the funding was not delivered; it was a top-down scheme that simply did not get off the ground, such that none of its constituents lamented ATSIC’s passing. So where is the great Labor plan? If they do not like what we are doing about a representative institution, where is their model? Where is the work that they have done to say, ‘We think we can do it better’? The bottom line is that they have not done the work and they have not approached the hard questions.
The report that was put forward by the select committee was full of political platitudes designed to be a Clayton’s support for the bill—that is, they do support it but they really want to show Aboriginal people that they are very unhappy about supporting it. The fact is that Aboriginal people are not unhappy about the legislation. They are looking forward to a new day. The Labor Party need to understand, as Senator Ridgeway indicated, that they should get on with the job. They should accept this legislation for what it is. It is a new start and it is a better way of doing things.
I pause to say that, from talking to people on the ground, I know that the Western Australian experience was that ATSIC was wholly and solely irrelevant to and unrepresentative of them. Western Australia has by far the largest population of Indigenous people in this country but their representation on ATSIC was one of the smallest. Indeed they did not fit into the political paradigm that evolved inside the walls of ATSIC. They did not have the chance to do the networking, to play the part and to assert themselves that eastern states members of ATSIC had. So Western Australia was at a huge disadvantage when it came to being part of what was an experiment in self-determination. In fact ‘self-determination’ was simply a euphemism for the strongest over the weakest and for the most articulate dominating the inarticulate. That is the failure on the ground in Western Australia.
Senators have said that I said that we did not go to Western Australia. We went to Western Australia back in June or July—

Senator O’Brien interjecting—

—We went to Broome before the parliament was prorogued. It is a whole new parliament. We did not go to Carnarvon, Meekatharra, Kalgoorlie—where there are literally thousands and thousands of Indigenous people—Perth, Bunbury, Albany or Geraldton. That is the most outrageous thing about the Labor Party’s approach to this legislation. They wanted to hold an inquiry but almost half of the constituents were left out of the loop. That is a very sorry, sad and lamentable fact.
In closing, I sincerely hope and believe that the legislative scheme that is before the Senate today is going to be a better deal for Aboriginal people. I believe it will give senators a much greater opportunity to scrutinise, to observe and to be part of the process of improving the lot of Aboriginal people, be they living in the cities, wheat belt towns, agricultural centres or some of the most remote communities in the world. I commend this legislation because the minister has done a good job. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-03-14,"—I am pleased that, about 19 minutes into his contribution, Senator Johnston went some way towards correcting the record as to what he told the Senate about the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs only last week. As Senator Johnston now recalls, he attended a hearing in Broome in Western Australia, contrary to his advice to the Senate last week that the committee had not been to Western Australia. He asked about 88 questions, I believe, at the hearing but he forgot all about that because, obviously, he was not paying attention to the evidence. He had a brief to achieve and it did not matter what the evidence was, according to Senator Johnston. That is the only thing I can draw from the extraordinary statement that he made last week.
I rise in this debate to lend my support to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. It is with a somewhat heavy heart that I indicate my support for the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Its abolition has in fact been long effected by this government through administrative means. This administrative action has been aided by the behaviour of a number of ATSIC’s leaders, not least that of its chair, Mr Geoff Clark. It is telling that in the very week the Senate select committee report into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] is presented and the legislation for ATSIC’s abolition is debated, Mr Clark has been embroiled in a debate about the ownership and authenticity of a football jumper. Once again Mr Clark, wittingly or unwittingly, has become the centre of public attention at a time when his organisation and his people require real leadership.
I had the privilege to serve as the shadow minister for reconciliation and Indigenous affairs for part of the last parliament and I released Labor’s Indigenous affairs policy statement during the election campaign. On 30 March last year, Mark Latham and I jointly announced Labor’s decision to support the abolition of ATSIC. We said that ATSIC had lost much of the goodwill it once enjoyed. Importantly, we also recommitted Labor to the principle of a national Indigenous representative body. That has been forgotten by some contributors to this debate. We did not hide from that commitment then and we do not hide from it now. What we did do was acknowledge that Indigenous interests were not best served by the continuation of Indigenous representation in its current form. At that time some people preferred to stick their heads in the sand and pretend it was not thus—and they still do.
It is not surprising to me that Senator Ridgeway spent a good part of his speech during debate on the second reading of this bill in attacking the Labor party. He repeated the asinine claim that Labor started the ball rolling on ATSIC’s abolition. The fact is that the Howard government had been gunning for ATSIC since day one of its election, more than nine long years ago. The claim that Labor’s policy statement was the beginning of the end for ATSIC is as stupid as it is absurd. It is telling that Senator Ridgeway and others have lined up the government’s campaign against Indigenous Australians with Labor’s 30 March 2004 media statement and asserted some sort of equivalency—that is, that Labor’s announcement was comparable to the Howard government’s savage cuts to the ATSIC budget, its struggle to undermine native title, its contempt for the stolen generations and its orchestrated campaign of vilification against the leadership of ATSIC.
Labor recognised the reality of ATSIC’s circumstances and decided to do something about it. That is why Labor took a policy to the election that committed an incoming Labor government to the development of a new regional and national Indigenous representative arrangement—a structure developed in consultation with Indigenous Australians. Labor did not introduce the ATSIC legislation in the middle of last year, but we were forced to deal with it. As the then responsible shadow minister, I negotiated with the Democrats, the Greens and individual Independent senators to establish a select committee to consider the ATSIC legislation and related matters, including the consequences of mainstreaming Indigenous programs. This committee, re-established in the new parliament, gave Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians their first and only opportunity to comment on the government’s plan. It was an opportunity the government wanted to deny the Australian people, including the very Australians whose representative structure it now seeks to abolish. During its first incarnation, this select committee took evidence in places as diverse as Alice Springs, Broome, Nhulunbuy, Cairns and Thursday Island in addition to accepting and publishing hundreds of individual written submissions. The Senate re-established the committee after the election and allowed it to complete its work.
I have had a number of longstanding concerns about the ATSIC legislation, not all of them comprehensively addressed in the select committee report or during this debate. One of my concerns relates to the proposed expanded role for the Office of Evaluation and Audit, an office that will operate with an almost unrestricted right to examine organisations and individuals that receive Indigenous specific funding. Little attention has been paid to the fact that this office will enjoy little operational independence. I am concerned that the capacity of the executive to direct the work of this office will be largely unchecked by external scrutiny. As the senator who uncovered the absurdly named and publicly funded Operation Hoodoo in relation to the Bidjara group, I am not satisfied that unchecked power in these circumstances is healthy or desirable. Organisations and individuals that receive funding, Indigenous or otherwise, need to be accountable. But I wonder why no Operation Hoodoo was established to investigate the circumstances in which Beaudesert Rail lost $5.8 million of taxpayers’ money on a non-operational rail line and still left creditors blowing in the wind. And I wonder whether the states understand the extent of the powers available to the Office of Evaluation and Audit under the provisions of this bill.
Of course, the operation of a new audit unit is pretty small beer in an environment where Indigenous programs and services are mainstreamed. That environment does have only passing relationship to the passage of this bill. Under the cover of ATSIC related controversy, including Senator Vanstone’s extraordinarily inept and spectacularly unsuccessful attempt to suspend the chair, the government has introduced wholesale changes in the administration of Indigenous affairs. The government has ordered its bureaucracies to swallow up Indigenous specific programs without regard for the needs of the Indigenous people they serve or, in many cases, the bureaucracies themselves.
In response to criticism, the government has pointed to the failure of existing program delivery—failure the government, I might say, has presided over for more than nine years; failure that cannot, except at the barest margins, be attributed to the administration of programs by ATSIC or other Indigenous controlled organisations. The fact that many Indigenous controlled organisations perform magnificently is rarely acknowledged by the government or, for that matter, anyone else. Senator Carr acknowledged the success of many Indigenous controlled organisations during his speech in the second reading debate, and I welcome and endorse his remarks.
We have heard plenty of bold statements from the government and, in particular, government senators about the new dawn in Indigenous affairs to be brought about as a result of its mainstreaming program—and not just from ministers. The Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Shergold, has been vocal in his commitment to make the Public Service more responsive to the needs of Indigenous Australians under the new regime. That is a good thing, but it is results that count. We all know how language can be used and abused—after nine years of Mr Howard’s prime ministership, boy do we know.
Late last year I thought it useful to look at how one key government department was performing on the critical issue of Indigenous employment. I thought employment was a good issue to examine because it is something over which the department has some control. The argument that Indigenous Australians are not good employees or do not want to be employed has as much currency as the argument that women do not belong in public life and, anyway, would really rather stay at home. I thought the Department of Transport and Regional Services was a good department to examine for a few reasons. The first was that it is a large department with regional offices located in places such as Darwin, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Bendigo, Wollongong, Orange, Newcastle, Townsville, Longreach and Jervis Bay. Many of those locations are home to significant numbers of Indigenous Australians. The second reason was that the department is administered by Deputy Prime Minister Anderson, a senior member of the government and himself a representative of an electorate with a significant Indigenous population. The third reason was that DOTARS was the department that the current Public Service Commissioner, Ms Lynelle Briggs, was serving when she was appointed as commissioner late last year. I also thought it appropriate to examine this department’s performance because its last annual report made some bold, but appropriate, statements about workplace diversity. This is what the DOTARS 2003-04 annual report says on page 161:
We respect and value the diversity of our workforce. In 2003-04, we continued the workplace diversity programme we launched in 2001. The programme is overseen by our Diversity and Equity Network and challenges us to:
• attract and retain a diverse range of people to the department with a focus on indigenous recruitment ...
I thought that was pretty interesting. Not only did it make the department’s commitment to focusing on improving Indigenous employment clear, it noted that the policy challenging it to do better had been in place since 2001. Four years on, I wanted to know what sort of results this policy and the department’s stated commitment were delivering. So, noting that the department employs about 1,000 permanent staff, I asked Mr Anderson a question on notice, and he told me that in 2003-04 his department employed 2.45 full-time Indigenous employees. That is, just under 2½ full-time positions out of about 1,000 were filled by Indigenous employees. That is an absolute disgrace. It is less than a quarter of one per cent of the staff. This exposes the department’s claim that it has a focus on Indigenous employment as nothing more than a collection of cheap words.
As well as asking Mr Anderson how many Indigenous people his department employed, I asked him what strategies his department had to improve employment outcomes. This is what I found. Was there an Indigenous employment strategy? No. Were there Indigenous specific employment positions? No. Was there an agency based Indigenous employment scheme? No. Were advertisements placed in Indigenous media, such as the Canberra based National Indigenous Times? No, that was not done either. In fact, the only measure adopted by the Department of Transport and Regional Services to improve its Indigenous employment outcome is participation in the National Indigenous Cadetship Program—and even that measure will not be adopted until later this year.
Public sector employment is one small measure of a government’s commitment to improved Indigenous outcomes. The fact that in this case the examination of reality so dramatically demonstrates the hollowness of the government’s rhetoric points to a bigger problem—a problem that underlies the anxiousness of many of us about the government’s mainstreaming of Indigenous programs. The life expectancy of Indigenous women has declined since Prime Minister Howard occupied that office. That has nothing to do with ATSIC. Nor does ATSIC bear responsibility for the poor rates of literacy and numeracy, the appallingly high rates of incarceration and the shocking infant mortality rates enjoyed, if I can put it that way, by Indigenous Australians. That responsibility rests with us, fellow senators—and it rests with a government that pretends that eliminating Indigenous representation and dismantling Indigenous programs will address Indigenous disadvantage.
I say this because I think it is important that Labor’s position be put in the context of our dissatisfaction with the current arrangements and the performance of the government. I say this because it is important to understand that we do not believe that we can find a genuineness behind the government’s words to give us confidence in the arrangements that the government seeks to put in place. I say this because we think something better has to come from the abolition of ATSIC. Labor as a party, and individuals within Labor such as me, will continue to work towards a more effective representational structure for Indigenous Australians, because we believe that self-determination for the original Australians needs to find a face in our society. Its time will come. It may not be in the next three years, five years or 10 years, but it must come.
I do maintain support for the abolition of ATSIC, as I first expressed on behalf of the Labor Party in March last year. In saying that, I understand that no representative arrangements will be put in place under this government—and that is a very sad state of affairs. However, I think that from this position a great many contributors from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities will carry the fight to this government and make sure that in the future their rights will be represented properly, their communities will be well served and well represented, and we will be talking about other legislation, probably with a different name, which will be the means by which this parliament will give effect to a new set of representative arrangements. I commend the second reading amendment and the legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-03-14,"—I thank senators for their contributions to this important debate. I foreshadow that I will be moving one amendment to this bill on behalf of the government at the committee stage of the bill. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] is part of a dramatic and overdue shift in Indigenous affairs policy. No-one in this chamber could continue to support a system that has failed Indigenous Australians so badly for so long.
It is disappointing that Labor continues to play political games on the issue. The delay in passing the ATSIC Amendment Bill has caused confusion and is hurting Indigenous Australians. After nine months, the Senate committee’s report simply admits that abolishing ATSIC is a fait accompli. After all, the opposition announced that abolishing ATSIC was Labor policy. It still is. Yet here we are, almost one year on from that announcement, and still Labor have not let go of ATSIC, simply because ATSIC represents a profound policy failure on their part—ATSIC was a creature of their making.
We have heard nothing in this chamber from the opposition parties but praise for ATSIC, as if it were an effective body representative of Indigenous people. We have heard how it has been the champion of Indigenous people. On the one hand, the opposition point to a lack of progress and, on the other hand, support a continuation of the status quo. That is because they have no ideas and nothing to add. In reality, there has been very little adverse reaction to the abolition of ATSIC. Labor’s crocodile tears over ATSIC do not wash with the government. What is their real commitment? Since 1996, they have had eight opposition spokespeople on Indigenous affairs, seven in the past four years. Does this mean they all want to have a go? I do not think so. The sentiments of Labor were summed up by one Labor left faction MP who in 2000 said, ‘Taking on Aboriginal affairs is like accepting a job as a toilet cleaner on the Titanic.’ Mr Beazley—or was it Mr Crean?—never did find out who said that. That is their attitude: plenty of talk but no commitment.
This government is serious about reducing Indigenous disadvantage. It has spent a record $2.9 billion on Indigenous specific programs this year, 39 per cent more in real terms than in the last years of the Keating government. Those opposite would have us believe, through their propaganda and second reading amendments, that this expenditure has been a complete waste and that there have been no real gains. Their claims are simply not true. There have been real and important improvements. The gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians has reduced in terms of deaths from respiratory illness and infections, and parasitic diseases; year 5 writing and reading benchmarks; secondary school attendance; year 12 retention; home ownership; students at TAFE and universities; and Indigenous employment, which grew by 22 per cent between 1996 and 2001.
The non-government parties talk about an apology but what would that have done in a practical sense? The government has provided $120 million for real initiatives such as the link-up network, counselling and parenting programs, cultural and language programs, a records preservation project and a national oral history project to address these issues. The opposition continues to dredge up its views on native title. The 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act have resulted in the volume of claims being rationalised and the claim process being streamlined. The rate of settlements has increased dramatically. Recently, the government provided Reconciliation Australia with a capital injection of $15 million. Reconciliation Place has been constructed in the Parliamentary Triangle at a cost of over $6 million.
While we should acknowledge improvements, Indigenous Australians still lag behind. It is not good enough to keep working within the same flawed framework designed by Labor. That is why we are going beyond abolishing ATSIC to introduce radical reforms to the way programs and services are delivered. The Australian government wants Indigenous people to have the same opportunities and choices that are enjoyed by other Australians. Yet over and over we have heard claims from the opposition that ATSIC is simply a scapegoat for the failure of others. So to mask the fact that Labor has no vision for the future, it harks back to the past. It sets out to discredit the government’s efforts regardless of the truth. It is just a political game.
Members of the opposition have said that there should be more consultation before we act. During the ATSIC review there were two major rounds of public consultation. Eight thousand copies of the public discussion paper were mailed out and a web site was set up. The panel received 156 written submissions. The panel met with a wide range of stakeholders across the nation, including each of the 35 ATSIC regional councils. A number of regional councils chose to invite community members to participate. The panel also met with some interested individuals. The public consultations revealed widespread disillusionment and dissatisfaction with ATSIC on the part of Indigenous Australians. Most Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians want us to put an end to it now.
The opposition have spoken at length about what they call mainstreaming. They use the emotionally charged word ‘assimilationist’ as a smokescreen for the fact they are devoid of ideas and originality. They say that mainstream departments have always failed Indigenous people in the past. They do not get the message that we want nothing to do with the past—that is Labor’s speciality.
The Senate Select Committee on Indigenous Affairs heard evidence from the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Peter Shergold. He told the committee that the old criticisms of mainstreaming were not relevant now. Labor knows that we are not abolishing special programs and that we are putting machinery in place to make the mainstream agencies take up their responsibilities in a coordinated way. Many of the Indigenous programs that mainstream agencies will manage are delivered now by Aboriginal organisations. They will be in the future. These are Labor’s scare tactics. In fact, it was Labor that mainstreamed Indigenous health programs when it recognised that ATSIC was failing.

 (Senator Knowles)—The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr and also on behalf of Senators Ridgeway and Nettle be agreed to.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2005-03-14,"—by leave—At the request of Senator Bartlett, I move the Australian Democrats’ second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion add:
         “but the Senate is of the opinion that:
              (1)    the legislative structure of the ATSIC Regional Councils should remain in place whilst operating within the ATSIC Regional Council structure, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should have the opportunity, provided in the legislation, to negotiate with each other to create a representative structure within the boundaries of the current ATSIC regions or wards which reflect the cultural leadership of the residents more appropriately, as recommended by the ATSIC Review Report In the Hands of the Regions.

         (2)    The Government should resource the continuation of Kungkala Wakai (“Our Women’s Voice”), the committee of elected female ATSIC members headed by Commissioner Alison Anderson.
         (3)    Where a legitimate decision has been made by ATSIC relating to assets held by ATSIC, the government department now responsible for administering the relevant assets must honour the decision and follow through by administering the full implementation of this decision in an expedient manner.
         (4)    The government must immediately enter into negotiations with the Torres Strait Regional Authority as to which is the best Torres Strait Islander representative body to replace the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board as the body which recommends the Torres Strait Islander member to be appointed to the AIATSIS Council.
         (5)    The Government must produce and make publicly available, guidelines for Departments, governments, Indigenous organisations and individuals regarding Shared Responsibility Agreements (SRA), including:
                   (a)    a clear description of what they are, and what the principles behind their use is and;
                   (b)    a clear account of what is and is not acceptable for use in SRAs, for example that no basic citizenship rights are to be bargained for; and
                   (c)    arranging for translation of the guidelines into the local languages (either in published format or through oral presentations) so that communities fully understand the processes.
         (6)    “Noting that the government has no developed way of evaluating the ‘new arrangements’ in Indigenous Affairs, the government should:

              (a)    fund a comprehensive needs analysis of Indigenous communities;
              (b)    task the Commonwealth Grants Commission to establish a measure of relative need in Indigenous communities;
              (c)    increase it’s monitoring and reporting of information about outputs and outcomes of government funding for Indigenous related programs including the development of a comprehensive national benchmarking regime; and
              (d)    provide a clear breakdown of all expenditure on Indigenous affairs including what is for the benefit of Indigenous Australians, what is for the benefit of all Australians and what is funding used to contest Indigenous people’s rights”.
                   (a)    a clear description of what they are, and what the principles behind their use is and;
                   (b)    a clear account of what is and is not acceptable for use in SRAs, for example that no basic citizenship rights are to be bargained for; and
                   (c)    arranging for translation of the guidelines into the local languages (either in published format or through oral presentations) so that communities fully understand the processes.
I want to speak to this second reading amendment because it has been circulated late in the chamber. I think it is necessary to give some explanation to the government and to the opposition in particular to try to enlist some support and, at the very least, to demonstrate the chaos that the government’s decision to abolish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission leaves many Indigenous communities in right across the country. The amendment particularly relates to the need for a regional network or structure to coordinate how services are run and how views are going to be listened to under the government’s new arrangements. The amendment also relates to the question of how women are represented in the process—I spoke during the course of last week about that particular issue—and to the committee that had previously been put together by ATSIC under the Kungkala Wakai initiative.
The amendment also goes the question of property assets. Legitimate decisions have been made by ATSIC relating to assets held by them, and government departments now have responsibility for administering those assets. The amendment seeks support for those decisions to be honoured—particularly those that were taken over a year ago, not the ones that were caught up in recent debates.
The amendment also deals with the issue of the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board. The government may not be aware of the confusion that has been created there. I think what has not been spoken about in this debate is the fact that, whilst the government have moved to make sure that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission itself is abolished, the Torres Strait Regional Authority is unaffected by these changes. But there are questions in relation to the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board and relationships between that and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.
Last, and probably not insignificant, are questions in relation to accountability mechanisms in order to look at how shared responsibility agreements are put together and at the evaluation of new arrangements. The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs was not provided with any comprehensive information from government or from government departments about how these new arrangements would work and what the evaluation criteria would be. Rather, it has been left open to communities to somehow work that out for themselves. I think it does raise questions. If we are talking about allocating public moneys and expenditure in communities, I think there is a need to make sure that you do get results but most of all that there is a way of being able to assess and measure them.
This is not an issue that is new to this process. It came up in a Senate inquiry in 2003 looking at the national progress towards reconciliation. That looked at how the evaluation of Indigenous programs across the country was going to work. Now that we have the new arrangements, I think that at the very least there is a need for an Australia-wide analysis of Indigenous communities. We should look at giving the Commonwealth Grants Commission the capacity to establish a measure of relative need within communities, if need is to be the basis on which services are provided. It should look at increasing its monitoring and reporting of information about outputs and outcomes and should certainly put in place a comprehensive national benchmarking regime.
On that point I have to be little bit critical of the states and territories for shirking their responsibilities and for looking at measuring themselves after the fact, as opposed to setting some standards that ought to be achieved and doing that in partnership with Indigenous communities. They should make sure that there is a clear breakdown of all expenditure on Indigenous affairs, particularly that which goes directly to Indigenous communities and provides some sort of benefit. We are coming up to the May budget, and I do not believe that the smoke and mirrors about record amounts of money being spent in Indigenous affairs is lost on anyone here. Very little information is being provided on what is old, what is new, what is being spent within government departments and what actually drip-feeds down to services on the ground. These are all important matters.
In considering the entire bill we also need to remind ourselves that, even with the speech that was given by Minister Abetz about the positiveness of these changes, it is hard to understand how he could trumpet this bill as achieving those outcomes. He talked about the failures of ATSIC when it has been said time and again in evidence put before the Senate select committee—and certainly through the ATSIC review committee process, where we spent $1.4 million in establishing both evidence and reasons—that there was a need for reform but for the retention of a national and regional structure. All of that has been lost on the government.
There is no evidence that mainstreaming itself will work. The government has not been able to put forward any practical evidence to support the claims that mainstreaming processes will improve the position of Indigenous people. Indeed, the opposite is probably the case. That is shown in overseas jurisdictions. I hasten to mention the whole question of community control, which the government seems to harp on about. It talks a lot about putting Indigenous services and decision making into the hands of Indigenous communities, yet at the same time it is trying very hard to diminish the capacity of the representative structures across the country. The rhetoric does not seem to ring true with what is actually going on. It is certainly not about empowering communities.
I mention again the MiiMi Mothers Aboriginal Corporation. I mentioned that many times in this place during the hearings of the Senate select committee. I point out that the decision in that case was taken over a year ago, when property was transferred to the Aboriginal Housing Corporation. I would encourage the government to look at that again. They say that they want to help that community and that they want to look at practical ways of moving forward. I could not think of a better way. So far the Department of Family and Community Services have made a decision against criteria that do not necessarily match the local aspirations and certainly do not support the mothers and the youth programs that are currently operating under very difficult circumstances.
It seems to me that we have to move beyond some of the rhetoric. Otherwise the successes that are out there at the moment will run the risk of floundering. I note that Senator Abetz, speaking earlier, mentioned the failure of ATSIC and yet at the same time neglected to mention that the health, housing and education programs were programs that, by and large, ATSIC did not deal with. When looking at the programs that were successful, one would have to ask: if they were so bad then why are none of the programs being abolished? During the Senate select committee process, I asked Dr Shergold, now head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, why he thought that, after being the CEO of ATSIC, he was promoted to being the head of PM&C—or the head of the Public Service, for that matter. It seems to me to be a contradiction and an argument against what the government proclaims in this case.
I believe that there is a genuineness in wanting to overcome the endemic poverty that exists within communities. I think we all aspire to that, but we have to get a bit more real about the rhetoric that is being used and start looking at the body of work that shows the truth about this issue and life in Indigenous communities. It seems to me that the truth itself is going to be necessary as a prerequisite if we are going to bring about positive change. Most of that is going to have to come from communities. We are going to have to listen to what people are saying. I do not think we should be having contests about who is right or wrong when it affects so many people’s lives.
Another issue is that—and this is particular to Indigenous affairs in this country—Indigenous assertions are consistent with the whole principle of what universality of fair treatment means. I have to say that that is what white Australia claims to embody, but it does not necessarily always apply to Indigenous communities equally. That was shown again recently with the re-enactment of the freedom rides in New South Wales. There is a story about a young Aboriginal man who had his ticket for a seat on a CountryLink coach. He was trying to get on the coach and the bus driver denied him access to the bus because he was running late. A young non-Indigenous woman ran after the bus—she had a ticket as well—and the bus driver stopped and let her on. Thankfully, the freedom riders were there and they gave the man a lift to the nearest roadhouse. They caught up with the CountryLink coach and confronted the bus driver. The young girl that he picked up stood up for the young Aboriginal man. The bus driver told her that she ought to button her lip. In the end she was thrown off the bus and the young Aboriginal guy was not allowed on either. The point is that we have to recognise that there are some issues that really make it difficult out there to get some of the services provided and to get change brought about.
Finally, if we are talking about fairness in relation to universality, the government cannot continue to ignore what is, I think, the No. 1 priority—that is, the appalling health circumstances in communities, particularly the high mortality rates. It seems to me that the investment of new levels of resources is required. If we are to bring the health of Indigenous Australians up to par with the rest of the nation, there is an opportunity to do that come the May budget—and I think it is pertinent that we are dealing with this bill at this particular time.
The second reading amendment that has been put forward by Senator Bartlett on behalf of the Australian Democrats highlights some of the chaos and confusion that exists on the ground. The government has taken the credit for the Murdi Paaki COAG trial which has been running successfully in my home state of New South Wales. It was conveniently rebadged as a shared responsibility agreement towards the end of last year, not recognising or not acknowledging that most of the good work was done by regional councils themselves. Certainly from my experience right across the country, where Indigenous coordination centres are being established, the regional councillors are working side by side with officers within the ICC. The regional councillors are the ones providing their expertise and the opportunity for introduction to communities and they are the ones making sure that the best comes out of this process. I do not bother too much about the board of commissioners, given some of its behaviour over recent times, but the regional councils and councillors deserve better treatment in this process.
This second reading amendment is really designed to try to pick up some of the issues there and to get an undertaking from the government that they are serious about these issues. I am glad to see the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs here. I know that she has a commitment to this issue and I know that she has been speaking to Indigenous members in the community as well as the new NIC. All of them have their particular views, and I hope that they are able to convince her of some of the things that need to be done and need to change in the way that these things are being pushed forward.
Most of all, whilst the government talks about any new structure that might arise from initiatives from within communities, there will be a need for support. We got conflicting ideas in the Senate select committee process, some from government saying that there would not be any funding and others from government saying that there definitely would be funding. So we still do not know whether the government is going to come on side and support those councils or communities across the country that do create positive initiatives.
I commend this second reading amendment to the Senate. I know that it was circulated late, and I can understand that the opposition may have some reservations about that. Given that they are apparently going to be supporting the government’s bill, I certainly encourage them to at least get an undertaking from the government that it will start to look at these issues—to make sure that the Senate sends a message that is loud and clear. I think that is the least that we can do. As I have indicated to Senator Carr, whilst it is a second-best option, the whole notion of regional councils being around for some time longer is something that I think is necessary as part of a transition process—but we will deal with that when the time comes.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-03-14,"—The opposition would like to place on the record our concern at amendments of this type being dropped on us without consultation and without an opportunity to consider them. I received this amendment just before the break. On this side of the chamber there was an agreement about a second reading amendment, which I thought was the appropriate way to deal with these questions. So I am disappointed that a proposition like this could be presented.
Individually, there is not one thing in the amendment that I would not find considerable merit in, but I do not like the way the amendment is expressed. I think it is clumsy and I think that there are provisions in the amendment that are unclear. I would have thought that you could have cleaned all of that up if there had been some talk. I understand that there is some concern about matters not coming back from the Clerk’s office, but this is not necessarily the best way to do business in this chamber. Unfortunately, we are now in a situation where we cannot adjourn this any further. I have consulted with my colleagues on the select committee, and each one of these points was covered in the Senate report. For that reason, we will not be opposing this second reading amendment. But I do say to you that we could have improved this amendment substantially if we had had an opportunity to discuss the matter with you.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-03-14,"—In rising to speak on this legislation on behalf of the Labor opposition I firstly note that we are dealing with two bills. These two bills are necessary in order to meet our commitment to Indonesia and replenish and provide additional funding for tsunami relief. The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 is for new outcomes and capital works and the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005 is for ordinary services. These are special appropriation bills, because the size of the financial commitment that is being made to Indonesia in response to the appalling tsunami disaster requires special legislation to pass the Parliament of Australia. The very size of the commitment means that assistance that has been given in respect of other natural disasters—which would not normally require two special appropriation bills—is dwarfed by this package.
I will commence my remarks by focusing on the human dimension of this disaster and why it is necessary to pass these special appropriation bills. Given that these are financial bills, before I get into the details of the finance that is being provided and the way it is being provided, I think it is important to touch on the overwhelming and devastating nature of the disaster that occurred on Boxing Day which, as I understand from last reports, left more than 286,000 people dead, 7,900 missing and more than 1.6 million persons displaced in a dozen countries around South-East Asia and eastern Africa. It is very difficult to find words to describe such a massive, overwhelming and appalling human disaster. I certainly hope that we never see another disaster of such magnitude at any time during my life. I would be very surprised if we did. I looked back at some of the great natural disasters of the last 100 years and the death tolls associated with them, and this disaster certainly seems to leave all in its unfortunate wake just by the sheer size of it.
As we know, Australians have responded overwhelmingly through donations and various types of fundraising that have occurred to provide assistance through a number of non-government organisations. Looking at a list we find that, as at 4 February, Australians had donated a total of $239.6 million. The Australian Red Cross raised $89 million; CARE Australia, $25 million; Caritas Australia, $11 million; Oxfam Community Aid Abroad, $21 million; UNICEF Australia, $5 million; and World Vision Australia, some $74.3 million. They are the collections of moneys by the various aid organisations involved in accepting moneys. I would be very surprised if there were a member of the parliament who had not been to, and participated in, one of the fundraising activities around the country.
I will now turn to some of the financial details of the two appropriation bills we are considering. The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 proposes $1 billion for the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development. This proposal consists of two elements: $500 million of grants and $500 million in concessional financing. These two amounts are to be transferred into separate special accounts, keeping the funds separate for payment under specific terms. The grants are to be used for small-scale reconstruction for social and economic infrastructure, human resource development, scholarships, education and training programs, humanitarian relief, rehabilitation, recovery assistance and assistance with systems of governance, including systems of law and justice, economic and financial management and public management. The concessional financing will provide loans for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of major infrastructure. The terms provide for $500 million in interest-free financing for up to 40 years, with no repayment of principal before 10 years have elapsed.
The bill also requests approximately $1.5 million for the Department of Defence, the Health Insurance Commission and AusAID to cover costs associated with commencing the partnership, such as the fit-out of the partnership’s operation in Indonesia and some asset costs relating to the government’s emergency response to the tsunami. Loans and grants will be administered by two special accounts. The ministerial determinations establishing these accounts and setting out how moneys can be disbursed are subject to disallowance. It is important that the determinations set clear limits and that grants and loans are reported to parliament. It is expected that the moneys will be allocated over five years.
The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005 provides an appropriation to replenish funding for programs which were diverted to enable the emergency response. There is funding for AusAID of approximately $52.3 million for a wide range of responses: a civilian hospital in Banda Aceh which performed 20 to 30 operations a day; seven medical teams—five to Indonesia and one each to Sri Lanka and the Maldives; the delivery of four tonnes of medical supplies and eight tonnes of medical equipment to Sri Lanka; and the delivery of 2.5 million litres of water to Banda Aceh. For the Department of Defence there is some $50.5 million for a wide range of activities: a 90-bed hospital in Banda Aceh; water purification plants producing 4.7 million litres of clean water; and the clearing of 7,000 cubic metres of debris. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is receiving $17.3 million for disaster victim identification, repatriating Australian remains, the return of personal effects, the handling of some 15,000 missing person inquiries and some 84,000 calls to the consular hotline. The Australian Federal Police are receiving approximately $4.9 million for disaster victim identification. The Department of Health and Ageing is receiving some $2.5 million for activities centring on assistance, such as health and psychological care for Australians injured in the tsunami and psychological care for Australian relatives of those injured or killed as a result of the tsunami. The Department of Family and Community Services is to receive some $2.4 million, also for assistance announced in December 2004 involving payments for transport and accommodation for those injured in the tsunami and payment to the next of kin for funeral costs of the deceased. The remaining agencies to receive funding in the bill are the Attorney-General’s Department, CrimTrac, the Health Insurance Commission and the National Blood Authority, with a combined total of approximately $1.4 million.
We are dealing with significant appropriations, but in rising to speak in the Senate on behalf of the Labor opposition I can indicate our very strong support for this legislation and our bipartisan role with the government. The details of the expenditure that is outlined are appropriate. As Australians we can be proud of the level of support that is being provided by this nation through these appropriations and by the donations that have been made to the agencies that I referred to earlier. It is a truly appalling natural disaster. I hope we do not see anything of a similar nature for a long, long time to come. I am sure all my colleagues in this place would have seen the dreadful pictures on the TV, which were captured by video, of the waves sweeping onto the various coastlines around South-East Asia and parts of the African coast and the Indian subcontinent. It was absolutely appalling—almost beyond any sort of comprehension. We have been asked to deal with this legislation tonight, and that is appropriate. I indicate Labor’s strong support for the approach taken by the government as reflected in these bills. I hope we can secure the passage of the legislation either this evening or, if we do not quite make it tonight, certainly tomorrow morning.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (TSUNAMI FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-14,"—I spoke a couple of times last week on behalf of the Australian Democrats on matters relating to the tsunami financial assistance package and overseas aid and development assistance in general, so I will not go on at length tonight—I refer people to the Hansard from last week. It is appropriate to acknowledge our support for the government’s package of assistance, predominantly to Indonesia but also to other nations affected by what in any language is simply an incomprehensible and appalling disaster. At the time, and repeatedly since then, I and other Democrats have voiced our support for the scale of the assistance that the government is providing.
To really emphasise the scale of the disaster it should be mentioned again that there tends to be a focus on the death toll. That in itself is very hard to comprehend. But of course in most ways the measures we are talking about here tonight are for the survivors—for the living. They are for the millions that have to go on despite having been severely affected. All of those hundreds of thousands of people who have died would have had loved ones who would have survived and who have to continue living with that loss. As Senator Sherry mentioned, there are around 1.6 million who have been displaced by this disaster across the Indian Ocean region. That is an enormous number of people affected in such a fundamental way. Clearly there is an enormous amount of work to be done and it is going to take a very long time to rebuild. But, as we all know, these things can be done—they have to start with the confidence that the resources will be there to enable it to happen. For that reason, this sort of package is welcome.
The wide recognition that this package will receive, particularly the Australia-Indonesia partnership, should very significantly improve the relationship between Australia and Indonesia at the government level and the sense of connection between our two nations. I make that point not in any way to suggest that there is some base sense of self-interest in providing this support but simply to make the obvious point that there is clearly benefit to Australia in providing appropriate and adequate levels of development assistance or disaster assistance to people who need it. Given the widespread recognition of that clear-cut fact, with this package of measures I would hope that we could recognise that the same benefits can be brought to our country and to others by increasing our development assistance more significantly, again particularly for countries in our own region, although not solely. There is a natural degree of benefit to our nation by providing support for others who need help, whether it is with immediate reconstruction following a disaster, broader economic development assistance or assistance with improving systems of governance. Of course, we provide other support in our region but clearly more is needed.
It is a strange quirk of our history and our place on the planet that, in most respects, psychologically a lot of Australians still feel connected to countries and cultures that are on the other side of the world rather than countries and nations that are closest to us. As we move into the next century, that is something that we will need to change and evolve in reasonably significant ways if we are going to reach our full potential as a nation. That is not to discard and discount our history and links with other countries further afield but to recognise the links we naturally share in being neighbours. There is still a significant lack of awareness on both sides—on the Australian side and on the side of other countries in our region, including Indonesia—about each other’s societies and cultures. That is something that needs to change, and measures like this can assist in that regard as well as, of course, with the more immediate and pressing need of providing assistance to people who in many cases have absolutely nothing.
The broader value of development assistance and aid should be recognised. The Democrats have been saying for many years that we must do much better with our aid and assistance, particularly to countries in our region. These bills are a welcome sign of our ability as a nation, and this government’s ability, to do better, as is the very significant amount of donations and contributions that the Australian community provided both as individuals and through the corporate sector. It is doable; we can improve our efforts.
The value and benefit to us and to the people we are trying to assist is clear to everybody. I hope this can be a starting point for a significant longer term improvement in the overall amount of assistance that Australia provides at a government level, a corporate level and an individual level to other countries in our region that are far less prosperous than Australia. Certainly Pacific island nations need ongoing assistance, as do many South-East Asian nations. I do not deny that other mechanisms that enable economic development can be equally, if not more, valuable to ensure prosperity for those countries, but that should not negate the benefit that development assistance and aid can provide.
There is one criticism I would make: the fact that half of the $1 billion package that is provided is in the form of a loan, which will increase Indonesia’s foreign debt. Obviously, it is a loan on very good conditions—a long-term interest-free loan—but it is nonetheless a loan. In the sense of the broader economic impact of that, I think it is a bit short of what we could reasonably have done.
The other aspect, which I pointed out in comments last week, is the need to ensure that the aid is spent effectively. If there is one thing that would dramatically damage the goodwill and the benefit that everyone can see, both from this package and from the donations people have provided privately, it would be if people were given the impression down the track that the money was wasted. I asked some questions at estimates hearings about what mechanism would be put in place to determine the expenditure of the money and ensure that it is as effective as possible: what criteria would be used to ensure that it is not just a de facto way of subsidising Australian companies, for example. Those details have not been worked out yet, primarily because the Australia-Indonesia partnership group have not actually had a meeting yet, as I understand. I believe that will happen very soon—some time in the next week or so, but certainly by the end of this month. That is certainly important.
It is now close to three months since the disaster and certainly the time is now right to get on with working out the details of how this money is spent. It is a very important task to make sure that it is spent effectively and that we are able to demonstrate to the communities in Australia and the communities in Indonesia that it will be spent effectively to get maximum benefit—not just financial benefit but also all the other broader human benefits that can come from this package.
This is a welcome measure. I hope it serves as a sign of broader long-term improvement in this government’s efforts with aid to countries in our region and overseas development assistance more broadly. We certainly need to do better. I urge the government to do everything it can to ensure that the money is seen to be spent as effectively as possible. Millions of lives need to be rebuilt. Economies, societies, communities, environments and infrastructures need to be rebuilt. This will not happen just through money, but it sure will help. I join in not just supporting the appropriation of these funds but also, along with all in this chamber and Australian community, continuing to send sympathy to all of those who were affected by this disaster and support for them as they seek to rebuild their communities.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (TSUNAMI FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-03-14,"—I speak in this debate in support of the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and the associated Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005, both of which represent an admirable attempt by the Australian government to respond to what is a very clear need for external assistance. In the province of Aceh especially, the tsunami has had an extraordinary financial impact. A preliminary damage and loss assessment prepared by international agencies including the World Bank has estimated that the total loss and damage as a result of the tsunami in Indonesia was $5.61 billion. In Aceh alone, the estimated value of the damage and loss amounts to a staggering 97 per cent of GDP.
The Australian government has pledged to a new body, the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development, the single largest aid project ever undertaken by Australia. Parliament has legislated for a five-year aid partnership involving about $US400 million in soft loans and another $US400 million in project funding. According to the Treasurer, that funding will be added to the existing aid program. The result is that Indonesia will receive a total of $US1.4 billion in aid over five years from this country.
This is a huge contribution. With such a commitment from the Australian people comes the responsibility to ensure that a carefully coordinated plan is put in place so that our aid partnership with the Indonesian government proceeds justly, openly and in keeping with the generosity of spirit shown by the millions of Australians. It is particularly our responsibility, as we have insisted that the Australian aid money be kept strictly separate from the Indonesian budget. We hear a lot about Indonesia’s reputation for corruption, but the fact that these funds are to be managed by a joint committee gives the Australian government unprecedented control over the decisions taken by the Indonesian government and therefore it is imperative that our handling of that responsibility is above reproach.
There are important questions to be asked about how this aid will be used to rebuild the province of Aceh. An article in today’s Financial Review indicates that plans to rebuild Aceh’s main hospital and establish a modern disaster response system across Indonesia are among the first projects under the tsunami aid package. These projects are estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars each and are expected to be approved this week at ministerial discussions with Indonesia on how the historic package will be administered. It has been clear from the earliest generous outpouring of contributions that administering aid is far from a straightforward process. While there is no doubt whatever that these two big projects are very important, there is a danger that, in planning for big-budget infrastructure development, the needs of most local and rural communities can be overlooked.
There is a primary need for housing and shelter. According to the Red Cross, many of the 30,000 people evacuated from Banda Aceh and Medan during the first days after the tsunami want to return to their communities but are still confined to temporary settlements or, even worse, makeshift shelters where poor standards of sanitation put their health at risk. The sooner the people of Aceh can return to their home communities, the sooner normality can be restored. It would appear that the matter of evacuees has not yet been adequately addressed, and investigating this should be treated as a matter of urgency.
There is also an urgent need to generate enterprise, commerce and income creation. Seventy-eight per cent of the estimated damage and loss was to private assets and income. This included not only people’s houses and personal possessions, of course, but also income-generating possessions such as fishing boats and nets, agricultural crops, shopfronts and taxis. It must therefore be a priority to provide assistance for long-term projects aimed at generating enterprise and income creation as these will be critical to rebuilding Aceh and the health and wellbeing of the Acehnese people. We know from UNICEF that about 35,000 children have been orphaned as a result of the tsunami. There is an immediate need to identify these vulnerable children and design special programs for their rehabilitation.
It is vital that some of the aid is directed towards rebuilding the rural economy. The agricultural and fishing sectors, which were the backbone of the economies of the local communities most affected, were the hardest hit by the disaster. The loss in these districts made up one-third of the province’s total losses. Throughout Indonesia, civil society organisations were among the first to offer relief in the disaster areas after the earthquake and tsunami. Some of our aid money should go to supporting the participation of civil society and local people, who are working effectively to reach remote areas despite the lack of resources. Local communities, often working in a voluntary capacity, can ensure that aid is delivered on the ground where it is most needed.
Procedures must be put in place to ensure that funding commitments actually help the affected communities to revive their livelihoods and their environment. For example, the planning processes to redesign and rebuild coastal villages must not be allowed to be hijacked by local elite to the detriment of the poor and marginalised. A genuine partnership will implement a participatory planning process which will involve local community groups and NGOs and assure public control over all the processes. We will need to keep a close eye on the operations of this partnership, and transparency there is of the utmost importance.
Another aspect of the allocation of aid which cannot be ignored is the environmental one. Inappropriate development in areas where coral reefs and mangrove forests were destroyed could lead to ecological disaster, so it is essential that reconstruction plans and activities do not create negative environmental impacts. All large reconstruction activities should prepare an environmental impact statement covering both on-site impacts and the impact of materials to be used. The demand for materials for rebuilding will put enormous added pressure on, for example, Indonesia’s forests and limestone areas, so, wherever possible, ecological design should consider the use of local materials that cause minimal environmental impact. Building designs should be socially appropriate—based on designs created with and approved by local communities—and ecologically appropriate, with low energy use, responsible materials use and easy to cool with ventilation.
We read in the newspapers the concern of diplomatic and donor organisations about the fierce competition generated by prestigious projects in Aceh, such as building schools and roads. There is a shortage of staff with the necessary skills needed for the rebuilding, and aid groups are fiercely competing to recruit the available staff, with the result that the salaries of skilled workers are being unnaturally inflated. Many of these skilled workers are employed by the Indonesian government and, if aid groups poach them from there to undertake new aid funded projects, the drain in expertise simply shifts the skills shortage from one patch to another. It would be a tragedy to see a lot of the donated funds wasted through competition among the donors for the best projects or the most skilled workers.
We need to take a long-term approach and, adhering to the principles of capacity building, ensure that a considerable portion of the aid is provided to build the skills which will be of ongoing benefit to the Achenese people, rather than tacitly condoning quick fix solutions adopted to solve the most financially attractive projects. Long-term sustained cooperation and capacity building means, in part, that there needs to be a planned development of local skills so that local companies can increasingly assume responsibility for the development of infrastructure projects.
There is provision for some of the funding to be spent on scholarships for Indonesians to study public administration and governance in Australia. While this is reassuring, we also need to ward against the danger of having an overly strong Australian hand on the re-establishment of the economic infrastructure of Indonesia. In this context I would like to quote from Andrew Burrell’s article on the tsunami aid plan in today’s Financial Review. It said:
Australian companies will be awarded the bulk of the contracts under the five-year aid package of grants and concessional loans, although officials said Indonesian companies might also be included in the tendering process.
Companies with operations in Jakarta, including BlueScope Steel and Leighton Holdings subsidiary Thiess, have already begun reconstruction work in Aceh and are well placed to win lucrative contracts under Australia’s $1 billion aid package.
Partnership means precisely that, and we need to guard against the possibility of Australian aid being targeted to help Australia as much as our Indonesian partners. It is certainly the case that, in the past, aid has been used to assist Australian business—for example, in 1997 the IMF bailout of Indonesia was subject to the further opening up of markets, selling off state services and abolishing price subsidies. This resulted in more opportunities for Australian businesses, but how much did it actually improve the situation of the poor people in Indonesia?
We also need to be conscious of the problems with what is often called ‘tied aid’. This is a system by which recipient countries must purchase goods and services from donor nation companies. We know that Australian business has benefited from this set-up in the past—in fact, approximately 50 per cent of all Australian government contracts, worth $1.5 billion in 2002-03, go to only 10 companies. This seems to me to be putting the welfare of large corporations above the welfare of poor Indonesians. I know that this is not what ordinary Australians wanted when they dug deep to provide financial assistance; they wanted proper procedures put in place regarding procurement, auditing, reporting and pay standards.

However, as in all things, it is from small setbacks that opportunities to do better come, so instead of having to rush through in two minutes I can now deal with the issue in some comfort. I really should thank Senator Carr for his unexpected show of respect for the standing orders last Wednesday night.
I will recap my topics of those two occasions. On the first one I spoke in commendation of the Australian Arabic Council and its 2004 media award. The AAC, as senators may recall, has its purposes in raising awareness about issues of concerns to the Arabic-Australian community and fostering better recognition of the contributions made by people of Arabic origin to the cultural, economic and social fabric of Australia. One of the vehicles it developed to realise these purposes is an annual media award, drawing attention to the role the media play in shaping public perception and the effects that media stereotyping may have on the forming of a multicultural society.
It is a very proactive and innovative approach—an approach more of our diverse background communities could give consideration to. The award was judged by a panel of distinguished experts in journalism and social sciences. They included the Chair of the Department of Social and Behavioural Sciences at the American University of Beirut, the social affairs editor of the Melbourne Age, a professor of journalism at the University of Technology, Sydney, and Ms Mary Kostakidis, who is not only the public face of SBS’s The World News but a fine professional journalist in her own right.
Nine news reports from the mainstream metropolitan printed media were short-listed. These ranged in content from reports of the Muslim community, in the suburbs of Sydney and elsewhere—and its largely successful efforts to integrate into Australian society and to oppose terrorism—to analyses of Middle East politics and diplomacy affecting Palestinian self-determination, including one by Anthony Loewenstein in the Sydney Morning Herald entitled ‘Defiant Israel blind to what it has become’ and one by Tony Walker in the Financial Review entitled ‘Nice democracy plan, shame about the sponsor’.
Out of this selection, the panel presented the award to Ms Andra Jackson of the Age for an article on Aladdin Sisalem, a Palestinian asylum seeker, then the sole remaining resident of the temporary immigration detention centre on Manus Island. He had landed from a fishing boat on a Torres Strait island more than a year before, after leaving Kuwait two years earlier and travelling through South-East Asia.
I have no issue with Ms Jackson’s ability as a writer and a reporter. She writes well and describes her subject and her story graphically and comprehensively. I have great sympathy for Mr Sisalem, both for his people’s plight—which the world has either forgotten or would prefer to forget—and for his personal plight. I would, as every senator here would, help him to the best of my ability, consistent with Australia’s national interest. I simply find it difficult, and I expect it would be difficult for any open-minded and reasonably unbiased person, to see how an article about a failed asylum seeker—who could be of any cultural or religious background or any ethnicity, not just Arabic—has anything to do with the stated aims of the Australian Arabic Council. I find it difficult to understand how such a subject would better advance the understanding and sharing of the experience of Arabic Australians by their fellow Australians—the understanding that the AAC seeks—when other articles about Arabic and Muslim Australian communities or the perennial disaster of Palestinian displacement could be overlooked.
If the issue that the judging panel thought important and wanted to focus on was that of long-term settlement of refugees, particularly political and civil war displaced refugees, which certainly included the several millions of Palestinian people who had been denied settlement since 1949, then surely they should have considered some articles highlighting lives in refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan, Kenya or Pakistan. Or perhaps they could have focused on the continuing, though frustratingly slow, international efforts to improve the lives and futures of those refugees. While doing so, they could have acknowledged, perhaps, the excellent contribution Australia has made and continues to make through its offshore humanitarian resettlement program—which, by the way, the mandatory detention policy, introduced with commendable foresight by the Labor government in 1991, is intended to protect and has successfully protected this internationally acknowledged important component of this international effort.
On the second occasion when I ran out of time last week, my topic was the Waverley Softball Association and its Harmony Day program, which gave much needed community support to the Sudanese and Somali communities. These communities make commendable efforts through self-help in their desire for their families, who are still waiting in hope in crowded refugee camps in Africa, to join them.
For the past seven years the humanitarian resettlement program has provided 12,000 places each year for such refugees to come to Australia. This year, the government has increased it to 13,000 places. In the year 2001-02, there were 6,732 new arrivals under this program. A total of 1,598, about 24 per cent, were from Sudan and 552 were from the Horn of Africa countries—the region identified by the UNHCR as most in need of relief. In 2002-03, there were 9,569 arrivals—3,516, or nearly 37 per cent, from Sudan and the Horn of Africa. In 2003-04, there were 10,335 arrivals—5,503, or 53 per cent, from Sudan and the Horn of Africa. Why the increase? Because places in the program previously taken by onshore applicants have been freed up by the government’s careful and steadfast management of problems that the unauthorised arrival of asylum seekers had posed.
Last week 56 refugees from East Africa arrived in Australia, the first contingent of a group of 336 that Australia is taking at the request of the UNHCR, because they are in acute need of resettlement. There are 336 human stories to be told here, and I suspect none would make the grade. Ms Jackson, of course, has gone on to greater scoops in the regrettable story of Cornelia Rau—an important contribution, I acknowledge, to investigative journalism. But, again, it seems to me that she ignored the real issues that underlie the sad commentary of our society: our society’s apathy about and neglect of mental health. I take this chance to commend the member for Gilmore, Mrs Joanna Gash, who moved a private member’s bill in the other chamber today on the need for urgent community action on mental health.
Lest it be thought that I dislike Ms Jackson, nothing could be further from the truth. I had never met her before briefly congratulating her on her win at the AAC function, nor had I been conscious of her writings before. But, as I said previously, I think of her as a fine writer and obviously a very capable reporter. The problem is with the judging panel, which lost sight of the object of the award and the purpose of the organisation which hosted the award, not with Ms Jackson.
In fact, the real problem is not even the panel of judges but our media culture and the values of that culture which our AAC panel of experts presumably believed that they must adhere to. I read a few weeks that Hunter S Thompson—the so-called king of gonzo journalism—had died, his passing treated to some well-moderated lamentation. I understand Thompson’s school of gonzo journalism means commentary reporting that masks character assassination with sarcasm, the lowest form of wit. It seems to me that the media culture that Ms Jackson and the AAC panel of experts pay obeisance to is less harmful than that. It is more akin to the Spike Milligan ‘Never mind the quality, feel the width!’ school of journalism. How else could they have missed the mark of what makes a news story important?",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Arabic Council</title>,ADJOURNMENT,22,1,speech

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-03-14,"—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
Please note: responses to questions 2 (b) and (3) have been provided by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR).
No.
$286.4million. (b) Revenue collected through the Air Passenger Ticket Levy is paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund to meet the costs of the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett group employees (SEESA). DEWR advise that as at 27 January 2005 $380 million has been advanced to Ansett employees under SEESA.
