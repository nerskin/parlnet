"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—I was making some points about the proposal for a fit and proper test being placed in the legislation and addressing the amendment moved by Senator Conroy when we adjourned last night. The point I made was that I do not think there is any fundamental policy disagreement between the opposition and the government in relation to this issue at all. It is simply a matter of finding the best way of moving forward with a fit and proper test. Senator Conroy quoted in his address to the committee the fact that APRA were proceeding down this path, so he clearly understands the fact that they are involved in the Basle core principles of effective banking supervision process and are developing this. There is an expectation on behalf of the government that APRA will conclude the process they are undertaking and will, through a number of alternative mechanisms, which, as I understand it, are potentially a further strengthening of guidelines, potentially move for an amendment to legislation at a future time. We do not have accurate information on that at the moment, but they could well have a legislative option or a delegated legislative option. They could use regulations to do it. But there is no disagreement at all about the view that a fit and proper test is a desirable path to go down.
The question that the Senate and this committee now have to resolve is: do we do it based on the amendment that has been prepared and is being debated before us now? We do see some problems with the amendment. We are sure that it will not meet the requirements that APRA, through their process, will be aiming at. They are going for a thorough upgrading and implementation of a fit and proper test through potentially three different mechanisms. One of the problems with the amendment we have before us is that, for example, it does not create any rights of individual appeal. To bring in a test and then not have somewhere else in the legislation a right of appeal for those persons who may be subject to that test would clearly be against best principles. One other issue I should address is that the amendment does not extend to senior executives and other persons who are often captured in fit and proper provisions in overseas legislation. In other words, the legislative amendment that we are addressing today is not up to world's best practice. We are assured by APRA that the APRA process is working within the Basel core principles of effective banking supervision process, and we want to ensure that APRA's fit and proper test is ahead of world's best practice or is at least at world's best practice. I am sure the opposition would seek to support that. This legislative amendment would be below best international prac-tice if that were to be the form of the test.
I appeal to all honourable senators, in moving forward on the fit and proper test path, to leave it in what we all agree are the capable hands of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The ministers' offices have authorised me to say that this process has been on foot for some time. As Senator Conroy has made clear in his statement, they are very keen to pursue this. When that process has come to the stage where they have reached finality of it—and I do not think that will take very long—we can certainly ensure that APRA will provide to the relevant shadow spokespeople, the opposition or the Democrats, or both, a full briefing and access to any drafts of legislative amendments, guidelines or delegated legislation. I think that is the best process to proceed with. I think an amendment that does not cover all of the necessary approaches to developing a fit and proper test would be, at best, a halfway house that would potentially cut across the process that APRA are very diligently pursuing at the moment. I would therefore either urge the ALP to consider withdrawing the amendment or appeal to the Democrats to suggest that we should have faith in the experts and those charged with the responsibility for this area of regulation, rather than those of us here, to develop their fit and proper test processes. We certainly cannot consider ourselves experts in this area. ",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-11-01,"—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendment, for many of the reasons that were spelt out yesterday evening by Senator Conroy. I note the comments of Senator Campbell, and the difficulty of course is trying to consider something in the absence of a possible future briefing. The only thing that we can do at the moment is to work on what is before us, and that is the amendment being put forward by the opposition. The point that needs to be made in all this is that, whilst there is the promise down the track of trying to deal with an appropriate fit and proper test, at this stage we would be seeking to look at the merit of the amendment put forward. 
I need to make a few comments on the issue. From our perspective, the point that needs to be made is that banks are essentially entrusted with large sums of money that are held by the community, and the strict legal relationship between a banker and a customer is a contractual one rather than one of a trustee and beneficiary as in the case of superannuation funds. So we would be supporting the amendment in the absence of appropriate arrangements being put in place, acknowledging that this essentially attempts to bring it into line with what already exists in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. For that reason, and in the absence of any briefing from the government, we will be supporting the opposition's amendment.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—Firstly, this is not filling any void. A set of guidelines is already used. In fact, my advice is that the acceptance of this amendment could potentially undermine the existing regime. APRA are actually in the process of improving the regime. As I have said, this test is without any doubt below world's best practice. It fails to meet the Basel core principles, so it would be a diminution of the regime that APRA are trying to put in place. What we would effectively be saying by doing this is that we do not trust what APRA are doing, that we do not trust the regulator and that we know better. I personally will be voting against it on the basis that I would regard that as an incredibly arrogant point of view. I do not believe that I know better than APRA in relation to this. 
The guidelines are already in place and they are going through a productive process. The impact of this passing the Senate in this form will be that the government will not allow that to take place. We will not allow the existing guidelines on fit and proper tests to be undermined. Far be it from me to predict what will happen in the House of Representatives, but I can suggest that the government will not accept this. It is certainly a weakening of the existing standards, it is cutting across APRA's diligent processes and the effect will be a further delay to putting in place increasing protections, particularly for the consumers of the financial products that are at the core of this bill.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-11-01,"—Could I make a couple of points and then seek some clarification from the parliamentary secretary. I am disappointed that you are bagging the amendment as not best practice, because the amendment is the exact, word for word copy of your own SI(S) Act amendment. If you are so happy with the amendment for the SI(S) Act, how can it be such a poor amendment for the Banking Act? I would be interested in you taking us through why, in terms of the SI(S) Act, it is an actual world's best practice but, in terms of banking, it is not. I am interested in your point on appeal. Could you point to the legislation to show us where the right of appeal for superannuation trustees is? I would happily accept a further amendment to lift the same words again out of the SI(S) Act and put them into this Banking Act. So I would happily keep that level if you could show us where that measure is within the SI(S) Act. 
In terms of your point about a process that exists at the moment, I have now questioned APRA on three separate occasions about the fit and proper persons test and, unfortunately, APRA really have not been able to clarify any procedures other than to continue to repeat that they currently apply an informal process. Senator Ridgeway has made the point that, in the absence of an alternative on the table, we should support this amendment. If, as you are saying, APRA believe a higher standard should be applied, I am sure we would welcome that and I am sure we would welcome an amendment to strengthen the fit and proper persons test whenever it is that APRA get around to it. But there have been 4½ years of your government. APRA suddenly decided they needed a range of changes in the SI(S) Act and we are just keen to ensure that the quality is maintained across the industry in financial services. If it is an amendment that is good enough for SIS trustees, it should be good enough for bank directors and owners. The current, informal process I do not consider to be satisfactory. I await the parliamentary secretary's response on a couple of those points.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—They are actually core issues, so this is what we should get right to. The real nub of it is that the superannuation structure where you effectively have a trustee who is the key party—the fit and proper test applies under that legislation—is a very different structure to that of a bank. We want the fit and proper test to move down through a range of other officers who should have that test applied to them. The amendment to the SI(S) Act that you have extracted and copied into the Banking Act effectively takes a level of supervision, a level of application of a fit and proper test, that appropriately applies within that legislation and to those people and then moves it into the banking sector.
The whole process being undertaken by APRA, which I described earlier, is to ensure that the fit and proper test currently being applied is upgraded to ensure that it complies with world's best practice, which most people in the sector would agree is embodied in the Basel core principles affecting banking supervision. How do you pronounce that? Is it `Barsel' or `Basil', as in Fawlty Towers? The key point I would seek to make in response to the honourable senator's question is that we know there is a significant difference in the structure of the organisations you are seeking to regulate, within a bank or within a superannuation superstructure, and the process APRA is currently going through is to ensure that the standards that apply under the fit and proper test are in line with the Basel core principles, which do not need to apply under SIS because they are fundamentally different organisations. Secondly, I can assure the honourable senator that, under the SIS amendment, there are appeal rights in this legislation—I am advised of that—whereas the opposition's amendment does not transfer those across into the Banking Act, so there is a fundamental failure there. That is all I need to say at this stage in response to the senator's questions.
 (Senator McKiernan)—I am not an expert on pronunciation, but I think the correct pronunciation is `Barle'.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I will defer to your call on it, but I am with Senator Campbell, actually. Senator, could you supply me with the reference for that appeal mechanism in SIS? I am happy for the advisers to keep flicking through the pages and then pass the information on. I am perplexed by the question of it being a poor test because of the structure of the organisation. The whole thrust of the financial sector reform that we have been undertaking and that we are undertaking in CLERP 6 is to try to put a standard in place irrespective of structure and product. The thrust of financial sector reform is to simplify it so there is one test that applies across the board. The fact that the structure in a bank is different from that in a superannuation fund should make no difference to what the test is. The core issue here is the quality of the test. If the quality of the test is good enough for SIS—and I believe it is a rigorous test; that is why we are supporting it—then the same rigour and quality can be applied to banking executives and banking shareholdings. It is a bit of a furphy to argue that, simply because a bank has a different structure, this should be ruled out. I accept there is an appeal process in SIS—hopefully, you have some information for us on that now. I am happy to lift the appeals process out of your SIS legislation and put it as a further amendment—or, hopefully, you will. It is a furphy to argue that banks have a different structure. The core principle here is the quality of the test. I took your argument to mean that there are not enough people captured by this. I am sure we would welcome having this extended when that APRA work is completed, and we look forward to you bringing that forward. 
In the meantime, the current situation is unsatisfactory. On three occasions, APRA was unable to define for a parliamentary committee the process they undertake and what the test is, other than to repeat that there is an informal test. Unfortunately, there are some controversial applications in the pipeline at the moment and people have a legitimate concern about how this test is going to be applied, who is applying it and how it is going to be signed off. Ron Walker is always a controversial character, particularly if you are from Melbourne, so we are concerned to ensure that proper process is followed, not some undefined airy-fairy informal process that APRA—chief executives and others—has been unable to explain to Senate estimates committees and other parliamentary committees at any stage. The structure argument is a furphy. If there is an appeal process I am happy to incorporate it. If you think this is limited because it does not go far enough in terms of whom it will examine, I will accept a further amendment or undertake to support the legislation when APRA has completed its process.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—The first question Senator Conroy raises concerns the appeals process, and I refer him to item 5 of schedule 3. That makes the disqualification under the fit and proper test in the SI(S) Act, I presume, a reviewable decision. There is no difference between the opposition and the government in policy and approach in relation to building on the fit and proper guidelines. Our advice is that APRA are pursuing this. They want to bring the fit and proper test up to the Basel standards. It is pronounced `Basil', I am told. `Barle' is the French. There is another pronunciation for the Germans, but the Aussies have decided to pronounce it `Basil'. If that is what the Aussies want; that is what they get—`Basil, Basil, Basil; oi, oi, oi.' The other thing I temporarily forgot to mention is important and should appeal to the Democrats, and that is that APRA, in the development of their test, intend to seek industry views. 
We were first given notice of this amendment by the Labor Party less than 24 hours from when the debate began. We have not had a chance to discuss it with the Democrats, I understand, or with the Labor Party. We sought amendments, as Senator Conroy knows, in the chamber. I said to Senator Conroy, `This debate's coming on. Have you got any amendments?' He said, `Yes, we'll get them to you.' We got them a few hours later—I thank the Labor Party for that cooperation—and that was the first time that we were aware of this amendment. It has not had any industry consultation whatsoever. We had, I think, a very vigorous debate about consultation on the bill as a whole in the second reading stage, yet this quite crucial issue of bringing in a legislative fit and proper person test, which landed on the laps of a few senators a day or so ago, is going to cut across APRA's existing process which is going to involve industry consultation. In fact, Senator Conroy and Senator Sherry, if I recall correctly, commended APRA for their role in consultation but cast aspersions on the consultative nature of my colleagues the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation and the Assistant Treasurer and the lengths to which they go to consult on these matters. I think if you want a process that allows industry to look at the fit and proper test and what APRA come up with through their process, it is appropriate you do that. 
I do not like to hark back to history but, when I set about the process of reforming the Corporations Law, we went through a process of, I think, four rounds of consultation right around Australia on every single change we made to that law, allowing continuous feedback. We engaged the opposition in that process and we engaged the Australian Democrats in that process so, when that legislation finally came to this place, there was a very clear understanding of all the changes that took place. This change landed in this place in the last 36 hours and, all of a sudden, the Labor Party and the Democrats say, `Oh, that's a good idea. We don't need to discuss that with industry. They don't need to be consulted. We can ignore the views of APRA. We know best.' It is not a sensible way to go about bringing in a new piece of legislation which will affect an entire industry. It shows a total lack of faith in the government. It has got nothing to do with the government. You cannot say, `We don't trust the government.' What you are actually saying is: `We do not trust APRA to develop this process and consult with industry.' I have said in good faith that the government will ensure we will not just leave it to APRA; we want to ensure that the Democrats and Labor, as part of that consultation, can be briefed on the outcome of APRA's process.
I can do no more than that. I just make it clear that it is inappropriate for industry not to have their views sought on these changes. It is inappropriate to bring in this sort of amendment with incredibly short notice and it is bad policy. I have put the arguments. I do not intend to continue the debate; I am just saying that the government will not accept it. It will simply delay the implementation of this regime. I do not think there is anything further that I can add.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-11-01,"—I think it might be Basel—and I think it is in Switzerland, by the way! But, separate to that, I note the comments by Senator Ian Campbell. The only thing that I would say is that I understand the issues in relation to the industry and their views needing to be sought. The point from our perspective—and it is something that was spelt out in the second reading debate—is very much about the question of the public interest being dealt with, particularly in looking at the fit and proper test as it relates to people that will be responsible for large sums of the public's money. And it essentially comes down to that rather than it being a question of the appropriateness of there being a test at all. So, without suggesting how this might be facilitated, I think that as part of the process there is time for the government to speak to the opposition. If they are able to work that out in terms of the issues being raised by the government and if there is an agreement on policy issues, then surely there is a way to resolve it. From our perspective, we would support something that is currently on the table in the absence of any other thing being put forward, acknowledging what Senator Ian Campbell is saying on behalf of the government. But I think, quite frankly, it comes down to the government and the opposition needing to work out the details of what the amendment ought to look like. We would support an outcome where there is concurrence between the two groups.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-11-01,"—With regard to this matter of a fit and a proper test and whether banks are doing the right thing et cetera, last evening I raised a matter in here with regard to the Commonwealth Bank and its treatment of some customers, and I think it is a very good example of why APRA should have some powers to ensure that banks do the right thing. On this occasion, I have to say, it seems that banks might have some heart—albeit only as small as a pea—at this point in time. But it would appear that they may well do. Last night I raised an issue in respect of the treatment of customers of the Colonial Trust Bank and the Colonial State Bank, particularly aged and war veteran pensioners, who were not receiving the same treatment as existing Commonwealth Bank customers. I made that contribution and, before I got back to my office, the Commonwealth Bank actually rang my office, rather annoyed at the comments I had made. They had promised me over seven days ago that I would have a letter in response to the matters I raised with them in writing. I have today received a letter from the Commonwealth Bank, and I would like to read the letter to the Senate. It says: 
Dear Senator Murphy,
I am writing in response to your correspondence to the Managing Director, Mr David Murray, of 27 September 2000 regarding the Commonwealth Bank's special rebates offered to aged or war veteran pensioners. Mr Murray has asked that I respond on his behalf.
I am pleased to inform you that former Colonial Bank and Trust Bank aged pensioner and war veteran customers who continue to bank with Commonwealth Bank will be eligible for this rebate so long as they were a customer of Colonial or Trust Bank before 31 October 1997. This mirrors our approach to pre-merger Commonwealth Bank customers.
The decision to extend this concession has been taken by the Commonwealth Bank to demonstrate our commitment to provide customers with the benefits of a broader product range and enhanced services as a result of the merger with Colonial. Eligible Colonial and Trust Bank customers will receive this concession when the necessary integration of products and information is complete. This will occur during 2001. In the meantime, the existing Colonial arrangements remain unchanged. I trust this addresses your concerns.
Of course, I am very appreciative of the fact that the Commonwealth Bank has had at least some heart in respect of particular customers. But I would encourage the Commonwealth Bank, in the interests of providing enhanced services and a broader product range and a commitment to customer service, to treat all pensioners the same. Whether they were a customer of the Commonwealth Bank or of the Colonial or Trust Bank as at 31 October 1997 or not, they should provide the same benefits to all customers, and I hope that this legislation will go some way towards ensuring such an outcome. In fact, it might be better if the banks gave greater consideration to these things, given the time that it took them to deal with this matter. I would hope that they take a similar time when they are dealing with their executive salaries and share options. It seems that it takes them little time to make those decisions. So I would hope that the government will consider what is proposed to them by way of amendment very seriously, because we do need to take some steps to ensure a better outcome for the banking customers of this country.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-11-01,—I would like to congratulate Senator Murphy on his outcome there. Well done. I apologise for delaying the chamber; I am happy to put this to the vote shortly. What is the appeal mechanism under the current informal process? Is there an appeal mechanism in the act at the moment for the current process?,SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—The process at the moment—as we have all agreed—is informal, so it is done via submissions and through seeking other people's views on it. Obviously, if you are not happy with the way it is going, you can make further submissions. The thing is, if you have a legislative requirement you have got to have an appeals mechanism. At the moment there is not a legislative requirement, there is not a formal test, so you do not need a formal appeals process. What you are doing here is effectively putting in place a formal test, then not creating any appeal process. That is the downfall of it.
Can I just respond briefly to Senator Ridgeway's point: with the lack of any other test lying around we had better grab this one and put it in—to paraphrase, probably unfairly—so we really care about the consumers. If you want to care about consumers you build a prudential regulatory regime that is the best in the world. This government has worked very assiduously for the last four years to build that regime. We are now internationally recognised and, very importantly, recognised as leaders in our region. That is one of the reasons why Australia has been so successful when many countries in our region over the past few years have had financial difficulties and why we were pretty well protected by what is called a firewall from the contagion that spread throughout Asia through the financial crisis in our region, because of both the fiscal policies and the regulatory reforms put in place. 
This government went through detailed processes in designing a new financial system for a new millennium. We went through a detailed consultative process with both the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, which of course was one of the pre-eminent programs of this government, and the financial sector reforms both through the Wallis committee and its implementation and through consultation on draft legislation. We did not adopt a process where we came into the pre-eminent legislative chamber of the land and brought in last-minute proposals and said, `This is the best we can do at the moment. Go and try to work it out and try to improve it later, but this is the best we've got at the moment.'
I have said to all honourable senators that, in the short time we have had available to look at the amendment, we have found two fundamental faults with it. Firstly, there is no appeals mechanism, and I would have thought that to put in place a test and then say there is no right of appeal would absolutely insult the principles of the Australian Democrats. I am accused of knowing Democrat policies more than I should around this place from time to time, because of past allegiances with that great Western Australian, Jack Evans. But I can say that this is not allowing the community to consult on a measure that affects the savings of virtually every Australian—every Australian with a bank account. Here we are looking at bringing in something with effectively no notice—that has not been consulted on by anybody. We found that, firstly, it does not come up to the Basel core principles; secondly, it does not have a right of appeal in it; and, thirdly, it does not apply to all of the officers that you would want a fit and proper test to apply to.
So it is actually a lower test than that which applies at the moment but we are saying, `Because its the only thing around, because its the only bit of paper that has been lodged—effectively a few minutes before the debate commenced—its okay.' The Democrats say, `Oh, we're doing that because we want to protect consumers.' Do not kid yourself. Firstly, the amendment does not add to consumer protection—and there is a risk that it detracts from it—and, secondly, it will cause a delay in the process of this legislation, without any doubt. I am informed there is a backlog of 300 cases at the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. We want to upgrade the penalties. We want to upgrade the resources of that. We want to make sure that those consumers get the protection they need. 
This is well intentioned, and I have been very open about that. There is no doubt about the intention. The Labor Party is incredibly well intentioned. They have tried their best to come up with an amendment to solve a defect that we agree on, but what we are saying is that there is a better way to go, and it should involve consultation, and it should involve a well thought out amendment. But this is not the place to do it. I appeal to the Democrats: please listen to reason, please listen to logic on this.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I came in a little late on the debate in relation to the amendment but, as I understand it—and forgive me if I do not articulate this as cogently as Senator Conroy—the fit and proper test is the test that is sought to be placed in the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. The answer back from you, Senator Ian Campbell, as I understand it, is that there is a test but no appeal mechanism—at least in the amendment that has been put forward. But the question then is: is there a test or an appeal mechanism in the parent legislation which would then allow either a merits or a law review of the matter? In other words, would you have an appeal mechanism in merits by the AAT or, alternatively, an ADJR process for a matter of law? In relation to the appeal mechanism, are you going to a merits review or a law review? If you are going to a law review, is the relevant banking legislation subject to the ADJR? It would of course still be caught by section 39 of the Judiciary Act anyway for a law review. Is that the direction you are talking about when you say there is no appeal mechanism, because there may be in any event an appeal mechanism that can be proceeded with? I am just wondering if you would clarify that. ",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—I have already described the process that exists at the moment—it is an informal process. We are saying that we are actually amending the parent act here. What you are seeking to do, what your side of politics is seeking to do, is put a formal legal test in place and then, within that bill, not have any appeals mechanism. Quite frankly we have had the debate. Coming from the WA Liberal Party I recognise where the numbers lie, and I am not going to delay the process any further. I am happy to go down with dignity on this and allow the House of Representatives to deal with it.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-11-01,"—I have just one final comment on this—this will also be my last words on it. I think what is at the heart of the matter—and we seem to keep going over the issue—is that there is agreement on the policy. That is not in question. Some deficiencies have been identified, including one that Senator Ian Campbell describes as being fundamental—although I would not necessarily view it in that way given that the amendment, I am advised, does not derogate from what it is that APRA is doing. If, at the end of the day, there is agreement from the point of view of what the policy position ought to be and there is an identification of what are some of the deficiencies—that discussion has gone on in the chamber, and I think the opposition have noted that—surely there must be some reasonableness in being able to deal with those deficiencies in such a way that this issue can be resolved.
I understand the comments in relation to consultation, but consultation of itself is not necessarily an issue that ought to take precedence over something that has already been set in relation to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. I think the point is that consultation would be fine if we were talking about creating something completely new, but we are not. We are talking about trying to bring something into place on its merits. So at the end of the day I do not think there is any disagreement on policy views on the issue. It is clearly a case of, as has already been done, identifying what those deficiencies are and fixing them.
I think the opportunity is there for the government to do something about that. Certainly, from the Democrat perspective, consultation is something that we always look forward to, but legislation or appropriate policy cannot be put off purely because there has to be consultation on everything. Otherwise we would never get anything done—we would spend all of our time consulting. So the reality is that it has to stop here. From my perspective, I think we all agree, and we are just trimming around the edges of what works and what does not. I hope that some sense comes out of all of this because it seems to be a simple and fixable issue.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—I would actually ask Senator Ludwig to indicate if he would be content in considering the ADJR as a full and desirable appeal process for someone who feels aggrieved by a decision under this test or whether in fact it could best be described as a less than full appeal process for someone who is aggrieved under this process. I would commend all senators to indicate if they believe that relying on the ADJR is an appropriate appeal process. I would love to be a fly on the wall when the Australian Democrats have to review this decision in their party room because what they have effectively said is, `We agree on the policy.' But the detail is in doubt. They have not discussed it with the government. They have not sought a briefing on it—they have not sought any briefing from APRA. So they have come in here without the full facts, but because it is the only thing on the table they think it looks good and they are going to vote for it, even though the detail is, by their own admission, not up to scratch. 
They have appealed to the Labor Party to come and try to sort it with us, so what we have to do is to go behind the screen with some advisers and quickly map out a fit and proper person test, even though APRA are doing this at the moment. The Democrats have to do that. I ask Senator Ludwig to say on his own behalf: does he say that the ADJR is there for a full and appropriate review and that he will be totally satisfied that, under the process that they are putting in place in this law, the appeal rights of a citizen who feels aggrieved are therefore all that they should expect in this great democracy because the ADJR is there, or should there be proper appeal rights across all the processes that are set down in this amendment that he is about to support?",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-11-01,"—Senator Campbell may be mistaken in the sense that I came to assist the chamber in discovering what appeal mechanisms were in existence for the banking industry. We have, as I understand it, now discovered that there is at least one, which is the ADJR procedure. However that is not to lessen the debate; it is merely to inform the house that there is at least a test and that other tests, such as the AAT, appear not to be a part of the banking industry. That is a matter for government to decide, just as the government has decided that there is not a test in relation to the extradition of people and that there are no review or appeal mechanisms in that area and just as the government decided under section 417 of the Migration Act that there is no review process. That is a matter for the government.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—I suggest to Senator Ludwig, if he wants to be consistent, which I would never accuse him of being, that, if he thinks that we should just rely on the ADJR and the Banking Act, then we should take out of the SI(S) Act item 5, schedule 3, which I described earlier and which ensures that those decisions be reviewable. In other words, we just rely on the ADJR across the whole thing. When we come to debating that, let us see the Ludwig amendment which takes out the reviewability of those decisions. Let us see some consistency. We have had the debate; we have a half-baked measure that is about to get supported here. It is going to undermine the regulatory regime of the Banking Act, but the Democrats are happy to support that and to put consumers at risk.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-11-01,"—Unless Senator Ridgeway wants to weigh in again, hopefully we can move on. I will just take up the sentiment of Senator Ridgeway's offer. We stand ready to introduce a review mechanism. We are happy to incorporate the same review mechanism as exists under the SI(S) Act. We are happy to draft that up in consultation with you in the next half an hour while the rest of the debate goes on. If that is your concern, Senator Campbell, we stand ready to respond to it. It is disappointing that you are trying to run such a scare campaign now; there is no current review mechanism other than the one outlined by Senator Ludwig. So there is no change on the existing situation, but we stand ready to work with the government and the Democrats to introduce a review mechanism if that satisfies you. You talked about the structure earlier; you have dropped that off—it is a furphy. But we stand ready to be consistent, as you have challenged us to be, with the government to support a further amendment that will in actual fact introduce that review mechanism. We are quite happy to do that in the spirit of the suggestion by Senator Ridgeway and the Democrats. ",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—Clearly, you can put in a review mechanism, even though Senator Ludwig does not think we need one because he does not care about consumer rights. Secondly, I have also said that this amendment does not apply to all the relevant people within the banking institutions. You say that there is no difference between the superannuation trustee and a banking organisation. Can I suggest, Senator Conroy—
—I did not say that at all.
—You are saying that it is a furphy to say that there should be a difference between a fit and proper person test for a superannuation trustee and a fit and proper person test for a bank. It is not a furphy. Anyone who has any understanding of the financial services sector in Australia knows that there is a significant difference, but no-one in the financial services sector has ever accused Senator Conroy of having an understanding of the fundamentals of that system. You also need to design an amendment that then seeks to cover—and this is one of the crucial matters—firstly, the appeals mechanism and, secondly, how you ensure that the test covers all of the appropriate officers within a banking institution. So you need to design an amendment there. That is what actually APRA is trying to do at the moment. What we are saying is that we could adjourn the debate for half an hour, get a couple of advisers from our side, your side and the Democrats, sit around and not go off and consult with consumers to make sure that it is appropriate for them—and you have a range of important consumer organisations in the financial sector who do an extraordinarily good job in Australia! So you are saying, `Let's not consult with the customers of the Commonwealth Bank or the Trust Bank or anyone else. Let's ignore all of those shareholder and consumer organisations. Let's sit around the hallowed halls of the Senate, within our ivory tower, and design a fit and proper person test that will work'! I say there is a better way to do it and that is the one that we will support.
Amendment agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-11-01,"—I move amendment No. 1 on sheet 1957 revised:
	Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 3), after item 16A, insert:
16B After subsection 63(2)
Insert:
	(2A)	The Treasurer must not make a decision whether to consent to an ADI entering into an arrangement or agreement, or effecting a reconstruction (the proposal), unless the Treasurer has first:
	(a)	caused for public submissions on the proposal to be called for through a process of national advertising; and
	(b)	given the public a reasonable period in which to make submissions on the proposal.
16C After subsection 63(3)
Insert:
	(3A)	In making a decision whether to consent to an arrangement, agreement or reconstruction, the Treasurer must take the national interest into account.
	(3B)	The Treasurer must cause copies of any submissions received under subsection (2A) in relation to the proposal to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after making a decision whether to consent to an arrangement, agreement or reconstruction.
This amendment deals with a couple of issues relating to the Treasurer's approval of a bank merger, acquisition or reconstruction. The first thing it seeks to do is to require the Treasurer to call for public submissions on the proposal and to give the public a reasonable period of time in which to make any submissions about any proposals that come before him. This is an issue that was raised before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee during its inquiry into this bill, and the government members of the committee concluded that the bill did not contain provisions making it mandatory to consult stakeholders regarding mergers. Whilst the government members did not feel able to recommend that the bill be amended to provide for that issue as it was identified, they did make the following comment: 
The claimed deficiencies in the current Bill are in the nature of requests for additional legislation and therefore the Committee considers that the current Bill should proceed with the proviso that the Senate's attention is drawn to the requests for further legislation in relation to mergers and demutualisations.
The ACA and the Finance Sector Union were possibly the leading proponents of trying to establish a process of consultation. The Democrats would have liked a more comprehensive process involving the invitation of submissions, public hearings and the publication of a report. However, we can also see that there are practical difficulties with a process that may take a long time. In discussion with the opposition, it was also made clear that they would be less inclined to support such an extensive process. Obviously, our views were not going to get the support desired. Consequently, we acknowledged the political and practical realities and have arrived at the amendment that is currently before the Senate.
The second thing which this amendment does is to impose a requirement on the Treasurer to consider the national interest when deciding whether to consent to an arrangement or reconstruction. The government members of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee also noted that the bill did not contain provisions for criteria against which the Treasurer or the Treasurer's delegate could evaluate mergers and demutualisations before giving any approval. The Democrats would have liked to move an amendment which would prescribe specific criteria. We do not feel in a position to do that without there first being a process of consultation on that issue to determine precisely what the criteria should be and how they should be expressed. At this stage, we are proposing to simply insert a requirement that the Treasurer consider the national interest in making his decision. We would envisage at some time in the future amending the provision to prescribe a number of specific factors. The sorts of factors that we would consider relevant at the time would be the employment effects, social effects and the ability of communities to access banking services. In conclusion, I commend the amendment to the committee.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-11-01,"—Let me start by welcoming and congratulating the Democrats on this amendment. Labor has been working closely with the Democrats to produce this amendment and we are happy to support it. This amendment seeks to do two things. It seeks to introduce a consultation process for banking mergers, and it seeks to harmonise the existing national interest test which is contained in the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act into the Banking Act 1959. Let me start by discussing the issue of consultation. Consumer groups have expressed concern that, under the current process of approving a merger, there is little consultation about the impact of a banking merger on the provision of banking services. When the Commonwealth Bank merged with Colonial, the Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre expressed concerns that the ACCC did not consult consumer groups in Tasmania, despite the fact that the merger had major competition implications for Tasmanian consumers. Chris Connolly, the director of the centre at the time, said:
The ACCC has been negotiating behind closed doors with the two banks. The banks have had top level access to ACCC staff and the Commissioner. Contrast this with the fact that the ACCC did not write to a single Tasmanian consumer or community organisation. They held no public hearings in Tasmania and the only consumer group they visited was the Australian Consumers' Association in Sydney.
Louise Petschler, from the Consumers Association, has also stated that she was concerned that the voice of consumers was not being heard. She stated to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill:
...we are not at the point now where we need to worry about the fact that someone should have a bigger voice than someone else. Our concern is that we do not get the opportunity to put that voice forward at the stage where mergers are being approved. 
In respect of the ACCC, it must be said that the lack of consultation on banking mergers is not because there are insufficient powers under the Trade Practices Act 1974. If the ACCC believes that a merger would have an unacceptable impact on competition, the ACCC has the power to hold a public inquiry and ultimately reject the merger. However, in recent banking mergers where there has been concern that the merger would have an impact on competition, the ACCC has accepted enforceable undertakings under the Trade Practices Act. The acceptance of enforceable undertakings has satisfied the ACCC that the impact on competition will be mitigated, and hence a public inquiry has not been required. In effect, the use of enforceable undertakings means that formal consultation is not obligatory. 
The ACCC accepted enforceable undertakings when Westpac merged with the Bank of Melbourne in 1997. The undertaking period has now expired, and it is appropriate that we assess whether the ACCC's undertakings have been successful in maintaining competition. The disappointing conclusion that many consumers have drawn is that we have lost a vigorous competitor in Melbourne and Victoria and, although the Bank of Melbourne branding has been retained, it will be difficult to argue that the Bank of Melbourne is still the bank that cuts the costs of banking. As a recent example, Westpac announced on Friday, 20 October that it would increase the fee on over-the-counter transactions from $2 to $2.50 and that this fee increase would apply to all Bank of Melbourne customers. Not much of an effort at cutting the cost of banking. 
I think it is important that, if there are further bank mergers, the ACCC does improve its consultation processes, but I also think this bill provides an opportunity to introduce a consultation process for the Treasurer, who is ultimately responsible for making a decision as to whether to approve a banking merger or not. The Democrats' amend-ment proposes that the Treasurer call for public submissions on a bank merger and allow a reasonable period for submissions to be received. These submissions will then be tabled in parliament. This amendment will mean that all interested parties have the opportunity to present their views to the Treasurer before a decision to approve a bank merger is made. The amendment acknowledges that banking mergers can have significant impacts on the provision of banking services and that, given the importance of banking to our community, the community has a right to present its views.
The second aspect of the Democrats' amendment is to require the Treasurer to consider the national interest when making a decision to consent to a merger or reconstruction. The government have stated that this bill provides an opportunity to harmonise provisions in the Banking Act, yet the government have for some reason chosen not to harmonise the existing national interest test, which is contained in the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act. The Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act does not define what the national interest is. However, Treasury have advised that there are a number of common facts that are usually considered. Mr Steven French, General Manager of the Financial Institutions Division of Treasury, told the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on 4 August that the issues that Treasury normally considers include prudential considerations, competition policy issues and other issues relevant to the national interest—for example, employment effects, regional effects, benefits to consumers and industry groups of greater efficiencies and productivity, and benefits in creating stronger institutions or greater diversity of product lines. 
There is no doubt that there is a need for further debate as to the issues that the Treasurer should consider in assessing the national interest when consenting to the merger or reconstruction of an ADI. At the heart of the issue is the need to define what the social obligations of Australian banks are. While the government were quick to agree that banks have social obligations, they are slow to define what they are. The Australian Consumers Association stated at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry that they were not in a position to be able to adequately define what should go into a public interest test nor what community obligations the Treasurer should consider when consenting to the merger of an ADI. They stated to the inquiry:  
What we would like is an actual debate with the government, with the regulators and with the banking sector around what would be viable universal service obligations and how they would look. 
In our minority report to the committee's inquiry, Labor senators agreed with the Consumers Association that there is a need for a public debate on how a public interest should be defined. We stated that the Treasurer should immediately establish a forum to bring consumer groups, trade unions, pensioner groups and other stakeholders together with banking industry representatives to discuss the issues that the Treasurer would and could consider when consenting to a merger of an ADI. While Labor is not proposing to define the national interest in this amendment, the Treasurer should establish a process to bring stakeholders together to discuss the issues that should be considered when consenting to a merger of an ADI. Labor supports the amendments to the bill proposed by the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—I understand Senator Kemp addressed this amendment in my absence briefly yesterday. I want to make two points. Firstly, as Senator Conroy has pointed out in his contribution he just read, there is already a lot of consultation involved in the process. For the reasons Senator Kemp outlined yesterday, we believe that making it a legislative requirement has a number of negative impacts. I guess it is thus in physics and politics that every move you make has an upside and a downside. We believe that there are a number of significant downsides in regard to this. I am not sure whether Senator Kemp mentioned any, but one of them is where you have cases of distress. Where a merger is required and the interests of depositors could be jeopardised by having to go through this sort of formal process, all of us would want the Treasurer to be able to make an immediate decision. There were examples of that throughout the 1980s and more recently in different parts of the country. 
Secondly—and this is a very important point—Senator Conroy has described the processes that took place through the ACCC and a range of other consultations that took place in relation to a recent merger involving the Commonwealth Bank and even Westpac, but he did not talk about the history of what took place when the Labor Party were in power. They always forget what they did with the Commonwealth Bank after campaigning in a federal election—I think it was the 1987 election—to not privatise the Commonwealth Bank. I remember standing at a rally in front of the General Post Office in Forrest Place in Perth where there were a whole range of employees of the Commonwealth Bank picketing and placarding the then leader of the party—I think it was Andrew Peacock in those days—and vowing to stop the Liberals from selling the Commonwealth Bank. Of course within literally weeks of the election Mr Keating sold the Commonwealth Bank. 
The closest relationship to this debate, Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, as you will recall well from the time, is that the Labor Party are now supporting a Democrat amendment in relation to consultation on mergers. The Labor Party have commended the Democrats and they have said they worked with the Democrats on this. But I remind all honourable senators of that infamous merger that took place between two of the great Labor icons of the eighties and nineties—the Keating and Kirner icons of the Labor Party—when they negotiated the merger that Senator Conroy and his Victorian Labor comrades want to forget: that is, the merger of the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria. I remember them giving all sorts of guarantees about service and bank branches and so forth. I asked my advisers: what consultation took place in relation to the merger of the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria? Did they consult with a consumer or any consumers? Not one. Did they consult with a consumer organisation? No, not one. Did they consult with the union? No. Did they consult with anyone? No. Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner did the deal and implemented it virtually within 24 hours.  
This is the gross hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party in relation to banking policy generally. This is the gross hypocrisy of a populist opposition with no policy, and in Victoria where Labor govern that state, or pretend to, their policy is similar to that of Mr Beazley: do not have a policy; just have a review. I think at last count they had reviews, roundtables and committees numbering in excess of 80, and Mr Beazley's policies are very similar. When it comes to native title or tax or anything else, the answer every time is: let's have a review. We oppose this amendment for very good reasons. When the vote is taken you will see members of the Victorian division of the Labor Party voting for a legislative requirement for consultation within only a few short years of when the Victorian Labor Party's great icon, that fantastic fiscal manager—quite frankly, that disgrace to Australian politics—Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating, that failed Treasurer, that failed Prime Minister, merged two great institutions, which involved no consultation and no discussion by anybody. The hypocrisy is breathtaking.

Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I welcome you to the chamber. You might have noted that we invited you to join us in a more formal sense yesterday and we were very disappointed when you did not make a contribution.
 (Sena-tor Lightfoot)—Perhaps you could make a contribution to the consideration of this amendment, Senator Conroy.
—I think your adjournment speech last night is very relevant to these amendments—although I was disappointed that you did not reiterate your call to jail bank directors. I am concerned that you may be getting a little heat and pressure—but I am sure that you would not let that influence you. Moving to the amendment more directly—
—I think that is a good idea, Senator Conroy.
—You have made a number of very valuable contributions to the philosophical debate, but I turn now to the specific wording of the amendment. The bill proposes changes to the Reserve Bank Act 1959 that will have the effect of inserting a new definition of `staff members of the Reserve Bank service' to replace various definitions of `officer'; amending provisions in relation to the appointment of staff that allow the bank to appoint such staff as the bank considers necessary for the performance of its functions on terms and conditions of employment to be determined by the bank; and deleting section 71, which currently allows the bank to lend to staff for the purpose of housing.
In consultations in respect of this bill, Treasury officials confirmed that existing terms and conditions of employment for RBA staff, including access to housing loans, will not be affected by the proposed amendments. However, in order to safeguard the employment conditions of Reserve Bank employees, Labor is proposing to amend the bill to prevent the undermining of existing conditions of employment within the Reserve Bank. Labor is proposing an amendment to ensure that the terms and conditions of employment, including as to remuneration, are determined by the bank, provided that such terms and conditions shall be no less favourable than those that may exist in terms of any certified agreement applicable to this group of employees.
—The question is that the amendment be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—That is indeed the question, and the government's answer to that question is: no, we do not agree to the amendment. We think it is an inappropriate amendment to the Reserve Bank Act. This is clearly an industrial relations issue. I suspect that the motivation behind it is effectively the puppeteers of the Finance Sector Union pulling the strings of their comrades in parliament whom they preselect, endorse and put in this place. There is no reason for this amendment other than promoting the Labor Party's deep ideological commitment basically to having individuals controlled by trade unions and ensuring that employers and employees cannot deal with each other as informed individuals to work out what is best for the organisation and for the employees and to move forward without external third party intervention.  
As I said, this is clearly an ideological preoccupation of the Labor Party. It should take a leaf out of Tony Blair's book and try to reduce union domination of its political organisation and represent all Australians. That is what our great party, the Liberal Party of Australia, does: it represents all Australians and is not dominated by one sector of the Australian community. It is entirely inappropriate to interfere in the Reserve Bank's industrial relations and human relations activities through this act of parliament, and I appeal to the more sensible minds of the Australian Democrats to oppose what is an ALP ideological obsession.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-11-01,"—In answer to the question put by the government, the Australian Democrats will support this amendment. The reason is that it revises provisions dealing with appointments by the Reserve Bank. While acknowledging that the parliamentary secretary sees this amendment more in the context of IR, we believe the merit of the argument in this case is that the bank is currently empowered to appoint staff as it considers necessary and to determine the terms and conditions of those appointments. However, the ALP amendment will provide that future terms and conditions must not be less favourable than those that apply in any existing certified agreement that is applicable to any of the bank's employees. From that perspective and looking to the future, the Democrats are happy to support protection for future employees of the Reserve Bank and we will support the amendment.

Mr Temporary Chairman, I have been rereading your contribution from last night and I congratulate you on it. The bill proposes to introduce a new penalty regime into the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 altering many offence provisions from fault to strict liabilities. I have already discussed in my speech on the second reading the fact that the failure of the government to consult on this bill led to the superannuation industry's raising a number of concerns about the bill at a public inquiry in Sydney on 11 July. As a result of the concerns raised by the superannuation industry, another public hearing was held on 14 August 2000 in Canberra which the regulatory bodies, including APRA, ASIC and Treasury, attended. The regulatory bodies provided evidence that the bill was part of the harmonisation of the legislative and regulatory approach in order to comply with the criminal code which is set out in the Criminal Code Act 1995. The criminal code codifies common law principles built up over time by court decisions relating to criminal responsibility. These principles are designed to be employed in the interpretation of criminal offences. The code's application is designed to ensure clarity and consistency in the interpretation of Commonwealth criminal offences.
Essentially, the proposed changes to penalties in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act go to reducing the cost of regulating the superannuation industry and enforcing the SI(S) Act legislation. Labor's main concerns with the bill relate to the application of the criminal code to the SI(S) Act and changes to the nature of some contravention offences from fault to strict liability or a combination of fault and strict liability called `two-tier'. With a two-tier offence, the regulator APRA has the discretion of whether to apply a fault or strict liability.
With respect to strict liability versus fault liability, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services was advised that the courts have interpreted the intention of the parliament to be either strict or fault liability, depending on the offence. For instance, where the penalty for an offence is imprisonment for 12 months, the courts have interpreted that the intention of the parliament was that the intention to commit an offence would need to be proved. As such, the advice of the regulatory bodies was that the bill does not make significant changes to the existing obligations of superannuation trustees.
However, there are a number of amendments proposed in this bill that Labor believes need to be reconsidered. Having examined the bill in detail, Labor opposes amendments to make a number of offences two-tier offences. This will allow the regulator to apply the strict defence for inadvertent or small breaches—for example, where someone is a few days late—and use the strict liability offence for more serious breaches.
Items 1 and 2 of section 36 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act provide for the lodgment of annual returns to the regulator. Section 36A of the SI(S) Act provides self-managed superannuation funds to lodge annual returns. APRA raised in evidence before the Senate committee that it particularly needed more powers for the purpose of enforcement when recalcitrant trustees did not lodge annual returns. However, there is a concern that, if a fund missed lodging a return by a day, it would be penalised in the same way as if it had lodged a fraudulent return. APRA has indicated on several occasions that it is not interested in prosecuting those who offend inadvertently or who miss lodgment by a couple of days. It has stated that it will continue its practice of assisting trustees to comply with the SI(S) Act. 
To accommodate all of these considerations, Labor proposes that this provision be made a two-tier offence. This will allow the regulator to elect either to prosecute under the strict liability offence but with a lower penalty than that proposed by the government or to prosecute under the fault liability offence, which will attract the same penalty as currently applies under SIS.
Item 3 of section 254 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act provides for information to be provided to the regulator. There is a concern that making this offence a strict liability offence would affect, for example, a fund which changes from the 24th to the 21st floor of the same building but does not let the regulator know that it has changed its address. While it is hard to imagine the regulator prosecuting a fund trustee for such a breach, this issue is related to the wider issue of ensuring that funds keep appropriate and accurate records—which is a `without reasonable excuse' offence. The application of a two-tier offence would again allow the regulator the flexibility to pursue SI(S) Act breaches according to the nature of the breach. Labor is therefore proposing that these offences be made two-tier offences.
Item 4 of section 347A of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act provides that `the Regulator may collect such statistical information about superannuation entities as the Regulator considers appropriate'. The section also provides:
... the Regulator may give the trustee a survey form. In that event, the trustee must: 
(a) fill up and supply, in accordance with the instructions contained in the form, the particulars specified in the form; and 
(b) give the filled-up form to the authorised recipient in accordance with those instructions. 
While the collection of accurate statistics is necessary, there is a concern that this does not need to be a strict liability offence—not even a two-tier offence. Labor believes that this offence should remain as a fault liability offence.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—I will seek to convince honourable senators to vote against this amendment. It is almost unreal, hearing the contributions of some senators on this bill. One minute they are saying, `You should listen to consumers,' and the next minute they are saying, `Let's stick up for the industry.' You have ASFA, headed by Philippa Smith, coming along and saying, `We don't like these penalties; they are too tough on my industry. My members do not like this. If we change address, we shouldn't have to advise the regulator, or we shouldn't have to do it by a certain date. If we're a couple of days late with an annual return, then we should not be penalised.'
Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, you would probably know better than most that, under management within this industry, there are the life savings and the retirement income of the great majority of Australian citizens. At last count, $470 billion worth of assets are being managed under this regime, and the financial security of Australia's citizens rests in having a sound regulatory regime. Just to put another, I guess, relatively arcane statistic, something like 40 per cent of the entire nation's financial assets are being managed under this regime.
You can seek to trivialise offences like not informing of a change of address, or you can seek to trivialise not putting in your annual return on time. I guess that, with a party that had a Treasurer who did not lodge income tax returns for three years on the trot, one can imagine why they trivialise these things. But, if you are managing a whole series of superannuation funds from the very biggest ones in Australia to the smaller funds, the regulator needs to know where they are located, it needs to know who their officers are and it needs to know who is responsible. For many of these funds, just the lodgment of the annual return is a crucial part of the regulatory process and an integral part of prudential supervision of superannuation funds.
So in answer to anyone who says, `Look, let's just be a bit less careful about the penalties because we don't want to hurt these people,' I say to the people who manage $475 billion worth of funds on behalf of Australia's citizens: you should abide by the law. If the law says you should put an annual return in on time, you put it in on time. If you move your office from the 21st floor to the 25th floor and the regulator says, `We want to know where you're located,' then you do it and you do it on time. If you move from one city to another city, you should, equally, tell it where you are. The consumers and the regulator should know where the responsible officers are located. If you do not do that, if you do not abide by the law of the land that says, `This is what you should do if you are going to hold in trust the life savings and the retirement benefits of such an enormous number of Australian citizens,' then you will be penalised. 
The Labor Party want to lower the penalties for people who are managing the funds. Why do they want to do that? Because Susan Ryan, a former Labor minister, and Philippa Smith say, `Our members don't like these penalties. We don't want to pay $5,500 if we fail to abide by the law; we only want to pay $2,250.' I will put that into some context. This is no longer my portfolio; I am doing this on behalf of the minister. I will put this by way of comparison for the benefit of the Australian Democrats. We have seen the Australian Democrats go along with Labor on all of their amendments—quite frankly, many of them stupid amendments—and some of the amendments will significantly undermine the superannuation and banking industry in Australia and will certainly delay passage of this legislation. I appeal to the Democrats: when it comes to sticking up for the interests of the industry or the interests of the consumers, please, Australian Democrats, come down on the side of the consumers this time. Please help the consumers. Do not say to the industry, `We're going to lower your penalties for not complying with the law.' Labor want to, in effect, halve the penalties. 
I am just going to make a clear analogy, and I want Senator Ridgeway to understand this. I beg your indulgence here, Mr Temporary Chairman, because this is slightly off the subject, but it is an important analogy about penalties for breaching federal law. Yesterday I launched a program on behalf of the Australian Communications Authority—and I guess this is a free plug for it—called A-Tick. This program ensures that if a retailer in Australia sells a mobile phone, a modem, a fax, a telephone or an answering machine that does not have the A-Tick symbol on it, which says that that equipment is authorised and approved by the Australian Communications Authority, the retailer—a Dick Smith, a Harvey Norman or even Ross's second-hand telecommunications equipment shop—will be fined 100 penalty units; that is, $11,000. They will be fined $11,000 for selling a single mobile phone, a second-hand fax or anything like that if it does not have the A-Tick symbol on it. But if you are a superannuation company that fails to comply with the law in relation to managing a super fund, the Labor Party are saying, `Don't fine them $5,500; cut the penalty down to $2,250.'  
If Labor seriously want to come in here and say that the penalty for failing to abide by the law in relation to managing a super fund should be a quarter of the fine for selling an unauthorised mobile phone, then let them say that to the consumers of Australia. You either care for and stick up for the rights of Philippa and Susan and their members and the guy who does the ad `It is the super of the future', Bernie Fraser—the Labor mates, the top end of town, the guys who are getting the quarter of a million dollar salaries and sucking the chardonnay and sitting around the boardroom tables—or you stick up for the workers, the battlers who are on lower than average incomes who are working for their retirement and putting their funds in super and hoping that the federal government are putting in place a prudential regulatory regime that will ensure that their super is safe. But who do the chardonnay set and the cappuccino sipping group in here called the Labor Party choose? They choose the big end of town. They choose their industry mates and not the consumer, not the working man. They say, `Let's lower the penalties for our mates.' 
We will not allow these amendments to go through. We will stand firm in relation to a regulatory regime that puts in place appropriate penalties, and we will send a message to the industry that says that, if you are in a position of trust, looking after the savings of Australians in superannuation, there will be a strict regime and strict penalties for noncompliance. We will oppose these amendments. If they go through this place, I can absolutely assure you that, within a short period of time, the government will send back to this place a penalty regime that is appropriate for this most important part of the financial sector. I appeal to the Australian Democrats: for once in this debate, stick up for the consumers and not for Philippa, Susan, Bernie and their mates who earn such huge salaries compared to the workers whom they pretend and purport to represent. That, indeed, is the future.  ",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-11-01,"—I respond by saying that the Democrats will be supporting Labor's amendments (1) to (4). In response to Senator Ian Campbell, I want to make a few comments. He seems to be talking about an issue in relation to an earlier amendment and not these ones. Clearly, these amendments are not about industry versus consumers; they are simply about industry alone. Senator Allison, as part of the Senate committee of inquiry, raised a number of times the issue of strict liability offences, and that is the issue that the Democrats are responding to. So consumers do not need to be considered and are not considered in this particular issue. It is about the industry and about the strict liability offence.  
I want to say a few things about amendments (1) to (3). When Senator Allison has raised these things previously, the government have expressed concern to us about watering down the penalties by the ALP's amendments. We are persuaded by the government's concern, but that has to be balanced against our general concern, and that is about the creation of strict liability offences. So, after having weighed up the competing considerations, we decided to accept the ALP's amendments and the lower level of penalty, with the knowledge that, if it is perceived that the penalties are too low, APRA has the opportunity to quickly notify the minister if it believes this to be the case, and the minister can return to the parliament and move to amend the legislation so that penalties can be increased. Amendment (4) has the effect of removing the strict liability offence and replacing it with a fault based offence. That offence essentially relates to the failure by a superannuation trustee to provide statistical information to APRA. We accept this amendment by the Labor Party, but I make the point again that the issue is not about industry versus consumer in this case; it is simply about industry and the strict liability offence.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I want to briefly respond to the diatribe that Senator Campbell gave in his speech. I appreciate, Senator Campbell, that it is not your portfolio area and that you are assisting the government by standing in on this. It is just disappointing that they have given you such a poor brief. To try to represent this as anybody kowtowing to Philippa or to Susan in your pathological pursuit of industry funds is to completely misrepresent what these amendments are. The government are seeking to introduce a stricter test.
—We are.
—We are supporting that, but we are simply saying that, in some cases, in a very small number of cases, we do not need to have so high a penalty for the new stricter test. This is consistent with legislation in other areas. It is disappointing you were not given a briefing that that was the case. You are trying to turn this into your traditional class warfare and bashing industry funds because the Liberal Party have such a pathological hatred of them. We know that you are out at every turn in every piece of legislation simply to undermine and destroy the effectiveness of industry funds. We accept that that is your agenda. We accept that that is your agenda by choice. 
Senator Ridgeway, we would say to you: when the choice debate comes to your party room, understand that the sentiment expressed here today is behind their choice. No matter what flowery words Senator Kemp puts to the Democrats party room, the intent is exactly as has been described: the hatred of industry funds and their success in delivering cheaper superannuation to all workers in this country. They want to undermine it. That is their intent, that is their hatred and that is how you should view the choice debate. Having said that, I think it is unfortunate that you were so poorly briefed on this issue. Hopefully we can resolve it quickly. ",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—Could I just address Senator Ridgeway's issue of penalties on the industry. He is try-ing to say that this has nothing to do with con-sumers. I reassure him that this industry is all about consumers. It is $475 billion worth of their money. This is about imposing pen-alties and a strict liability regime on the in-dustry that manages those funds. You can-not differentiate between the industry and the consumers. This industry should be all about the consumers. I have to say that one of the prob-lems with the whole super-annua-tion debate is that it gets captured by those people I was talking about. This is not about in-dust-ry funds; this is about all funds. It is about very small super funds, as I said. It is about very big ones. It is about industry funds. It is about private funds. And it is to ensure that, regardless of what sort of fund you are running, if you breach the law you will suffer a fine and you will suffer a penalty.
—You can have the death penalty on you!
—You can trivialise it, you can make a joke about it and you can make personal attacks and say that I have not been briefed on it. Can I say that I have been thoroughly briefed on it. I understand exactly what we are doing. The Australian Democrats need to understand that there is one choice here. If you vote for these amendments, you are lowering the penalties that apply to the people who are managing these funds, any of the funds, if they breach the law. If you stick with the legislation as it is before you, you will ensure that the penalties are appropriate.
The government have put a range of measures in this bill that change the liability regime and put in place some new liabilities. These amendments seek to change that. We believe that the penalty regime and the liability regime have not been effective in the past. I think there has been only one successful prosecution in the past four years. The Australian Democrats need to understand that, if they say aye to these amendments, they say aye to lower penalties and to a regime that is less effective for consumers. They can try to kid themselves that that is not what they are doing but, quite frankly, they need to go back to the source of their advice on this and be quite clear. 
The government will not let the effective halving of the penalties caused by these amendments stand. We believe that you need a well-regulated industry here. You need to ensure that you send a message to the people who run that industry that they have a very important and responsible role to play and that, if they breach the law, there will be strict penalties and serious fines. We are not going to see that diminished. If the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party want to say to the people who run that industry, `We're on your side,' and be good fellows in the eyes of those organisations, Philippa Smith and Susan Ryan, then do that. But I will ensure that the government make it clear to the consumer movement that that was the decision of the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-11-01,"—I have just a very quick response. Again, I think Senator Campbell must be looking at a different amendment to mine. We are not talking about diminishing penalties; we are talking about improving the regime that exists. We agree on the strict penalties in relation to the 50 penalty units. That is not in question. We all agree on that. What we are talking about is flexibility in the regime, particularly in relation to the smaller super funds, and making sure that, for whatever reason, in their capacity they do not become subject to harsh decisions taken in relation to the strictness of the regime and the penalties that are dished out as a result. At the end of the day, we are not trying to diminish any of the penalties there. The regime is purely seeking to provide flexibility and to keep in mind the numerous smaller funds to give them some comfort that the regime will be fair, will be flexible and will provide the discretion that is required in this industry. ",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—Could I, for the record, make it clear that there are a number of quite specific penalties for breaches of three particular offences against this act, which will be lowered and decreased as a result of the vote that is about to be taken—and let there be no doubt about it. They relate specifically to annual returns. You can trivialise the importance of an annual return, but what you are saying is that you are going to reduce the penalty for failure to lodge annual returns. You can say that that does not really matter and you can say that a change of address does not matter, but it does matter if you are an aggrieved consumer or you are the regulator, you are trying to get hold of a super fund that has come under some sort of doubt and you have not been informed of a change of address or you do not have their annual return. You can kid yourself and you can try to obfuscate and say that we do not know what we are talking about and that we are not reducing penalties but improving them. One of the amendments that you seem to be about to vote for specifically reduces the proposed penalties for three specific breaches of the act. Don't kid yourself that is not what you are about to vote for, because that is exactly what you are about to vote for.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—by leave—I move government amendments Nos 1 and 2:
(1)	Schedule 3, page 32 (after line 9), after item 62, insert:
62A  Paragraph 252C(2)(c)
Omit “or (7)”, substitute “, (7), (7A) or (7B)”.
62B  After subsection 252C(7)
Insert:
	(7A)	It is not an offence if the information, or the information contained in the document, as the case may be, is all or any of the following:
	(a)	information identifying a particular self-managed superannuation fund (other than information disclosing the tax file number of the fund);
	(b)	information that is reasonably necessary to enable members of the public to contact persons who perform functions in relation to a particular self-managed superannuation fund;
	(c)	a statement of the Commissioner's opinion as to whether or not a particular self-managed superannuation fund is a complying superannuation fund in relation to a particular year of income for the purposes of Division 2 of Part 5.
Note:	A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in subsection (7A) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code).
	(7B)	If information referred to in subsection (7A) is disclosed to the Registrar of the Australian Business Register established under section 24 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999, the Registrar may enter the information in that Register.
Note:	A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in subsection (7B) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code).
 (2)	Schedule 4, page 41 (after line 7), after item 1, insert:
1A  Paragraph 56(2)(c)
Omit “or (7B)”, substitute “, (7B) or (7C)”.
1B  After subsection 56(7B)
Insert:
	(7C)	If information referred to in subsection (7A) or paragraph (7B)(a) that relates to a body that is, or has at any time been, regulated by APRA under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 is disclosed to the Registrar of the Australian Business Register established under section 24 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999, the Registrar may enter the information in that Register.
Note:	A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in subsection (7C) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code). 
These amendments are designed to enable interested parties to more easily access contact details for self-managed superannuation funds and information as to whether those funds are complying funds. The publication of this information until now has been difficult, due to the restricted nature of the secrecy requirements under that act. It is important that public contact details for super funds and the compliance status of those funds be easily accessible. A fund's compliance status affects its entitlement to claim tax concessions. Before making contributions to a fund, it is essential that an employer or an employee is able to determine whether the fund is a complying superannuation fund. This is particularly relevant in the case of superannuation guarantee contributions, where contributions are required to be made to a complying super fund. The government amendments will make it easier for interested parties to find out the compliance status of a fund.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I will happily stand and discuss at some length this important bill.
—Which bill is it?
—It is the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000, it is the resumption of the second reading debate and I think I have made more than enough of a contribution on this, so I will sit down.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I thank Senator Conroy for his assistance during a difficult time. I have actually been up talking about the ABC and the appalling attacks this government is launching upon it. Perhaps I can talk about that tomorrow. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000 provides funding for the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program. The intention of the government is that this bill will serve to replace the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 from 1 January next year. It will provide both recurrent and project funding for the period 1 January 2001 to 30 June 2005. The bill also provides for funding associated with the away from base element of Austudy. The bill, in addition, seeks to implement at last an initiative in indigenous literacy and numeracy announced in the 1999 federal budget. This new strategy included in that budget was not announced in detail until March 2000—almost a year later. In November the Senate is finally having an opportunity to debate the bill, a full 18 months having passed since the original announcement. You can see the high priority the government has attached to this particular measure.
If you look at the treatment of education bills in this parliament you will note, I am sure, that there is a growing pattern within government, particularly from this Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, to bottle up education bills to the very end of the parliamentary session. There are some 10 bills currently on the Notice Paper. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 was completed yesterday, and there are many other bills relating to programs and funding that must be in place by 1 January next year. Most of them are contentious in the sense that they are controversial policy proposals and they have, as a matter of necessity, required attention by the Senate committee. But that does not change the fact that the government seeks to delay the discussion of those bills in this chamber. One has two options to explain this: either the government is seeking to prevent public scrutiny and accountability in the chamber or the minister is not able to provide sufficient muscle in the turf wars over the legislative programming of this government. 
What I see here is a bill that, in general, we have substantial support for, but there are matters that do require quite serious attention. The bill has indicated some significant changes to the current act it seeks to replace. Some omissions do concern me. This bill does not commit the government to a predetermined level of funding for each sector of education, be it pre-schools, schools, vocational education or higher education. The current act which it replaces does make those specifications. The minister will be able to determine the distribution of funds between the sectors at his personal whim. He will also be able to allocate funds as it suits him between the government and non-government educational providers. Given his recently demonstrated propensity to favour the non-government sector, particularly the elite and most powerful sections of that community, in regard to the funding of schools, I am not altogether certain that I would feel confident about the choices that this minister would make. The bill will allow the minister to recover from the states and territories, in certain circumstances, funds that have already been spent, and Labor opposes the use of this power without due process—and I emphasise that issue of due process. The states, in my judgment—and I have always argued this here—ought to be accountable for the expenditure of public moneys. Our concern, however, is that the powers of the Commonwealth minister should not be used arbitrarily. It is Labor's view that the minister should be accountable himself—not just the states but the minister himself—for the exercise of these powers. Accordingly, we will be moving appropriate amendments during the committee stages of the bill. 
This morning an extensive document was delivered to the shadow minister for education, Mr Lee. A great many more than 29 pages of documentation were delivered just this morning. These are the administrative guidelines for the supplementary recurrent assisted and targeted outcome projects for English as a second language, for indigenous language speaking students and for the National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. These guidelines were received today but they were requested on 8 August by the opposition. I think we are entitled to know—and I will be seeking an explanation for this in the committee stages of this bill—why it took so long for this minister to provide this information to the opposition. Frankly, why do we have to ask for this at all? It is extraordinary that issues of this importance are not contained in the bill or are not part of the legislative package that is presented to the parliament in some other form. We do not see these guidelines in the explanatory memorandum or in any other forum that we can see, and we have to seek them out specifically. They are essential in understanding any consideration of  this bill. There are, in fact, 31 pages of documentation—delivered only this morning. Is it reasonable, given the demands on parliamentary officers at this time and given that we are currently considering 10 education bills in my office, that that action be taken by this government? Consistent with this pattern of delaying and bottling up education legislation, I have come to the conclusion that it is not just a question of Dr Kemp being weak and ineffectual within the government itself but that perhaps there is a more deliberate strategy involved. 
The other alternative is that the department has not been able to provide the information. Frankly, that is not an explanation that I find particularly satisfactory. I would hazard a guess that, when this information was sought by Mr Lee back in August, the department would have had the guidelines ready in a flash. I would speculate that they have been sitting in the minister's office for a great deal of time. I will be seeking advice on that matter at the Senate estimates. I trust that the officers will be able to assist me.
—Is that not the case? You do not think the officers will be able to assist?
—You are beyond assistance.
—We will see how much assistance you require. This government's guidelines suggest that the government can only require the recovery of unspent amounts of money from the states by legal means. But this bill does not actually say that; the bill would let them recover all the moneys. We need to have this issue clarified. What is the level? What amounts of moneys can be recovered under this particular legislation? 
The Prime Minister was involved with the launching of the new strategy in March this year—I think it is important that the Prime Minister does launch things like this—and he claimed that the government would be providing $27 million in additional funding. He said it was new money for the indigenous literacy program through the legislation. This is not the case. As we have seen recently in the case of the schools funding bill, there are huge windfall increases to the wealthier schools. But the Prime Minister does not seem to know much about that bill, and it appears he knows even less about what is happening in this bill. I would suggest that he knows very little about what is happening in the education portfolio. The $27 million referred to by the Prime Minister is not new money; it comes from an existing pool of money which has been put aside for some time within the department's appropriations. The government managed to cloud this issue even further by means of a monumental administrative bungle in this year's budgetary papers. The government has now admitted, after being challenged by the Labor Party, that a technical error was committed in Budget Paper No 3, and that the funds for the Abstudy away from base programs had been incorrectly included along with moneys for the non-government providers. This apparently had the effect of deflating the total IESIP funds by over 20 per cent on the previous year. How could this `error'—as the government call it—occur in the budgetary papers presented to this parliament? The opposition is, naturally enough, relieved to discover that this is an error that has occurred, rather than there being a drop in the moneys going to this particular program.
To continue with the opposition's reservations about the bill, it seems that the bill does not include a requirement for specific steps to be taken by the minister in the case of a breach of performance requirements on the part of any particular state government. No process has been outlined and no review or discussion is called for. That is, as I say, a matter we need to pursue with some care in the committee stage. There is apparently no requirement for the minister to justify his actions, either to the parliament or to anyone else, and that will need to be clarified. If that is true, that is quite a serious omission in the proposals. This, to my mind, flies in the face of the generally accepted principles of accountability and transparency in the expenditure of Commonwealth moneys. I hope that those matters can be clarified to the satisfaction of the opposition. We have made the point over and over again about these issues of accountability and transparency in education funding. These two issues stand side by side with the concept of quality which ought to underpin the quality guarantee that we provide to students of this country, to their parents and to all the other people that benefit from our education system. These issues are of central interest to me personally, and are issues that the Senate committee inquiring into vocational education and training will be reporting upon on 9 November. They have arisen in direct response to the very grave concerns that have been widely expressed about the application of these principles to educational programs. When it comes to the education of our indigenous people, there can be no clearer example than the dismay and the horror about the apparent failures of many state administrations in this regard.
I have raised at previous Senate inquiries—as has Trish Crossin—concern about the actions of the Northern Territory government in the expenditure of Commonwealth indigenous education funds. It was a revelation to me that over 40 per cent of those Commonwealth moneys were creamed off and used for administrative purposes. I think that is a scandal which should have been attended to by the government a long time ago. It seems to me that it is totally inappropriate for state bureaucracies to milk Commonwealth funds in these ways. I am told that that is a matter that has been attended to since the release of the Collins report in the Northern Territory, and that decisive steps have been taken to improve the situation. Recently, I had the pleasure of meeting with Ms Catherine Henderson, the Deputy Secretary of the Northern Territory Department of Education, who oversees indigenous education programs. I understand Ms Henderson has been in that position for just on a year. I am very impressed by her commitment to this area, and I look forward to doing what I can to assist in the development of that commitment and to improving the benefits to indigenous students in this country. 
There are a number of other areas of concern. Perhaps at the estimates hearings we will examine the various areas where more attention needs to be paid to the expenditure of Commonwealth moneys in this particular program. What concerns me, though, is that whatever progress has been made in this matter has to be set in context with what actually is occurring with indigenous students. I am still shocked by the figures available on indigenous education. I may need to update some of these figures, but the most recent ones indicate that, while 73 per cent of non-indigenous students are staying at school until year 12, the figure for indigenous students is only 32 per cent; that 68 per cent of indigenous students do not attend school; that the school drop-out rate for indigenous boys far outstrips that for girls, as does the truancy rate; that the vast majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boys, particularly those outside the urban centres, are not receiving anything like the education they need and they deserve; that literacy and numeracy remain at shamefully low levels—the Collins report found that only four per cent of year 5 indigenous students meet national reading benchmarks; that, since 1996, completion rates for indigenous people in higher education have fallen compared with commencements—in other words, a smaller proportion of these students are successfully completing their courses; that pass rates for indigenous students in vocational education and training languish some 27 per cent behind those for VET students in general; and that changes to the Abstudy scheme introduced this year clearly disadvantage mature age part-time indigenous students—a large number of indigenous students fall into these categories and have been denied Abstudy assistance.
The educational deprivation that is beginning to be understood by some—and even within this government—has to be seen in the broader context of the extraordinary disadvantage experienced by indigenous people in health, housing and access to employment. Amongst Aboriginal families the infant mortality rate is twice the national average. Life expectancy is 15 to 20 years below the rest of the country's. Death rates for 35- to 54-year-olds are six to eight times that of the general population. Seven per cent of indigenous people live in households of more than 10 persons—50 times the proportion of other Australians. Only 31 per cent of indigenous people own or are paying off their own home, compared with 71 per cent of Australians overall. In some states imprisonment rates for indigenous people are 10 times that of other persons. It is no wonder that education attainment and participation rates for indigenous people are a casualty in those sorts of social statistics.
This is an unbelievable record of failure by governments in this country—and I say that of all governments; I do not say that particularly of any one government—and it does demonstrate why so much more is required to end the endemic racism and social discrimination that does occur in this country. What we have got here is clearly a need for all governments—at state and at national level—to take urgent action to positively address these statistics and to assist indigenous people to overcome the inherent institutionalised disadvantage that they face in this country. Of course, education remains central to overturning those gross inequalities that have occurred. I could go on at length. There is a second reading amendment, which I will formally move, to perhaps draw attention to some of these concerns.
I would also draw attention to the fact that those who are seeking simple quick fix solutions to these problems will be sadly disappointed. Recently I heard the chief executive officer of the Northern Territory department say that that department was considering greater movements towards technology as an answer to some of these problems. While I do commend the need for all governments to ensure that technology is available, I do think availability of telephone lines and other infrastructure such as reliable power should be sufficiently provided to ensure that those computers that people talk about as the great panacea actually work. It strikes me as remarkable that so many of our remote communities—Aboriginal towns—in this country are not able to secure a decent telephone line sufficient to provide adequate access for their local schools and do not have a reliable power supply to make sure the computers actually work. It seems to me that those basic considerations need to be attended to in any consideration of these matters. This is a bill that the opposition have some concerns about but we do support in general. I move: 
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate:
	(a)	notes the major disparity between the educational outcomes for indigenous Australians and the general population; and
	(b)	calls for a renewed commitment from governments and education providers to address this disparity; and
	(c)	condemns the Government for:
	(i)	misleading the public by wrongly claiming the National Indigenous Literacy and Numeracy Strategy contained additional funding; and
	(ii)	providing incorrect funding for indigenous education in the Budget Papers.”",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-11-01,"—The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000 is intended to replace the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 from next year. The original act of 1989 is something that I in fact had a personal involvement in. I know in detail the origins of that act and the 21 goals which then emanated from that act and the way in which performance indicators were written as a means to have state and territory governments accountable for those millions of dollars during that 12-year period, which was of course four lots of three trienniums.
This bill now changes the way in which that money will be allocated to state and territory governments and private providers and the way in which that money is now accounted for. This bill provides continuing funding for the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program—or, as we in the industry commonly refer to it, IESIP—from 1 January 2001 to June 2005. So the IESIP money is now being rolled into a four-year funding period in line with general schools recurrent funding. It covers both recurrent and specific project funding as well as the base element of Abstudy.
This bill in fact seeks to implement the 1999-2000 budget initiative which announced a new National Indigenous Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. Under that strategy, which was launched in March of this year, the government claims the funding will be performance based with priority given to a focus on literacy, numeracy and school attendance. One of the most disappointing aspects of that announcement is that if this government were serious about trying to address the chronic literacy, numeracy and attendance problems that exist in Aboriginal communities then the $27 million we are talking about would not be taken from within an existing pool of funding but be additional funding provided on top of the amount to be set aside by IESIP. I do not believe a genuine commitment to looking at those problems simply means that you shuffle the money from one bucket into another bucket, without creating a new pool of funds, without actually demonstrating that you have a commitment to address these problems by in fact committing additional resources.
The government tried to pretend from the very beginning that this was new money—that this was an injection of funds that went above and beyond their current commitment. We pursued this during the estimates process, and finally the government admitted that in fact that was not the case. At the launch of the program the Prime Minister incorrectly claimed that additional funding was being provided for indigenous literacy. He was claiming that this strategy represented a firm commitment of resources from the federal government. We also had the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in his education speech at the launch of that strategy, state the following: 
... $27 million from the pool of funding available for indigenous students will be provided specifically to support this strategy for literacy and numeracy—
that is $27 million from the pool of funding available, not additional money. In other words we had the Prime Minister back in March claiming that there was an increase in resources going to indigenous literacy, but at the same time we had the minister for education making it clear that this was simply an allocation of existing funds. The fact that this is not new money has been confirmed by the analysis the Parliamentary Library do on each bill that is to be debated. Page 3 of their digest says:
The strategy earmarks $27 million from existing programs of recurrent assistance for schools and from specific supplementary assistance available through IESIP.
The strategy also indicates that the funding will be performance based, and this is now linked to IESIP agreements in which the funding priority will be aimed at improving literacy, numeracy and attendance. I understand that negotiations are taking place with each of the state and territory governments. There is yet to be an agreement signed between any of those bodies, but I am assuming that this matter will progress fairly rapidly and would need to be resolved before the start of the next financial year or at least before any funds are released.
In terms of the agreements to be made with state and territory governments and educational providers, while the current act gives the minister the power to set conditions not specified in the legislation, it indicates that the main conditions dealing with payments relate to the acquittal of the amount, monitoring, evaluation and reports on the education programs—currently no penalties are specified. By contrast, however, the new legislation says that funds are recoverable if a condition of agreement is breached. Neither the bill nor the explanatory memorandum spells out what those conditions might be, but I understand that the minister's letter of 8 June this year to state and territory education ministers on the new IESIP arrangements says:
Accountability and reporting arrangements for IESIP will be strengthened for the 2001-04 quadrennium.
The bill simply says that, if one or more of the conditions of the agreement are breached, the money is recoverable by the Commonwealth. This bill also states that the Commonwealth may recover the amount as a debt through the courts. However, the strategy states that the Commonwealth intends to introduce more rigorous guidelines for performance monitoring and reporting for its supplementary assistance during the quadrennium funding period. Funding under IESIP during this time will be contingent on the completion of an implementation plan for this strategy.
The Commonwealth will also expect education providers to give priority to improvements in literacy, numeracy and attendance when undertaking initiatives funded by IESIP. We know how these came about; we know that MCEETYA, as I understand, established an indigenous education task force which came up with a set of common agreed core performance indicators that were then signed off by each of the state and territory ministers. In a question on notice that I asked during the estimates process—answer No. E112, which was received on 21 July—I sought clarification as to how the new eight priority areas of the national strategy for the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people fitted or meshed with the 21 goals of the Aboriginal education policy or AEP.
It seems to me that those 21 goals have now been in some way connected to the eight priority areas. What is still unclear to me, though—and perhaps the minister may seek to clarify this for me—is whether or not state and territory governments will have to report their outcomes against the 21 goals, the eight priority areas or the common agreed performance indicators, or against all three. I am assuming that the core performance indicators are in some way linked to those eight priority areas, but I still have not had a clear clarification from the minister as to how in his mind he sees this working, which of course then links directly to his power over the funding area. 
It is interesting to note that the Federation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages expressed some concern over the emphasis in this strategy, stating:
There has been growing concern from some areas that the move by DETYA to boost measurable outcomes in literacy and numeracy in indigenous schooling, would see a shift in funding priorities impacting negatively on a number of indigenous language programs.
When the minister, Dr Kemp, responded to this he said:
It must be stressed that in 1999 there has been no change to the funding criteria for the Commonwealth's Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program (IESIP). Under IESIP, education providers receive funds to put in place initiatives to achieve educational outcomes against a set of performance indicators and targets. These include indicators relating to the teaching of indigenous languages, indigenous studies and the delivery of culturally inclusive curricula.
So, again, it raises in my mind exactly what requirements there are in terms of reporting against specific output. The comment in the Bills Digest also accurately states, significantly, that Dr Kemp did not make a similar commitment for the 2001-04 quadrennium. Given the emphasis on the National Indigenous Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, the concerns of the Federation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages about shifting priorities and their impact on indigenous languages may well be justified. Those education providers with less quantifiable performance outcomes and with targets that seek funding for the purpose of advancing the objects of the bill may find themselves significantly disadvantaged by this legislation. It would therefore be interesting to gain an explanation from the minister as to how he intends to deal with situations where providers may in good faith have tried to meet the required performance targets but nevertheless have failed to do so.
As Senator Carr has said, we strongly oppose the use of the powers, as spelt out in the bill, to recover moneys already paid and already expended by education authorities, except in the most extreme circumstances. Our preference would be, and we certainly hope it happens, that, in the first instance, the government would adopt a more constructive approach when addressing any concerns it may have about an education provider failing to meet performance requirements or—and I will expand on this further in my speech—failing to justify the use of funds it has been given by the Commonwealth. In particular, we hope that education providers would be warned that future funding was at risk if they did not meet particular performance indicators.
I want to look at the issue of funding in relation to this bill. This bill gives the minister the discretion to allocate the funding. Earlier this year, I asked a question in estimates regarding the allocation of this money to government providers as opposed to non-government providers. This year's budget papers showed that only 45.7 per cent of IESIP funds were being directed to government providers and that was down from 56.7 per cent in the 1998-99 budget. The matter was raised with the office of the minister for education, and, in a letter dated 7 September, the minister advised that a so-called technical error had occurred and that Budget Paper No. 3 was incorrect. The government has admitted that there was a technical error in Budget Paper No. 3. I can understand that these can occur from time to time and, as Senator Carr has said, there is some relief to know that this occurred from the fact that Abstudy away from base funding, which has now been incorporated with IESIP, had been incorrectly included with funding for non-government education providers. I think that is a matter that will be further pursued but, rather than funding for government providers of indigenous education falling from 56.7 per cent to 45.7 per cent, it in fact rose from 56.7 per cent to 64 per cent, which at least satisfies in my mind some of the questions that I was alluding to earlier this year in the budget estimates process.
I want to make further comments about the situation in the Northern Territory. I have been pursuing fairly vigorously through the estimates process the reasons why the Commonwealth government accepted that the Northern Territory government had creamed off nearly 48 per cent, for what they perceived as on-costs, of the funds from the Commonwealth government. I have spoken in this chamber many times before about what those on-costs consisted of. It needs to be placed on the record that the Northern Territory government are in fact the only state or territory government in this country that did not as a matter of course have their IESIP funding money simply rolled over for this 12-month period. They were funded as a matter of course for only the first six months of this year. It was not until, as I understand it, nearly two weeks ago that officials in DETYA were able to negotiate a suitable agreement for this six-month period. 
As I said earlier, funds are not released until that agreement is signed. People in the department and the minister have to be satisfied with the agreement and with the outcomes that will result from the agreement. I think it has been an absolute indictment of the Northern Territory. Those funds could have been made available to them at the end of last year. They could have had those funds automatically rolled over for a 12-month period; they got them for only a six-month period. It has taken July, August, September and the best part of October to come up with an agreement that is suitable for the Commonwealth under these guidelines in which they can get their funding for this six-month period. We have had many phone calls and many discussions with people who are trying to operate in Aboriginal education in the Northern Territory. They do the best job that they possibly can, whether they are in the department in an advisory capacity or in the schools, while they wait for this money, which is critically linked to the ability of the Northern Territory government to satisfy the requirements the Commonwealth have set, to be released from the Commonwealth.
Although I have some reservations about further restrictions and penalties under this bill, I actually think that some credit is due to the work of the officials in the department who have persisted with a belligerent Northern Territory government in getting this somewhat under control. The Northern Territory government conducted its own review of Aboriginal education in the Northern Territory in 1999. In fact, its own internal review demonstrated that there has been a significant lack of interest in Aboriginal education. I think a document, which is severely embarrassing for the Northern Territory government, points to these sorts of indicators. In 2.5, this document says:
NTDE's poor achievement of IESIP targets and outcomes can in large part be attributed to a lack of strategic planning, coordinated management and cohesive implementation ...
They also admit in their own report that the degree of internal accountability for initiatives has varied over the years and has been minimal in the last triennium. But I think the most astounding statement in their own review of IESIP is this statement:
There has been long-term troubled relationship between DETYA and NTDE about IESIP—
And of course we know why, because we did have officials in DETYA who actually wanted to make the Northern Territory government accountable for the money they got. The Northern Territory government simply say this is due to `a systemic lack of interest in Aboriginal education'. They go on to say:
There has been a history—
at their own admission—
of using IESIP funding as substitute funding—
not additional funding—
for NTDE core business.... Many initiatives `supplement' nothing. 
They are four words from their own report. This systemic lack of interest in the Northern Territory has now been proved not only by themselves but by the fact that they have taken nearly four months to come to an agreement with the Commonwealth officials about this six-month period of funding. There has been only marginal achievement in some outcomes by indigenous students and an unwillingness and incapacity on the part of senior management to ensure a concerted and coordinated approach to improved educational outcomes amongst indigenous students. Their review also showed that there was a history of using IESIP funds as substitute funds for core Northern Territory Department of Education business, with many initiatives supplementing nothing and others not addressing agreed targets and outcomes. The IESIP funds accounted for about 69 per cent of the budget of the then Aboriginal Education Branch of the Northern Territory Department of Education. 
Although I have made some comments about a need to hold state and territory governments accountable, I do have some reservations about actually recovering those moneys, because at the end of the day I think the actions by that minister would only further disadvantage those students to which this money is targeted. I do want to place on record that there is an acknowledgment, certainly by me and by those who worked in Aboriginal education, that there has been a concerted attempt by people in this department to hold the Northern Territory government accountable once and for all for this money to ensure that their on-costs are now 10 per cent and not 48 per cent. This should lead to a significant improvement in indigenous education. (Time expired).",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-01,"—The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000 provides $591 million in grants to state and territory education providers to the year 2004. This bill allocates recurrent and specific project funding under the government's Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, or IESIP, and Abstudy. There is absolutely no question that these programs are necessary. According to ATSIC, in 1994 one-third of indigenous 15- to 24-year-olds had not completed year 10. Undernutrition, hepatitis B and anaemia, vision and hearing difficulties are very common. There are schools in the Northern Territory where 90 per cent of children are deaf because of ruptured eardrums caused by otitis media, or middle ear infection. Racism in the classroom is endemic. Koori workers in Bairnsdale told the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission rural and remote education inquiry that racism will not change until Koori culture is made a compulsory part of the curriculum for all students. High rates of disability and illness amongst indigenous students in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland were all discovered when the education committee did its inquiry last year.
The indigenous education picture is improving but not fast enough. The Democrats are supportive of the objects of the bill. However, it does not represent the sort of sustained injection of resources needed to lift educational standards and attainment to anything resembling general community standards. This year's budget papers show the growing inequities in IESIP. From now to 2004, government schools which cater to 88 per cent of indigenous students will receive an increase in IESIP funding of five per cent. Non-government schools on the other hand will receive a 23 per cent increase. Retention rates to year 12 for indigenous students have risen from 12.3 per cent in 1989 to 29.2 per cent in 1996; it is now, according to DETYA, at 33 per cent, in contrast to 73 per cent for students generally. Dr Kemp said in a media release some time ago:
We must make the achievement of educational equality for Australia's Indigenous peoples an urgent national priority. Australia's education and training systems must provide sufficient choice and diversity in their infrastructure, curriculum, teaching and learning practices, and assessment and reporting arrangements to enable Indigenous people to choose from the same range of futures as other Australians.
I agree wholeheartedly with Dr Kemp on those words, except that `choice' is again code for funding the private sector at the expense of public schools. The funding share by sector is currently 49 per cent to government schools and 51 per cent to non-govern-ment schools. By 2004 this breakdown will result in government schools getting just 44 per cent of the IESIP pie and non-govern-ment schools getting 55 per cent. This mirrors exactly what is happening in the states grants bill. These will dovetail with other government decisions made outside this bill. They include the stagnation of funding for the Country Areas Program, which boosts support to rural and remote government schools. When the King's School in Parramatta is spending half a million dollars ordering a set of sandstone gates and getting enormous increases in its recurrent funding under the government's new SES model, one has to think what your typical underresourced school servicing a high population of indigenous kids could do with this kind of money.
Let me turn to some of the provisions in the legislation. We share the ALP's concern about the lack of information on this bill: for instance, the breakdown of money flowing to private and public schools, and to which sectors—preschools, schools, VET, et cetera. We are happy to support the opposition's amendments on this important accountability issue. It is desirable that the minister report to parliament on how funding is allocated, why it might be reduced or withdrawn and what performance data is being collected by each state and territory. Concerns have been expressed about what will constitute a breach of the act under which the minister will be able to recover funds. We are all well aware of the endemic problems of poor attendance and underresourcing of schools and socioeconomic disadvantage, particularly those in remote areas, and I would want to see careful monitoring of this issue. 
I note with interest that the Commonwealth has refused to step in when the Northern Territory government has made decisions adversely impacting on indigenous education, such as the decision about bilingual education. Indigenous students comprise 38 per cent of enrolments in government schools in the Northern Territory. Shockingly, up to half of the federal money made available for their education has never made it to schools. Instead, it has been squirrelled away by the Northern Territory government, presumably into consolidated revenue. I would like to ask the government: what is planned to redress this appalling behaviour? Will the minister use the powers he has just given himself in the bill? I certainly hope so. 
Many indigenous children, perhaps up to half of them in the Northern Territory, are receiving ungraded education, according to evidence given to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Many indigenous communities lack schools—period. Boarding and distance education are often culturally inappropriate. The lack of new money for new initiatives is alarming and dismaying. While the objectives of the National Indigenous Students School Attendance Strategy are laudable, the $14 million allocated to it from the year 2000 to 2004 is minimal and is not new money. The money will be used for professional development and cultural awareness training for teachers and projects to assist in affirming students' cultural identity and to facilitate community input into teaching programs—all very praiseworthy initiatives but at the expense of  existing resourcing; likewise the Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy funded under this bill. 
At the launch of the strategy, the Prime Minister identified as his own personal special responsibility the task of practical reconciliation. By definition, the Democrats believe that practical reconciliation involves resources, especially human resources, rather than just `feel good' statements. Yet, under the strategy, not one cent of the $27 million allocated is new money. The $27 million over four years represents roughly $1 million per state and territory per year. So I am sceptical of Dr Kemp's agenda. I want to see him talk not just about the basic literacy and numeracy attainment for indigenous young people—yes, these are very urgent priorities for indigenous kids, many of whom are failed by the system and have failed to acquire these competencies—but, equally important, about the need for them to hear the message over and over that they are capable of more. 
The Federation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages have expressed consternation over the government's Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. They warn that the move to measurable outcomes would trigger shifts in funding with harmful impacts on indigenous language programs. It is hard to see how Dr Kemp's infatuation with this sort of data is going to assist service providers who wish to emphasise and maintain indigenous language culture. The Executive Director of Community Aid Abroad, Mr Jeremy Hobbs, warned of the risks if the Northern Territory followed through on its plan to axe indigenous bilingual education. He said dismantling it may breach our obligations under the United States Convention on the Rights of the Child to protect and respect the right of indigenous people to appropriate education. So we need a concerted effort in working with the living cultural heritage and languages that indigenous kids bring with them to their formal schooling, not work against it or deny it.  
The Democrats would like to see more effort put into providing preschool opportunities for indigenous children. Preschool is an important means of providing early exposure to English and the school system. This was a recommendation of the Senate's report into indigenous education. We know that children learn literacy faster if it is taught in the language in which they think. That alone is an important reason to boost our efforts on bilingual education. There is also an urgent need for English as a second language teachers. English is a second language for many indigenous students but can also be the third or even the fourth language for them. The Democrats would like to see these needs addressed. Even then, English as a second language teacher training tends to be directed more towards migrants in capital cities than towards indigenous students. Many teachers are thrown in at the deep end. There is an urgent need, I think, for more teacher training in cultural awareness as well as in the specifics of indigenous language. I urge government members to reread the Senate report on indigenous education and ask themselves why it is that it continues to short-change indigenous students.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-01,"—I thank other senators for their contribution. The government opposes the second reading amendment, which was moved by Senator Carr. Although the government has always noted the disparity between educational outcomes for indigenous Australians and the general population, it has maintained a vigorous commitment to improving those outcomes for indigenous students. This is shown by its policies in relation to indigenous education and the increased funding for indigenous education. The government rejects totally that part of the second reading amendment which condemns the government for not having any additional funding or providing incorrect funding for indigenous education in the budget papers. I place on record the fact that the government rejects those allegations outright.
The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000 will replace the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. This bill is a vehicle for the government's indigenous education targeted funding program for the quadrennium period 2000 to 2004, and it will provide the authority to approve some $591 million in grants to indigenous education providers in the states and territories over that quadrennium. This is an important bill. It affirms the commitment by the government to indigenous education in Australia. This bill will implement the 1999-2000 budget initiatives for indigenous education, including priorities such as the improvement of literacy, numeracy and attendance outcomes for indigenous students—and I note other senators have touched on these problems and it is widely recognised that these problems in indigenous education need to be addressed, and the government is doing that with this strategy.
This bill will provide for payments to be made under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program during the period 1 January 2001 to 30 June 2005. This will improve the educational outcomes for indigenous Australians that I have mentioned. This bill is essential in keeping up those literacy and numeracy initiatives. Senator Allison mentioned English as a second language. In 1998 we introduced a program to improve the literacy of those indigenous students in communities where English is a second language. That point is being addressed squarely and we are looking forward to seeing the results of that program in years to come.
This bill will also allow for a mixed mode away from base delivery of Abstudy. During the current academic year institutions have received block grants through outcomes-focused indigenous education agreements that have utilised an agreed set of performance indicators to increase the accountability of this funding. In addition, the use of block grants allows institutions to develop innovative approaches to achieve better educational outcomes for indigenous students. The government again stresses the importance of outcomes: that is what should be kept in mind. We do not simply throw money at a problem hoping that that will cure it; we focus on educational outcomes. This is exceedingly important in the area of education for indigenous students and it is the approach that the government brings to indigenous education funding. 
This bill will operate in line with the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1998, which will also commence on 1 January 2001. It forms part of a whole-of-govern-ment approach to improved education in this country. We have seen increased expenditure on education in both the government and non-government sectors. From what I have seen, places such as the University of Notre Dame in Broome are doing great things for indigenous education. I visited the university not long ago and had the pleasure of seeing at first-hand the efforts that it is making to give indigenous students—particularly those in a remote part of Australia—great opportunities. This bill is very worth while and I commend it to the Senate. The government totally rejects the second reading amendment.
Amendment agreed to.
Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2000-11-01,"—The draft report of the independent committee reviewing the Australian Wheat Board's single desk powers as required under the National Competition Policy process was released for discussion on 13 October, and that is the reason that this day many farming representatives are visiting Parliament House to put their position and view about the future of the Australian Wheat Board's single desk. I want to take this opportunity, therefore, to make some comments about the single desk powers of the Australian Wheat Board, its vital importance to the Australian wheat growers and the community benefits generally that flow from the continuation of this power. John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, said earlier this year:
While ever Australia's wheat growers clearly benefit and while ever the nation's export performance is enhanced, while ever the National Party is there, we will not budge in our rock solid support for the single desk export powers of the Australian Wheat Board 
I share that view. So concerned am I about the possible change to the single desk powers, I have promoted attendance at a meeting in Lockhart in New South Wales this Friday to hear growers' views on the draft. The Lockhart meeting was initiated by the National Party's Farrer candidate, Councillor Bill Bott, a wheat grower who takes a genuine interest in ensuring the best outcome for the industry, and that is the retention of the single desk. The aim of the meeting is to find out what growers and industry stakeholders think should happen to the industry and to hear their thoughts on the draft report examination of the overall net benefits of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989, which continued at that time the single desk. I will tell the meeting that I am disappointed in the draft review report because it contradicts the benefits of a single desk system by encouraging trial deregulation in niche export markets. The report appears to put off the evil day for about five minutes because a further review has been flagged for four years time. Deregulation would serve only to benefit international competitors, not Australian wheat growers, by eroding price premiums. The single desk is the only way growers can best be represented in the international marketplace, where AWB International has the muscle to negotiate fair returns against subsidised international competitors. Our major competitor, the United States, does not like our single desk. That seems to me to be a pretty good reason for keeping it. They have valued the benefit of the single desk in double digits up to, at least, $US25 per tonne—a very substantial amount of money. International grain companies concede and acknowledge privately that they can never be as dependable as the Australian Wheat Board.  
Why is there so much concern about this issue in country Australia? The reason is that the Australian wheat industry is a major export provider for around 155,000 Australians, and it accounts for 18 per cent of world wheat exports. We are the world's third largest wheat exporter. It is now our largest agricultural export after wool and, like wool, it spreads its tentacles right throughout regional Australia. Country towns and regions may not all grow wheat but a lot of them do, and a lot of the support and infrastructure required for those country and regional communities depends on a healthy wheat crop and price. Around $4 billion worth of wheat was harvested in Australia last year, of which $3.5 billion was exported. The livelihood of these farmers, their families and their communities is dependent on a buoyant industry. Australia's major international competitors in 1999-2000 were: the United States, which accounts for around 30 per cent of world wheat exports; Canada, which accounts for 19 per cent; the European Union, which accounts for 16 per cent; and Argentina, which accounts for nine per cent—in all around 100 million tonnes of wheat in the world wheat export market. These are countries used to playing hard ball in world markets. We need a unified voice in dealing with these markets; we do not need one grower competing against another grower by reducing prices, we do not need Australian wheat competing against Australian wheat—not in niche markets, not in new markets, not in any markets, I would suggest.
Australia in the past four years has increased its market share from 15 to 18 per cent. This is a remarkable achievement in a static world market with about a 40 million tonne oversupply. It has done so because it has had the single desk. The $3.5 billion of Australian wheat exported every year comes from over 31,000 farms and, therefore, it is imperative that we get the best system possible to sell our product. If we go back in history, the National Party, which I represent in this place, cut its teeth on orderly marketing and a fair return to growers. The single desk will help ensure the future of grower returns, especially in a distorted international market where the Europeans and Americans receive production and/or export subsidies. To combat this we need to retain our integrated system, which involves market research, quality assurance, technical assistance, a national logistics program, a historical knowledge of the national crop and extensive research into each year's crop well before it is harvested. We need the continuation of that service provided by the Australian Wheat Board. It would be very difficult to convince me that somebody else could do this better than the Australian Wheat Board with its long experience of exporting the Australian crop.
If we look particularly at niche markets, one of the areas which could be opened up under the draft suggestions, there is an argument that small and specialised opportunities exist. But the single desk has proven itself flexible enough to act on these market opportunities and has continued to do so. Recognising the need to meet these market needs, in 1993 the Australian Wheat Board established the container and bagged export system. While the Wheat Export Authority took over responsibility for the container and bagged export system in July last year, other groups are given permission to export into niche markets. In fact, around 90 per cent of applications to the Wheat Export Authority were granted export consents. The system works—do not mess with it. 
I have held meetings with concerned growers, with representatives of the Grains Council of Australia and with the Australian Wheat Board. I now look forward to meeting with many more growers at Lockhart on Friday, and I congratulate the Nationals' candidate for Farrer, Mr Bill Bott, for his initiative in organising this meeting. I also look forward to welcoming Mr Bott—who will be a worthy replacement for the former Leader of the National Party of Australia, the Hon. Tim Fischer—as the member for Farrer next year. But, most importantly, I look forward to the continued orderly marketing of the Australian wheat crop for many years to come and to the benefits that flow to all of us in regional Australia and to the Australian economy from the very wise and proper usage of the single desk powers of the Australian Wheat Board.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Wheat: Single Desk Selling</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-01,"—My question is directed to Senator Ellison, Special Minister of State. For a moment I thought he had been replaced by Senator Alston, which would be going from the sublime to the ridiculous. I refer to the question I asked Senator Ellison yesterday regarding the allegation from former minister David Jull regarding departmental maladministration in relation to health insurance deductions for one of his staff. Given that the minister was unable to answer the question yesterday, I would like to give him the opportunity to answer it today. Has the minister ascertained whether in fact departmental officers were at fault, as alleged by Mr Jull? Will the minister now take the opportunity to rebut Mr Jull's criticism and clear his department's officers of this allegation?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Finance and Administration: Ministerial and Parliamentary Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question

What we want answered—and this is the question the minister has failed to answer—is who was wrong here, Minister. Was it your public servants, as alleged by Mr Jull, or were Mr Jull's allegations not soundly based? Aren't the public servants entitled to some sort of public defence from you if in fact they have been slurred incorrectly? Why will you not defend your public servants and answer the question?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-01,"—I thought I had answered the matter quite adequately yesterday. There had been contact between the Department of Finance and Administration and Mr Jull's staff member. I am not going to personal details in relation to anybody's staff— 
—He did. Clear your department.
—Other people might, but I am not. Quite frankly, as I understand it, there has been a resolution of the matter, and that is it. The opposition might be very unhappy that that matter has been resolved, but the fact is that the department has been in touch with Mr Jull's staff member, and my advice is that the matter has been resolved. I can just say that it is a pity that the opposition is raising these sorts of aspects—
—Mr Jull raised it; not us. He raised it on AM.
—Senator Ray is saying that Mr Jull raised these matters. Mr Jull may or may not have raised these matters. That is not the issue. The fact is the opposition is asking questions which go to the personal details of a member of staff, and that is outrageous.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Finance and Administration: Ministerial and Parliamentary Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer

In fact, what I am saying is that the Department of Finance and Administration acted appropriately. The matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of Mr Jull's employee. Where is the problem with that? And, as I said yesterday, the MAPS section of the Department of Finance and Administration is a very busy one, and one which provides a very good service to members of parliament and also to the hardworking staff of members of parliament.

Does the Prime Minister support calls by his own chairman of the Primary Industries and Regional Services Committee, Mrs Fran Bailey, for the fuel excise rise due in February to be frozen? Given that Mrs Bailey has joined a growing list of Liberal backbenchers calling for the fuel excise rise to be frozen, why are they all being ignored?

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I was not going to ask Senator Hill a supplementary question, Madam President, but his response causes me to do so. I put it to him: when Mrs Bailey said, in regard to the skyrocketing petrol prices, `I am doing everything that I can to make sure that the government does understand,' does this mean that the government currently does not understand the pain being felt by motorists, or is Mrs Bailey just panicking yet again? Wouldn't one way to relieve motorists' pain over skyrocketing fuel prices simply be to honour the Prime Minister's promise that petrol prices would not rise as a result of the GST?

"Hill, Senator Robert",LP,2000-11-01,"—I could wonder what the Labor Party's policy is on this matter, but I would not have to wonder long, because they have no policies on any subject after four years of opposition.
—They had roll-back.
—Yes, for a moment they had roll-back. They were forced into roll-back because they adopted the GST. When they adopted the goods and services tax they had to differentiate the product a bit, so they took the GST with roll-back. Roll-back was never defined because, if they were to roll back the GST, they would have to come clean and say they were going to put up income taxes. That is what they last did in government—they pushed up income taxes, interest rates and inflation and sent a whole lot of Australian businesses broke. That is what we know about the Labor Party's policies. They know only the one policy: a little bit of indefinable roll-back in conjunction with the goods and services tax—that is all they have got. The nerve of the Labor Party, after four years in opposition of not producing one policy, to then come in here and talk about the government's policies—I ask you! What an embarrassment for the Labor Party because it demonstrates and illustrates their total failure as an opposition.
—Rubbish!
—But, Senator Cook, you have failed. Part of being in opposition is to prepare yourself as an alternative government—to develop a program to take to the people. Is there an education policy? No. Is there a tax policy? A little bit of roll-back.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! There is too much noise in the chamber and, Senator Hill, you should address your remarks to the chair.
—Do they have a health policy? No. Ask Senator Bolkus this: do they have an environment policy? No. They do not have any policies. They are not interested in preparing themselves for government. That is part of the role of opposition. When we were in opposition the Labor Party came into the Senate every day and said, `Where are your policies?' They demanded policies of us. If they have failed in opposition, they certainly do not deserve a go in government. They have another year or so before the next election. Perhaps instead of worrying about the government's policies they ought to go to the backrooms and start working on a few of their own so we can have a political debate in this country. Politics is all about a contest of ideas, and there are no ideas in the Labor Party. There is no contribution to the development of a program and no demonstration that the Labor Party is in any way—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! There are far too many senators making too much noise.
—The only reference—
—Senator Hill, I have not recalled you. I am waiting so that I can hear the answer myself.
—I will give you the answer, Madam President. The answer is petrol prices have gone up in Australia because the price of crude has gone up. Everybody knows that except the Australian Labor Party. If the Labor Party comes in and says that taxation should be reduced because the price of crude has gone up, then it would have to be made up in the form of excise from somewhere else. This government does not believe that would be in the national interest at this time, and therefore the policy that logically follows is not to reduce excise.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Fuel Excise</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-11-01,"—Petrol prices did not rise as a result of the GST. I must say in passing that Mrs Bailey is a good local member. She is the sort of local member you get on the Liberal side of parliament that is interested in the small business of her electorate and, as a result of that, is not happy with the price of crude increasing at the rate that it has. But that is out of the hands of this government. That is a worldwide phenomenon that is beyond the control of this government. However, this government will continue to be a low tax government and continue to present a lower tax alternative. If the Labor Party ever comes clean on its taxation policy, the people of Australia will have two policies to compare: Labor's high tax alternative with the coalition's lower tax alternative, because it has always been the case and will continue to be the case.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2000-11-01,"—My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Vanstone. Will the minister outline to the Senate the government's strategy to counter serious crimes against the Australian community, such as money laundering, drug trafficking and people smuggling?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Law Enforcement: Strategies</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2000-11-01,"—I thank Senator Tierney for the question. It is a very astute question. Senator Cooney or Senator Tierney rightly knows—and I am sure that Senator Cooney knows—that money laundering is a very serious offence and that, if you chase the money, you will get the criminals. There is an Indonesian saying: ada gula ada semut. That means: where there is sugar, there are ants. That is the principle on which all money tracking agencies work: if you follow the money, you get the big-time crooks.
—The level of noise in the chamber is unacceptably high. I remind senators of the standing orders and their obligation to abide by them.
—So, in answer to Senator Tierney's question, it is critical that, if any government wishes to give its law enforcement agencies the capacity to fight serious crime, it must provide the law enforcement agencies with financial intelligence. AUSTRAC is the government's financial intelligence agency. It is headed by Elizabeth Montano, who I believe has bipartisan support. She was first appointed by Labor and was reappointed by this government, and she has this government's complete confidence. She knows how to spend money well and effectively and to achieve results. She is, in fact, the most senior woman in law enforcement in Australia.
AUSTRAC regulates the financial system to detect and deter misuse by criminals. It is excellent value for taxpayers' money. By the nature of its work, it is not known by many Australians—although some interested in law enforcement do know—just how good a job it does. AUSTRAC targets all suspicious transactions, all cash transactions over $10,000 and all international funds transfers, and it ensures that financial institutions comply with a 100-point ID check. Last year there were about seven million financial transaction reports received. AUSTRAC's work in tracking dirty money allows the Federal Police, the National Crime Authority, Customs and state law enforcement to break up organised criminals involved in fraud, illicit drugs and people smuggling. The annual report recently tabled outlines a number of investigations by the Federal Police, Customs, the National Crime Authority and the tax office, all of which have received invaluable assistance from AUSTRAC. AUSTRAC intelligence was used by partner agencies in 628 investigations, of which 430 were regarded as significant.
Just let me give two examples. The tax office indicates that, over the last five financial years, $160 million—or $44 million in 1999-2000—in additional tax and penalties was raised by the tax office. That can be attributed solely to financial transaction reporting by AUSTRAC. So, without AUSTRAC, there would be $160 million less in additional tax and penalties raised by the tax office. Similarly, the New South Wales Crime Commission's use of FTR information has led to a dramatic increase over the last year in the value of proceeds restrained to $38.4 million, up from a mere $12 million the year before.  
AUSTRAC data can be used to reveal identities of unknown persons, to reveal associations between them, to target movements of expenditure, to determine the size of criminal syndicates, to locate proceeds and to reveal links between targets. The global nature of law enforcement means that AUSTRAC has obviously an increased international role. It does that through the financial transactions task force and the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering. AUSTRAC needed more money when we came to government—it was already there when we came. We have given it more money, targeted money, and it is being used appropriately and successfully.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Law Enforcement: Strategies</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-11-01,"—In reference to the matters raised by Senator Cook, I am sure this was not deliberate. If it were, it would cause me some concern and you would not find me the usual cooperative minister that I am. My understanding, and the advice I have got, is that notice of this came to my office just after question time started today. If you wish to play it that way, that is fine, but it does mean that sometimes the information you want cannot be provided. Let me say that I share Senator Cook's concern if questions are not responded to. I follow these things up, Senator Cook, as you would know. Sometimes, because it involves other people, whether an answer can be tabled is not entirely within my control.
Let me say, Senator Cook, that I will pursue this matter. I think a number of the answers are very close to being tabled. It is my view that we should always try to table answers as quickly as possible. Sometimes the information requested is voluminous and this will of course take more time. On other occasions, of course, the answer is out of my control and it requires the approval of others. Senator Cook, I will pursue this matter for you. I hope that a number of those answers can be tabled in the short run, but it is a bit difficult if your office phone up just after question time starts. I assume that was a mistake.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
Could I go to the first part of the explanation, which was really a veiled allegation against me or my office. In September, when time to answer these questions had expired, the minister assured me that the answers would be provided forthwith. I then asked him about the answers later in September. He assured me again that the answers would be provided in a matter of days. The answers are still outstanding. Minister, when my office—before question time—gave notice to you that I would be asking this question, it is bordering on the indecent for you to turn around and infer that we are playing games. These are serious questions, Minister. You are out of time now. It is November now; these questions were due in the early part of September. After you were given proper notice, you are well out of time, and to make that allegation against my office is despicable in the circumstances.
—Order! Address the chair, please.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President, I shall do that.
—That is a trifle overreacting.
—Order, Senator Kemp!
—I take that interjection, Madam Deputy President. It is not a trifle. 
—All interjections are disorderly, and Senator Kemp's was even more so because he was not in his seat when he interjected.
—I note what the minister, walking through the chamber, said. The only way many Australians have to find out information is through a question being asked in the Senate, and it is the obligation of the executive—in this case, this minister—to answer those questions. There are settled rules about how those answers should be given. One of those rules is that, when the questions are asked in writing—as is the case on this occasion—the answers are to be given within a specified time. If that specified time cannot be complied with, it is entirely appropriate for senators who have asked those questions to rise in their places and ask: when will those questions be answered? I did that on 6, 7 and 18 September respectively, and I was advised on all those occasions that the answers would be provided in a matter of days. It is now November, and we are still waiting for the answers.
I go to the next point. In his comments, the minister said that sometimes these questions can be complex, that sometimes these questions can be voluminous and that he is unhappy that people are taking a long time to answer them. I understand that, as part of the Westminster system, ministers take responsibility for their departments and, if their departments do not act according to the needs of the parliament, the ministers have a decent course of action, which is to apologise to the parliament or—in certain circumstances—to resign their portfolio if they cannot make their departments answer the needs of this parliament. It is not an excuse for a minister, who has the responsibility, to blame his department. This is a classic case of blaming the office staff when the minister makes a mistake—but, in this case, he has blamed officers of his department.
The second part of that answer referred to the complexity of these questions. These questions relate to important matters in the Treasury and economics portfolios, for which the minister is responsible. They are not matters that are arcane; they are mainstream issues. They are not matters that are difficult or complex. They are matters that this department deals with all of the time—I repeat: all of the time. It is just a matter of spinning the dials, consulting the files and composing an answer. So to blame the department for not doing it and to hide behind departmental inefficiency is, in this system of government, to pass on a responsibility that the minister must accept. The minister's refusal to take responsibility for that today is a reflection on him.
Finally, the minister's attitude does leave something to be desired. If in these circumstances there are genuine mistakes, we in the opposition will understand that. Genuine mistakes do occur and people should be given latitude when they occur. But he has not said that there has been a mistake. He has not said that he misled us when, on the three previous occasions on which I asked about these questions, he promised an immediate answer. He has not said that his definition of `immediate' may span two or three months. There is no apparent mistake here, the minister has offered no apology to the parliament and, worst of all, he did not today say when these questions will be answered.
I do not want to unnecessarily delay the affairs of the parliament—there are other important matters to proceed with—but I want to say that the parliament's efficient operation does depend on ministers doing their duty and meeting their responsibilities to this chamber efficiently. If they do not act efficiently and do not meet their responsibilities, it does delay the whole process. This minister is now serially guilty of declining to answer these questions in an appropriate time span and in the terms of this parliament. I would have thought that some reasonable explanation would have been made. It has not been. I would have thought that, if the minister had exercised proper due diligence and taken responsibility for this, he could have said when these answers would be given. He did not do that. I now ask him—although he has left the chamber; one presumes he will follow this debate—
—He scurried out.
—`Scurried out' is indeed a proper description. He should read the Hansard and see these words. He ought to now guarantee that, before this parliament rises for its recess at the weekend, the answers to these questions will be provided to the chamber.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill), to questions without notice asked today, relating to the goods and services tax and petrol prices.
This government is obviously in total denial mode. Senator Hill said—as has every government minister; and I emphasise that they are ministers, not backbenchers—again today:
Petrol prices did not rise as a result of the GST.
That is wrong—that is the first thing. For Senator Hill's edification, all you need to do—and I think Senator Cook made it quite clear in an interjection—is work out the price of crude oil internationally; work out the price in Australia; add the excise, which is a percentage; and add the GST, which is a percentage. It is not that difficult. There is not one person in regional Australia—and I know that other government members will be responding—who would deny the fact that the GST has been a major factor. We are not saying that the GST is entirely responsible for the increase in petrol prices; it is responsible in part and has exacerbated an already outrageous situation.
Senator Hill then went on to make a further mistake, and the second mistake he made was saying that the GST flows to the states—`It's a problem for the states; we won't be bullied or verballed by the states.' For those in this chamber who are even passingly economically literate, the reality is that the cross-over point in terms of GST revenue for states like New South Wales and Victoria, for example, is 2006-07 before they see one red cent of additional GST revenue. That is the first point. Secondly, he said that Labor wants to perpetuate a myth that the price of petrol has increased as a result of the GST. It is not a myth. Every single person in regional Australia knows it; government members opposite who are out in the streets in regional Australia know it. 
Senator Hill then said: `Where would we get the money if we were to take remedial action and provide some genuine relief for people in regional Australia?' There are a couple of sources. You might want to have a look at the $13 billion surplus that Treasurer Costello announced the other day, for example. Or you may want to have a look at the windfall the government has as a result of petrol. The estimates in relation to that are variously described as being between $400 million and $1 billion—that is the aggregate of the rent tax, the GST and excise. There is plenty of money there, and to say Labor have not put forward any concrete proposals is simply incorrect; we have. Not only that, we have done the government the great favour of costing them, so the government does not have to go to the trouble. 
This government is in real strife in regional Australia, and until such time as somebody has the intestinal fortitude, as Fran Bailey has and as the Speaker in the lower house has, to say, `Yes, the GST has been a factor and has exacerbated the situation in regional Australia,' no action will be taken. Yesterday we had the Prime Minister again saying: 
There have been no broken promises in relation to fuel excise by the government. That is a figment of the imagination of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. 
I challenge the people from the government who will follow me in this debate to agree with the Prime Minister and restate that. I would like them to restate that there have been no broken promises. Senator Hill has done it, but he is the leader and he has to say these things. I would like the government members who follow me in this debate to also restate it—particularly the National Party members. Let us have a look at what the government has said. On 13 August 1998, Mr Howard said in an address to the nation:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist. 
He does not like the word `ordinary' much these days, but at that time he used the words `ordinary motorist'. I have to agree with Laurie Oakes in relation to this. On 7 September the Treasurer said:
The government's proposed new tax system will not lead to any increase in petrol prices.
In August the Treasurer said—this is in terms of retrospectivity since the introduction of the GST:
As a result of the GST, petrol prices were either stable or overall fell.
That is absolutely incorrect. The reality is that Labor are seizing the initiative. We are instituting a major inquiry into petrol. One of the primary objects of that committee is to establish the nature of the windfall and ensure that the calculations that we have done are correct in relation to petrol. Whilst the government are in total denial mode they will continue to be in real strife in regional Australia. People like Fran Bailey will continue to lobby. People like the Speaker in the lower house will continue to put the truth in their newsletters, and the National Party will continue to decline as a major political force in this country.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2000-11-01,"—This issue is the big political issue of the moment. It is great that we have got back to politics.
—It's an issue, is it?
—Yes, let us debate some real issues in this parliament. The rise in oil prices worldwide is a major issue that impacts on our economy, as it has done a number of times in the past. On a number of occasions—1973, 1979 and now most recently—there has been a considerable rise in the price of crude oil, which has flowed through to affect the economy. What has happened this time as compared with previous times is that the inflation that had been set off previously shows no sign of reappearing as a result of these rises in recent times. We have had a small spike in inflation as a result of the GST. Despite a campaign by the Labor Party, going back many years, in which they said that the GST would lead to a 10 per cent increase in prices, the real figure in the CPI is only a little over three per cent. That includes not only the GST effect but the oil price effect over the last few years. Time and again the opposition tries to put to people that it is somehow the government's fault that prices have gone up to this extent.
I see Labor senators nodding, so let us go back to the real facts about why the price of petrol has gone up. It has gone up, basically, because the price of crude oil internationally has gone up. It has gone from a figure of $11 a barrel at the start of last year up to $33 a barrel. For every dollar a barrel the price of petrol goes up, the price of crude oil goes up and the price of petrol at the petrol pump goes up by 1c. Obviously a 20-odd cents price rise is the result of what has happened overseas with the oil cartels. This is something that is totally out of the control of the federal government. What has not been out of the control of the federal government, going back over the last 20 years, is petrol excise. Let us have a look at Labor's record on petrol excise, going back to the early part of the 1980s. In 1983, when they assumed office, it was 6.1c per litre. When Labor left office in 1996, Senator Mackay, do you know what the figure was? It was up from 6.1c to 34.1c. That excise was put up by the Labor Party.
—Did you oppose it? Did you say you would scrap it?
—Tell us, Senator Mackay—it is a pity you do not have a chance to respond, but maybe Senator Murphy will tell us—how much the Labor government compensated the people of Australia for that rise. How much did you compensate them? Nothing—not 1c. You just kept putting it up. You kept using the bowser as the cash cow. You used the motorist as the main way in which to raise money through the petrol pump. So when you come in here and start talking about excise as a component, you should go back to your own shameful record and the way in which you increased it when you were in government. Have a look at what we have done, while in government, to the excise rate. Have we put it up? We have not put the excise rate up at all—not once since 1996. If you had been in power, because your governments are so cash hungry you would have kept putting it up. We have not done that. Indeed, in relation to one of the base drivers of the economy, diesel fuel—the cost of which, particularly in rural areas, is so important—we have actually reduced it considerably over that time. So, for people driving trucks, for people on farms, a major cushion has been created by the drop in excise on diesel fuel over the last year. 
In comparison with the state of the Australian economy at the time of the oil shocks in the 1970s, the economy is in quite good shape this time. I am quite convinced that we will withstand this shock of external oil prices—we will certainly withstand it a lot better than if a Labor government had been in power.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-11-01,"—What an interesting contribution from Senator Tierney! The government would like us to believe that this is about crude oil prices, and they would like to blame us and talk about the excise rate when we were government. But the crux of this issue is this: this government made a promise to the Australian people. The roots of this story begin in approximately August 1998, when the Prime Minister said:
The ordinary motorist will not pay any more for petrol, but, of course, they will not get that reduction. They won't pay any more, though. It won't go up ...
Senator Tierney says, `Oh, it's crude oil prices.' Obviously the Prime Minister did not know anything about crude oil prices in August 1998, otherwise he would have understood that crude oil prices could affect the price of petrol and he would not have made such a stupid promise. But make it he did. He was followed by the Treasurer and Mark Vaile, who said that petrol prices would not rise anywhere as a result of the GST. That was September 1998. On we roll. We get to January this year. The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, said on 2UE that the price of petrol would actually fall. He obviously did not understand anything about crude oil prices.
—What date was that?
—This was in January this year.
—Yes, he did, Senator Faulkner—he had a bit of a blow-out. But that was not his only blow-out; he had a blow-out again just recently when he made a similar claim. The process moved on. On 9 February 2000, the Prime Minister, when he was questioned about the price of petrol and the GST, again said:
I can only repeat what is patently our case and that is that we're going to honour our commitment.
I say to Senator Tierney and to Senator Hill that that is the crux of the issue: you made a promise. Senator Hill, as was pointed out by Senator Mackay, came in here today and said that the GST did not impact on the price of petrol—as did the Treasurer in an interview with Steve Liebmann on 23 August this year. Steve Liebmann asked:
Yesterday, BP said, “There never has, never was, never will be that 1.5 cents saving the government suggested there was”. Last night Mobil said “The GST has added between 2.5 and 3 cents a litre to the pump price”. Are they trying to kid the public?
The Treasurer said:
The GST didn't add anything to the pump price.
And the Treasurer, I must say, made a comment in answer to another question from Mr Liebmann, who asked:
So are they profiteering, the oil companies, and making the Government and the GST the scapegoat?
The Treasurer said:
If there is profiteering, it will be fully investigated.
And he said:
... we'll have the Australian Competition Consumer Commission looking at that.
The old ACCC looked at a few things, and they made a report. I think Terry McCrann has done their report up very nicely. He said:
`It's official: government is cheating on petrol'.
Price-buster Allan Fels and his ACCC have nailed John Howard and Peter Costello for welshing on their petrol price promise.
That is absolutely true, because we went through the process. What does that do? What does that take away from the Australian motorist? In the first instance, Mr McCrann points out: 
Now that might not seem much in a world of $1 petrol and where the pump price can change 10c literally overnight.
But it still adds to something like $400 million in the taxman's pocket rather than yours, the motorist.
Then we come to the movement in excise, on top of which is the GST. What do we end up with? At the end of the process by February next year, the additional tax take will be $1,300 million from Australian motorists. You made a promise that you would not do that to Australian motorists. You said you would not lump them with increased taxes on petrol. That is the promise we want to make you keep, and that is why we have said we will reduce the price of petrol by 2c a litre. You ought to fess up. You ought to keep your promise. You ought to do what Fran Bailey is suggesting you do, and at least make some move towards honouring the commitment you gave back in August 1998.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-11-01,"—I join this debate by referring back to Senator Hill's answer in the Senate in question time; that is, what is your policy going to be? What is the proposition that you are putting to the parliament? You say you are going to reduce the excise: by how much—1c or 5c? It would have to be 5c at least, and you are talking about billions of dollars. With your record of expenditure, what will be cut? Where will that money be spent? On extra education and services? I heard Senator Mackay tell us that she would dip into the surplus—
—It is $13 billion.
—the $13 billion surplus. Senator, you should speak to your shadow Treasurer about that. He is the man who wants a bigger surplus. He wants more than $13 billion. He will not let you dip into that, so you have got no policy coherence at all.
In relation to the other question you put about whether we would support John Howard's commitments: of course the speakers on this side do, as supported by the ACCC. The ACCC found in its inquiry that for the quarter from the week ending 30 June to the week ending 29 September the actual rise in petrol prices was below the level that was expected, taking into account the main underlying factors that influence petrol prices. The report stated:
The Commission's analysis suggests that actual fuel prices have not increased as much as expected on the basis of movements in underlying factors including historical wholesale and retail margins. This is not inconsistent with the suggestion that cost savings from the NTS changes have been passed on.
That is from page 2 of the ACCC report. So the ACCC report confirms the government's position that the petrol prices have been largely driven by international oil prices. So this is not unique to Australia, as you are attempting to suggest in the debate; this is a worldwide problem. We have seen on our news services the blockades that have occurred in France and in England. We did not get the same sort of reaction here in Australia because, quite frankly, the governments overseas have a greater taxing effect on the pump price of petrol than Australia does. In England it is up to 75 per cent of the pump price. In other European countries it is up to 85 per cent of the pump price. Australia actually has one of the lowest taxes on pump price oil in the world. So in this country we simply did not get the same reaction as occurred worldwide.
Senator Mackay suggests that the government are entirely in denial mode. We are not unaware of the volatility of petrol politics, particularly in the rural and regional areas. We know only too well how the rural and regional areas—more than the city areas—rely on fuel for not only their farm businesses and small businesses but also their family households in particular. In relation to rural and regional farm businesses, appropriate tax deductions were brought in with the new tax system—for example, the 100 per cent diesel fuel rebate. Over $2.2 billion, in fact, has been cut from the fuel excise with the new tax system—6.7c per litre was reduced from excise after 1 July. There is a 100 per cent rebate on diesel fuel. There is also the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, providing 1c or 2c per litre to retailers to reduce the gap between the city— 
—It's not being passed on. Where is it?
—It is operating. Over $500 million over four years has been outlaid. All in all, over $2 billion since 1 July has been taken out of the tax system. So we are not insensitive to the rural and regional areas' reliance on fuel. We know the volatility of politics, but we put it to you that this is a worldwide phenomenon, totally based on the price of a barrel of oil, which is up to about $US60, a jump from February 1999 of $US11. So you can see the enormous cascading effect on the pump price.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I have to join with my colleagues in taking note of Senator Hill's answer this afternoon, because I think, as Senators Mackay and Murphy said earlier this afternoon, the government is in denial mode. I just want to get back on the record what this excise is. It is a petrol and diesel excise that is indexed twice a year to movements in the consumer price index, and the reason for that is to maintain its real value. There are no other taxes in this country that are indexed. This is the only one, as I understand, that is indexed. If anything is unique in what we are discussing this afternoon it is that, not anything that Senator McGauran has put to us. These excises are deliberately indexed, as I said, to maintain their real value.
Why are they indexed? As Senator Murphy pointed out, in the next financial year this tax will raise $13 billion for the government, and they may have already allocated how they are going to spend that money. The next time this tax is to be indexed is in February of next year. Along with a number of businesses, communities, trade unions and organisations throughout the country, we have called upon the Prime Minister to not persist with this indexation. The government do not have to index this, but the government have decided, no doubt, that they are going to spend this $13 billion. In the next financial year the GST will raise $24 billion, which they have no doubt allocated for spending. Think about it: $13 billion with $24 billion: that is a lot of revenue that the government are going to collect from some indirect taxation. That is why it is not going to be reduced; because they are not going to keep their word on it.
I am very interested to have seen a number of the coalition members of parliament parading over the last few weeks about the cost of the diesel and the petrol excise. They have been playing classic home and away games. A number of them have been getting themselves in their local or metropolitan papers saying, `We're going to raise this with the Prime Minister. We're going to raise this within the party room.' And what have they done? 
We have Senator Winston Crane, who was almost the first cab off the rank. We have Senator Lightfoot, who continues to be a critic of the government. We have: Mr Ross Cameron, who holds the marginal seat of Parramatta; Mr Peter Nugent; Mrs Draper; Mrs Kay Hull; the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory; Fran Bailey; Tony Lawler; Neil Andrew. All these people have played these home and away games and beaten themselves up in the metropolitan and local media. But when they have an opportunity to come down here to try to influence their party, which is in government, what do they do? They cower in some corner—they cower and cringe—and they get up here and try to defend the indefensible. We are not prepared to allow them to get away with it. I can assure you that, particularly in those marginal seats in New South Wales where I come from, we will be highlighting this hypocrisy and cowardice that a number of these government members have been displaying.
To finish on this matter, I repeat: petrol and diesel excise is indexed twice a year to movements in the consumer price index in order to maintain its real value. No other tax is managed like that in this country. So I believe, as we will see exposed over next few months, the government's inflation strategy will be in tatters. Then we will see how courageous these home and away players are.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-11-01,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown from moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of this Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 742.
Let me point out that this is a very important and very contemporary motion relating to the huge debate over funding of public education in this country. My motion simply calls for the Senate to note that there is a high level of community anger being generated by the government's new funding formula for primary and secondary schools, which will see some elite private schools granted massive Commonwealth funding assistance. It notes also the call by the Australian Education Union and the Australian Council of State Schools Organisations for the federal government to pass a schools funding continuity and stability bill and calls on the Senate to support such a bill that would give the same level of funding to private schools as to public schools next year as has occurred this year. I would have thought that this motion would have Labor Party support and would not be refused formality by the Labor Party. I hope that the Democrats would be able to support this motion as well.
I point out to the Senate that my motion is an expression of support for that very strong feeling in the Australian public domain that education funding from the Commonwealth should remain at the current levels for the public school sector as for the private school sector. Through this mechanism, we are giving a very early indication to the government that the Senate does not support its contention that some two-thirds or more of the funding in the coming year will go to the private school system. We have all heard the extraordinary excesses of the formula which would have major private schools—from the King's School in Sydney to other so-called public schools around the country which are really private schools—being very well endowed while the public school system remains retarded as far as funding is concerned.
I stand as a Green for the principle of a well-funded public school system. I stand for the principle of ensuring that everybody has access to the public school system and that they find the full facilities that are required for young Australians to get an education which will give them the options in the future which will not only give them rewarding lives but make them rewarding citizens as far as our community is concerned. As this motion says, there is a great deal of community anger because this government is moving massive amounts of taxpayers' money to the private school system, not least elite school systems, while the public school system, to which most Australian kids still go, is getting a relative starvation of funding.
—People who go to private schools pay tax.
—I would remind the interjecting Manager of Government Business that all children in Australia have access to the public school system. That is their choice.
—But not access to private schools.
—They do not have access to the private school system because they are prevented by income from going there. I would have thought that those on the opposition benches would understand that. Let me not be distracted, because the time is short. I call at this important moment for the Labor Party to look again at this motion. This motion is to support the position of the Australian Education Union and the Australian Council of State Schools Organisations in this debate. We will be dealing with the legislation shortly. I am afraid it will be brought here right on the death knock, at the eleventh hour, just before Christmas, and pushed through this place without the public debate and public input that is required. So I call on the Labor Party to think again about this motion and to iterate its support for the proposal that the motion encapsulates. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION: FUNDING</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,18,1,speech
"Carr, Senator Kim",ALP,2000-11-01,"—Senator Brown has asked the chamber today to suspend standing orders on a motion that does three things, essentially. The first issue in his motion goes to the question of the unfairness, the injustice and the lack of due process that has been established in regard to the government's new funding formula for non-government schools in this country. The second issue goes to the proposal emerging from the Australian Education Union and the Australian Council of State Schools Organisations for a replacement bill in effect that would be entitled the `schools funding continuity and stability bill'. The opposition have made abundantly clear to all who have an interest in this matter our very deep concerns about the government's $22 billion bill, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. It is a bill which will be debated next Wednesday. It is a bill which the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee has given considerable attention to, and it has been the subject of three separate return to orders. I have taken a particular interest in following this bill, and it has been the subject of some two years work through the Senate estimates as well. These are issues we take very seriously and we will be seeking next Wednesday, when this bill is discussed in the chamber, to seriously amend that bill. We trust that the government will accept the amendments, and we trust that the Democrats and the Greens are able to accept our amendments. I would be surprised, however, if the government does accept our amendments; nonetheless, one lives in hope. 
As to the proposal from the AEU and the Australian Council of State Schools Organisations to have a schools funding continuity and stability bill, we do not support that particular measure, because we are concerned to ensure stability of funding for the 10,000 schools in this country. This government is introducing a bill which will provide for quite extraordinary levels of additional support to the 61 most elite and most powerful schools in this country. That is a matter that deeply concerns us. It will continue the EBA, which has seen $27 million ripped out of government schools in this country. It will introduce new measures in regard to targeted equity payments for students in government schools, which will see less money provided for students with disabilities in government high schools. It will introduce whole new measures in terms of the administration of money. So it is a very serious proposition that requires very careful consideration by this parliament. This motion, however, does not allow us to do that. Therefore, I say to Senator Brown that the essence of what you are saying in the first part of your motion is a sentiment we share. We have sought to demonstrate the injustice of the government's proposals wherever we have gone. The fact that places like Geelong Grammar can attract $2 million extra per year seems to me to be fundamentally unjust at a time when there is such deprivation in our educational institutions in this country and when the local public education facilities are doing so badly. That is a matter the Senate ought to be considering very carefully.
I think the situation is pretty well summed up by a cartoon I saw recently in the Australian, which had the image of a state school burning down and the fire brigade arriving, pulling out its hoses and filling up the neighbouring private school's swimming pool. That sort of contrast demonstrates the sharpness of the division that is emerging on these issues insofar as the elite category 1 schools, as they are called—the 61 most powerful, most elite schools in the country—are getting such an unfair advantage because of the ideological obsessions of those opposite who have the gall to tell us that all of this is being done in the name of social justice—an extraordinary proposition. Senator Brown, I think your motion requires a bit further thought, a bit more consideration. Therefore, we cannot support the suspension of standing orders at this stage.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION: FUNDING</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,18,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-01,"—I rise to support Senator Brown's motion. I would like to share with the chamber briefly some of the emails that I have received in relation to this issue. One of them is from the New South Wales Federation of Schools Community Organisations. This is a peak state school parental organisation. In the latter part of their email, they make reference to the fact that— 
—Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: I think the senator should refer his remarks to the proposal that we suspend standing orders. I do not think you can get up and do the Len's mailbox segment of the Senate. You actually do have to suggest at some stage in your debate why one should suspend standing orders. You simply cannot get up and read out a bunch of emails in this segment. Surely if standing orders are suspended, the One Nation senator, who seems to have gone into coalition with the Greens now, will be able to read out emails from friends and citizens—
—Birthday cards and Christmas cards.
—Indeed, Senator Knowles, Christmas cards and letters from Pauline, whatever he wants. You cannot just have a little five-minute segment of Len's mail when you are discussing a motion, which is a quite serious motion, to throw away the standing orders for the rest of the afternoon to discuss Senator Brown's proposition.
—The reason I referred to the emails is in support of setting aside standing orders.
—Let me make a ruling, Senator. The previous two speakers have been given a fair degree of latitude in mentioning the substantive parts of the issue. I will declare that Senator Harris should continue, but he might like to talk about the reason for urgency as well.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. My reason for referring to the emails—and I was only going to refer to two emails—is in support of the contention that the community is extremely concerned about the government's proposal. They are expressing that concern, I believe, to all members. Therefore, it is quite appropriate to convey to the chamber the extent of this support. The reason that we should stand aside the business of the Senate is based on that amount of support so that senators will take into consideration the importance of this issue. I indicate again that I will support Senator Brown's motion.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION: FUNDING</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,18,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-01,"—The government will not be supporting this proposition. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000, as the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate has quite accurately said, will be on for debate in the Senate next week. These issues will be properly debated. It is a very important issue. Ensuring that there is equitable, sensible and soundly based funding to the public and private school system is something that is crucial to this government, crucial to the future of Australia. And if populist politicians like the Green politician down the end there and the One Nation senator from Queensland want to grandstand and be populist on this issue on a broadcast afternoon by pulling this stunt, then they will not have the support of the government, which is serious about this policy.

—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Because I am always afraid I will forget to do it, let me start by thanking those people who have helped with the report, particularly the people in the secretariat: Elton Humphery, Peter Short, Veronica Strkalj and Ingrid Zappe.
This report is extremely timely. The community debate that became very obvious to us during the course of the inquiry has been heightened, and we have been reminded of it again because of the recent report of the BSE disaster, I suppose I would call it, in the UK and the newspaper coverage of it. The fact that scientific and government encouragement suggested that eating beef was safe and it has turned out not to be has only heightened the concern of the community about these sorts of matters. It is a bit hairsplitting to say to the community, `Oh, but we are talking about genetically modified organisms not mad cow disease.' The community is, I think properly, very cautious on these matters.
Our report found that a very significant number of senior scientists are very concerned about genetically modified organisms and are certainly urging great caution in the way in which we proceed in this area. The legislation for a regulator in the area of genetic modification of organisms is extremely welcome and very overdue. I believe that is the balance the community is looking for. We need a very strong regulator to deal with the concerns in the community, to give assurance to the community and to also allow the community to enjoy the benefits that genetically modified organisms and genetic research can produce for this country. I think it is also important that Australia be involved in that research, but under very strict regulation. 
I would like to briefly talk about why our report is called A cautionary tale: fish don't lay tomatoes. `A cautionary tale' is with fond regard to Hilaire Belloc, who, I believe, wrote a series of admonitions for parents to give to children. Perhaps that is not quite what we are doing here, but I do think the admonition, or the urge for caution, is terribly important and reflects very much the sentiment of the community.
At the same time we were going through our inquiry, we learnt that one of the areas of major concern to people was not so much genetically modified organisms but the moving of genetic material across species. If people wanted to use a rust resistant wheat gene to assist with the modification of wheat, people would not have so much trouble with it. But the idea of taking fish genes to put in our tomatoes or bacterial genes to put in our canola crops and indeed using viral genes to turn on bacterial genes to modify our canola crops was a major concern that came up again and again in our inquiry. While I was being assured one day that I need not worry about genetic material moving between species, I was told I did not understand—to paraphrase the witness—that genetic material was moving between species in the bacteria in my bowel each day. I was, of course, not comforted by this fact. But at the same time it struck me that even if it were—
—Spare us!
—Senator, it could well be in your bowel too! Floating genetic material indeed! Even if that were the case, as our report title says, fish don't lay tomatoes. I think we need to recall the concern that people have about trans-species genetic material. Our report is called that to remind us forever that, at least in the year 2000, when this inquiry was conducted, that was the nature of at least some of the major concern. One of the recommendations of our report comes down very strongly on the importance of the precautionary principle and says that this bill, at least in its use of the precautionary principle, should be consistent with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It certainly seems odd to us to argue that there should be any less precaution in this bill about a regulator for the genetic modification of organisms than there might be in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.
I do believe it is very important to give an assurance to help allay community concern and also to make it clear that the precautionary principle, as understood by anybody reading properly in this area and as understood by us in making recommendations, does not mean total opposition—anything but. The precautionary principle actually says that, even if there is not absolute scientific evidence that there will be a health threat or an environmental threat, the person approving the licence must require that there be conditions set so that people behave as though there will be a threat to the environment. It does not say, `Don't proceed.' It says, `Proceed with caution and keep doing the research to confirm or substantiate that caution.'
Our committee also heard that the community is not at all helped by the difference between genetically modified organisms, genetically manipulated organisms, genetic engineering or even the new term `transgenic processes'. This is a loose set of words, and it is hard to pin down what exactly is being referred to. But the lack of precision in the language is actually assisting the concern in the community. I believe that the more open we can be about what exactly is being described, the more the community will be appreciative of being taken into confidence and provided with facts instead of being asked to cope with slippery language that skids over an area of major concern for the community.
In our report, the majority recommended that, because the regulator will be having an extremely significant responsibility and onus placed upon them, it would therefore be better to have not a single, one-person regulator but a regulator authority of three people so that that burden of responsibility can be shared. We thought it was important that there be third party appeal allowed and also recommended that there be processes to exclude mischievous appeals. We do not believe that this is, in our recommendation, licensing anybody who wants to to complain regularly about prospective damage to the environment or to health. We believe it is possible to weed out the mischievous complainants or litigants, but we also believe it is important that the community have the confidence of knowing that, under the legislation, if there were a properly constituted organisation with credibility in the area, they should have the opportunity for an appeal, should they see evidence to give them great concern. 
We believe that discussion of the importance of having a regulator with sufficient powers is very timely. One of the concerns for us was the discovery during our inquiry of, for example, the leakage of the genetically modified organisms in the canola crop in Mount Gambier and the evidence given to us by Aventis when they said on the record that they would have behaved differently if there had been a regulator. Our report is not a witch-hunt on previous inquiries into these areas, but we want to make it clear to companies that this legislation, with the recommendations for amendment that our committee has put in, allows the regulator to say to Aventis or to any other company, `If you are licensed to proceed, you should know that your behaviour will be closely supervised, that we have policing powers to check that you are doing what you say you are doing, and that, if you do not do that, there will be significant penalties.' Companies need to know that this is not the United States when it comes to the genetic modification of organisms.
Finally, I think it is very critical that we continue major research with adequate funding and that, if we are talking to the community and the community want the regulator and want the discussion about these inquiries, it must be a fiercely independent campaign. The protagonists, the scientists doing the research and the investigations, are no longer trusted by the community. They want a very clearly independent education campaign so that they will be able to take comfort in the information and assurances that are provided to them. Our inquiry has been an extremely valuable one. The legislation to introduce a regulator is very timely and very welcome. We can then have the comfort of the benefits of genetic modification but an assurance so that people in this country will know that they need to get a licence and that they need to proceed properly. The community need to be comforted by our behaviour. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Report of Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-11-01,"—There is no doubt that the Gene Technology Bill 2000 represents the strongest, most practical and comprehensive legislation to regulate the risks associated with gene technology yet developed by any country in the world. It is therefore disturbing to think that this report has such a flippant and wrongful heading: A cautionary tale: fish don't lay tomatoes. In Senator Crowley's comments just a moment ago, to further exacerbate that misleading title she drew an analogy between mad cow disease and gene technology. I am sorry, but this is now getting quite out of hand.
There has been a requirement in Australia for many years to have labelling laws and a regulator for gene technology. The Labor Party were in office for 13 years and did nothing about this issue. I see Senator Crowley leaving the chamber, and I am sorry, because this is particularly important. The Labor Party gave a commitment to this government that they would see this legislation through the parliament before the end of this year, to be enacted and operational by 1 January 2001. Thanks to the way in which the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens have joined forces, this will not be the case.
The opposition decided that the legislation was not going to go to the legislation committee for consideration but that it was going to the reference committee—thus creating the first delay. The second delay was that it extended the reporting date. The recommendations now contained within this report would necessitate a further delay, because the whole thing that has now been negotiated with the states and signed off by the states—with the exception of Tasmania—would need renegotiation. I ask you: what is the logic of that? What about the commitments given by the Labor Party in this regard? I understand that, at a caucus meeting yesterday, Labor decided that it would proceed with this legislation. Here, we still have a report—coming from a Labor dominated committee—making recommendations about a regulator that are already contained in the legislation. This does not come as a surprise to the chair, Senator Crowley. I sent her a copy of the minority report from the government senators, detailing where the recommendations that she was advocating for this legislation were contained within the bill. Did it change anything? It changed not a paragraph, not a sentence, not a word. 
I can say with absolute assurance that this does represent the strongest and most practical comprehensive legislation of any country in the world. Why? Because that is the evidence that was provided to the committee. The other thing that mystifies me about the way in which this report has now been presented—advocating all these recommendations for change and renegotiation—is that the committee was also given very strong representations from the premiers of ALP states. They were not equivocal. Premier Bracks and Premier Beattie were not equivocal in any way, shape or form. They said that the legislation was good and that they were happy for it to go ahead sooner rather than later. So the bill is Australia's best option for identifying risks to human health and safety and the environment and for managing those risks. It addresses a complicated issue but in a measured, cautious and cost-effective way. As I say, the title of the report is so flippant that it is disgraceful. It simply fans the unfounded fears of many in the community—fears that have been promoted by some lunatic fringe that does not want to address this issue properly. That is a very sad reflection on the good quality evidence that was provided to the committee.
Unfortunately, the Labor members of the committee have fallen into the trap of recommending changes to the legislation that clearly add no value whatsoever. The Labor Party members of the committee have proposed changes that will add considerably to the cost of the regulatory system and unnecessarily complicate it. I have pointed this out to the Labor Party members, and they have simply ignored it. I have pointed out the fact that many of their recommendations will not be bought by the states. The states simply will not agree to them, so they cannot come in here and say, `We agree that this is a requirement, but we want to have wholesale change.' Why not sign off on the legislation as it is, as it has been signed off by all the states and territories—with the exception of Tasmania—with many of those states being Labor states?
By contrast, the government's Gene Technology Bill ensures all the necessary protections from risks in a way that does not unnecessarily hinder the use of technology by our science community. We have to concede that this has been going on for years. This is not something that just happened yesterday. It has been going on for years, it will continue to go on and this country needs a regulator. Let us get on and do it. It is a very serious point of concern to the government. We have an interest and a desire to ensure that the Australian scientists who contribute so much to the health, wellbeing and prosperity of this country are able to continue to make this contribution. Today is science day. Scientists are in Parliament House, seeing members of parliament and encouraging them to make sure there is better R&D funding and everything that is associated with it. The recommendations contained in this report, and the attitude of the opposition, will simply hinder that process.
It will be interesting to see what the Democrats say about this report. Senator Stott Despoja stood up in this chamber not long ago and talked about the science and technology day, advocating just the things that I mention. Yet I am fearful that she will say, `This is a pretty good report. This is pretty flash, but we're going to now put barriers in front of it.' Everyone can predict what Senator Brown is going to say, so there is no point in canvassing that. The ALP is fully aware of the brain drain crisis facing this country, and yet it blithely recommends changes to this legislation which can only exacerbate the problem. I hope that the Democrats will not join that call. This government, on the other hand, refuses to be party to a de facto moratorium on the use of the technology—something that will be brought about by these recommendations, which will quite simply make it too complicated for our R&D sector to use. They say they do not want a moratorium; what is contained in this report will simply create a moratorium. 
The bill was developed in close consultation with the R&D sector. Over 1,000 people who directly use the technology, including every single institutional biosafety committee in Australia, were provided with details and the opportunity for face-to-face discussions throughout the development of the bill. By contrast, I note with concern that there was only a small handful of scientific organisations invited by the committee to give evidence to the inquiry. While CSIRO's credentials are without dispute, that organisation does not have, and does not purport to have, a monopoly on the issue. Recommendations flowing from the inquiry that impact on the science community must therefore be viewed with concern and scepticism. In total, over 25 public meetings, many bilateral discussions and 300 submissions have informed the development of this bill. No-one can say there has not been any consultation. It has been scrutinised repeatedly and on an ongoing basis by every state and territory, by primary producers, industry, individuals in the community and many others. Everyone from the AMA to the Country Women's Association has complimented the inclusive, responsive and thorough consultation process by which this legislation has been developed. It therefore amazes me that the Labor members of this committee and, presumably, the Democrats believe that a process that has devoted minimal time and resources to this issue—and with only three days of public hearings outside Canberra—could result in a better legislative system than that developed by all jurisdictions involving over 18 months of extensive consultations. Just the mere fact that these consultations have included everyone and taken 18 months vis-a-vis three days of public hearings stands for itself. This bill should proceed immediately. It is just not acceptable to adopt the recommendations.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-11-01,"—First of all, I put on record that the job of this parliament and this chamber, which is a house of review, is to analyse, amend and improve legislation if that is desired. Secondly, Senator Knowles is correct: I am going to say that this is a good report. That is not even a reflection of the content. It is a reflection of the fact that, for the first time that I can recall, we have had a comprehensive debate into, and analysis of, the issues of biotechnology and genetic engineering. I know that my party is probably best placed to argue against the simplistic statement that this has involved minimal time and resources because, for a number of years, we have been examining these issues. In fact, in 1992 we were the first party to even mention the issue of, say, labelling for genetically modified foods. That came from the Australian Democrats. I am aware of the public consultations, because I have been in regular contact with the Department of Health and Aged Care for the last year or so while they have been ongoing. I am aware of the draft legislation that led to this bill, because the Australian Democrats read it and analysed it well before the legislation before this chamber today was even finalised.
As for the work of the committee and reflections on the title of the report, there is something that, as legislators, we have to grapple with, and that is that the general community—ordinary Australian citizens—have an interest in and fears about this issue, with differing levels of understanding of genetic engineering, genetic modification, gene technology or whatever you want to call it. Therefore, we have to respond to those concerns, those needs and those differing levels of understanding. I had a long discussion with a number of geneticists last night—yes, the Democrats talk regularly with geneticists because the Democrats have a biotechnology portfolio and we have staff who are geneticists because we care about this issue. If you want to ask why this committee took so long, it is not a political stunt to defer this process; it is because we wanted the best legislation, but half the members of this place would not be able to define genetic engineering if you put it to them. So I guess I should not lament the politicisation of this debate, because maybe it is time that science got a bit political. Maybe it is time politicians got a little scientific. Yes, FASTS is celebrating Science Meets Parliament today; it is an opportunity for some in this chamber who do not have regular contact with science policy, the portfolio or scientists per se to make contact. Maybe it is time they looked into some of those areas and got a greater level of understanding. 
Referring to the conversation I had with the geneticist last night, he acknowledged this: `Yes, indeed, it's a crude science. Anybody in the know understands that we are at the beginnings of this technology. It is not a precise science.' For those on the other side of the chamber to suddenly say, `Yes, it has been here for years; it is well understood. Therefore, this proposed regulatory scheme is fine,' shows their lack of understanding. I would be surprised if they could give a realistic definition of genetic engineering. I am glad that this report has come before the chamber. I am glad it went to a references committee because, among many other people in my party, I have strongly supported for many years some investigation into the issues before us.
The report is an encouraging development towards achieving protection for Australians and the environment. The Democrats are optimistic and supportive of a majority of the recommendations contained in the report. As I said, for many years we have had on record our concerns about commercial-in-confidence provisions in the regulation of GMOs for human consumption and in the wider community. The Democrats, as Senator Bartlett and I have stated in our additional comments to the majority report, believe that a successful gene regulatory scheme must contain two elements: firstly, community confidence and, secondly, independent information and education. 
Community confidence is a varying and multifaceted phenomenon which is reliant on several factors in a regulatory system. The community, as I have said many times in this place, is naturally sceptical of GMOs. It could be seen by some as a grassroots or even a gut-felt precautionary approach—don't worry, I do not intend to go as far as Senator Crowley did in relation to anatomy debates in this chamber—to this promising and revolutionary technology. I will never deny the dazzling potential benefits of this technology. Unlike Senator Minchin, who wishes to place such views in the same basket as those held by the flat-earthers, I believe that issues of technological change and its effective regulation will be the greatest challenge this place will have over the coming decades, and isn't this a good but small start? The Australian people are naturally sceptical, highly questioning people—natural scientists, if you like. With greater community information, education and public awareness the days of `Trust me, I'm a scientist' are perhaps long gone. Despite the attempts of the current government, we are not pretending and cannot pretend that the 1950s still exist. The Australian public requires more than the reassurances of the Ponds Institute and, unfortunately, if the regulatory system that the Gene Technology Bill 2000 currently proposes is implemented then that is what we will be given in several areas of gene technology assessment.
I want to draw specific attention this afternoon to a study, soon to be widely distributed by the Public Health Association of Australia, that shows gaping holes in and inadequacies of current assessment processes under ANZFA. Under the current system, ANZFA is responsible for assessment and approval of genetically modified organisms for food production and public consumption. However, the food authority has no independent testing facilities to ensure the scientific validity and reproducability of data provided in applications. The Public Health Association of Australia reviewed several applications from US based Monsanto, the agrimultinational, for release of food produced from Bt-corn, roundup ready corn and canola. It was found in the applicant data that canola, when fed to laboratory rats, in one instance caused liver enlargement of up to 16 per cent, though this finding did not warrant further investigation by the company scientist. Can you believe it! Furthermore, the Bt-corn application did not contain testing of the protein, designed to rupture the guts of butterflies, moths and other such insects, on humans. So it was not tested. Nor did it test the transfer of genetic material or protein by other animals ingesting raw GM material and the possible health effects of human consumption of these animals. 
Our Ponds Institute of Food Assessment will remain responsible for overseeing such application and approval under the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, a body which is underresourced to appropriately utilise the scientific knowledge of their employees to properly assess GMOs which are being consumed by the Australian public. To add to this poor scientific assessment of GM foods, there will be no standard risk assessment processes for all GMOs under the scheme. In fact, GMOs will have to comply to very scant requirements or none at all. The Democrats are committed to environmental risk assessment processes at least to the standard of those established under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage—and this is something the Democrats feel strongly about—must be able to assess and provide the final decision on the safety of GMOs for the environment. We maintain that this is essential to ensuring that the environment is protected from the possible adverse effects of GMOs. I note for the record the commitment given on behalf of the government by the environment minister during the original passage of the EPBC Act, when he said:
... matters that affect the environment will be referred to the environment minister for assessment and advice by that independent regulator. That will ultimately be provided for through an amendment to this legislation—
in other words, the EPBC Act—
when it passes in conjunction with the law that is going to be put in place to set up the new GTR.
That deal was reneged upon, but I will leave that for another time.
It is fundamental for the intergovernmental agreement between the states and territories that the environment be adequately protected under the regulatory system. Without such protection, what is the motivation for participating in the scheme? To ensure public and industry confidence, would it not be more effective, for example, to impose state based legislation if the Commonwealth cannot protect the natural resources and market advantages that so many of our regional economies have in agricultural production? Linked to this is the ability for the states to opt out if it is deemed desirable for that jurisdiction. Contrary to the legal advice from the IOGTR, the Tasmanian government's legal advice suggests that the opt-out clause is in keeping with WTO requirements. Certainly the Democrats will be moving an amendment, which we announced in June, for an opt-out clause for the states and territories. I hope that the support of the community and the minor parties in this place for such an amendment is reflected in the Senate when the time comes. The Democrats believe that a successful gene technology regulatory scheme must allow choice for consumers, and this choice is facilitated most effectively by an opt-out provision for the states with clear interests and concerns primarily in the regulation of agricultural GMOs. An opt-out clause provides domestic market differentiation and clear safe havens for GM-free production which consumers can clearly identify and place confidence in.
There are many other issues that I could raise in the chamber this afternoon, but time is against me. I strongly commend this report to the Australian public and the Senate. I put on record the Democrats' concerns about this legislation—its loopholes, its flaws. I maintain that it is the role of this parliament to improve that skeleton legislation. I think many of the recommendations in the committee's report will do just that. The additional recommendations by the Democrats would do it even better.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-11-01,"—I want to add a word of welcome to this report of the Community Affairs References Committee on the provisions of the Gene Technology Bill 2000. I do not have the trouble that Senator Knowles has with the cover. I think it is bright and entices the public to open up the report and read it. This issue of genetic engineering is one which involves everybody. After all, it is an issue about the food we put in our mouths, the health of the environment around us and the sort of security that the next generation will inherit from us. I am very aware of the cutting edge thinking in the world at the moment which projects forward to try to look at the outcome of the science and technology available now to six billion human beings on the planet. Consider the writings of futurists like Bill Joy, the American thinker who predicts that, within half a century or so, if you put together nanotechnology, robotics and the innovations of genetic technology—the matter at hand here today—it is quite possible to foresee the human species being overtaken by the combined wherewithal of technology and actually becoming subsidiary to the technology we are producing. The very thought of that is beyond most of us—we just do not think about it. But we have to. More immediately, many Australians are alarmed about the prospect of genetic engineering entering the food cycle and the environment—full stop. They want to know that genetic engineering will only be used in a way which is safe. 
This report has listened to the people of Australia, from the shoppers to the scientists. It is a very important benchmark in not only the debate about genetic technology but also the search for responsible laws to ensure that we make genetic engineering and its applications safe for the people of Australia and, indeed, through that set a guideline which can be taken on by people around the world who are concerned about the potential impact of genetic engineering.
The recommendations of this report, if carried through by the Senate and applied to the legislation, will give us legislation which very significantly improves on that brought forward by the government. I commend Senator Crowley for her chairing of the Community Affairs References Committee, which has brought forward this report. I have the same complaint to Senator Crowley that Senator Knowles had about bringing forward a very big list of concerns that I felt could have been incorporated into the findings of this report. I was on the other side of the fence to Senator Knowles. I think, however, we have to say—and I differ from Senator Knowles on this—that Senator Crowley has done a magnificent job in coming up with this report while trying to steer a course through these competing objections to anything brought forward to come up with this report.
In particular, I want to commend this report because it adopts the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle, which says we should not unleash technology until it is shown to be safe, was a basic outcome of the 1992 Rio conference, which brought together all of the nations and thinkers of the world to look at the impact on the environment of the way human beings are empowered through technology. It simply says—and I have got a slightly different paraphrase from Senator Crowley's—that you do not unleash technology on the human community or on the living fabric of this planet and our 30 billion fellow creatures unless you know it is safe, unless you have a mechanism for ensuring that if things get out of hand you can haul them back. There is a very wise fear held by the people of this country about genetic engineering being unleashed in a way which is not safe, in which there are not precautions and safety mechanisms. If there is one great breakthrough in this report it is that it sensibly says—eight years after Rio—that the precautionary principle is the fundamental if we are going to apply genetic technology.
However, on the issue of an opt-out clause for those states, territories and indeed local government areas that want to be GE free, this report does fall short. The report should have explicitly stated that where a community of people through their elected representatives says, `We want to keep our area GE free,' they should be able to do so. You should not be able to have a multinational corporation walk in across the top of that and start planting GE crops or experimenting with them, as they are doing all over Australia at the moment. As a Tasmanian, I very strongly support the Tasmanian government's opt out of the current national situation by keeping Tasmanian GE free at least for the current 12 months while an inquiry takes place down there. I hope that leads to Tasmania becoming the GE free state, if no other state or territory does it.
I add—I heard Senator Stott Despoja's proposed amendment—that the Greens will go one step further than saying that states and territories ought to have an opt-out amenity; we should explicitly have an opt-out for local government areas in Australia as well. This is particularly taking into account rural communities which can see a niche market coming out of being able to sell to the world their produce emblazoned as GE free. In a world that is increasingly concerned about GE products they ought to be able to do that. They should not have that option taken away from them by any doubt over the power of multinational corporations which want to come in and grow their produce within that jurisdiction. 
I would also like to have seen—and in our supplementary report the Greens have called for this—a five-year moratorium on the dissemination of genetically engineered crops around the country. I agree with the previous speaker that genetic engineering has very clear potential for alleviating human suffering and indeed for innovations in science which will be of advantage to the community. We are talking about medical innovation there, for a starter. But that is very different from the dissemination of genetic engineering into the environment and into the rural environment where, for example, it threatens the burgeoning organic farming community in Australia, which is largely based on families, very highly job intensive, and with extraordinary potential in the market, domestically and overseas. This needs to be protected, and it will not be protected if that part of our farming community is surrounded by agribusiness which is indulging in genetic engineering. We must ensure that those who involve themselves in using genetic engineering for profit make sure they are insured first, so that they can indemnify those people in their neighbourhood or consumers who are threatened by the potential of genetic engineering going wrong.
Those are some of the matters that I have addressed in the supplementary report, along with recovery provisions for loss and environmental harm through insurance or through a fund, and full site disclosures where genetically modified organisms are being placed. Why shouldn't the community know about that? Of course they should. That should be explicit. That said, I look forward to the debate on this matter in the Senate, and I look forward to contributing to Australia coming up with the world's best and safest legislation on genetic engineering.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Report of Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-01,"—I also rise to take note of the report on the Gene Technology Bill 2000 from the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. The knowledge gained from genetic engineering is no doubt of benefit to mankind. It has enormous potential when it is viewed in relation to human illness, and I believe it will, in the years to come, become a substantial process by which we will be able to cope with some of the diseases we do not have answers to today. Having said that, there is not sufficient knowledge of this science, either broadly in the community—or, I believe, to some extent even in the scientific world—to give us clear answers as to what can or will happen.
The period of time that the committee had to assess this bill and take submissions from both scientists and the public was to some degree dictated by the government's time line. So Senator Knowles's comment that there were only three days of hearings outside of Canberra implies that in some way this investigation has been rushed. But I would like to very clearly place on record that that time frame sought to take into account the government's requirements in relation to getting this report into this chamber and bringing the bill on.
The recommendations of the committee go to many different sections of the bill. The first recommendation on which I would like to comment is that the bill be amended so that the individual who has worked within the regulated industry or entity be precluded from holding the office of Gene Technology Regulator until the expiry of a two-year period. In our hearings around the country this point was raised on numerous occasions, and reference was made to the revolving door that would appear to contaminate the FDA, the Food Drug Authority, of America. So the recommendation of the committee is to address that issue where it could happen in Australia.
References have also been made to the transmission of DNA across the species, from fauna to flora, and also ultimately into the human body. Some examples of that are where we now have strawberries that actually contain DNA from salmon. This DNA has been transferred across in an effort to get them to produce in colder regions and thus extend the period in which they can be grown. But where does that place a person who has an allergy to fish? If they walk into their local store and pick up a punnet of strawberries, are they going to know that that has been genetically modified? There is also sufficient scientific evidence now, I believe, to suggest that DNA might possibly transfer through the wall of the intestine—something that was not considered before, but there are scientific cases where that has been assessed. 
I would like to raise another side to gene technology and genetically modified food, and that is that they would hasten and escalate the possibility of corporations having ownership of the food source for the people of the world. I view that with extreme caution. During our committee sittings, evidence was put before us relating to the testing process of certain products. One issue was raised in relation to soy and another issue was raised in relation to the genetically modified cotton being produced in Australia and the possibilities and the difficulties of ensuring that that genetically modified cottonseed did not find its way into the food chain.
Another recommendation from the committee is that the bill be amended to require that the Gene Technology Community Consultative Group provide advice on individual licence applications made under the bill. I also believe that the Gene Technology Regulator—whether that constitutes a single individual or three people, as is recommended—should take into consideration concerns that are related through that community consultative group. One of the concerns raised by the group during the hearings was that the trial process for genetically modified crops in Australia may actually be used in such a way as to proliferate these crops to different areas so that there are very few GM-free areas—that may be the case even at this point in time when we are taking note of this report. The possibility that the trial process was being used in actuality to bulk up seed to be used in the process of procuring genetically modified seed was also brought to the committee's notice.
The committee also recommended that a provision in the bill requiring the regulator to accept state or territory viewpoints to prevent the release of GMOs within their jurisdiction be strengthened. As Senator Brown has also mentioned, I believe that should be extended so that, where a local council prefers, after consulting with the people in that area, to remain genetically free, the bill should also accommodate that. As well as the field trials, reference has been made to laboratory trials and the processes of assuring that the community could be confident that none of the material from laboratory trials could get into the environment. One only has to look at the proposed facility in the inner Brisbane suburb of St Lucia, where it is proposed to have within that residential area a biotech laboratory of a level 4 stage. So the concerns that the community have brought forward have to be balanced in relation to the benefits that we can derive from this technology. I believe the report goes a long way to doing that and commend it to the Senate. Mr Acting Deputy President, if there are no other speakers to the report, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I rise to speak against that proposition. I will not speak at great length, but I think it is important to respond to that. The House has rejected the first amendment moved by the opposition to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2000, as I understand it, on the grounds of the following advice received from the Australian Government Solicitor:
There are significant risks that the High Court will regard those provisions as invalid, at least insofar as they prohibit an advertisement which promotes a tobacco manufacturer in the context of discussions on political matters.
I also understand from media reports that the Australian Democrats will not continue their support for the Labor amendment and will be voting with the government not to insist on the amendment.
I note also that the Australian Government Solicitor's opinion which was referred to has not been made available to the opposition. However, I would like to make three basic points. Firstly, the Labor amendment does not prohibit an advertisement which promotes a tobacco manufacturer in the context of discussions on political matters. It explicitly allows a tobacco manufacturer to place advertisements in their own name. The issue raised yesterday by the government was that perhaps the amendment might stop a group of manufacturers getting together and placing an advertisement together, and this possibility was taken into account by the further amendment made by the opposition. The sole difference between the government's position and the opposition's position is that our version requires the tobacco manufacturer to advertise in their own name. The government version allows third parties to advertise on behalf of the tobacco companies—that is, to display banners and other material to promote the name of the manufacturer in exchange for the sponsorship money received. The freedom to communicate by tobacco companies is not infringed by this limitation.
Secondly, advice provided by the shadow Attorney-General makes a relevant point about the application of the Lange High Court decision to this matter. He advises that the effect of the Senate amendment would require tobacco manufacturers to identify themselves in any publication or advertisement that comments on government or political matters. The freedom of political communication is not absolute. Legislation or executive action that constrains the way in which political communications are made is subject to a test of reasonableness. The test was identified by the High Court in the case of Lange as follows: 
... if the law effectively burdens that freedom—
of communication—
is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end the fulfilment of which is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government—
The Senate amendment would arguably not be regarded as an unreasonable restriction on the way in which tobacco manufacturers make political comment. There is ample Commonwealth precedent for the requirement that organisations and individuals identify themselves with particular political communications. It is, for example, part of the fabric of the Commonwealth electoral law that parties and individuals who wish to make political comment are required to identify themselves in a prescribed way on each occasion that political communication is made. Such a requirement is entirely reasonable, as people have a legitimate right to know the source of information and comment on political matters. This information about the source of political comment is necessary in order to properly evaluate the contribution. For this reason, it is my view that the Senate amendment is an entirely reasonable restriction on the freedom of political communication.
The third issue on which I wish to comment is the government's claim that the legislation as a whole will be imperilled by the prospect of a challenge to section 9(1B). The act contains a detailed provision in section 4A to ensure the validity of each section of the act. This is expressly stated to apply to amendments adopted after the commencement of the act. Accordingly, even if a challenge were mounted to the Senate amendment and found to be partly or wholly invalid in relation to a particular advertisement, this clause means that no other section of the act would be impacted.
The opposition does not believe the government has made out a good case that the proposed amendment is legally defective. It certainly is not the case that if this section were challenged at some stage in the future it would impact on any other measure. I think if the government were genuine in its desire to end political sponsorships in the same way that all other sponsorships are now prohibited, it would have worked constructively with the opposition to redraft the relevant section to end this practice. The bottom line is that there was no political will on behalf of the government to end that practice, and it is unfortunate, therefore, that the bill will proceed without us successfully ending that sponsorship practice. As I say, I am concerned and disappointed that the Democrats have chosen to fold their cards, as it were, so quickly. But I accept that, unless Senator Allison has some more up-to-date information than what I have read in the press, we will not get their support to insist on the amendment.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-01,"—I want to emphasise from the start that the Democrats are totally opposed to tobacco advertising in any form. We believe there is no safe level of tobacco use and that there is no safe level of tobacco advertising either. We therefore do not support tobacco advertising at sporting events such as the grand prix. However, we do recognise that the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act has banned almost all forms of tobacco advertising in the electronic and print media and that Australia has led the way in world terms in this general ban on tobacco advertising. We are therefore not prepared to take a risk that this act could be challenged by the tobacco industry due to an ineffective and, in the words of the Australian Government Solicitor, confused amendment by the ALP.
The Democrats did initially support the ALP amendment because it was in line with our own general position of opposing all forms of tobacco advertising, but it needs to be said here and understood that the ALP amendment would not have had any effect on sponsorship of political parties. It is quite disingenuous of Senator Evans to suggest that this is an amendment which would stop sponsorship of political parties. It simply will not do that. In fact, it will result in little, if any, reduction in tobacco advertising in association with sponsorship.  
The amendment was provided at the last minute of the debate and amended on the floor of the Senate, and therefore there was very little time at that stage to examine the amendment in detail. However, we have since seen the advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that this amendment could leave the entire act vulnerable to a High Court challenge. Philip Morris has already challenged the act once, and the defence of this challenge cost the government millions of dollars. We think it would be irresponsible to open the door for the tobacco industry to mount a similar challenge in the future. I would also like to point out that yesterday the ALP voted against a Democrat amendment to bring forward the phase-out of tobacco advertising at sporting events. It seems that the ALP is much more interested in opportunistic political gains than reducing tobacco advertising and sponsorship. In fact, the ALP has received significant amounts of money from the tobacco industry in the past.
—Oh, Lyn! Come on! You're a hypocrite. You got conned.
—Order! I think Senator Evans needs to withdraw some unparliamentary language, please.
—If I used unparliamentary language, Madam Chair, I withdraw.
—Senator Evans does not want to hear this, but he must do so because he has put us in this position and he needs to hear the truth. 
—You're trying to twist and turn. You sell out, and then you come in here and try to pretend it's the principle of the matter.
—I will repeat for the benefit of Senator Evans: the ALP amendment will have no effect on sponsorship of political parties. I want to make that absolutely clear, because he said quite the opposite a little while ago. That is going to be very misleading and it is the sort of thing that becomes the truth if you say it often enough. But it is not the truth; it is in fact completely false. This has nothing to do with sponsorship of political parties per se. The fact that the ALP is much more interested in these sorts of opportunistic political games than actually reducing tobacco advertising and sponsorship has been made clear. We need to ask the reason for that. The ALP has received significant amounts of money from the tobacco industry in the past and has made no commitment today or this week to refuse any donations in the future. If Senator Evans were serious about sponsorship and stopping political advantage from receiving tobacco money, I would have expected that a simple announcement today to the effect that the ALP will no longer receive such sponsorship would be perfectly in order. But we have not heard that from Senator Evans and we are not likely to. 
In the 1998-99 financial year, the Labor Party accepted donations of $53,060 from Philip Morris and $73,500 from British American Tobacco. During the same period, the coalition accepted $104,050 from Philip Morris and $35,000 from British American Tobacco. Unlike both of the major parties, the Democrats have never accepted any money from the tobacco industry. Nor have I accepted tickets, Senator Evans, to go to the grand prix and be part of the tobacco industry's box at the grand prix, but members of the Labor Party have done that. I hope that both major parties will now give a commitment to refuse all donations from the tobacco industry in the future. This is really the only way that the Australian public can be confident that its elected representatives will not be influenced by the power of the tobacco lobby, and that is the key. The Democrats remain steadfastly opposed to tobacco advertising in all its forms and will not support an amendment which leaves Australia's current general ban on tobacco advertising vulnerable.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-11-01,"—The government accept this bill, as it is now, without the amendment previously passed in this chamber. I remind senators that the government have negotiated with both the ALP and the Democrats on this bill. Several changes have been made as a result of this. We have brought forward the date after which no new events will be given an exemption, and we have agreed to provide an annual report on the exemptions granted and infringements of the terms of those exemptions. Our objective since announcing our intention to change this act and since introducing this bill in May has remained simple: to remove all remaining options for tobacco advertising in sport. Much has been said in the past couple of days about the possibility of changing the act to end sponsorship of political events. The amendments proposed by the ALP would have done nothing of the sort. If the ALP want to do something about sponsorship of political events, they should turn their attention to the Electoral Act. The only thing the amendments might have done is place this act at risk of being challenged in the courts. We would not and could not knowingly place this act at such a risk. The government accept this bill as it is now and are proud of what it achieves. This is a world first in tobacco control and yet another concrete action to reduce the harm caused by tobacco in our community.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I will not reply at length to Senator Allison, although I have been provoked. But I think anyone who wants to look at her public record on this issue in the last couple of days will be very confused as they try to follow the twists and turns. Yesterday there was a press release criticising the ALP for failing to maintain its position; today Senator Allison comes in and says she will not vote for the amendment she voted for yesterday because we are being opportunistic. All I can say is that we are voting for the same position we adopted yesterday. There is only one group in the chamber who have changed their position: that is, the Australian Democrats. We do think this would have been a worthwhile addition to the legislation, that it would have closed a loophole in terms of the sponsorship by tobacco companies of political parties' events. But the Democrats have chosen to fold on that issue. That is for them to explain, and I suspect Senator Allison will have to do better than she has done today. 
The key issue from the point of the public debate is that the parliamentary secretary ought to table the Solicitor-General's advice. The message from the House of Representatives, as I understand it, is based on the Solicitor-General's advice. Again, the Democrats have been in the privileged position of being consulted and shown that advice. It is not an opportunity that other members of this Senate or parliament have received. I do not know whether, while they were being shown that advice, the minister ordered in some more Yellowglen and they celebrated their deal at the taxpayers' expense. But I think the minister does owe it to the Australian public and to this chamber, if we are being told that a motion carried by this chamber is to be rejected on the legal advice of the Solicitor-General, that we have access to that advice. Why should it be only the government's close friends and the Democrats who are allowed to see that advice? Why can't the Australian public see it? Why can't other senators and parties represented in this place see that advice? As I said, I do not want to prolong this debate overly; I can count. But I urge the minister to make available that advice and give this chamber the courtesy of seeing the advice that he says so explicitly requires this chamber to reject this amendment. 
—The question is that the motion moved by Senator Tambling, that the Senate does not insist on its amendment No. 1, be agreed to.
—I would ask the parliamentary secretary to at least have the courtesy to respond to me as to whether or not he will table the advice. I assume his silence means no, but I expect the courtesy of him at least advising me of that.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-11-01,"—I thought the government had made it very clear in the course of this debate that there were a number of legal opinions that were given, particularly with regard to the amendments that were proposed earlier by the Labor Party, and that earlier advice had been made available. But we can go on tracking, ticking and tacking about each and every occasion. I think the intent of the proposals, as sent back from the House of Representatives, has been made very clear at this stage. I do not propose to table any further advice.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-01,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I notice that there is no-one here from the government able to deal with this matter. This is, yet again, remarkable. I notice there are no officials available. I trust that they are on their way. I am pleased to see that the departmental officials are now entering. It is a pity the minister is not here.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I understand that Senator Ellison is on his way.
—Do you want to call a quorum, the standard procedure here? (Quorum formed) It is very good to see that the government are now ready to deal with this matter. I trust that they are.
—We always were.
—That is good to see. Before the lunch break we were discussing the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000. The concerns that the opposition has with this bill go to the issue of whether or not appropriate accountability mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that considerable sums of public moneys are in fact spent in accordance with the purpose for which they have been appropriated—namely, to improve what is truly an appalling situation in regard to indigenous education in this country.
The points that were being made went to some statistical examples of just how deep the levels of disadvantage are in this country. I asked the minister a series of questions that went to the fact that 32 per cent of indigenous students were staying on to year 12; for the rest of the country it was something like 73 per cent. Sixty-eight per cent of indigenous students were not completing school, and that was of course a much higher rate, particularly indigenous boys. With literacy and numeracy it remains the situation that only four per cent of the year 5 students in the Northern Territory, for instance, were meeting national benchmarks. The pass rates in vocational education were something like 27 per cent lower than those for the VET students as a whole. The number of indigenous students engaged in higher education at research levels was at 0.6 per cent.
The minister corrected me on that. He said, `No, you're wrong.' The only statistic he mentioned I was wrong on was the number of students who stayed on at school until year 12—not completing year 12 but actually attending year 12. I said 32. He said, `You're wrong. It is 34.7 per cent.' With that startling revelation I take it that the other statistics that I have used are now being confirmed by the government. It strikes me therefore that the issue at the heart of this matter is whether or not sufficient attention is being given to ensuring that the moneys appropriated by this parliament are properly spent by the states. This ought to be our central concern.
The minister also said before lunch that the reason there had been changes in the bill from the previous act was that the government was in search of modernity. He said that it was a more modern means of administering public moneys to take out of the bill a whole series of measures—quite important measures—and put them into the guidelines; for instance, how much money was going to individual students, a pretty fundamental question I would have thought. He says the government is doing this because it is in search of modernity. I tell you what: in this country one thing that is not particularly modern is the avoidance of responsibility in regard to education, particularly for indigenous students. I put it to you, Minister, that this has nothing to do with modernity; this is an attempt by this government to actually avoid accountability and parliamentary scrutiny. 
Presenting to us this morning 31 pages of guidelines which the minister says he cannot table but can give to us on the quiet suggests to me that there is a deep problem here in the way the government is approaching this bill. The fact that it has taken so long to get here, is part of a general package of bills—now up to 10 bills—and is crammed up at the end of the parliamentary session further suggests to me the government is not anxious to examine the detail of these measures. Minister, since we have had so much time, is it now possible for you to give me an answer to the questions I asked you this morning which you took on notice?",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-01,"—I will check and see where the answers to those questions are—those that I did take on notice. When we were last looking at this in committee Senator Carr moved his amendments, by leave. I just place on the record that the government will be opposing those amendments—just for the sake of neatness, if you like. I will now check and see where those answers are.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-01,"—Minister, while you are doing that, can you also establish for me why it is that this act is being replaced. You have said that it is because of modernity—I am troubled by that, frankly. This new bill replaces the old act and one presumes that all grants under the old act will no longer apply, with the ex-cep-tion of one—that covered by section 13(b) of the old act which goes to the app-rop-riations and which I understand will con-tinue through to 30 June 2001; that is, funds for assistance under 13(b), appropriation for 1 January 1993 to 2001. These figures in-clude moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for a whole series of purposes under that section and I am wondering whether it is necessary to actually have provisions in this bill to repeal the old act—or is it the case that this automatically flows on; that this appropriation automatically applies?",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-01,"—As I understand it, Senator Carr is saying that we have these appropriations in the current legislation but not in this bill and is asking if it is the case that they will continue. Having taken some instruction from advisers on that, the initial advice seems to be that this is repealed. However, I give that advice to the committee with the caveat that that will have to be checked. We can get that information from the departmental lawyers. It would seem from initial advice that this would be repealed, but that is subject to confirmation.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-01,"—It is quite apparent then that we will need to have this matter held over until that advice is received. It would seem to me that this is quite a substantial issue—that is, if the act is being repealed and yet there are outstanding appropriations, under what authority is that appropriation continued? Because—and I repeat this—13(b) does appear to me to suggest that there is a continuation of moneys appropriated under the consolidated revenue fund through to the period of 30 June 2001 on which authorisation is based upon the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act, as I understand it was then known. Is that the case, Minister?",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-01,"—I under-stand that inquiries were made in relation to the questions asked about the guidelines and the issuing of the guidelines. I am advised that, as these guidelines are only a draft—they were not scheduled for completion until the bill had been debated, as I men-tioned previously—the timetable was brou-ght forward in response to the shadow min-ister's request that they be made available before the debate in the Senate. The min-ister and the department met late last night and the guidelines were delivered to the shadow minister this morning. The guide-lines cannot be finalised until the bill has been passed and any further amendments, as requested by DETYA's legal and fraud group, have been made. The guidelines will then form part of the contract, along with the IEAs that I mentioned earlier, that will go to education providers and other bodies. So in relation to your questions it seems that the timetable was brought forward in response to your shadow minister's re-quest, and these guidelines were given to him this morning. Bringing forward the time-table seems to have shortened the period of notice.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-01,"—Minister, you really ought to ask your advisers to provide you with a more detailed response than that, obviously there has been some misunderstanding.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. I do not think the minister needs that gratuitous advice and, if he does, it should come through you.
 (Senator George Campbell)—There is no point of order.
—I rise on another point of order. Could you ask the speaker to direct his questions and his contribution through you.
—There is no point of order.
—The request for the guidelines was made on 8 August. The guidelines were provided to the opposition today. They had been in the minister's office for two weeks. For you to suggest, Minister, that it was a result of the request by the opposition that brought the timetable forward on this matter and therefore, somehow or other, these guidelines could not have been produced is clearly not in accordance with the record. Minister, the question I asked you this morning was: what date did the legal audit group conclude its review of those guidelines? That was the question which you took on notice.
—It was one of them.
—Yes, it was one of them. I am interested to hear what date that was concluded. We have heard that these guidelines have been in the minister's office for two weeks. You say that these guidelines, being a core issue in regard to the distribution of moneys, would not be available under normal circumstances unless we asked for them. That is the difference here: we have asked for them. The point that the Labor Party makes in this matter is that we are entitled to know how the government intends to spend the money—the expenditure of some $591 million—particularly given the issue here is that the levels of attainment are so severely under those in the rest of the country that we have a right to expect more of government in this regard. We have a right to expect this government to require the states to administer moneys in accordance with the appropriations. They are reasonable points, surely. When it comes to this issue, we asked for the guidelines on 8 August and they are not delivered until the very day that this issue is being debated in the Senate, after having been in this minister's office for a fortnight. I do not know at what point they actually exited the department—that is what I would like to know now.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-01,"—Senator Carr, you were indicating earlier that they made a request for the guidelines by 8 August, if I understand you correctly.
—Yes, that is correct.
—My advice is that the guidelines had not even been drafted. In fact, drafting had not even commenced by 8 August. Therefore, that request could not have been complied with at all. That is my advice in relation to that aspect of the guidelines. In relation to the approval by the legal section, I am still getting instructions on that. I can assist Senator Carr with his earlier question in relation to the old act and moneys appropriated under that. Clause 16 of the bill is headed `Money appropriated under the old Act to be available under this Act'. Although the previous legislation is repealed, this provides that the amount appropriated out of consolidated revenue under the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 for the period starting 1 January 2000 and ending on 30 June 2001 is available for the purpose of making non-Abstudy payments during the period starting 1 January 2001 and ending on 30 June 2002. There is in fact a note under clause 16(1) which deals with section 13B(8) of the current act. It states: 
... an amount of money was appropriated for the period starting on 1 January 2000 and ending on 30 June 2001. Section 13C of that Act allowed for that amount to be replaced with another amount.
It would seem from that, Senator Carr, that money appropriated under the old act is to be available under this bill when it becomes legislation. I think that should answer your question in relation to that.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise this evening to speak to the government's response to the National Pregnancy and Work Inquiry Report, which, surprisingly enough, was not available when my office asked for it earlier this morning and became available sometime after question time. I think it is interesting to note that we have been asking for a response to this inquiry, which was conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The inquiry they conducted was called Pregnant and productive: it is a right not a privilege to work while pregnant. The results of that inquiry were released well over a year ago. There have been many members of this party and certainly women around this country who have been waiting for this response. Because it is such an important issue and because there had not been an adequate response, our then shadow minister for the status of women, Jenny Macklin, introduced a private member's bill into the House to put in place these recommendations.
There were 46 recommendations in this report from HREOC. From my cursory reading of the government's response today, for 18 of the 46 recommendations the government actually says `the government accepts this recommendation'—that is, for those 18 recommendations, it does not dance around the issues by saying that it accepts the recommendation in principle, it does not give some half-hearted excuse as to why it cannot accept the recommendation and it does not try to handball the issue off to other agencies. The government actually blatantly says in writing that it accepts 18 of the 46 recommendations that HREOC produced as a result of this inquiry. So the government cannot trumpet the fact that it is concerned about women's rights in the workplace and concerned about women's ability to be able to access opportunities and choice if it is not prepared to put in place more than half of the recommendations of the HREOC inquiry. The recommendations that it has chosen to endorse go to education, producing guidelines, informing organisations and ensuring organisations are aware of their rights and responsibilities, but the real hard recommendations which would actually put something in place to protect the rights of individuals under law—that is, to actually turn those rights for women from just a matter of promotion or information into something meaningful in an act of law—have not been accepted by this government.
For 16 months, we have been demanding a response to the HREOC report, but in their announcement today in releasing this response, the government have not attempted to explain in any way the delay or the inferiority of their response. The government have now confirmed that they will not empower HREOC to publish enforceable guidelines in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy. They will not make provision to ensure that unpaid workers are covered by the Sex Discrimination Act. They will not remove the exemption for education institutions established for religious purposes in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy. Nor will this government make provision for punitive damages to be awarded. They are not intending to change the powers of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory awards or agreements to the Industrial Relations Commission. They are not intending to amend the Workplace Relations Act to extend unpaid maternity leave to casual employees employed over 12 months. And they do not intend to include provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act to protect employees who intend to adopt a child or are in the process of adopting.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-11-01,"—I also rise this evening to contribute to the government response to the National Pregnancy and Work Inquiry Report. The government response, in summary—and if I could be so rude to say with a pregnant pause—is bereft of any real and genuine reform. Even in its conclusion, it states:
Many of the recommendations in the National Pregnancy and Work Inquiry Report focus on education, guidance and awareness raising.
The government has said that it considers the most effective means of promoting and protecting the rights of individuals to be education and the dissemination of information. Time has past for that. We have waited, as Senator Crossin has said, something in the order of 16 months for an appropriate reply, and the reply has not only been disappointing but also failed to adequately address the issues for women in the workplace that need to be addressed. The government should realise that if women are to participate fully in the workplace, discrimination against pregnant workers must be, should be, taken seriously. The government's response has confirmed that this government is not about helping them balance work and family; it is about providing a general pamphlet and pieces of information. This government is not about ensuring that their rights are adequately protected in legislation. This government is not about ensuring that there is a place for a complaint to be lodged and investigated and for those issues to be brought out into the public and dealt with in an appropriate and reasoned manner. This government is about saying, `We will give you a pamphlet or brochure instead.' It is extraordinarily disappointing to see that the government has taken this approach. 
Senator Crossin also went on to say that of the number of recommendations that were made, some 46, the government's response to something in the order of less than half of them in a reasoned way is disappointing to say the least. In the explanation provided, the government does not appear—and I intend to take some more time to read through the response that has been provided by the government and deal with it at a later stage—to have dealt with a lot of the material in what may be considered a fair way. It has not dealt with some of the recommendations other than by something in the order of the way it dealt with recommendation 10, which states:
Recommendation 10: That the Attorney-General amend section 13 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) to remove the exemption of employment by an instrumentality of a State.
So we see a positive recommendation and the response from the Commonwealth is: 
The Commonwealth understands that most employees of State and Territory instrumentalities enjoy similar protection to that afforded under the SDA. The Attorney-General has written to his State and Territory counterparts drawing their attention to the issues raised in the report and seeking their views on those recommendations. 
More of these motherhood type statements are reflected through the report and I will come back at some appropriate time in this chamber to expand on them further. But disappointing for women is the recommendation, in relation to the Workplace Relations Act, to extend unpaid maternity leave to casual employees employed for over 12 months. This government has failed to address this recommendation in the response.
