Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (12:31):  The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2013 makes administrative amendments to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000, which is commonly called IETA. The bill provides for an amendment to funding arrangements for the continuation of Labor's effective and targeted education programs for Indigenous students in the Northern Territory. These amendments were introduced by the Labor government earlier this year. A 2013-14 budget decision was made to administer IETA as an annual appropriation rather than as a special appropriation. Currently, IETA funding comes to an end under the special appropriations arrangement on 1 January 2014. This bill will enable the minister to continue to enter into agreements with providers beyond 1 January to ensure the long-term security of this important funding.


Labor believes that an excellent education is an opportunity that should be available to every Australian student, no matter their circumstances or where they live. These amendments ensure that Indigenous students will continue to benefit from Labor's investment in targeted education and training programs beyond 2014 and well into the future. These programs include our School Nutrition Program, which encourages and supports school attendance by providing meals to schoolchildren in Northern Territory communities; our Indigenous Youth Leadership Program; supporting 200 additional teachers; and the Achieving Results Through Indigenous Education project, which encourages and supports school attendance through sporting and recreation activities.


The bill reflects Labor's ongoing commitment to ensure that Indigenous students are supported in their school setting so that they are best able to achieve their potential. It is vital that we maintain consistent funding so that individuals, communities and educators can plan to ensure that we do close the gap that still exists between the education results of Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. We are making progress. Under Labor's unprecedented investment in closing the gap we have seen improvements in reading in primary school students, with 74.2 per cent of Indigenous students meeting basic year 3 reading levels, up from 68.3 per cent when the close the gap framework began in 2008. More of our Indigenous young people are completing year 12 or certificate II equivalent, with 53.9 per cent of students attaining this qualification compared to 47.7 per cent in 2008.


There are challenges though that remain. The latest COAG report showed a slight drop in meeting basic levels of numeracy, down to 72.7 per cent from 78.6 per cent in 2008. If we are to close the gap in education, we must continue to have investment in a range of programs that we know will lift results. That is why the coalition government's commitment to the Labor government's better school funding plan—a needs based model that would deliver resources to our most vulnerable students across the country—is so crucial. Under this funding reform, extra funding in the form of special loadings is guaranteed for every Indigenous student right across the country, no matter what school they attend. 


We know that for many of our Indigenous young people, a quality education is a path from disadvantage and we have the absolute responsibility to ensure that every Indigenous student is given the very best support that they need to achieve their potential. That is why it is important for the coalition government to guarantee funding for education targets under the close the gap framework and to develop the new close the gap higher education target, which they supported prior to the election. I commend the bill to the chamber.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:35):  I rise to speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2013. While the Greens do not have any fundamental concerns with this bill—we think that the changes are reasonable and the right way to go in terms of ensuring this funding—we do have some concerns about comments made by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs in his second reading speech that linked these programs to school attendance. We are concerned about some of the school attendance measures that have been canvassed in the media and that we understand are being considered by the government. If the government is not considering the underlying causes of non-school attendance and some of the other issues of disadvantage that Aboriginal students and communities face, this targeted spending is not going to achieve its objectives.


School attendance, we appreciate, is critical to learning. We have no dispute on that issue. Our dispute is to do with the fact that we are not focusing on addressing the underlying issues that affect a child's capacity to attend school, that undermine a child's ability to attend school. Also, just getting a child into school does not always address the issues, unless we address some of the fundamental barriers to their being able to gain the best experiences from that school. I am talking, for example, about issues around hearing. We need to ensure, first, that Aboriginal students are attending school and, then, when they are attending school, that we are addressing that fundamental barrier to kids being able to engage with school. I have spoken on that issue many times in this place. 


I have spoken about the need to make sure that we are investing in early literacy and numeracy programs, programs that address the gaps in a child's fundamental development before they even reach school, when that fundamental development has been affected by their hearing difficulties. The evidence on that is absolutely clear. Until we start doing that, getting a child into a classroom is not only not going to do that child very much good; it may actually undermine their learning experience: they will feel isolated, they will feel intimidated, they will be bullied, it will prevent their learning and it will further disenfranchise them from the school. Unless we are investing upfront, just concentrating on school attendance numbers will not address that issue.


During Senate estimates, just two weeks ago, I asked about whether we were recording not just enrolment but also attendance in preschool, and we are not actually doing that as a uniform approach around Australia. In the NT, I understand, we are having trouble getting that data. Just having children enrolled in early education does not achieve the desired outcome. Facilitating children's attendance and making sure that they can hear and are engaging with those programs is something that we will continue to follow up with government, because, unless we address that fundamental issue, the money that we further invest is not going to achieve the outcomes.


I want to go back to this issue of school attendance. What we have heard talked about very recently is waving a big stick around and investing in truancy officers to try to get kids to school. Again, we believe that that is going to be a waste of money, a waste of resources, if we are not addressing some of the underlying causes. It is absolutely essential that we engage families. We have no dispute with government about that. It is absolutely essential that we engage those students and families in school. The concern is that having truancy officers running around—it is a very old-fashioned approach, I must say—enforcing school attendance can be demeaning to families. It can also lead to blame within the family and further dysfunction in the family, which is one of the reasons why we also do not support the SEAM program. I have spoken about this on many occasions. The SEAM program ultimately cuts social security payments to families whose children persistently miss school or are not enrolled in school. This has an impact on the broader family, can lead to blame within the family—we have heard this directly from families—and makes it very hard to survive when you are not getting paid any money into the community.


We need to stop and think about how students in remote communities think about and engage with school. Of course, this is not just about remote communities, but a lot of the programs are currently focused on remote communities. We need to make sure that we have programs that are bridging the gap between home life, school and, ultimately, a job. Often the connection is not there for Aboriginal students. They are told there will be jobs at the end of school, but there are not. School is not meeting their needs. It is disconnected from family. There is not, as I said, a clear link between what happens in school and jobs. Often the jobs that are held out are not the sorts of jobs that students particularly want. Quite often, parents have been disengaged from the school system in their lives. They have seen no direct outcomes from their education that have led to improvements in their lives. So therefore we need to engage parents as well. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that engaging parents and families in school will lead to better outcomes. Engaging families and communities in decisions about education, their schools and their local community is also important. Having Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander assistance in schools also produces a good outcome.


Aboriginal students often do not have the same attitudes to school as some of their Western counterparts. Competing on standardised tests and topping the class are not necessarily the drivers for them in school. They quite often feel shame in school that these issues are not adequately addressed, particularly when you layer on top of that the issues to do with their not being able to hear. Going into a situation where you are not being spoken to in your first language; you cannot hear; in some instances, because you have a hearing impairment, you are used to using hand language; and you are feeling alienated in a classroom that is not your usual environment, of course you are going to feel isolated, particularly when people may be raising their voices because you may not be responding to them speaking to you.


These issues are all still happening in our classrooms today and are barriers to learning. We need to look at where we can invest in innovative learning spaces that actually meet children's needs, that are comfortable places for them to learn in. We also, as boys and girls get older, need to look at different spaces for young men and women, because this is still an issue in some schools, and look at how we can do more informal out-of-school learning and make sure we provide those sorts of spaces. All these things, to a lot of people, would seem like common sense, but apparently to some they are not. Looking at culturally appropriate programs is also important, as is looking at bilingual language programs—I am aware of the ongoing dispute around those issues—and making sure that students have access to digital technology and putting sound fields in classrooms. We still do not have a standard approach across Australia around sound fields in classrooms.


As you can see from that list, there are a lot of things that take investment in resources. We are much better off investing in those areas than we are in a standard approach to truancy—the big stick approach. I will not even call what we need to be looking at the carrot approach, because it is not; it is looking at the creative ways we can invest in education to meet students' needs and understand the issues around school attendance. We do need to be improving that, but we need to make sure that we are meeting students' needs, that we have a school system that meets students' needs and that, once we get them into the classroom, they are actually learning in a way that is culturally appropriate and that students can respond to. That is where we need to be investing our money. Punitive approaches do not work and will not work.


So, yes, we will be supporting this particular bill because we think this is a step in the right direction. It means we do not have to keep revisiting some of these issues in terms of appropriations every year. But we are also clearly saying that we need to improve our education system for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. The system is not meeting their needs, and beating them around the head with big truancy sticks will not address the issue. Changing the way that we deliver education and making sure our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students can actually hear when they walk in the door and are on par with non-Aboriginal students in terms of being able to hear are very important. To do that, we need to be investing even before they go to school in early literacy and numeracy programs to cover what they have missed out on in brain development because they cannot hear—I have been through that before.


The activity in our brain gets allocated very early on in our lives. If we cannot hear, that part of our brain that hears gets allocated to other activities, so you do not actually develop the techniques to be able to hear and develop numeracy and literacy. There are now programs available that can help two-, three- and four-year-olds learn how to hear. That is a fundamental step as those children then go into the classroom. It is one of the best things we can do for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who are affected by hearing problems created through otitis media. I remind the chamber that Australia has a pandemic of otitis media in Aboriginal communities. We need to be addressing that issue, but we need to address the symptoms that that has led to, and those are hearing problems.


All these things need to be dealt with together as a package. Just investing in truancy and punitive approaches will not work. I will be following this issue very closely during estimates. The minister who will be addressing the chamber after me said that the government is still considering the approaches it will be taking to attendance. I hope it will be taking a much broader view than has been previously articulated so that we have a comprehensive package that addresses the fundamental gaps in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's education. At the moment, the programs do not and will not. As Senator McLucas articulated during her speech just then, we have had some improvements, but on some indicators we have gone backward. If we are going to meet our commitment to close the gap by 2030, we need to make some very significant progress. We will be supporting this bill, but we will continue to watch and pursue changes to the way we approach education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs (Senator Ronaldson) to questions without notice asked today.


After 65 years in Australia, with a long and proud history of building the cars that Australian families drive, Holden is reduced to just one friend at the cabinet table. But it is not just Holden that has been abandoned by those in cabinet opposite; the government has abandoned tens of thousands of families in Victoria and South Australia who rely on the automotive industry for the livelihoods, to pay their mortgages and to buy their weekly groceries. Mr Greg Hunt, Mr Kevin Andrews, Mr Bruce Billson and Mr Andrew Robb, all from my state of Victoria and all in the cabinet, have all abandoned the automotive sector in Victoria. You could at least have expected Mr Christopher Pyne, the only South Australian in cabinet, to strongly support the industry that means so much to his state, but no. In amongst the looting of $1.2 billion of taxpayers' funds to bail Mr Pyne out of his debacle last week, he turned on South Australian families who are supported by work in the automotive sector. He could find a billion dollars to save his own skin, but he could not find an extra cent to keep families paying their mortgages. The lone voice in cabinet supporting the automotive industry and the jobs and families that it represents was Minister Macfarlane.


But worse than simply abandoning Holden has been the decision taken by a significant number of cabinet ministers to background journalists and leak against the Minister for Industry and against Holden, its workforce and the families that it supports. This is, frankly, a stunning state of affairs. We have a minister who is trying to support a company that employs thousands of Australians being publicly trashed by his own cabinet colleagues. This type of destructive backgrounding is entirely unprecedented.


But what is most galling is that the workers being trashed by coalition cabinet ministers are among the most productive in Australia. Research in yesterday's Guardian Australia shows that labour productivity in the machine- and equipment-manufacturing sector has grown strongly and consistently for the last two decades. Australian automotive manufacturing workers are productive, hardworking and highly skilled. Holden boss Mike Devereux is reported to have told the Productivity Commission again today that workers and unions in the automotive industry continue to work closely with management to drive productivity, and all this is happening while senior coalition ministers are cheerily digging a grave for this Australian icon.


There are many small and medium businesses in my home state of Victoria that will suffer if the government withdraws support for the automotive industry. Here are just some of those companies, and the families who work for them will be directly impacted: Australian Arrow in Carrum Downs, Diver Consolidated Industries in Reservoir, Katcon in Keysborough, Venture DMG in Keysborough, Multifoam in Dandenong South and Staetite Fasteners in Heidelberg West. Those opposite, particularly those 18 cabinet ministers who have turned their backs on the industry and sold out those workers, should hang their heads in shame. Once again this government is proving that it is not— (Time expired)

They are all great cars; I love them. But I do not think that taxpayers should be the owners of car companies or build cars. This is best done by private companies who are responding to market forces and demands. But, in saying that, I note that private companies need to have a level playing field. They need to be able to compete in ways that are reasonable and, as I say, on a level playing field. In that regard, I found the article by Grace Collier in The Australian today very interesting reading and I would encourage everybody to have a look at it.


But that is not to say that there is not a role for government to play in assisting car companies through transition. Historically, bipartisan support has existed for transition assistance for the car companies, but transition assistance does not mean funding them forever. Questions about the future and viability of the Australian auto industry as it remains are rightly being asked at the moment and are rightly being sent for consideration by the Productivity Commission. It is clear that Ford is leaving already, GMH is currently under threat and Toyota potentially would have challenges down the track as well. It is right to ask the question now and to ask the Productivity Commission to have a look at what factors are influencing the viability of our auto industry.


What are the things that government can realistically and properly do to assist with that viability? And what are the other challenges facing it that the government can impact on? Government, indeed Australians, need to know the answers to these questions. It is not something that we should just do in an ad hoc, knee-jerk reaction and hand out money whenever it is asked for. We need to understand what the challenge is, what the problems are in the longer term to make sure that we set the auto industry on the correct path if that is indeed possible, which I readily hope it is.


Any decisions the government make following the Productivity Commission's findings also have to be made in the context of the debt position that the previous government has left us. We need to be responsible in how we approach dealing with that debt challenge. Unfortunately for industries right across the country, that means that there is less money to throw around propping them up. That said, I mentioned that I am very interested in hearing what the findings of the Productivity Commission will be because that may well provide us with a pathway to help ensure the viability of the auto industry in Australia. I would love to see that happen but, I do repeat, we have to do that responsibly and we have to do it in the context of the great fiscal challenge that we have been left by the previous government—$250 billion worth of net debt.




Senator Conroy:
  Why are you increasing it then?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BUSHBY:
  You may well ask: why are we increasing the debt limit? That is because debt—




Senator Conroy:
  You abolished the debt limit and raised the amount of debt.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BUSHBY:
  Government spending is not something that you can turn around at the click of a finger. Think of a large oil tanker at full steam in the open seas. If you decide you want to turn around because you are going in the wrong direction, you cannot just turn it around on a dime. It takes something like 10 kilometres to actually stop a large oil tanker. It keeps on going for a long time even though it is in reverse. That is an analogy of what we are facing with debt. The previous Labor government set us on the debt trajectory that is going to take a long time to turn around. It is not an easy thing to do. We can put it into reverse, we can turn the thrusters on backwards but it is still going to keep on going for many kilometres before we can even stop.




Senator Conroy:
  You have added $10 billion.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy, you are continually interjecting. Please desist.




Senator BUSHBY:
  The Australian government fiscal situation is like an oil tanker. The previous government had it heading full-steam in the wrong direction. It is not something you can turn around on a dime. It is going to take us a long time before we can even stop that oil tanker moving in the wrong direction never mind actually turning it around and getting it going in the direction it should be.


Senator Conroy mentioned that Australian-made cars are the cars that Australian families drive. That certainly was the case once upon a time; every house had a Falcon, a Kingswood or a Commodore—depending on the time that you are talking about—parked in the garage. But that is not so much the case now. That is one of the things that the Productivity Commission needs to look at. We need to understand the challenges facing the automotive industry in Australia at the moment. (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2013-12-10,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:17):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate on taking note of answers of Senator Ronaldson and Senator Cormann. I do so with a deep sense of foreboding because the contribution from—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will just correct the record there. The motion is we are taking note of answers given by Senators Abetz and Ronaldson.




Senator GALLACHER:
  My apologies, Mr Deputy President. I need to restate that the contribution from the other side over a couple of days in this debate has not given me any sense of confidence that there will be a successful outcome here. In fact, Senator Bushby mentioned the outcome of the Productivity Commission but the Prime Minister has ruled out any additional funds prior to the Productivity Commission making its determination. So I suppose it takes us back to where we are at.


On 7 September there was an election and a government was elected, a government that has been characterised as having its first 100 days of delays. We have the National Commission of Audit due to come in on 17 January and a bit more in March. And answers to almost every question on almost every topic in this chamber are 'we will not commit'.


We have a dire situation in the automotive industry. The Senate is a representative body of states with 12 senators for each state. We have had one contribution from Senator Edwards, which I will say no more about but it did not inspire me with any confidence that there was any great support for the automotive industry in South Australia. We have had nothing from Senator Fawcett, nothing from Senator Birmingham although he did say something this morning. He said he supported the car industry—and has remained stubbornly silent ever since. We have seen nothing from Senator Ruston, nothing from Senator Bernardi. It is very unusual; Senator Bernardi is usually the most vocal of the senators from South Australia on a whole range of issues. So all of those thousands of people in South Australia looking at their representatives in this chamber have had a very poor result from the other side. In fact, what has been coming back is chilling. This industry is so important to our state and, as rightly pointed out by Senator Conroy, it is vastly important to Victoria. The spin-off is immense. BlueScope Steel could be dramatically affected by any closure of the automotive industry in South Australia as could transport companies. Toll transport and Allied Transport are all part of the exactly-on-time logistics chain. The impact if this industry does not get the wherewithal to continue and commit to the additional billion dollars' worth of funding which those opposite have been asked to put on is going to be devastating. Devastating is probably not the word. All of those families are living with this uncertainty while this government procrastinates and delays, with a background of leaking, with a background of telling journalists, 'We are dry economic people here. We do not really want to be chipping in.'


One lower House member has put his name up to the front, Alex Hawke. Alex Hawke tweeted this morning, referring to a very partisan article in TheAustralian, which basically says the workers at Holden should take about a 67 per cent pay cut. I am sure it is very encouraging for them at this time of the year and with this uncertainty over their heads.


The reality of what is happening here is inaction. You claim you have a mandate to govern and you claim you have a mandate to do all sorts of things. What you should be doing is stepping up to the plate and securing the future of the automotive industry. The automotive industry is the largest contributor to manufacturing research and development. The skills developed in that endeavour are not contained to the automotive industry. Those people get trained, work in the automotive industry and then go across the whole manufacturing sector. If we want to be a smarter country and if we want to add value, this industry cannot be allowed to wither and die just because there are dry economic rationalists in the Liberal Party.


If this was something to do with agriculture like GrainCorp, then the Nats would be all over it, the Hon. Joe Hockey would be bullied into submission and we would have certainty. But, unfortunately in this case, it is the automotive industry and this government looks set to let it wither and die.

Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (15:23):  By way of background, the first car I ever had was a Fiat 500, and every other car since then—and there must be 50 or 60 of them—has been a Holden. I hope the last car that I have will be a Holden too because they have served me very well. I have never been in a position where I have not been able to get it back home one way or another. So I support the car industry, but let us not write the car industry off yet. 



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator BOSWELL:
  There is no decision being made on the car industry, so do not get in there and beat this up or develop a straw man so you can knock it over. That is what you are doing. No decision has been made.



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy.




Senator BOSWELL:
  After your contribution on the NBN, Senator Conroy, I would curl up in a little round ball and hide under the desk.


When Hawke and Keating took tariffs off, we became part of the world. We could not then just hide behind a tariff wall. We all applauded that—you applauded that. But what Keating and Hawke did was say, 'We are competitive,' so we had to take on the rest of the world in car manufacturing where costs are so much lower, where wages are so much lower and where OH&S is so much more realistic. This is the result that is coming home. We used to get by by paying higher wages and by paying for good conditions. We all want that for workers, but that was all underpinned by having cheap energy. That is what we did in Australia. We had high wages and high conditions and we all applauded it. Then, you came along. The one thing that we had going for Australia was the abundance of cheap coal and cheap energy. So what did you do then? You said: 'Here is our natural advantage. We do not need a natural advantage and our workers do not need a natural advantage. We will throw them to the wolves.' You through them to the wolves and you put a $400 carbon tax on every car.


While you procrastinate and not let the legislation go through, while you filibuster, you are hurting every worker in Australia, because you will not recognise that it is not only Holden and Ford but also Qantas who have to pay a $100 million carbon tax. It is the whole industry. Today a little mine in Queensland with 200 workers went belly-up. Why? Because there is a carbon tax. There is a litany of broken manufacturers out there, and you let these people go broke: McCain, with 59 employees—gone; Simplot—gone; Golden Circle—gone; Downer EDI—gone; Electrolux—gone; Caterpillar—gone; Rio Tinto, out of Gove; WesTrac—gone; and Peabody Energy—gone today. Then there is Kresta, Cussons, Aeroguard, Harley-Davidson, Bosch, Penrice Soda, Norsk Hydro, Shell and Goodman Fielder, and Queensland Aluminium where 4,500 jobs have been lost. While the jobs are flooding out, you are procrastinating. All of this is not only because of a carbon tax and renewable energy but also because of the high dollar. But the carbon tax and renewable energy are playing a very significant role in the demise of Australian industry.


How can you face this parliament? How can you possibly go back and talk to unions when you are slitting their throats and costing them jobs? You are destroying them. Why do you take their money? Why do you take their union fees and betray them? You are betraying them every time you try to block the repeal of the carbon tax. The carbon tax has destroyed so many jobs in the manufacturing industry and so many jobs in the mining industry. The mining and coal industries are trying to make a quid; many of them are not. They are saying, 'If we didn't have a mining tax and if we didn't have a carbon tax, we would not be terribly profitable but we would be in the black, not in the red.' What is wrong with you? Why do you have to be led around by the nose by the Greens? Why do you have to do take notice of them? (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2013-12-10,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:28):  I too would like to take note of answers given by government senators to questions asked by Senator Wong and Senator Carr about the future of Australia's automotive industry. We keep asking questions of the government about the future of the automotive industry because the answers we get are totally unsatisfactory. They are not answers, in fact; they are just responses. They do not answer the question of whether or not this government will act to save the 200,000 jobs supported by the automotive industry. The responses we get offer no solace to Holden workers in my state who want to know how much longer they will have a job for. The responses we get only reveal that there are deep divisions in this federal government about whether or not Australia's auto industry and all those who work in it and rely on it should continue to be supported as they were under the former Labor government.


I know the Premier of South Australia is coming to Canberra this week to speak to the Prime Minister about the future of the car industry. I know he is passionate about saving the South Australian jobs in the car industry and doing what he can to secure a future for Holden and the 1,700 workers in South Australia that it employs.


I know that all South Australian Labor senators in this place and Labor members in the other place have spoken out in support of the auto industry and called on the federal government to step up to the mark and declare exactly what it plans to do. However, I do not know what South Australian Liberal senators are doing because they do not tell us. It is extraordinary. Over the last two days, in taking note on this important matter of the auto industry, we have not had one South Australian Liberal senator stand up and put their point of view. Not one!




Senator Kroger:
  Rubbish!




Senator Fifield:
  That's just not true!




Senator McEWEN:
  In taking note, we have had, as we just heard, a Tasmanian senator, Senator Colbeck, and another Tasmanian senator, Senator Bushby—




Senator Fifield:
  Tasmanians are people too!




Senator McEWEN:
  I have not seen too many cars made in Tasmania, Senator Fifield!




Senator Fifield:
  They use them!




Senator McEWEN:
  I have not seen too many cars made there!




Senator Fifield:
  They drive them!




Senator McEWEN:
  And we have had a senator from Western Australia and now a senator from Queensland—and I fail to find any auto industry in Queensland. So we do not know what Liberal senators are doing.




Senator Kroger:
  They don't use the horse and buggy!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! On my right!




Senator McEWEN:
  We do know what some unnamed Liberal senators are doing, though. They are backgrounding journalists and saying that Holden is going to pull out of Australia. But today we heard from the CEO of Holden himself at the Productivity Commission that no decision had been made.


No decision has been made by Holden, so why are coalition ministers, unnamed, going around and saying that Holden is going to pull out of Australia? Why are they forcing their own minister—Minister Macfarlane—to try to defend and reclaim his portfolio space? What is this all about? What is the hidden agenda of those coalition ministers who are backgrounding journalists?


Is it because the economic dries have taken over the Liberal Party completely? You would have to think so, wouldn't you? Because they are the people who believe in a no-holds-barred, no-strings-attached complete economic freefall for all, and whose ideological obsessions blind them to the fact that governments do sometimes need to support industries. But there is more to supporting an industry than letting go of the levers and watching the freefall that happens, and hoping that some people and some organisations survive out of that. We know that the member for Mayo, the member for Sturt and the member for Higgins all have that ideological obsession. They want to let the automotive industry fall, basically.


I would like to conclude, however, by noting that one South Australian senator has made some comments about this; one South Australian senator, and that is Senator Bernardi. I do not know who saw Senator Bernardi interviewed last night, but it sent shivers down my spine when he was asked about the automotive industry. What did he do? He reverted to type, and he said that what they should do in the auto industry is to look at those union agreements that they have negotiated at Holden. Surprise, surprise, surprise! Is this what it is all about, really? Is it about attacking ordinary working people and their unions, who have negotiated decent enterprise agreements for the automotive industry? That is probably what it is all about.


I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, that the unions will stand behind automotive workers in South Australia and Victoria and in the other industries that are dependent on the automotive industry. South Australian Labor senators will stand behind automotive workers. The people who will not stand behind them are Liberal South Australian senators, who have refused to participate in this debate and who are standing by watching the auto industry come to its knees.

  The government will not be supporting this motion as it is factually inaccurate. The government's policy is to keep families together, including mothers and newborn babies. In some circumstances, such as where babies require special care, access may be slightly more limited, as it would be for anyone in the Australian community since some Australian hospitals do not have the capacity to accommodate mothers overnight with children or babies in special care, regardless of the mothers' visa status. In such cases the department will work with the hospital to obtain as much access for the mothers as is reasonably possible. I indicate that the government will not seek to call a division on this motion, noting that the Greens and the opposition are both voting in favour of it.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:07):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the documents.


This is a nonstatement by the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I note that the government has once again failed to comply with an order of the Senate. This is the second time in as many weeks and, unfortunately, once again the minister has claimed public interest immunity. I remind the senator that it is all very well for the government to make a claim of public interest immunity; it is another thing for the Senate to accept that claim, because that is a matter for the Senate itself to determine. It is an extraordinary position that she has taken here today.


I observe that in the previous debate she indicated that the Labor government had failed to comply with orders to produce documents on 75 occasions. Of course, that was a gross exaggeration of the situation. In the six years of the Labor government, the government cited public interest immunity on nine occasions—that is right, nine occasions, Minister, and they were spread across all portfolios, unlike with this particular government which seems determined to hide all information it can on the issue of asylum seeker policy.


Very little is known about the incident that took place on Friday, 15 November 2013, which is the subject of this return to order, other than we understand an Australian government vessel ripped the bow out of a boat and put 40 people into the water and, as a consequence of the government's tow-back policy—




Senator Scullion:
  A frequent occurrence.




Senator KIM CARR:
  it failed dismally. An Australian Customs patrol boat had to end up rescuing the 40 people. The matter has been canvassed in a number of newspapers in Australia. A fishing boat's engine had apparently stopped 20 kilometres from Christmas Island and it is believed that the government was seeking to tow this vessel back to Indonesia. The incident occurred on a Friday night and it actually took till Sunday to get the passengers from this vessel deposited on Christmas Island, where of course the matter became public from that point on.


This may well not be the first occasion this has occurred. It reflects, to my mind, a real danger of the tow-back policy. As we have heard from across the chamber, this is not uncommon when you are towing wooden vessels. It is one of the consequences of doing these things on the high seas. But it is core government policy—this is the point. The government policy is incredibly dangerous.




Senator Scullion:
  It happens to fishing vessels all the time.




Senator KIM CARR:
  The government says it only does it when it is safe to do so. Clearly, that is simply not the case. It is not safe to do it because on this occasion they have actually ripped the bow out of the vessel and it has sunk.




Senator Scullion:
  That sometimes happens.




Senator KIM CARR:
  So I would suggest it may well not be in the public interest at all to deny this. It may be in the government's interest—I understand that, to their way of thinking, that might be the case—but, frankly, it is not in the public interest to seek to suppress this information. It will become a public matter.


Today the Senate has established an inquiry into the claims of public interest immunity. This will be an opportunity for the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee to look at the detail of this assertion. That committee will report back to the Senate and the Senate will get its opportunity to revisit this question of the government's claims to public interest immunity on these extraordinarily important matters.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:07):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the documents.


This is a nonstatement by the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I note that the government has once again failed to comply with an order of the Senate. This is the second time in as many weeks and, unfortunately, once again the minister has claimed public interest immunity. I remind the senator that it is all very well for the government to make a claim of public interest immunity; it is another thing for the Senate to accept that claim, because that is a matter for the Senate itself to determine. It is an extraordinary position that she has taken here today.


I observe that in the previous debate she indicated that the Labor government had failed to comply with orders to produce documents on 75 occasions. Of course, that was a gross exaggeration of the situation. In the six years of the Labor government, the government cited public interest immunity on nine occasions—that is right, nine occasions, Minister, and they were spread across all portfolios, unlike with this particular government which seems determined to hide all information it can on the issue of asylum seeker policy.


Very little is known about the incident that took place on Friday, 15 November 2013, which is the subject of this return to order, other than we understand an Australian government vessel ripped the bow out of a boat and put 40 people into the water and, as a consequence of the government's tow-back policy—




Senator Scullion:
  A frequent occurrence.




Senator KIM CARR:
  it failed dismally. An Australian Customs patrol boat had to end up rescuing the 40 people. The matter has been canvassed in a number of newspapers in Australia. A fishing boat's engine had apparently stopped 20 kilometres from Christmas Island and it is believed that the government was seeking to tow this vessel back to Indonesia. The incident occurred on a Friday night and it actually took till Sunday to get the passengers from this vessel deposited on Christmas Island, where of course the matter became public from that point on.


This may well not be the first occasion this has occurred. It reflects, to my mind, a real danger of the tow-back policy. As we have heard from across the chamber, this is not uncommon when you are towing wooden vessels. It is one of the consequences of doing these things on the high seas. But it is core government policy—this is the point. The government policy is incredibly dangerous.




Senator Scullion:
  It happens to fishing vessels all the time.




Senator KIM CARR:
  The government says it only does it when it is safe to do so. Clearly, that is simply not the case. It is not safe to do it because on this occasion they have actually ripped the bow out of the vessel and it has sunk.




Senator Scullion:
  That sometimes happens.




Senator KIM CARR:
  So I would suggest it may well not be in the public interest at all to deny this. It may be in the government's interest—I understand that, to their way of thinking, that might be the case—but, frankly, it is not in the public interest to seek to suppress this information. It will become a public matter.


Today the Senate has established an inquiry into the claims of public interest immunity. This will be an opportunity for the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee to look at the detail of this assertion. That committee will report back to the Senate and the Senate will get its opportunity to revisit this question of the government's claims to public interest immunity on these extraordinarily important matters.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (17:13):  I present the following two reports of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights:


First report of 44th Parliament: bills introduced 12 November–5 December 2013; legislative instruments received 8 June–22 November 2013; and


Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights annual report 2012-13.


Ordered that the reports be printed. 




Senator SMITH:
  I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the reports.


Leave granted. 




Senator SMITH:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the reports.


It gives me great pleasure to table the first report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in the 44th Parliament on Human Rights Day. In doing so I would like to take a moment to remind the Senate of the important role that this committee plays in supporting the parliament's legislative process. The committee examines and reports to the parliament on the compatibility of bills and legislative instruments with Australia's human rights obligations under the seven international human rights treaties ratified by Australia. The committee also has the ability to examine current acts and to conduct broad inquiries into human rights matters referred to it by the Attorney-General. 


The committee's work is focused on prevention and education with regards to human rights compatibility. The committee does not usually seek to make definitive statements regarding the compatibility of legislation with human rights. Instead, the committee seeks to determine the risk of the legislation being applied in ways that would be in breach of human rights and suggests avenues and safeguards for addressing areas of concern.


The committee commences its work by reviewing the statement of compatibility that is required for all bills and most legislative instruments that come before the parliament. While the committee does not accept statements of compatibility at face value and is able to consider the human rights compatibility of legislation in the absence of such statements, it appreciates that statements of compatibility often provide valuable information that cannot be gained from the legislation itself or from the explanatory memorandum or explanatory statement that accompanies it. Since its establishment the committee has sought to influence the general quality of statements of compatibility and has set out its expectations for statements of compatibility in its Practice Note No. 1.


The committee considers that a good statement of compatibility will set out the objective of the legislation and the manner in which rights have been considered in framing the legislation to achieve this objective. This is particularly important when, in order to achieve a particular objective, certain rights are to be limited. Where a provision in a bill or instrument appears to limit rights, the committee considers three key questions: whether the limitation is aimed at achieving a legitimate objective; whether there is a rational connection between the limitation and that objective; and whether the limitation is proportionate to that objective. The committee expects that these questions will be addressed in the statement of compatibility.


The committee also expects that the statement will set out the safeguards that will be applied to ensure that any limitations are implemented in the least restrictive form. Where further information is required to determine these questions, the committee writes to the sponsor of the legislation seeking clarification and publishes its concerns in its report to parliament. The committee publishes responses received together with the committee's comments on them. The committee seeks to conclude its work while the legislation under consideration is still before the parliament to enable senators, members and other parliamentary committees to draw on the committee's work in their own contributions to the passage of legislation.


The committee's first report of the 44th Parliament sets out the committee's consideration of 45 bills introduced into the parliament from 12 November to 5 December 2013, 1,017 legislative instruments received between 8 June and 22 November 2013, and 10 responses to comments made by the predecessor to this committee in reports tabled in the 43rd Parliament. The committee considers that the majority of the bills and instruments it has considered do not give rise to human rights concerns. Some of these bills and instruments do not engage human rights, some engage and promote rights, and some engage and limit rights but are accompanied by statements of compatibility that set out an adequate justification for each limitation.


The committee has identified 18 instruments that do not appear to raise any human rights concerns but are accompanied by statements of compatibility that do not fully meet the committee's expectations. The committee has written to the relevant ministers in a purely advisory capacity, providing guidance on the preparation of statements of compatibility. The committee has identified 22 bills, 20 legislative instruments and six responses for which it will seek further information before forming a view on compatibility with human rights. The committee has deferred its consideration of three bills to allow it to examine the issues more closely and to take account of submissions made to Senate committees to which the bills have been referred. The committee has deferred its consideration of six instruments to allow time for consideration of recommendations for review of certain legislative schemes made by the committee in the 43rd Parliament.


As I turn to the committee's annual report of 2012-13, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the predecessor to the committee in the 43rd Parliament, and its chair, Mr Harry Jenkins MP, the former member for Scullin. This report captures the formative stages of the committee as it determined the scope of its role and how to approach it. The key achievement of the committee in the 43rd Parliament under Mr Jenkins's leadership was the measured and collegiate way in which it approached its work, resulting in 18 consensus reports and the development of the robust analytical framework I outlined earlier. This framework has enabled the committee to focus on the assessment of human rights compatibility across a wide range of legislation of varying complexity, engaging a diverse range of human rights in an objective and consistent way. As a result, the committee has begun to contribute to the source materials available to assist those engaged in the development of policy and legislation to consider human rights at each stage of this process. The first annual report identifies the human rights that arose most regularly in the committee's work during the review period, the legislative and policy context in which each of these rights arose and the types of concerns that the committee has identified. The report provides concrete examples to illustrate each type of concern identified and, as a result, should be of practical assistance in the consideration of human rights during the course of developing future legislation.


The work of the committee in the 43rd Parliament provides a firm footing for the ongoing consideration of human rights by this parliament. I look forward to working with the committee to build on this foundation and continue this important work in the 44th Parliament. I commend the reports to the Senate.

AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT BILL 2013




Australian Research Council



This bill to amend the Australian Research Council Act 2001 is an essential item of housekeeping to ensure that the ARC can continue to support and serve Australia's vibrant research community. The ARC is fundamental to the support of both blue sky and applied research, and its peer reviewed competitive funding schemes are the lifeblood of many of the most significant research endeavours in the country. 


This appropriation bill increases the ARC's funding caps in line with inflation and ensures that government support for thousands of research projects does not weaken. If we are to address the great challenges of our time, to improve the quality of people's lives, to support the development of new industries and to remain competitive in the global knowledge economy, then we need a strong research community and this bill is underwriting that strength.


The ARC is the most significant single source of funding for new, breakthrough, investigator driven research that covers all disciplines in Australia. This funding has underpinned the life work of so many of our greatest researchers that it is hard to know where to begin, but I will give a few examples, just to give a taste of the variety of research activity which this funding supports.


Professor Rick Shine, at the University of Sydney, is one of Australia's number one experts on cane toads. As we all know, the toad was brought in to solve a problem, beetles in sugarcane, and the solution turned out to be far worse than the original problem. It's an example of good science fighting the mistakes of the past—and of how scientists are using new research to find practical solutions to a serious invasive pest. Professor Shine and his research team, supported by an ARC Laureate Fellowship of over $2 million, are a fundamental part of Australia's effort to combat this poisonous exotic species. Professor Shine has said that his research career would not have been possible without the Australian Research Council. Perhaps his efforts will help rid Australia of the cane toad forever. 


The ARC's Future Fellowships scheme is coveted by researchers throughout Australia as it provides the funding boost that can change the course of a career, and enable them to make a crucial contribution to solving major problems. Targeted at a critical time—the mid-career—a future fellowship frees a researcher to focus on a topic of great interest and importance. The ARC's value here is in its flexibility—for the ARC works in all disciplines. Take for example the Future Fellow Professor Martina Stenzel. Although her background is in chemistry, she has taken her breakthrough work in nanoparticles into the hospital, to help cancer patients. Her unique platinum project, to develop nano-sized drug delivery containers for the targeted delivery of platinum-containing anti-cancer agents, bridges a gap between chemistry and medicine in a way that perhaps only an ARC fellowship can effectively support. 


Of the five recent recipients of the 2013 Prime Minister's prizes for science, three have had significant ARC funding during their career. Statistician Professor Terry Speed—who received the overall Prime Minister's Prize for Science for his outstanding achievements in applying statistical techniques to genetics—previously received funding as a partner investigator with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Kangaroo Genomics, a centre which was funded with over $5 million beginning in 2003. ARC Centres of Excellence are powerhouses of Australian research, and their value as proving grounds for the great researchers of tomorrow cannot be underestimated. 


Also announced as part of the Prime Minister's prizes, the winner of the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year, Associate Professor Andrea Morello, is housed at the ARC funded Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, which is receiving over $24 million from 2011-2017. This centre is making major inroads into making quantum computing a reality, which it is expected will radically transform the security and capability of computing around the world. There are very few people in the world like Professor Morello, who can actually explain how quantum computing works, let alone excel in it. We can be proud to have an ARC funded centre here in Australia which is making very significant breakthroughs in quantum computing technology, and which is getting frequent accolades on the world stage. There is said to be potential here for a breakthrough just as great as the breakthroughs we have witnessed in conventional computing.  


It is significant that both Associate Professor Andrea Morello and Professor Terry Speed have been associated with ARC Centres of Excellence, and it speaks of the role that these centres so often play in the research careers of our best and brightest, both at the formative stages and at the pinnacle of that career.


Associate Professor Angela Moles from UNSW's Evolution and Ecology Research Centre was recipient of the Frank Fenner Prize for Life Scientist of the Year, and has spoken of the inestimable role of ARC funding in kick-starting her breakthrough research in ecology. Associate Professor Moles visited 75 different ecosystems around the world as a part of the World Herbivory Project, collecting and interpreting ecological data. She has received funding from two ARC Discovery Projects grants, ARC Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities funding, an Australian postdoctoral fellowship in 2004 and a 2009 Queen Elizabeth II Fellowship. Her work has challenged conventional wisdom in global ecology, transforming our understanding of where to look for natural plant compounds of medicinal value. 


These are just some examples of how ARC funded research has played and continues to play an important role in improving the lives of Australians. There are thousands of stories like these to tell. 


But the ARC is not only the most significant source of funding for innovative, investigator driven research in Australia. It is also a significant source of knowledge about the research community, including through running the Excellence in Research for Australia—or ERA—assessment of research. 


The challenges of a changing research sector are also being tackled by the ARC through its new open access policies, closely watched by the research sector. These policies seek to ensure that publicly funded research is made publicly available, as part of a new worldwide drive towards openness, and an unlocking of the doors of traditional research storehouses. The ARC's consultation on measuring research impact, and its ongoing role in attracting international researchers to our shores are other examples of how significant it is to the health of Australian research and our universities.


It is clear that ongoing funding for the ARC is essential to the vitality of the Australian higher education system.


The peer review system managed by the ARC is an important driving force in keeping our research sector innovative. Peer review is a cornerstone of the process of scientific advancement, and is fundamental, wherever research is free to be practised throughout the world. The ARC uses peer review to establish research merit across the spectrum of disciplines. Peer review by experts, experts drawn from all over the nation and abroad, is at the heart of both the ARC's Excellence in Research for Australia program, and the awarding of the ARC's grants and fellowships. Every proposal, every research output, is judged by experts in the field on its merit. 


I will briefly mention two other ways in which the ARC is helping to diversify the research workforce. The ARC plays an important role in attracting and supporting Indigenous Australians to engage in research, through its Discovery Indigenous scheme. This is of great importance to untapping the research potential of Indigenous Australians, and to enriching our national research effort.


Women in research are also supported by the ARC, and will benefit from this amendment bill, which supports among other things two Australian Laureate Fellowships specifically for women: the Kathleen Fitzpatrick Australian Laureate Fellowship for a female candidate from the humanities, arts and social sciences disciplines, and the Georgina Sweet Australian Laureate Fellowship for a female candidate from the science and technology disciplines. Named after great Australian women who were research pioneers, these fellowships have an ambassadorial role, and will support the role models for our next generation of female researchers. The ARC also seeks to ease the transition for women returning to research following career breaks. The ARC's Research Opportunity and Performance Evidence (ROPE) measures enable assessors to take into account any career interruptions, including those for childbirth and caring responsibilities. 


Through these initiatives and through the whole National Competitive Grants Program, the ARC is helping to reduce research career barriers and ensure the nation reaps the benefit of all of its research talent.


The government's strong support for research and specifically for the Australian Research Council was reflected on 8 November when I announced $522 million in ARC grants and fellowships, supporting 1,177 research projects on diverse topics throughout Australia arising from the competitive peer review processes of the ARC.


Supporting the ARC through this amendment bill is fundamental to the continued health of our research sector. It is good to reflect on the role that the ARC plays in nurturing and sustaining the research community, working to solve great challenges which face us, and strengthening the world standing of our higher education sector. 


I commend this bill


 


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 2013


This bill reintroduces a measure that was introduced by the previous government but lapsed when the last parliament was prorogued.


The measure targets access to the research and development (R&D) tax incentive to the small and medium sized entities that are more responsive to increasing their R&D spending as a result of government incentives. In other words, it reduces waste by ensuring that government incentives for R&D are applied in a more effective way.


It does that by limiting the R&D tax incentive to companies with aggregated assessable income of less than $20 billion. Companies that have aggregated assessable incomes of $20 billion or more will apply the normal income tax rules to their expenditure on R&D activities.


The measure will apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2013 and is estimated to produce a gain to revenue of $1.1 billion over the forward estimates period.


The bill also makes a consequential amendment to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 to ensure that very large companies are still able to claim their overseas R&D activities for income years in which they fall below the $20 billion threshold. This allows the tests for eligibility of R&D activities conducted overseas to continue to operate as intended.


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:51):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This is the statutory funding agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia, represented by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and Sugar Research Australia. The sugar industry is one of the biggest industries in my state of Queensland and certainly in Northern Australia. It is the third largest raw sugar supplier in the world. Sugar is the seventh largest agricultural export from Australia. Eighty per cent of the crop is exported. Something between $1.7 billion and $2 billion each year is the value of production. There are over 4,000 cane farms supporting the sugar industry, and they are mainly mum-and-dad farms right along the east coast of Queensland and a few in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales. There are 24 sugar mills, employing literally thousands of people along the Queensland coast, and there are six bulk storage ports.


This agreement which has been reported on today was an agreement whereby the Commonwealth, with its normal research and development grants, has funded the sugar industry. It has been very important. Sugar Research Australia Ltd is a new company which was set up not long before the last election. If there was one good thing the Labor government did in its six years, it was to facilitate expeditiously the establishment of Sugar Research Australia Ltd, which brought together all of the research and development units that support the sugar industry. Sugar Research Australia is an industry services body, declared so by the Sugar Research and Development Services Act 2013, and it allows the Commonwealth to match contributions by the sugar industry towards research and development in the way set out in various Commonwealth government acts dealing with the sugar industry.


Prior to the establishment of this new organisation, there were several units dealing with research into sugar: the old Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations, the Sugar Research and Development Corporation and a millers research agency called Sugar Research Limited. The industry in its wisdom decided to bring them all together under Sugar Research Australia and then, with the approval of the Commonwealth government, set that up as the organisation that would receive the Commonwealth matching funds for research and development. Research and development in our rural industries is essential, and that is what keeps Australia ahead of the pack. Certainly, whilst the sugar industry is very efficient in Australia, we cannot compete with countries like Thailand and Brazil when it comes to wages and cost of operations, so we have to compete through our expertise, our skills and our research and development. Over the years the sugar industry has been noted for that.


At times you will hear scare campaigns about the sugar industry destroying the Great Barrier Reef—that is when climate change is not destroying it, or whatever happens to be popular in Greenpeace on any particular day. But I have to say the sugar industry have long been aware of the need to be environmentally sustainable and conscious in the way they operate, and they have done a fantastic job over the years, with a lot of programs and initiatives that they have done themselves; they have not been forced upon them. Their research and development expertise over the years has contributed to this. It is an industry which is so very important to the east coast of Queensland and, if we can keep ahead of the game in research and development, we can continue to be a very significant world player in the production of raw sugar. I want to congratulate all of those involved with setting up Sugar Research Australia and, indeed, the industry as a whole. They are a credit to Australia.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (18:57):  On 3 October this year, Afghanistan recorded a comprehensive seven-wicket win over Kenya at Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium to finish second in the World Cricket League, paving the way for their country's first ICC Cricket World Cup appearance to be played in Australia and New Zealand in February and March 2015. The Afghanistan cricket captain and all-rounder Mohammad Nabi described the win as a gift to a young generation. After their team's historic victory, jubilant fans lined the streets of Kabul and other major cities in Afghanistan, singing and dancing. Large crowds also celebrated inside the Kabul National Cricket Stadium after watching the match on a giant screen. In the past, of course, the Kabul stadium was used by the Taliban for incomparably darker purposes.


Dr Noor Muhammad Murad, CEO of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, recently said that already 5,000 cricket clubs were established across Afghanistan, with 280,000 active participants, but the national team's recent success has caused a surge of interest, with expectations of 1.5 million participants by the end of this year.


This growing support is not just a win for cricket in Afghanistan. The engagement of thousands of young Afghanis in cricket is resulting in very positive knock-on effects in health and education throughout the country. In a recent SBS Radio interview, former Pakistan fast bowler and Afghan cricket team coach, Kabir Khan, said the sport has already had a positive effect on the lives of many Afghan people. He said the team's players felt honoured to offer a positive story about Afghanistan, in contrast to the decades of continuous tragic news coming out of the country. This is a remarkable achievement for the team, for the fans and for Afghanistan. The team has worked very hard, against the odds, and its recent World Cup qualification is the ultimate reward for all that effort.


Afghanistan will play its first World Cup match against Bangladesh at Manuka Oval here in Canberra, followed by other Australian fixtures, including a match against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground and a match against Australia at the WACA in Perth. Of course, these venues will be a world away from the dusty refugee camps of Pakistan, where many Afghanis were introduced to the game.


I am sure all senators would join me in congratulating the Afghan National Cricket team on their recent success, and wish them the best of luck in 2015 for their first appearance at an ICC Cricket World Cup. I believe we should celebrate their success.
