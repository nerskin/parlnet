"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-21,"—Madam President, as you know, I speak in continuation. Yesterday I was referring to remarks made by Senator Ferguson designed to damage the credibility and the status of the reports produced by the various committees, in particular the main select committee. That is a process of Senate abuse, if you like, which has been carried on by a number of government senators.
Every committee in which I have ever been involved has had some difficulties in arriving at the final report because that is the nature of the report process. However, Senator Fergu 
 son well knows that the private meeting of the Senate committee to consider the draft report did agree on what basis the report should be balanced up and how it should be treated. It was left to the chair and deputy chair—comprising six out of the seven members of the committee—to finally resolve the matter, with the specific injunction that government senators should balance up the report in areas where they felt there was insufficient evidence to support their viewpoint.
At that meeting, we also made it clear—and I particularly made it clear—that government senators, Labor senators and the Democrat senator would rely on their supplementary reports to establish their position. The main report would summarise as much of the evidence as possible.
Whether it was legitimate or not I do not know, but it was Senator Ferguson who chose—knowing that the date for the report was 19 April—not to be in Canberra. He chose not to be available for the last fews days on which the Senate committee report was to be resolved. As deputy chair, I would not have made that choice, but he did make that choice. It is entirely wrong for the deputy chair of that committee to condemn the process for political purposes when he himself had the ability to supervise the process.
In proceeding to the substance of the bills before us, I want to focus on the government senators' report because it is the government's package—the government's New Zealand package, the government's New Zealand option—that is being put to us. The first conclusion of government senators was that:
The Inquiry process produced no information that was not already in the public domain or had not been considered by the Government when putting the tax reform plans together and debated during the election campaign.
I have to say that this is the most extraordinary, arrogant thing I have ever heard. I am startled that some of the Liberal senators who are of high quality could assume, and put their names to a statement, that they have perfect knowledge—that they could discount the views of 1,437 submissions, all the media and everybody else. This just seems amazing, particularly as I know, both from private 
 conversation and on the record, that there were many facts about which they were interested and excited to hear—some of which supported their own views. Senator Conroy will recall the excitement with which the government treated new modelling that supported their views. They did not know that this modelling existed before, but they embraced it warmly when it helped them.
The government say that the process produced no information that was not already in the public domain, but I remind you that there is a very serious issue here concerning culpability and law. I draw an example which you may find strange, but which is apposite. In France, ministers and former ministers are being prosecuted because they knew that, if you dealt with blood in a manner that was inappropriate, you put at risk the lives and health of the people who received contaminated blood.
I draw this to your attention: remember that the government say they know everything. This is what they knew. At page x of the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee dated March 1999, in the executive summary—the Treasurer and everybody else knows this—the committee heard conservative estimates that:
. . . at least 65 more people would die each year in Australia as a result of the increase in urban air pollution and traffic accidents if the GST package goes ahead as proposed. These would be predominantly young children and the elderly.
If you are assuming perfect knowledge, you are telling the courts that, when you are prosecuted for somebody's death or ill-health, you knew something about it already. Ministers are being prosecuted in France because they knew that, if they dealt with blood inappropriately, they were putting lives at risk. And you know that you have been told by the Senate committee—by the AMA, a body of repute and credibility—that you will cause deaths if you pursue this matter. Therefore, you might find yourselves liable in law. I draw this to your attention when you say that you have perfect knowledge and nothing new has been observed.
The second conclusion of government senators reads:
The Inquiries by the Senate were poorly focused and mis-used by Labor and Democrat Senators who manipulated the Inquiries in an attempt to re-argue their political positions which were defeated in the last election. The Democrats ignored and misrepresented evidence which did not support their position with respect to food and GST.
This is very one-eyed. Of course the Democrat senator and the Labor Party pursued their particular viewpoints. You do not think that the coalition did? You think that they are angels who sat back objectively and independently—who sat on high and did not support their position in their argument? This again reflects an attitude to the process of committee work and Senate appraisal of legislation that is extraordinary given the known quality of the coalition senators involved—who do know better.
The third conclusion of government senators was this:
Many witnesses and submissions relied on false assertions and anecdotes . . .
Are you saying that all those who supported the government position did that or are you saying that it was only the ones who opposed it? Are you saying that all the submissions from the bishops and the churches relied on false assertions and anecdotes `many of which were irresponsibly perpetuated by the Labor senators rather than primary source material, such as the legislation and explanatory memoranda, which have been public since December 1998'? The conclusion continues:
Government Senators therefore do not place any credit on the claims and conclusions of the Labor Senators which are willingly based on misleading and inaccurate evidence.
Let me give you an example. Labor senators say that the first-year effect of inflation is between three and four per cent. The modellers, the economists and everybody else agreed, but because the Labor senators say it, is it going to be wrong?
We then move on to item 4, `The Government's tax package entirely meets the criteria by which tax reform should be assessed.' This is the idea that the package is perfect—`Peter's perfect package'. It is just extraordinary—when you originally intro 
 duced 16 bills, the detail of which was not before the people at the last election, and to that you added a further 17 bills, and there are more to come—that you can claim that it entirely meets the criteria by which tax reform should be assessed.
The government says in item 4, `it is efficient—a single rate GST'. In fact, we know that indirect taxes number at least six and maybe seven. By the government's own laws, there are exempt, GST free, full GST, excise tax, wine equalisation tax and car taxes. There is no single rate; there are varied rates. And it says it `means minimum distortion to allocation of resources and prices and economic welfare increases by the greatest amount'. The jury is out on that. Essentially, the final conclusion of the very eminent people before us, including those by whom the government has put great credit, was that the economic effect will be moderately positive to negligible. I know that is a good outcome but that does not imply that it entirely meets the criteria by which tax reform should be assessed on an efficiency basis.
It continues, `it is simple—least compliance effort by business and ATO and no wasteful tax re-classification.' Eighty thousand businesses are affected by making health and education GST free and some other items that they sell will be fully taxed. Are you telling me that there are going to be no definitional arguments in that area? Are you seriously expecting me to believe that given the history of the definitional arguments over wholesale sales tax? It is the nature of sales tax law, whether or not it is GST law, that there will always be definitional arguments. Whether or not food is left out, I guarantee—I am prepared to put a year's salary on it—that there will be definitional cases going to the courts on your proposals, never mind the amendments.
Item 4 also says `it is equitable.' Well, this is an argument about fairness. In one of the last speeches yesterday, the point was made that compensation is necessary because it is unfair. It is a basic point. You do not need to compensate people unless there is unfairness apparent in the process. The government has used the word `compensation'. Therefore, the question is whether there is sufficient com 
 pensation. Listen to this conclusion from the government in item 5 which says:
There was no credible evidence to demonstrate, on reasonable assumptions, that any modelled household type would be worse-off as a result of the Government's tax reform package.
Were they there? Did they listen to the evidence? That is just the most extraordinary denial of the truths that were put before them. So let us turn to their supporters, to those people who believe in a GST and believe that food should be taxed. The former leader of the Liberal Party, the leader prior to John Howard's present team—not far back, quite recent—Dr John Hewson said, and I quote the Australian Financial Review  of Friday, 16 April 1999:
. . . the Government should return to Fightback, as far as its compensation package is concerned. If there are lessons to be learnt—and there are—then the Government should learn them.
While economists will continue to debate the technical minutiae of the compensation package, the Government really should now cut the Goebbels chant, `There are no losers!', admit that there will be, and revamp the compensation package to ensure that there won't be. Further, in doing so, the Government should ensure that the benefits of compensation are preserved into the future.
That is not Labor senators speaking, it is not Democrat senators, it is not Senator Harradine; it is Dr John Hewson, the advocate of right-wing economic rationalism, saying that the evidence has proved that the government's compensation package is insufficient. Why deny it? Why go out into the world making fools of yourselves when the churches, charitable organisations, business organisations and your own supporters say that the compensation package is inadequate? You just end up looking like mugs. That is the problem with the coalition defence of their package. They are obliged by the rhetoric particularly of the Treasurer but also of the Prime Minister to hold the line regardless of the credibility of their argument.
That is why Dr Hewson uses the most damning condemnation that can be used in the 20th century, that you are behaving like Nazi propagandists. Dr Hewson says you are using the Goebbels chant. I might add that it extends to Goering hysteria because, for some 
 reason, the Treasurer believes that, if the package is amended to make it fairer, inflation will go up, the surplus will collapse, the deficit will ride over us and the Mongol hordes will pour over the borders of Australia. We are doomed! We are going to die because we are going to give a few bob more to the poor and to the disadvantaged! It is absolutely extraordinary.
If the Senate inquiry has told anybody anything, it is that the poor and the disadvantaged will be undercompensated. They do not argue about the average, the mean; there are millions of people who will be undercompensated or will be losers. I can guarantee to you, from what I know of him, that Senator Harradine will not let you pass this package without attending to that problem because he is a moral man. So do not look to him to pass your package as it stands because he will not; neither will we. I carry on with the quote from Dr Hewson:
The principal losers will be the aged and other low-income earners, including those who pay little or no income tax or receive little or no welfare benefits—those whom Warren identifies as the working poor, and those who are asset- rich but income-poor.
What are the Democrats saying to you? What are the people you are trying to demean in your responses saying to you? They are saying to you, `If you don't pay income tax you don't get an income tax cut, and if you're not in the social security system you don't get a social security benefit, so you fall between the two of them.' This has been confirmed by Dr Hewson, whom the previous Prime Minister used to refer to as `Professor' in a derogatory fashion. But this chap is pretty clever, he is pretty well informed, he is well educated and he understands the evidence. The evidence is that your compensation package stinks, and it needs to be improved. He said:
But the revamp should be more than just a political exercise. One of the features of Fightback of which I am most proud is that in designing the compensation package we didn't just seek to compensate for the CPI effects of the tax package, but rather to actually skew the benefits to those who are particular disadvantaged in our society (those who, to some extent, have become victims of the ""system""), by deliberately and generously overcompensating them. 

John Hewson went to the people and said he would compensate those people—better than you would, so he says—but he also made a critical mistake which you have not. He took the whole package—all the details, warts and all—to the people, and the people rejected it because they did not like the composite package. What have you done? You have fudged and denied and gone about with mistruths and misrepresentations, and the result is that the Senate has the job of fixing this package.
Professor Neil Warren is an Associate Professor of Economics at the Australian Taxation Studies Program at the University of New South Wales. He wants food taxed, he wants the GST, and he is an author of the Fightback package—so he is on your side. In the Financial Review of 13 April 1999 he said:
First, the current compensation package needs to be significantly improved—
he is not talking about fiddling at the edges; he is talking about making real change—
with greater assistance to low-income households. Second, there must be a rethink on how best to compensate the low-income working poor and self-funded retirees.
And finally, the current compensation ""lock-in"" mechanism designed to ensure that the compensation package is maintained into the future will not work—even the Treasury now admits this is the case—and must be rethought.
Let us go back to page 347, item 5, of the select committee's main report. I will read again what the government said:
There was no credible evidence to demonstrate, on reasonable assumptions, that any modelled household type would be worse off as a result of the government's tax reform package.
You have lost that debate. You can go out and pillory the Senate as much as you like, you can tell lies about its obstructionism, you can tell lies about how the Senate process works and how the committees work, you can damn the senators, but you have lost that argument—the people do not believe you. We do not believe you, and we will not vote for your package for as long as your compensation package stands as it is. Item 6 of the report states:
The reasoned evidence— 

says the government—
to the Inquiries overwhelmingly supported food remaining in the GST base on efficiency, simplicity and equity grounds. The Democrats refused to acknowledge that when informed witnesses addressed issues of equity and fairness they supported the use of direct compensation rather than narrowing the broad-based design of the GST.
While I cannot repeat the endless statements on the record when we dealt with those two competing issues, let me make it clear to the Senate and to the people of Australia that when it comes to issues of fairness versus complexity we are on the side of fairness. Sorry, folks—we are on the side of the poor and the disadvantaged.
This report talks about reasoned evidence. So the bishops are unreasonable—they do not have reasoned evidence; ACOSS do not have reasoned evidence; the charitable organisations do not have reasoned evidence; and those who do not want the essentials of life taxed do not have reasoned evidence. Oh no, says the government, the only people we are going to listen to are the disciples of mammon. We are not going to listen to the bishops and the churches—no—but we will go and bend our knees every Sunday. But does anyone think that the churchmen at the end of their services sidle up to the coalition senators and members of the House of Representatives and say, `Good on you folks. You've got the right package. We're right behind you, but we're not going to tell the people that?' The bishops and the churches are telling you it stinks, and they have put reasoned evidence before us. Those on the other side are simply saying, `Discount that, because simplicity matters more.'
Let us talk about the simplicity argument. The government says that, at the minimum, the cost of imposing a GST on business is $1.9 billion. Let me repeat that: $1.9 billion at the minimum. Others think it could reach as high as $2.7 billion—from $1.9 billion to $2.7 billion—to introduce the GST as the government proposes. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, ASCPA, says that the cost of making food GST free will be $100 million—five per cent. The point is: how do you say that this entire package is ruined when the total compliance cost is $100 
 million for making food GST free, but somehow the $1.9 billion doesn't matter at all? It just does not add up. So when the bishops and the churches and the charitable organisations say to us, `Do not tax food,' when the people of Australia say to us, `Do not tax food,' and those on the side of taxing food say, `The total compliance cost is $100 million,' I am afraid that I am on the side of the churches and the charitable organisations and the $100 million.
—You're on the side of hypocrisy!
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw your  attention to the state of the house. (Quorum formed)  To continue my remarks, the way in which the government has attacked the Democrats is extraordinary because the Democrats have accepted that there need to be changes to our tax system. We are suggesting amendments to make it fairer. We are suggesting amendments to avoid very real problems which have been exposed in the Senate's inquiry. We are suggesting that it is not Peter's perfect package and that the government should acknowledge the difficulties where they arise.
The Democrats have said that they are prepared to support a fair tax system. We say that this tax proposal as it stands is not fair. We say it will make the poor and the disadvantaged worse off. We say that its economic benefits are skewed. During the early days of the committee the economic effects of the GST were considered in detail. We did find that the indirect tax base is shrinking as a proportion of gross domestic product and that PAYE taxpayers are paying an unfair burden due to the exponential growth of tax sheltered income. Because of this, there is a strong case for relief for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers to offset the effects of bracket creep since 1993. But there is not a strong case for 80 per cent of the benefits to go to 20 per cent of the taxpayers at the upper end.
While the ANTS package is likely in the longer term to have a small but positive impact on the economy, the GST itself is unlikely to have a significant positive effect on employment. Any jobs improvement from the package is likely to come from the elimi 
 nation of poverty traps and other related measures. Again and again on the public record I, on behalf of the Democrats, have congratulated the government for attacking the problem of poverty traps, but it needs to go a lot further. We found that zero rating sufficient foods in the economy for up to 90 per cent of all food will increase the number of jobs created in the short term by 8,000 to 12,000 but will not affect the long-term macro-economic benefits of the tax package.
We have drawn a number of lines in the sand. Those lines in the sand relate principally to making the compensation package far fairer, to making most foods GST free and to delivering the economic benefits of the diesel excise proposals without attaching to it the dreadful environmental harm which will attach to it if it is extended into the cities.
Treasury has argued that all households had similar price effects, showing that pensioners, disability pensioners, self-employed and couples without children face much higher price effects than single employed people, for example. The NATSEM report firmly debunked this view. Unfortunately, the NATSEM report did not calculate price effects for households by income.
—We did ask them to.
—We did ask them to. This is a major failing because the GST effect on the bottom quintile is half as much again as it is on the population as a whole. For those who are not technically minded, this means that essentially the modellers were unable to assess appropriately at what level and how the losers lock in in this situation. The Labor Party have listed two million losers. We have identified 1.1 million people who are not caught by either the income tax system or the social security system. We believe up to 4.9 million people are potential losers or will benefit marginally in this situation. All of that means that the government has to redo its numbers. You can retain the intent of your package if you attend to compensation, if you attend to broadening the number of goods made GST free, if you attend to the bad side effects from your diesel fuel policy.
Distinguished economist Professor Neville says that differences in consumption patterns vary depending on the circumstances of the person. Had the NATSEM modelling taken income specific spending into account, a much larger number of losers at the lowest level would have been identified. Unfortunately, what has happened is that the argument is now about how many and whether and all those sorts of things. I have deliberately put a great deal of emphasis on the words of Dr Hewson and of Professor Warren, because that line of argument is a nonsense—that is a diversion. It is accepted by business organisations, by charitable organisations, by the Democrats and by the community at large that the compensation package has to be improved. So stop talking about marginal changes; let us pull out a few billion to attend to that—and you have that money.
The food issue is something we will concentrate on during the committee debate, but really we have four options before us. The New Zealand option is the government's option. The New Zealand option says we will make food taxed. I have been to New Zealand recently and I have spoken to the people who attend to the needs of those at the bottom end of society in New Zealand. The result of the New Zealand changes overall has been bad for the poor and the disadvantaged in their society. We do not need to follow the New Zealand model. The other models with regard to food have broadly been described as the Dutch model, which is the all out model; the British model, which is food out, except for restaurants and takeaways; and the Irish model, which more narrowly defines food primarily as fresh foods and commonly consumed groceries.
Frankly, as Senator Lees said yesterday, it is Peter Costello's call. If he wants to go with the Australian Food and Grocery Council to all out, we are there. We will be quite happy with that. We will accept any of those definitions that we have put forward, or variations of those definitions. I want to remind the Senate that, on the food issue, Professor Cnossen said there are 105 countries in this world—and I think that is about half of all of the countries—that have a GST or VAT 
 system. The vast majority of them do not tax food or they concessionally tax food. Even those countries which Professor Cnossen has advised as to how they should treat the GST system in their country have continued down that route.
Those are often countries that have authoritarian governments, which do not have the restraints that we have in our system. Yet on behalf of their people, over the 40 years in which GSTs have been applied, they have chosen to follow the principle of not taxing the essentials of life—in particular, food. Somehow this government says that we should follow the New Zealand option because that is much better on the grounds of simplicity. We should tax food because if we do not it is going to cost 40,000 retailers $100 million. What an extraordinary view. This government was quite happy for the superannuation industry to incur $100 million worth of costs in trying to manage a new tax, yet it says that $100 million dollars worth of food compliance costs are too much. It is ludicrous. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-04-21,"—I have been deeply involved in the minutiae of the tax package in attempting to understand it with as much completeness as I can. I was going to deal with the details of the package in this speech during the second reading, but I realise now that speeches in the second reading are to address the principles which should govern our approach to measures such as this. So, if you will excuse me, I will attempt to express some general principles and viewpoints and then come to certain specifics.
The mere mention of taxation in any forum at all will of course get a reaction—there is no doubt about that. If you talk about taxation, you immediately get a reaction because everybody has an opinion on it. The government has now presented to the parliament, and through it to the people, a taxation package which is nothing less than revolutionary. It has far-reaching consequences. The government is to be congratulated on addressing this very important issue in our society. The ACCI and others called the tax summit in 1985, and there has been consideration given by various 
 governments to it, but at least this government has attempted to bite the bullet. Whether that is ultimately good for society or whether it is not depends on how it measures up to certain principles.
The government has had a long-term plan on this particular issue and on other areas as well. I do congratulate the government for the way it has sold the package and on how opinion makers appear to have grasped the package as if it were a lifebuoy thrown over in turbulent economic seas. Even those who are going to be shafted by this particular package—for example, the farmers—seem to have accepted it. During a committee hearing in one state, it was the first time in my long experience in this parliament that I heard any group at all say, `Please tax my products.' That is precisely what is occurring in respect of the producers of food in this country.
Not unexpectedly, we have had an enormous response to the package. Some 1,300 actual submissions were made to the ANTS committee of the Senate. They were very useful indeed. I felt that the committee system did work. I know the Treasurer had another view about the matter, but the committee system enabled people to come before the committee and to express their views for or against—or to suggest certain amendments. I found that very useful indeed.
 I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the secretary of the committee and the committee staff for the extremely professional way that they approached their task. I feel they are not often given credit where credit is due. This was somewhat of a different type of committee from the ones I have been used to in this place in that people—and I am talking about the government and the opposition—appeared to have a fixed point of view that they did not deviate from, and that was a bit of a problem. Nevertheless, I found the committee inquiry useful.
 I also found very useful the thousands and thousands of letters and phone calls that I received from people throughout Australia. I have to apologise that I have not been able to answer them all or even a majority of them. Let us face it: unfortunately in a position like mine, which is an undesirable situation, you 
 do get a huge volume of mail. One day in December last year 2,300 actual pieces of mail came to me—and that is not counting the email. Whoever invented email ought to be strung up! So I do apologise for not answering them all. I take this opportunity of thanking my very dedicated staff for the way they have handled all of these matters.
Tax has a social as well as an economic dimension. It has social and economic consequences. It does raise questions of what is best or better, what is good or bad, what is right or wrong. There are moral as well as economic consequences; and there are moral choices to be made by the government. These must be made by the government. Books have been written about the purpose of government, but the purpose of government is simply the administration of the common good preferably in a free, equal and life-affirming society.
 The object of a free society is not laissez faire; the object, surely, of a free society is the genuine flourishing of the individual human beings living within that society. To achieve that, democracy and the market must be disciplined by a vibrant moral culture which is grounded upon a shared public conviction as to what is `moral truth'. The cynics will say, `What is truth?' If the government allowed that situation to exist, then of course you would have a laissez faire situation where the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, and you had the survival of the fittest. I believe none of us would adhere to that cynical view of unrestrained economic rationalism or heavy-handed dictatorial government.
Tax is a very much needed tool for governments to administer the common good. Surely, in the consideration of this very vital subject of taxation, we should all have a shared public conviction of what is moral truth and what are the principles which should guide such an important consideration. Could I suggest that among those principles are the need to build a nation and to protect its people and the need to create an economic and social order in which the citizens can live with freedom and dignity and pursue both their spiritual development and material 
 wellbeing in conditions of equal opportunity and economic security.
Tax should not stifle human initiative. It should reward people for work, it should remove poverty traps, it should be fair and simple and be based on the capacity to pay and it should have high compliance and low evasion. One of the things that is in the minds of people when you go around the country is: how come one of the richest people, probably the richest person in this country, does not pay tax? That may or may not be so, but that is what you get all the time. So the tax should be based on the capacity to pay. It should be progressive, not regressive; that is, falling on those least able to afford it. It should, of course, uphold the principle of distributive justice. In other words, we should uphold the dignity of each individual human person, because the test of a civilised society is in how it treats its most vulnerable.
I come to the final point of what a government should do in respect of tax in our society. The fundamental group unit of society is the family, and its taxation measures should be family friendly. Why is the government proposing to have a GST? The GST is required, according to the government, because of the dwindling tax base. Why do we have a dwindling tax base? Because people are not having children—that is why. We are getting to be an ageing population; we are going to have an enormous problem.
But the burden of that problem is now being placed, through a GST, on families, who are not responsible for the original problem. If Australia needs new taxes to expand the revenue base to pay for pensions and health services for an ageing population, does it make sense to impose a GST on the necessities of life involved in raising children? Does this not mean fewer taxpayers and a smaller tax base in the future? We only have to look at what is happening in Europe. European birth rates have dropped well below replacement rates as the tax cost of children has gone up with increased value added taxes. Should we be making it harder for Australian families to have and raise children? The cost of raising children is assumed to be a form of consumption tax—remember we are talking 
 about a consumption tax. But investment in children is surely a social and economic necessity if the economic system is to continue. We will get the response, `But there is compensation in the package.' May I respectfully suggest that that is not enough and that much of that is doing what ought to have been done previously.
The Labor Party cannot take any solace at all from its continued erosion of the family in the tax system. If it is going to win power it will need to have a look at both the electoral advantage and the economic advantage in Australia and do something about the family. Otherwise that fundamental group unit of society will be left high and dry.
Much has been said about food. I put to the Senate that there is far more than food involved, and I know other honourable senators realise that. There are other necessities of life. If I recall correctly, we heard during the committee inquiry that for the lowest quintile of family groups food represents an outlay of some 24 per cent of household income, whereas the other necessities of life—clothing, rent, transport and the like—represent 38 or 39 per cent. There might be people who are able to go without clothing in this nation; you certainly cannot in my state.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—There was a dump of snow on Mount Wellington this morning. In all seriousness, these are necessities of life, and I believe that the compensation for them that has been suggested by Treasury is not adequate. I will not go into the modelling or the misassumptions that underlie some of the proposals in the tax package.
There are suggested compensation packages for pensioners and people on low incomes, and I am quite convinced that those compensation measures are inadequate. Some people have suggested, `Why don't you go along the way of NATSEM's option 7 with tobacco and housing in?' If people are into this business of compensation, that is certainly well worth looking at and modelling but, as Mr Carmody has said, you do have to lock the compensation in in some way. As far as pensions are concerned, you have to lock them in to the 
 male total average weekly earnings—25 per cent plus, in that case, six per cent.
Whilst we are talking about compensation, let us talk about the other issue: the rate of the GST. The rate of the GST, it is said by the government, will not change unless all the states agree. As Mr Keating said—Senator Lees referred to it the other day—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—That's right—`Don't get between a premier and a bucket of money.' So I do not know whether that is a satisfactory measure at all. If this is going to go through, you have to lock it in in some very severe way so that the 10 per cent will not grow.
I am a believer in the principle of subsidiary function—that power should reside with the smallest group capable of efficiently performing the functions with the power required. That is a very important principle, and I therefore believe in state governments, local governments and the like. I am a bit worried, philosophically, about money just flowing to the states without them having the responsibility to do anything about it. I understand the problem about regressivity of so much of the state taxes. (Extension of time granted)
I am greatly concerned about the fact that certain charities are going to be affected substantially by this measure. These have been mentioned in the debate, so I will not remention them here. At the last meeting of our committee, I did ask the Treasury official who the losers were. I have a response. The response did not satisfy me, and maybe it never will. It is very difficult to determine who are the losers—some you can. But bear in mind that the government has been saying that there are no losers. There are in fact losers, and they must be compensated. The government must consider the ways and means of compensating those losers.
One came to mind only yesterday when a friend of mine faxed me, and that is a PhD student living off the smell of an oily rag—well, living off a scholarship. I believe PhD students should live off the smell of an oily rag. It helps their intellectual capability and 
 they perform better. But never having done any of that, I would not know. That is one, and self-funded retirees are another. So quite a large number of people will be in that losers group. How do we compensate them? Treasury says that it is very difficult to do so because they do not have a relationship with government. Mind you, a lot of them do not want a relationship with the government, to be quite frank. I have actually known people who were eligible for the pension and have not claimed it. There are quite a number of those. There are people who are not in the taxation system and they are not in the social security system. The government has plenty of ideas. Maybe it should come up with a tax credit fund or some such plan that would be able to fund the extra taxes which these people will be required to pay without any compensation.
There are other matters that I wanted to briefly mention, but I will just limit them to a couple. I think it is important for me to raise them. One is the question of the international competitiveness of the tax package. It is suggested that international competitiveness would be advantaged by the package as a whole. If the GST does produce claims for compensation—wage claims, for example—and wage outcomes, then it may have a negative result.
I will ask certain things of the minister representing the Treasurer. How does the GST lower the equivalent marginal tax rate if income equals consumption plus savings? Does it matter for economic incentives whether money is taxed going into the purse or pocket or out of the purse or pocket? Is the GST equivalent to an income tax surcharge on income less savings? If a person spends 90 per cent of their income, does a 10 per cent tax on spending amount to a nine per cent income tax surcharge? Can the Senate be provided with tables showing equivalent marginal tax rates after adding back net indirect tax rates to the proposed income tax scales? What about the payment of compensation via social security? Does that involve economic inefficiency in churning money around? 
Some of these questions were briefly referred to during the committee hearings. I raised a number of questions—and continue to raise them—about the Ralph committee and how the Senate does not have before it all of the proposals that were mentioned in the document entitled Tax Reform: not a new tax, a new tax system. Are they logically consistent? Indirect tax reform is supposed to bring investment into Australia, but will the direct tax measures drive both domestic and foreign investment out of Australia? I was very interested to read an article by Steve Lewis and Fiona Buffini on page 4 of the Financial Review:
The business community has mounted a strong push to ease the tax impost on offshore earnings of domestic—and multinational—companies in a bid to boost Australia's international competitiveness.
Already there is some considerable concern being expressed in that case by the Business Coalition for Tax Reform.
The indirect tax reforms are meant to reduce the cost of producing in this country. This is supposed to attract foreign investment and expand our capital stock, our employment and our exports. But many of the measures being considered by the Ralph committee have been roundly criticised by both tax professionals and representatives of groups of foreign investors as creating disincentives for foreign companies to invest here or even for Australian companies to retain head offices here. In addition, there are serious concerns about the relative competitiveness of Australian managed funds against incoming US mutual funds, about disincentives to save through life insurance and about the impact on small business and farms, might I mention, of taxing trusts like companies. Family farms and small businesses may experience serious cash flow drains. Others have also pointed out that the loss of accelerated depreciation being considered by the Ralph committee would have adverse impacts on exporters such as miners and farmers and tend to negate or offset the benefits of GST refunds on exports.
I did not see any modelling of this, and I asked a number of questions on these particular matters during the committee inquiry stage of the Senate process. No modelling has 
 addressed these matters. We do not have it before us here. Is it fair to ask us to judge all of these things without having the second leg of the package to consider? I just raise that. Maybe the government will be able to advise us on these matters. In this sense the Senate does not have before it all those issues.
The windfall losses of groups of people have been referred to in other speeches, including those who will have to pay increased insurance premiums because of the transitional costs of the package on insurance. There is also the question of how credit unions, Aussie Home Loans and others will be affected. That has all been referred to in other speeches.
Finally, I want to come to the question of whether the GST legislation is constitutionally valid. Is there one subject of taxation as required by section 55 of the Constitution? The High Court decision in the Mutual Pools case seems to indicate that the Commonwealth may not be able to make up a subject of taxation entirely as it pleases, that it cannot tax land and intellectual property, for example, under the one imposition act. These are matters that I think one should raise in a speech on the second reading. I have some advice on this and I just raise it for the government's consideration. I do not think that the enormous anti-avoidance powers that have been given by the GST bill to the Commissioner of Taxation would be regarded in the long run as constitutional.
It would be great if we could have consensus on such an important public policy issue. It would have made it more credible. However, that is not the case. I would have liked to have gone into the question of the mandate, how the Senate is part of the government in the broad sense and how our responsibility is the administration of the common good.
I am concerned, most importantly, about the effects on jobs in my own state of Tasmania. That has been stated quite clearly by the government's preferred modeller, Mr Chris Murphy, who stated that there would be substantial job losses. I would like to hear responses by the government. I thank the Senate for allowing me to continue over time.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-21,"—The bills being debated in the Senate, A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998  and related bills, establish a new tax system for Australia. This is the most comprehensive reform of taxation in the history of this country. The bills set out a new tax system for the new century. The legislation sweeps away an outdated, inefficient tax system that does not serve the needs of the modern nation. The new tax system rewrites Commonwealth-state financial relations. The new tax system which we have proposed will lighten the burden of income tax for families and average wage earners.
The government's proposal was released before the last election and we put the plan to the Australian people. The taxation plan, Tax Reform: not a new tax, a new tax system, was the central focus of the election campaign. It was debated on a daily basis in all the media. After that prolonged debate, after the consideration of the government's proposals to reform the taxation system in the country, the people of Australia endorsed it at the last election. We asked for a mandate and we received that mandate. The government's tax plans, which are now before the Senate, encapsulate these changes to deliver to our great country a more productive and more competitive tax system. It will help our exports, deliver more jobs and work to improve the standard of living in this country. We believe that, after this very prolonged debate which has ensued since the government's plans were first released in the middle of last year, we have received overwhelming support. We have received the mandate that we sought from the people and which I mentioned.
Business groups have been very supportive. Businesses have already noted that they will enjoy lower costs and be able to grow and give more Australians jobs. For example, the Business Coalition for Tax Reform said:
We believe that measures in `A New Tax System' form an integrated approach to tax reform that will improve our international competitiveness, encourage investment and job creation, encourage savings and improve fairness. 

The farming sector has been particularly supportive of our tax reform plan. The National Farmers Federation stated that, for farms modelled, the benefits range from an average increase of $1,825 up to $49,000 per annum. The increase in disposable income was typically in the range of one per cent to two per cent per annum.
We went to the people; we received a mandate. Farmers support this measure; and people in rural Australia, we believe, support the measures we put forward. Business groups large and small support the tax package. But also all state premiers and territory chief ministers endorsed on 9 April 1999 the intergovernmental agreement on the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. This is the largest single transformation of Commonwealth-state financial relations since at least the Second World War. It improves the financial position of the states by providing them with access to a robust and growing tax base. This is needed to secure the funding for important community services like roads, hospitals and schools.
There has been some debate in this chamber about the reaction of state premiers to the tax reform package. The state premiers, not surprisingly, as some have noted, want a growing source of income. But we should ask ourselves why they want that growing source of income. Of course, they want that growing source because state governments provide important community services like roads, hospitals and schools. This is why the state governments want to put intergovernmental financial relations on a sounder basis.
Let me make it clear. This path-breaking reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations is only possible because of our tax reform plan. If we are going to help the schools and welfare services in the states, and if we are going to help the states to carry out their important health functions, people who support that will vote for these bills. Let me quote Premier Kennett of Victoria, who said:
I think the Premiers Conference is a seminal day in Australia's history. It is now up to the Senate to recognise its responsibilities and to discharge them in the same way. 

As Premier Beattie said: `The Howard government got a mandate for the GST in the last election.' This is a historic opportunity for Australia. The government had the courage to put a comprehensive tax reform plan to the people before the last election and, unfortunately, we have seen that the Labor Party has adopted its usual `no' approach to any major reform program. This is in contrast to the very different attitude that the coalition took when we were in opposition. Of course, the former ministers of the Keating government now run away as fast as they can from the reforms that were carried out by the Keating government, but the fact of the matter is that these reforms were supported by the coalition parties when we were in opposition.
The Labor Party has basically turned its back on reform of the tax system and has mounted what is seen to be an outrageous scare campaign. The Labor Party refuses to accept that Australia voted for tax reform, for major tax cuts and benefits for Australian families, and for generous compensation for low income Australians. It is interesting to note the difference between the attitude of the federal Labor Party and the approach that Labor premiers and their state branches are taking. As I said, you have only to look at the comments by Mr Bacon, the Premier of Tasmania, by Mr Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, and by Mr Beattie, the Premier of Queensland, to see that the federal Labor Party is quite isolated in its completely negative attitude to tax reform.
Of course, we have had people like Mr Bob Hogg, a former federal secretary of the Labor Party and a former state secretary of the Victorian division, who has called on the Labor Party to pass these bills. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the federal Labor Party, even within its own ranks, is becoming increasingly isolated as the wider community continues to appreciate the significant benefits of the government's tax reform program.
The introduction of our tax reform program will be a very significant change to the taxation system in this country. Wholesale sales tax will be abolished. This is the system which the Labor Party thinks is a good sys 
 tem, but in its views it is completely isolated. The federal Labor Party is the only institution in this country which believes that the wholesale sales tax system is a good system.
In consultation with the states, we are abolishing nine types of taxes—which again will help make sure that we have an efficient tax system. Let me list some of the taxes that will be abolished by state governments: financial institutions duty; the debits tax; the stamp duty on marketable securities; conveyancing duties on business property; stamp duties on credit arrangements, instalment purchase arrangements and rental hiring arrangements; stamp duties on leases; stamp duties on mortgages, bonds, debentures and other loan securities; stamp duties on cheques, bills of exchange, promissory notes; and, of course, the so-called bed taxes.
The abolition of the wholesale sales tax and other taxes is vital to reduce the cost of doing business. At present, half the money raised from the wholesale sales tax comes from taxing goods purchased by business. It imposes a hidden tax on exports and import-competing industries. The introduction of the GST will change this. As businesses are entitled to full import tax credits, the hidden burden will be removed. In fact, business costs will fall by more than $10 billion, as a result of the GST and the abolition of current inefficient and unfair taxes.
The GST will also lead to a $4.5 billion fall in the cost of exporting. Lifting this burden will increase the competitiveness of Australia's export industry. The bill provides for GST-free activities which include exports of goods and services, international air and sea travel, and domestic air travel purchased by non-residents, taxes and charges at all levels of government—excluding local government rates and water and sewerage rates and charges. The price of GST services will fall, because tax will be removed from the purchase of those supplying them. The GST will be broadly based, providing simplicity for business and consumers.
The government has not neglected important community services. In its plan the government proposed that virtually all health, education and child-care services, charitable 
 activities and religious services should be GST free. The recommendations of the Voss committee further extended the GST-free areas proposed in the government's tax policy. They recommended GST-free treatment for a wide range of medical and allied health services. They provide for comprehensive GST-free treatment for residential and community care for the aged and the disabled, provided that care is at a sufficiently high standard. They provide for GST-free treatment for a wide range of aids and appliances specifically designed for people with illness or disabilities. They provide for GST-free treatment for all secondary and tertiary courses, including vocational courses, provided students are eligible for income support. They provide generous rules for charities. All of these recommendations were adopted in the legislation which is now before the Senate.
One major issue is constantly ignored by the Labor Party as they attack the government's reform program. We are providing major tax cuts to the Australian people. The tax cuts will more than compensate taxpayers for the introduction of the GST and will also make it possible for ordinary Australians to save and invest. The personal income tax bill gives effect to the cuts in rates of income tax and provides extra assistance to families by increasing the family assistance tax-free thresholds. The tax-free threshold increases to $6,000 and the lowest rate decreases from 20 per cent to 17 per cent. This helps all taxpayers but is of particular benefit to low income earners.
Under the old system incomes between $20,700 and $50,000 were subject to rates of 34 per cent and 43 per cent. The new system applies a lower rate of 30 per cent to all those on incomes between $20,000 and $50,000. I stress that this will mean that around 81 per cent of taxpayers will have a top marginal rate of 30 per cent or less compared with 30 per cent of taxpayers at present.
Lower and middle income taxpayers in particular will keep more of their wages. This incentive encourages Australians to seek promotion, extra training and overtime. More effort will now mean more reward for 
 individuals as well as a more productive Australian economy. The top rate remains unchanged at 47 per cent for those with annual incomes of more than $75,000. The $75,000 threshold will be equal to around 1.7 times average earnings, and this will ensure that average earners do not drift into paying the top marginal rate, which would have otherwise occurred early in the next century.
I mentioned the significant gains for rural and regional Australia. The reform package also acknowledges the high cost of transport, particularly for rural and regional Australia. The new diesel fuel credit scheme will effectively reduce diesel excise for all off-road—including marine—users from around 37c per litre to zero. For the larger transport users, including rail, the reduction will be from around 37c per litre to 18c per litre. This is on top of savings of 7c per litre for business users of petrol and diesel through their access to a refund of the GST paid on fuel. Alternative fuels will remain excise free on the introduction of the GST tax. The reforms to diesel fuel are now to be opposed by the Democrats, although we are yet to see their amendments. They have been promised as soon as practicable, and we look forward to seeing them. As the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out in the House, this opposition by the Democrats will overtly penalise those who live in rural and regional Australia.
No bills before the Senate have been subjected to greater inquiry than these bills. No bills that have ever come before the Senate, as far as I am aware, have received such intensive Senate scrutiny. If you add together the number of months that Senate committees have met, we can probably reach at least 52 weeks and possibly more. Every possible aspect of these bills which are before the Senate have been subject to intensive inquiry. Hundreds of submissions have been received. We believe that everyone who had a question to raise certainly was able to use those vehicles.
We believe that there is no credible evidence to demonstrate, on reasonable assumptions, that any modelled household type would be worse off as a result of the government's tax reform package. The recent 
 evidence to the inquiries overwhelmingly supported food remaining in the GST base, on efficiency, simplicity and equity grounds. The Democrats have unfortunately refused to acknowledge that, when informed witnesses addressed issues of equity and fairness, they supported the use of direct compensation rather than narrowing the broad-based design of the goods and services tax. Yesterday the Democrats provided some further signs of their proposals to amend the bills before the Senate. We believe that the measures announced by Senator Lees yesterday would not only greatly increase the complexity of the taxation system but also favour the higher income earners. We believe the measures ignore the evidence that was presented to the committee.
Let me take the example of baking products. Baking products, with the exception of bread or fruit bread, will not be taxed. But what if, as the Baking Industry Association itself says, the baker runs cheese or other products on the bread? What is bread? Is a cheese and bacon roll bread? Is a bagel bread? Is a fruit bun bread? These are just some of the examples. There is a plethora of examples which could be used to demonstrate the complexity that the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats will lead to in the tax system. After this very prolonged period of inquiry, we believe that the overwhelming weight of evidence supports the government's position. We believe that that is yet another reason why these bills should be passed, and be passed forthwith, by the Senate.
Let me turn briefly to the personal tax cuts and increased family assistance. From the outset, one of the government's guiding principles for tax reform was that there must be no overall increase in the tax burden. We have delivered on that. The tax cuts will more than compensate taxpayers for the introduction of the goods and services tax and will also make it possible for ordinary Australians to save and invest. The personal income tax bill gives effect to the cuts in rates of income tax and provides extra assistance to families by increasing the family tax assistance tax-free thresholds. We believe, therefore, that in 
 so many ways the system that we propose across the broad range of Australian society provides huge benefits for the nation, for its people, for its families and for the people who run business. Indeed, as I said, across the broad sweep of the nation, we believe that the system that we propose is one which deserves the support of the Senate.
A number of amendments have been moved by non-government senators. It will not surprise senators that we will be opposing the amendments which have been moved. Senator Cook's amendment in particular attempts to defeat the second reading of the bill. Of course, if that particular amendment is passed, that will end the debate forthwith. This again shows the incredibly negative attitude of the Labor Party to tax reform. The Labor Party is now attempting to stop proper debate on these bills.
—Defeat them—no GST.
—The Labor Party not only is ignoring the mandate that the government received at the last election, not only ignoring the weight of evidence that was put to the Senate committee, but also is now, through the amendment proposed by Senator Cook, attempting to defeat the second reading of these bills. The government, quite naturally, strongly opposes this move by the Labor Party. To repeat myself, this will mean, if that amendment is carried, that there will be no further debate on these bills.
Senator Cook sits here in the chamber and smiles and nods in agreement. Senator Cook, the truth of the matter is, I think, if you move down this route, that the Labor Party will properly stand condemned. We had an election on these bills. We won the election. We are now going through the proper parliamentary procedures in putting our proposals to the parliament. It is fascinating that the Labor Party seeks to stop debate that other non-government parties may wish to have on these very important bills and to prevent the government delivering on its election promise. Make no mistake: it is an attempt to prevent the government delivering on the promise that we went to the Australian people on and that we were elected on.
I am foreshadowing a number of government amendments to the GST bills that we will be moving in the committee stage. The amendments will incorporate suggestions made to the government during the wide-ranging and very constructive consultations we have undertaken since the bills were introduced. These changes do not alter our GST proposals but merely refine the legislation to ensure that the government's policy is carried through in the most practical, efficient and cost-effective way possible.
With the assistance of a number of professional and industry bodies and through input from community organisations we have continued to look for ways of making the design and operation of the GST even better. I am pleased to report that this has resulted in a number of innovative changes which will continue to support our claim that our GST is world's best practice.
There are around 30 issues on which amendments are proposed. These amendments are in the nature of finetuning of the bill. However, half a dozen or so of these changes are of particular note. They include the changes we are making to the GST treatment of insurance and to the general anti-avoidance provision, to extending the benefit of the grouping provisions to small business structures and to corporate treasuries, to making it clear that the separate sale of farmland and improvements will be GST free and to making a number of changes that will make administration easier for charities.
The model we are adopting in Australia for the goods and services tax treatment of general insurance is an elegant solution to a set of circumstances other countries are still struggling with, and it gets the right result. This approach provides complete treatment for both the insured and the insurer. It means that input tax credits will be available for payouts when the GST is paid on premiums and, conversely, that no credits are available if no GST is paid on premiums. Payouts under insurance policies will have no GST consequences for unregistered persons.
The government is also responding to concerns raised about the general anti-avoidance provision. That is, I think, one of the issues 
 that Senator Harradine raised in his remarks. We will amend the provision to make its scope and operation clearer, to ensure that it does not apply to anything done or any arrangement entered into before 2 December 1998, to make it clear that it will not apply to the exercise of an option provided for under the legislation and so that it applies where the tax benefit obtained is the principal effect of the arrangement and not simply a principal effect.
The GST grouping provisions that apply for the benefit of companies will be extended to trusts and partnerships. This will ensure that small family businesses which conduct their businesses through several entities, including trusts and partnerships, will be able to share in the compliance cost benefits of grouping in the same way as a group of companies.
There are also a number of amendments in this package which will make dealing with the GST easier for charities. Under the GST, entities can choose to account on a cash basis if their annual turnover is $500,000 or less. Businesses will generally account for GST on the same basis as they currently account for income tax. However, charitable institutions and gift-deductible bodies do not need to account for income tax and often account for their activities only on a cash basis. Under amendments I will move in the committee stages, charitable institutions, gift-deductible bodies and trustees of charitable funds will be able to choose to account on a cash basis regardless of their turnover.
The government's expressed intention was that no net revenue would be raised from applying the GST to gambling. This would be achieved by reducing state and territory taxes by a similar amount to the GST. However, in the case of raffles conducted by charities, no state or territory taxes will be levied. To ensure our policy is achieved in the simplest possible fashion, such raffles and bingo run by charities will be GST free.
Amendments will also make it clear that the sale of the family farm and improvements as a going concern will be GST free. However, farms are often sold piecemeal, that is, the stock and machinery are sold separately in clearing sales and then the land and buildings 
 are sold afterwards. Selling the farm land in these circumstances may not constitute the sale of a going concern. The amendments will ensure that the separate sale of farm land, including improvements, will be GST free.
In addition, to remove any practical difficulties for business under the government's proposal to reduce the 32 per cent wholesale sales tax to 22 per cent, I will also be moving amendments to specify a change to the date of effect of this measure. The reduction of the 32 per cent rate will come into effect 21 days after the date on which the GST bill receives royal assent. This is in response to concerns from businesses that they need sufficient notice to implement the necessary changes, such as altering prices.
The amendments we are proposing reflect the consultations which we have had with groups. We believe that they are an appropriate response to issues which have been raised with us. Senator Harradine has raised quite a number of questions in the debate. I will make sure that a response is given to those questions.
The committee stage of the debate is a time to outline the general positions and general principles that various parties in the Senate are adopting. The government's position is quite clear: we believe that we need major reform of the tax system. The Labor Party position is equally clear; it is utterly opposed to reform. The Labor Party went to the election with a very poorly thought-out and poorly developed tax policy and was appropriately defeated. They wasted their first period in opposition and I think they were judged correctly by the public.
I believe the Democrats have come to this debate recognising that the tax system is broken. The Labor Party does not accept that. The Labor Party thinks that Australia has a great tax system. We do not.
—We want reform without the GST.
—The Labor Party does not want reform. The Labor Party has no alternative plan. The poorly thought-out issues which were developed on a piece of paper and put to the Australian public were treated 
 with contempt by them, and rightly so because the Labor Party refused to do the work. Typically of the Labor Party, it says no to everything but when you ask it what its alternatives are it does not have any solutions. The Democrats, I believe, have come to this debate recognising that reform must take place—that is light years ahead of the Labor Party position.
It is very clear from issues raised today by Senator Murray that there is quite a deal of difference between the government's position and the Democrats' position on a number of quite fundamental issues. Nonetheless, we recognise that the Democrats are seeking to raise issues and in the committee stages undoubtedly we will have a vigorous debate on those particular matters.
I regret that in many ways the Greens seem to have excluded themselves from major debates in the Senate. That may not be apparent from the amount of time which is taken up with debates with Green senators. The truth of the matter is that the two Green senators have a balance of power position in the Senate. It is a great pity that the Green senators relentlessly align themselves with the Labor Party.
—Not on everything.
—On just about everything. Senator Sherry is embarrassed by the company he so often keeps, and quite rightly.
—No, I'm not embarrassed.
—Because of that embarrassment, I am very glad I raised that issue. We have noted how often the Greens support the Labor Party position. I think it is a great pity that Senator Margetts and Senator Bob Brown do not take part in the wider debates. It is a great pity that you do not encourage wider discussion and negotiation with the government on issues.
—So does that translate to selling out?
—Senator Margetts, you have had your say and I might have mine, if you don't mind. I think it is a pity. The Democrats differ from us, but we have discussions. The Independent senators will differ, but discussions occur on many issues. 
 Some of those issues are resolved; others are not. No discussions ever occur with the Green senators. We sit in this chamber and listen to reams of amendments and a torrent of words but the Green senators achieve absolutely nothing, despite the fact that they have the balance of power in the Senate.
Senator Brown interjecting—
—I am sorry about that, Senator Brown, but when people review what has happened over the last three years and they say, `What did Senator Brown achieve and what did Senator Margetts achieve?' it will be the shortest list of any senator in this chamber. I think that is a pity, and I put that on record. So I think that as the second reading debate moves to an end—
—I bet you I got more amendments up than you in the whole time you were in opposition.
—Order! Minister, would you ignore the interjections.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Unfortunately, I seem to have provoked the senator. Anyway, my remarks stand on the record and others will judge them.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—People will judge your records, Senator Brown and Senator Margetts, and they will judge mine. As I said, the second reading debate now comes to an end. There have been many issues which have been raised in the second reading debate. I have no doubt that these are going to be fully canvassed in the hours, days and weeks ahead. Given that the government have a mandate, given that we have put a plan before the public—this plan has been fully discussed, debated and voted upon; we have had the most extensive Senate inquiries in history—we believe that the time has come for the debate to progress, we hope with due speed, so that the Australian people can look forward—
—You are ready to go, are you? 
—We are ready to go, Senator, but I think there are others that are not quite ready. I leave the detailed arrangements to the Manager of Government Business. I commend these bills to the Senate. They are very important bills, they are major reform bills and they are bills which will bring great benefit to our nation and to Australians.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to propose that when the question that the bills be read a second time is put, the bills Nos 1 to 6 as listed on today's Notice Paper  be put separately and as one block.
—The chair will carry that request at the request of any senator. That will be done. Minister, you seek some clarification?
—Would you explain what is meant by `put separately and as one block'?
—I am proposing that when the question is put that the bills be read a second time, bills Nos 1 to 6, as listed in today's Notice Paper , which are the substantive bills, be put separately and that the block of bills Nos 1 to 6 be the first block to be dealt with.
—As I said, the chair will divide the question at the request of any senator, and that is what we will do.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-04-21,"—I seek to move an amendment to the Labor Party's second reading amendment.
—Is this one that you have foreshadowed?
—No.
—You need leave.
—I seek leave.
Leave granted.
—In order for me to support the Labor Party's amendment, I would seek to amend it by deleting part (b). I move:
Omit paragraph (b). 

I seek leave to briefly explain that.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate. Just briefly, it is about the emphasis on applauding the efforts by, in effect, the Keating Labor government to maintain or emphasise a low inflationary economy in Australia. There are many issues in relation to that, including the fact that the accord did not keep up with the profit levels of many corporations. In relation to unemployment, I think the issue is that often inflation was put above unemployment. So from the point of view of the Greens (WA), we would not like that to be seen as a particular issue that we applauded, because it needs to be so qualified that it becomes meaningless. Therefore, I would be happy to support the rest of the Labor Party's second reading amendment, but first I would like to have it amended by the deletion of part (b).",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-04-21,"—by leave—I just say that this seems to me to be an unhelpful process. I can understand the opposition making certain points about the matter, but it seems to me to be quite unhelpful to the way things are ultimately to proceed. I expressed my view about matters during my second reading contribution, and no doubt everybody else did as well. I am concerned about the rushing of this measure. I think tax matters should be considered very carefully, and other honourable senators will say, `They have been.' Even those who will be principally affected by the Ralph committee's examination of the measures that were contained in the package itself are calling for time. They say that the reforms are too vital to rush. I think these reforms being proposed here are too vital to rush, and I do not believe that the proposals that have been put forward by the opposition will assist in that.
If the government is insisting that the matters be considered by the Senate, I am not in a position to oppose its right to insist on that. I believe that in the long run it will be seen, possibly even by the government, that it is more appropriate for the matter to be given further consideration and not to be governed by a date deadline, which appears 
 to be the case at the moment. If voting for this amendment by the opposition means that that is the end of the matter at this point in time, I cannot support that, although I am in favour of a number of the aspirations that are in some of these amendments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-21,"—by leave—The amendment proposed by Senator Margetts does not address the fundamental intent of this amendment, which is, effectively, to wipe out the bills to be considered because it says, `Omit all words after ""That"".' I know that the Labor Party has paid a great deal of serious attention to the ANTS package through the various committee processes over the months that have passed, as indeed have Senator Margetts and Senator Harradine. It seems to us that the government has every right to argue that its legislation should be considered, and the appropriate time for the decision as to whether to reject it is during the third reading debate when the amendments will either be satisfactory to the Senate and the government or they will not. So the problem with Senator Margetts's amendment is that it does not deal with the fundamental issue. So I foreshadow, as you would expect, that the Democrats intend to argue that the bills do go to committee stage and are properly considered at amendment. Therefore, to us, Senator Margetts's amendment is almost irrelevant for that reason. So I put that point of view, and we will see how it proceeds from there.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-04-21,"—by leave—I note and respect the remarks made by those senators who by leave have intervened in the debate again. I would like to very briefly make some points on what has been put. Firstly, we will not be accepting the amendment to our amendment from Senator Margetts of the Greens (WA). We think it is appropriate to state the record on this. I am disappointed that the Greens (WA) feel that that is not the case, but I do trust that if their amendment is not successful they will feel able to vote for the substantive motion. But that is a matter to be arrived at very shortly.
Senator Harradine has raised a point. I respect the remarks he has made. From the Labor Party point of view, it is a matter of fundamental principle that Australia should have tax reform but it should not have a GST. The most profound way we can state that is by rejecting the bills at this stage. That is what we would prefer this Senate to do and I hope the Senate can find itself obliged to support us. My remarks to the Democrats are the same. I understand that they have foreshadowed a number of amendments to the legislation; we simply believe that you cannot make this legislation fair and, therefore, we insist on our amendment.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Margetts to Senator Cook's proposed amendment be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Cook in respect of A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998  be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1

"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1999-04-21,"—Some weeks ago, 60 Minutes  revealed some of the business dealings of the former Prime Minister of Australia in relation to his infamous piggery. It has taken some time for the full implications of the charges that have been made to sink in. This afternoon I wish to deal with extraordinary favours done for the former Prime Minister Paul Keating by the Commonwealth Bank—`the people's bank'. The favours done by the bank to Keating were massive, secret, crucial to a successful sale of his piggery, absolutely unprecedented, entirely improper, unavailable to any other Australian, against the interests of shareholders in the bank and corrupt.
The Commonwealth Bank's favours to former Prime Minister Keating are by far the greatest scandal in Australian federal history. 
 When Paul Keating began the sale of his piggery in 1994, the government he led was still the majority shareholder in the Commonwealth Bank. As Prime Minister, Keating was in effect the chairman of the board of the bank's dominant shareholder. Every member of the credit committee of the Commonwealth Bank's board at the time had been appointed by a director of the bank appointed by the government of which Keating had either been Treasurer or Prime Minister.
Documents and facts now published lead to one inescapable conclusion: that the CBA did Keating favours which enabled him to sell his interests in his piggery and pocket millions of dollars, even though the piggery remained millions of dollars in debt. The bank, as much as the Indonesians who purchased his piggery, made Keating into a multimillionaire. The bank's favours were also designed to hide forever the deals which made a fortune for Keating.
Apart from what was a remarkably soft treatment of an out-of-order piggery account, as well as failure to insist on a guarantee from Keating, here are some of the extraordinary facts which have now emerged. Having found a potential Indonesian purchaser for his half share, Keating faced the problem that the piggery was greatly burdened with debt. In short, he faced the age-old problem that it is hard to get a good price for a business if it is overburdened with debt. And overburdened the piggery was. I seek leave to table a 1995 report by KPMG, which in paragraph 7 declared that, contrary to Keating's claim that the piggery was a first rate asset, the Euphron group of companies could only continue to trade with the support of the group's shareholders and banks.
—We are refusing leave at this stage because I am taking advice, but we may be prepared to give you leave later.
Leave not granted.
—That is very interesting and we will come onto that later. I am sure that the opposition would not want to cover up for the former Prime Minister, but I take Senator Denman's undertaking at face value because she is indeed a very honourable senator. 
However, the bank did come to the rescue. It enabled the sale process with the first great favour. The bank wrote off nearly $5 million of the piggery's debt. 60 Minutes recently reported that the Commonwealth Bank made provision to write off $4.5 million of the piggery's debts. This provisioning occurred in August 1992. As banking specialist John McLennan noted on the 60 Minutes program, `When it got to that point, or even beforehand, the bank would have pursued every form of additional security to prop itself up that it could. So to turn a blind eye to the potential rich source of security from Mr Keating, in my opinion, is a very unusual situation.' I now seek leave to table a bank document which shows that in May 1994 the Commonwealth Bank indeed did write off $4.9 million of piggery group debt.
Leave not granted.
—Isn't this interesting? $4.9 million of debt—here is the proof—and we are waiting for leave to table the document. We want the facts out, and the document is there. A fascinating feature of this document which I am not allowed to table at the moment is that the write-off is recorded by hand on what is otherwise a word processed document. This suggests that knowledge of the write-off was intended to be kept secret by only those with a need to know. The effect of the write-off was, of course, to improve the financial position of the piggery by almost $5 million.
—How much?
—$5 million, Senator Calvert. Because a write-off is a write-off, banks have rules and procedures governing such matters. Fundamentally, banks only write off debts when they have exhausted all avenues by which they could ever recover those debts. In this case, however, the bank wrote off the debt without any recourse to its security. No effort was made to recover anything from the multimillion dollar purchase price paid by the Indonesians.
Generally, it would be expected that write-offs of this amount would go to the credit committee of the bank's board. In this particular case, where the write-off was enormously beneficial to the Prime Minister of the 
 government of the day—the bank's dominant shareholder—there is not the slightest doubt that it should have been referred not just to the credit committee but to the bank's full board. Equally, there is not the slightest doubt that it was not referred to the bank's full board because exposure to the full and proper processes would have doomed it, assuming that its relevance to Keating's sale had been properly acknowledged. It is, however, unimaginable that the write-off would not have been cleared at the highest levels of the bank.
Write-offs are normally the end point of a process of recovering when all avenues, including all legal avenues, have  been exhausted. Write-offs are not normally in the gift of banks to make special customers rich or to curry favour with major shareholders. Not normally, that is. This extraordinary write-off was a favour, a gift, a present, to the Prime Minister worth millions of dollars—indeed, almost $5 million.
The Commonwealth Bank's second great favour or gift or present to Paul Keating was equally extraordinary. Keating and his partner wanted to maximise their take-out of the final settlement of the sale of their shares and Keating's option to the Indonesians. So at final settlement over the Anzac weekend in 1996, the bank came to the party again—this time with a gift worth about $4 million which enabled a successful sale. The gift was in the form of a six-year no-interest loan which the bank extended to the Indonesian purchasers at final settlement.
—How do you get those loans?
—I would like to know too, Senator Calvert. I think Senator Boswell would like to know; he has a few constituents who have got problems with the bank. The loan does not include any balloon payment at the end of the period to recover the forgone interest. On the same night the bank gifted this $4 million, Keating took away over $2 million as his final settlement—all this only weeks after he lost the prime ministership. Think about it hard. The ramifications of this are extraordinary and, one has to believe, entirely unprecedented.
Somehow Keating gets his bank to sweeten his sale by giving his purchaser six years of no interest on an old Keating debt. Could anyone else in Australia have gotten such a good six-year no-interest loan? Bankers say they have never heard of anything like this. I invite any other Australian—anyone—who has been able to get such a good deal from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to come forward and tell us how. For the rest of us, out-of-order loans attract penalties and no gifts, certainly no gifts of interest-free loans.
For the thousands of Australians who have been sold up by the Commonwealth Bank, the bank's treatment of Keating must rank as one of the sickest jokes imaginable. I must say that it is almost necessary to suspend disbelief that these things could happen in Australia, but happen they did. Together, the first and second great bank favours were a gift to Keating's piggery worth $9 million. Recently, 60 Minutes posed the question of whether the bank and Keating conspired to blackmail Mr Al Constantinidis to buy his silence about the piggery deals.
—You've got to be joking.
—I am not joking, Senator Bolkus, and that is the shame of it. This is not a joke.
—This is recycled hash.
—It established that the bank settled its $11-plus million action against Constantinidis—
—This is recycled rubbish.
—Well, if you want me to bring something forward which is new—
—This is recycled rubbish and you know it.
—Order! Senator O'Chee, it would be useful if you ignored the interjections and addressed your remarks through the chair.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I accept your ruling. If Senator Bolkus wants me to bring forward something which is entirely new, then the Labor Party should give me leave to table the documents that they do not want me to table. They will 
 give me leave to table the documents that prove that the Commonwealth Bank wrote off $4.9 million. But they don't want me to do it because they are gutless and they want to cover up for Mr Keating. That is the fact. They say, `Come up with something new.' You come up with something new and they say, `We're not going to let you table it.' What an extraordinary performance! What an extraordinary bunch of people on the other side! They are as extraordinary as this deal, but let me continue with the facts about this deal. A number of important questions arise out of these allegations.
—Lump of swine.
—Withdraw it.
—Order! Senator Bolkus, I suggest that you withdraw that.
—I withdraw but—
—Thank you. No, there is nothing else.
—Hold on, I raise a point of order.
—What is your point of order?
—The point of order is that Senator O'Chee has spent the last 13 minutes or so trying to destroy the reputation of a person by recycling hash that we saw on television a few weeks ago. The fact that he is prepared to get in the gutter in this respect ought to be brought to the attention of the Senate.
—Order! There is no point of order. The standing orders do not provide for the protection of former members. As citizens of this country know, they have rights under the standing orders and provisions of the parliament and those people, including former members, have the right to exercise those rights at some point in time.
Senator Abetz interjecting—
—Order! Senator Abetz, I am not asking for a comment from you. Continue, Senator O'Chee. 
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think your ruling is very perspicacious, because Senator Bolkus is trying to protect Mr Keating. But what is unarguable is the proposition that it was of great benefit to Keating for the bank to write off its claims for $11 million from Constantinidis. By settling for half a million dollars, the bank's action induced Constantinidis to agree not to pursue his legal action against Paul Keating. It also induced Constantinidis to agree to an extraordinary and onerous confidentiality clause in his agreement with the bank, the purpose of which was to cover up all details of the piggery and its dealings with the bank. I say `extraordinary' because the Commonwealth Bank made the write-off of Al Constantinidis's personal debts conditional on his silence on matters to do with the piggery and Paul Keating.
Together, the Commonwealth Bank's $5 million write-off, the $4 million no-interest loan and the $11 million cover-up short-changed Australian taxpayers and bank shareholders to the tune of $20 million—all of which benefited Paul Keating. That is a $20 million benefit which, as I said at the outset, was massive, secret and crucial to a successful sale of this piggery. It was absolutely unprecedented, it was entirely improper, it was unavailable to any other Australian, it was against the interests of shareholders in the bank and it was corrupt.
I intend to provide these observations together with the new documents, once they have been tabled, to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice for consideration of the need to hold an urgent inquiry in relation to these matters and this financial impropriety.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-04-21,"—Yesterday Senator Mackay asked me a question about Tasmanian health services and their funding, and I undertook to approach the minister to see whether there is any supplementary answer to provide. I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
SENATOR MACKAY—You may be aware that the Tasmanian government has in fact given up and was forced to sign in relation to the broken promises made by this government. In the light of this further broken commitment to the Tasmanian community, can the minister confirm that the initial offer made to the Rundle Liberal government was a pre-state election bribe? Can the Minister confirm 
 that the Prime Minister never formally withdrew the first offer that he made? Isn't this just another example of this government's complete disregard to honouring promises made to the people of Tasmania?
The Tasmanian Premier, the Hon Jim Bacon MHA, wrote to the Prime Minister on 1 April 1999 agreeing to sign an Australian Health Care Agreement on the basis of the Commonwealth's offer of 5 August 1998 the same basis as those jurisdictions that entered into Agreements in August last year.
An Agreement has not yet been signed, and reports that it has been signed are incorrect.
Commonwealth and State officials are presently finalising several minor details, and I understand it is expected the Agreement will be signed some time over the next few weeks.
The Agreement will provide significant increased funding for Tasmania.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-04-21,"—This is indeed a matter of public importance. It is far wider than the booklet which is the subject of this motion, because it strikes right at the heart of consumer rights in Australia at a time when, right round the world, consumers of all sorts of products are wanting to know more about the nature of those products and in particular about such things as their social and environmental acceptability. Indeed, President Kennedy in the United States spoke very strongly during his presidency, way back in the early 1960s, of the consumer's right to know, and this was one of the first matters taken up by the United Nations in debating the right of consumers to be informed.
Ralph Nader, the great consumer advocate from the United States, stated when in this country that information is the currency of democracy. So what has happened to that currency in this case? Alan Gray and Anne 
 Hall, who are associated with the small Earth Garden magazine—which informs consumers right around Australia and other people about organic gardening and environmentally friendly ways to spend money and to develop your house and your farm and so on—got together and produced a labour of love, this little booklet, which I have given to all senators, called Forest-Friendly Building Timbers. It is a very simple guide for those people who wish to be able to use wood but not at the expense of the wild forests and the wildlife which are part of Australia's heritage. On the back of the book it says:
Australia's native forests can't go on providing our building timbers without the threat of massive extinctions. The good news is that there are simple, attractive, ecologically-sound timber alternatives to native forests. This book shows you how and where to buy plantation-grown timber products, or superb recycled timbers, and how to feel good about your renovation, new home, or timber project.
You don't need to make your home a museum of rare timbers.
Australian companies have the products and the knowledge to make your home forest-friendly.
This book has said to the consumer, `Reject timber coming out of our wild forests,' in East Gippsland, in New South Wales, in the great forests of south-west Western Australia and in the world heritage value forests which are unprotected and the rainforests of Tasmania.
Most Australians would want to have this if they were buying timbers, because all the opinion polls show that most Australians are strongly opposed to the logging industry as it eats into these native forests and destroys the habitat of many endangered species and, indeed, many components of the wildlife that Australians know and love. I need go no further than to say that time and again in the Regional Forest Agreement assessments of the wellbeing of many important species logging was cited as the threat which put such species as the world's largest freshwater crayfish, Astacopsis gouldi, from Tasmania on the endangered list because it is helping drive that species towards extinction, both through the destruction of the food source habitat and through the logging roads reaching into 
 previously safe havens for this magnificent creature.
So there it is—a booklet to allow people who do not want to be part of that process but who want to use timber to get it from the alternative, which is the plantation resource industry in Australia. By the way, that industry employs more people than the native forest logging industry in this country. As the jobs fall off in the native forest logging industry, although they are cutting down more wild forests, the plantation industry is the downstream processor which is the job creator of the future in this country.
NAFI, the National Association of Forest Industries, representing the big woodchip corporations, moved in. It threatened legal action; it threatened an injunction. It said that if the book was not taken off the shelves, including the shelves of BBC Hardware—a giant retail outlet in Australia which has taken this book to its heart and has taken out three pages of advertisements in the booklet as its endorsement of the thrust of it—it would take legal action. In the event, NAFI has done nothing of the sort. But what we have is a controversy, not about the book itself in the main but about the right of Australians to be freely informed. What we have from the loggers' representatives, including a reprehensible attack on this book by the now moving on NAFI head, Dr Robert Bain, is an effort to stop the information in this booklet going to consumers because the loggers want a woodchip forest; they want to make money out of our wild forests. They are leaning on—by inference if not by as yet undiscovered direct measures—BBC Hardware and potential other outlets, including the Wilderness Society, whose shops around this country still stock this book where, due to their courage, it is selling like hot cakes.
What the National Association of Forest Industries and Robert Bain in his reprehensible campaign tried to do was say, `This book lies.' He has withdrawn that statement. He said it earlier, but he does not say it any more. I suggest he does not say it because he knows himself that he will be under threat of legal action if he continues that. So he goes on to say that it is misleading and such and 
 such. But when you get down to the points he is making, there is nothing in this book which he says is wrong which he can defend in his argument. It is a matter of opinion being debated here, not a matter of fact, as he says. He has a right to hold the opinions he has. Nobody has taken legal action against that. But the opinion of the authors of this book, and the right of consumers to take that opinion, is under legal attack and threat from the might, wealth and muscle, through threat and coercion, of the logging industry against the interests of the average Australian.
This is not the first time. This is the logging industry that set up the Forest Protection Society and poured millions of dollars into a front group, with the pretence that communities had got together to defend the right to destroy forests around this country. This is the industry which has threatened my colleague Peg Putt in Tasmania with legal action because she made a public statement that it did not like in defence of forests. This is the industry that had a spokesperson who told me that everything I say is put before a bank of QCs—a threat from North, the biggest woodchipper in the Southern Hemisphere, to try to make me frightened to take part in campaigning. This is the industry that time and again threatens legal action, slaps on writs, and essentially tries to bludgeon its environmentally driven and environmentally responsible opponents into silence.
It will not work. I believe this action has blown up in the face of NAFI. I do not know whether that is why Robert Bain is moving on to the AMA, but I can say this: the Australian Medical Association should beware. If Robert Bain orchestrates through lawyers an effort to legally, and I believe fraudulently, try to silence opinion opposed to his in the woodchip industry, what are we going to see coming from the AMA under his direction? An effort to ban books on home birth, on euthanasia, on alternative health measures or on acupuncture because the AMA might not like alternative health measures?
This is an important matter. I know that future speakers are going to get up and say that this book does not meet their thinking. My challenge to the other speakers in this 
 chamber who take a different point of view and to NAFI is this: where is your book? The right action to take if you do not like this book is to bring out your own. It is not to try, through false, coercive and totally unwarranted legal bludgeoning, to deprive Australians of their right to know and to have a valid opinion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Forest-Friendly Building Timbers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-04-21,"—Free speech is a treasured part of our freedom as a society. So when there is a matter about freedom of speech, I take some great interest. As with any other right within our community, there is a countervailing obligation—that is, if you want to exercise free speech, you have to tell the truth. So let us consider this matter which talks about censoring free speech. But, first, let me advise that in 1996 I displayed a poster produced by the Forest Protection Society in my Parliament House office. Guess what? A Mr Blakers, a name well known to Senator Brown because a Margaret Blakers in fact works for him, wrote me a letter threatening legal action that if I did not remove the poster they would sue me. Talk about legal bludgeoning! That is a wonderful example of it.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order which goes to the matter of misleading of the Senate. What Senator Abetz is now talking about is an infringement of copyright, which is very much different from freedom of speech, and he knows it.
—That is not a point of order, Senator Brown, as you well know.
—I have made my point.
—If Senator Brown had allowed me the courtesy of continuing, I was going to say, yes, it was a matter of copyright, and I therefore made the offer to appropriately note on the poster that the photograph was taken by Mr Blakers. But of course that was not good enough. Why? Because the poster was such a devastating revelation of the untruths being told by the Wilderness Society that they wanted only one thing and that was the removal of the poster. Anything I offered to do to remedy the alleged breach 
 of copyright was not good enough and therefore the poster had to come down.
Senator Brown now has the expression on his face of the dog that hit the electric fence. Senator Brown, the people around you have been engaging in legal bludgeoning in exactly the same way that you are accusing the National Association of Forest Industries of doing. But let us deal with this book. On the very back cover it says:
This book is published with the support of the Wilderness Society and BBC Hardware.
We were told by Senator Brown that this book had been taken into the heart of BBC Hardware. Let us listen to what BBC Hardware has to say. A BBC Hardware spokesperson on 8 April 1999 said that the company had not authorised use of its name in the publication by the Wilderness Society. A complete untruth—completely deceptive, dishonest. It is a cruel hoax on the consumer, whom Senator Brown alleges he is somehow defending. In fact, it is unconscionable conduct by those who produced this book.
We then have, also in relation to this book, the assertion that a major sawmiller had broken ranks with the National Association of Forest Industries. They quoted one Mr Kim Booth, the former failed Green candidate in the last state elections. And guess why he is against native forest harvesting. He tells us that he is the largest distributor of Oregon timber in Tasmania. He imports timbers from across the world to sell in Tasmania. Of course he does not want our local forest products to be used. He wants to use those nasty imports, Senator Brown, that you continually rail against. When it comes to importing timbers or using Australian timbers, I stand on the side of Australian timber. It has also been alleged in this book that our forests are disappearing. The foreword says:
As Australia's native forests continue to disappear at an alarming rate . . .
What are the facts? According to ABARE, Australia's forest cover has been growing since around 1980. For the last decade Australia's forest cover has been growing and that has been scientifically shown by ABARE, an independent organisation. But when you are running an extreme green campaign you 
 never let the truth or the facts get in the way of a good story. Unfortunately for the Wilderness Society, on this occasion truth has come out and as a result a lot of people are now saying that they will not be associated with this booklet. Another example from the booklet is in the acknowledgments that appear on the front page. It says:
The following companies have also generously assisted with time and information:
Guess what the acknowledgments before that include. Margaret Blakers, a name I have mentioned before—an adviser to Senator Brown—and Senator Bob Brown himself. Undoubtedly he did assist with the untruths that are contained in this document. There are a number of companies such as French Pine from Tasmania which are deliberately listed in the acknowledgments. But what does French Pine from our home state of Tasmania have to say about this? Kevin French, managing director, said on 14 April 1999:
I wish to advise that at no time leading up to the publication of the above did myself or any other company personnel have any contact with the authors of this publication. We have not and definitely would not give support for a booklet of this nature.
And yet they quote French Pine as supporting these outrageous allegations in this document. Senator Brown has had the audacity to come in here and claim that he is somehow championing the cause of the consumer. He has championed the causes of misinformation, deceptive advertising and the misleading of consumers. He is guilty of conduct unbecoming of a senator.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Forest-Friendly Building Timbers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-21,"—We have had seven minutes from Senator Abetz. We heard a constant tirade of abuse at Senator Brown and everybody else involved on the Green side of the debate. The one thing we did not hear was the defence of NAFI. Why not? Because their action was indefensible. In this debate on a matter of public importance we are talking about an issue which should be and is critical to debate in Australia. We are discussing another attack—not an unprecedented one but another attack—by this particular industry group and by Dr Bain in a debate which is of particular concern to Australians.
They have attacked this industry group, this company and this book because NAFI did not like what its opponents were saying in the debate. They did so because they had the financial resources to do so. They are the two unavoidable facts in this debate. This is not the first time. Senator Brown has mentioned other occasions on which people have been threatened with legal action. In 1991 I, as Minister for Administrative Services, wanted to restrain the use of old forest timber in government constructions and I also wanted to restrain the import of rainforest timber. I was met with a similar sort of reaction from NAFI and Dr Bain. I got a letter from a solicitor threatening me with defamation proceedings. This is the way this person has conducted public affairs when it comes to this issue. In this instance Dr Bain has gone over the top and I think he has embarrassed industry because of it.
What actually was said that led to this reaction from Dr Bain? What were the actual comments in the booklet that caused such a reaction? There were five objections to comments in the book that were raised by NAFI's solicitor. One was a satirical comment by Mr Marr, who wrote:
Are you the sort of customer who strides through the doors of your local hardware store and demands, `Give me a 15-metre beam . . . and make sure it's covered with the blood of at least one endangered species'?
It was not a critical comment that was made in any other sense but the satire. NAFI then takes exception to the assertion that:
. . . half our forests have disappeared. Australia has the worst record for plant and mammal species extinction in the world.
Whether it is right or wrong, that was sourced to a document published by the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales in 1991. Does NAFI want to go back to that source and tell them that they should withdraw as well? The third comment, on page 10, was:
Less than 18 per cent of the average timber logging of an old-growth coupe in East Gippsland ends up in the sawmill.
Where was that from? It was misreported, but it was from the Statement of Uses, Resources and Values  put out by the Victorian state 
 government in 1993. Let Dr Bain threaten Jeff Kennett as well.
These are comments that are part of a normal political debate. As I said earlier, the action of NAFI was not just undemocratic but an abuse of power. We have here an industry organisation that is prepared to spend a lot of money to advocate its cause, but it was also prepared to spend more money to try to stop its opponents.
Whatever you think of the arguments in this debate, I think all of us would reckon that particularly community organisations should not be under this sort of threat when they involve themselves in this debate. What is at the core here? I think the proprietor of Timber Wholesale and Timber World, Kim Booth, put it properly when he said:
They've got no right to dictate to the public what they want to read.
That is the essence of the debate here and that is the point that Senator Abetz could not address and could not rebut. We are talking in this area of a long and ongoing debate in Australian politics. But it is not just that issue of logging; it is also that fundamental issue of consumer information that Senator Brown referred to earlier on.
This is not just the issue of democracy; it also reflects what I think is wrong with political debate on logging. What we should be getting here is encouragement of a relationship between industry and those in the community who are concerned about some logging practices and who are concerned about environmental and ecological outcomes. There needs to be more of this cooperative relationship between industry and retailers in a way that helps inform consumers. That is exactly what is going on across the world. Eco-labelling, consumer information and those sorts of initiatives are running worldwide. NAFI attempts to basically try and derail this particular initiative also poses problems because it does run contrary to what is happening in parts of Europe and North America and in other parts of the world.
As I said, NAFI's action is a dangerous precedent for freedom of speech in this country. It is an attack on freedom of speech and it is one that I am pleased to see there 
 has been a broad community reaction to. In response to those comments in the booklet, NAFI lawyers wrote to BBC Hardware saying that the booklet contained misleading and deceptive statements, and warned that they would seek a Federal Court injunction if it was not withdrawn.
The Victorian Association of Forest Industries, which claims to have led the reaction, is warning that the timber industry could actively campaign against the national hardware chain. VAFI head Graeme Gooding wrote to BBC, saying:
While you may gain some sales from `green' builders or consumers influenced by the misinformation in this book, you could lose as much in any backlash, if the people you are harming choose to campaign against BBC.
So we have the threat of an active campaign against a national hardware chain—a threat which Mr Gooding says would lead to financial loss.
It is no wonder that even Professor Alan Fels of the ACCC is investigating whether NAFI breached the Trade Practices Act in demanding that the BBC Hardware chain withdraw the book from sale or face legal action. I have not agreed with Professor Fels for quite some time, but I think his comments last week, when he dismissed NAFI's claim that the book contained deceptive and misleading comments, were pretty well to the point. He said it was pretty clear, as far as he could see, that the statements in the book were not actionable. He also said that any action to stop sales of the book based on alleged TPA practices would get a `frosty reception' in the Federal Court. I will tell you where else it would get a frosty reaction: it would get a very frosty reaction in the High Court as well. The High Court, over recent years, has entrenched in our constitutional structure freedom of political debate.
The law is one thing, but I am really concerned with the fundamentals of this debate. There has been an overreaction which does threaten free speech. The reaction of civil libertarians was to be expected, but the reaction of a broad spectrum of people is something that this Senate should note as well. NAFI's threats in this particular instance 
 got a reaction from Terry Lane, for instance, in the Sunday Age. He, I think quite pertinently, says:
If the Trade Practices Act is used to stop evangelical greenies preaching their creed and fishing for converts, then it will be used against those who argue the ethical and environmental cases against eggs from battery chooks, pork from battery pigs, freeways through the forests, the eating of meat or the smoking of cigarettes.
The point he makes is that it will become illegal to advocate whatever your cause might be. If it is not illegal, then it will become a lot more difficult.
We should not underestimate the importance of financial resources in these sorts of battles. On the one hand, you consistently have—not just in this industry but across the spectrum—industries with resources to pursue their cases in court and elsewhere, and through lobbying exercises. On the other hand—I will not say more often than not, but I think universally—you have community organisations and individuals who are prepared to stand up and fight for environmental and community based concerns. What we do have here is an abuse of power, stifling democratic debate. As I said, it is based on this use of resources to bring about the outcome.
We have had some interesting developments in this debate over the last couple of days. Again, it is worth noting that the National Party of Western Australia has taken a position which is quite different from the National Party in the federal parliament. Only yesterday, when the State Director of the Western Australian National Party, Jamie Kronborg, launched this particular book, Forest-Friendly Building Timbers, in the state of Western Australia, he said, `We're supporting sustainable forest management.' I think that is an act on his part that signals to the Australian government and to NAFI that maybe they need to pause in this particular debate and to take into consideration a broader spectrum of issues.
As I said earlier on, I think Bain's reaction was over the top. It does damage to his cause but, unfortunately for him and the industry, it does damage to the timber industry as well. We have had one speaker from the govern 
 ment, Senator Abetz. Probably more than anything that Senator Brown or I could say in defence of the booklet, Senator Abetz said it by not uttering a word in defence of the National Association of Forest Industries.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Forest-Friendly Building Timbers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-21,"—In the brief time I have available, I would like to indicate the support of the Australian Democrats for this matter of public importance. It is an important matter in the specific context of this attempt by the National Association of Forest Industries to censor free speech, to try to intimidate competitors and to try to ensure that information about encouraging the community to move away from native timbers does not get out into the broader community. The broader issue is one of intimidating anybody that tries to put forward an alternative point of view that might threaten the commercial position of a large commercial operator.
The broader position relates to a specific piece of legislation which this Senate will debate when the government gets round to bringing it on for debate—the Regional Forest Agreement legislation. This sort of action is a perfect example of the reason why we as a parliament at Commonwealth level representing the Australian community nationally cannot afford to sign away our legal rights for over 20 years to monitor the activities of forest industries. This sort of action shows the lengths to which the National Association of Forest Industries will go to try to protect their commercial interests. Yet here we are as a parliament being asked to remove legal protections for our native forests and to put them in the hands of organisations such as the National Association of Forest Industries.
It shows the sort of undue and excessive influence which can be brought to bear by large operators such as this one simply using legal processes to intimidate people who are trying to put an alternative point of view and get the facts out into the community. In this case they would seem on the surface to be fairly benign suggestions—encouraging people to increase their understanding of alternatives for utilisation of timber in building, renovation and design. And even in a 
 case such as that we have the legal sledgehammer being brought down.
I suppose one of the positive things out of the action of the Association of Forest Industries is that the publicity has in many ways probably led to greater sales for the book that may otherwise have been the case. As often happens with attempts to censor what people say, the resultant attention actually raises people's awareness to what is being put forward than would otherwise have been the case.
We can see another example of that with the recent uproar amongst a small number of people about the film Lolita, which has led to it getting substantially larger numbers of people going to see it than would otherwise have been the case. I am not sure of the building links between Lolita and the native forests timber industry, but the issue of censorship is an important one.
I hope the Association of Forest Industries does rethink its stance on this particular issue. Certainly, from the Democrats' perspective at both federal and state levels, any attempt by large industry organisations to try to stifle alternative viewpoints must be opposed. I know my colleague in the Western Australian upper house, Norm Kelly, has spoken out equally strongly about the actions of NAFI in this regard—with the Western Australian parliament and the Western Australian community more broadly being embroiled in the current debate over the regional forest agreements and the current threat to Western Australia's forests, which even the WA National Party have finally recognised are very much under threat. I do hope this federal parliament does not aid in the destruction of those forests.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Forest-Friendly Building Timbers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1999-04-21,"—The arguments between NAFI and the book's publisher are basically—apart from the courts—a matter for the ACCC. What we are really talking about are misleading statements contained in this document entitled Forest-Friendly Building Timbers . I support the industry's stance on this matter because it is just wrong to have statements such as:
Australia's native forests can't go on providing our building timbers without the threat of massive extinctions.
This is just incorrect. That was on the back cover of the document. The facts are as the 1990 government study into ecologically sustainable development chaired by the Director of CSIRO's Institute of Natural Resources and Environment found:
There have been no known extinctions of Australian native fauna and flora species as a result of timber harvesting over a period of more than 100 years.
Another misleading statement is contained on page 10 when it says that less than 18 per cent of native timber logging in East Gippsland ends up in sawmills. The fact is that it is about two-thirds rather than 18 per cent. Again, there is misleading information in the document. A third example of misleading information is on page 11 of this document where it says, `It is a myth that Australia's native forests are managed sustainably.'
—Absolutely true.
—It is absolutely misleading, Senator Brown. I quote the Resources Assessment Commission, which you are well aware of and which the Hawke government brought in to look at this question of whether forests should be conserved or managed on a sustained yield basis. That RAC report released in March 1992 found:
The Inquiry is satisfied that currently the agencies have in place sustained yield management strategies for wood production.
It supported the continuation of harvesting of native forests. This document has misleading information in it, there is no question about it.
In the last few minutes that I have available to me, I would like to put on the record for the Senate and the community that the Howard government supports the use of sustainable forest resources through the promotion of the plantation industry and through the conservation of our native forests by a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system and by ensuring that commercial management and use of the forests outside the formal reserve system are managed in an ecologically sustainable way. With regard to 
 plantations, the Howard government has been active in promoting plantation forestry. It has thrown its weight behind the Plantations 2020 Vision, which is an initiative of a partnership between the plantation growing and processing industries and all three levels of government in Australia.
This program encourages private plantation investment with the aim of trebling the area of plantations in Australia by the year 2020. This will involve planting, on average, an area of 80,000 hectares a year. Already we have seen the plantation average lifted from 20,000 hectares a year in the early 1990s to last year's figure, which I understand was about 50,000 hectares.
Other Commonwealth achievements encouraging plantations include progress on tax treatment of plantations and the removal of controls on exports of unprocessed plantation and timber. A positive example of the use of plantations is the announcement of the plan by Visy Paper to build a $450 million mini kraft pulp mill and paper mill at Tumut in New South Wales.
Senator Brown interjecting—
—Cut it out. We are also encouraging our farmers to become involved through the Farm Forestry Program, through which a $7.8 million program has been provided this financial year from the Natural Heritage Trust. Farm forestry is the incorporation of commercial tree growing into farming systems, and the Farm Forestry Program has helped 190 national and regional projects.
Turning to native forests and the regional forest agreements, these are the agreements which resulted after the Labor government, over 13 years, desecrated the industry by favouring Greens against the forest industry. But in the end the Labor government was forced to reach an agreement with the states and to go through proper scientific process as to what parts of the native vegetation should be set aside in comprehensive and regional reserves, and what parts should be left for sustained yield management of wood and other products.
Whereas the Labor government failed to reach agreements, this government has gone 
 ahead with that process, and regional forest agreements have been set up with the states. Those regional forest agreements seek to establish a sensible balance between providing job and resource security for the industry and achieving a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of forest reserves. Prior to signing those agreements, each forested region was assessed comprehensively for all forest values, including wilderness, old growth, biodiversity, national estate, indigenous, social, economic and world heritage values. That was done comprehensively between the states and the Commonwealth.
The economic and social impacts were taken into account in those that have been completed. The Howard government has provided more than $50 million this financial year for ongoing implementation of the RFA process. Regional forest agreements have been completed for east Gippsland and the central highlands in Victoria and also in my home state of Tasmania. I have been supplied with figures by Environment Australia of the significant areas of forest added to the current reserve system by the RFAs.
In east Gippsland the CAR reserve system covers 514,000 hectares, of which 13,000 are an addition arising out of the recent process. In the central highlands, the CAR reserve system covers 297,000 hectares, with 116,000 hectares having been added. In Tasmania a remarkable 2.7 million hectares is in the CAR reserve system and 396,000 hectares have been added. The Tasmanian RFA included a Commonwealth commitment to provide financial assistance for employment and industry development. Funding for the Tasmanian RFA will total $110 million over three years.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Forest-Friendly Building Timbers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-04-21,"—When it comes to hardware stores, I have to confess that I am a totally frustrated, unqualified, do-it-yourself carpenter. I must admit I have wiled away many hours strolling through my local BBC Hardware store or the Mitre 10 store or Hudsons—these are not unpaid ads, I might say, but they are the stores in my area. I love nothing better than looking at all those wonderful gadgets and planning and thinking about those jobs 
 that I could do at home, such as building the pergola that I have been promising my wife for the last two or three years.
I must say that when I received the booklet that was sent to me by Senator Brown—which has been endorsed, I understand, by BBC Hardware—I was intrigued. It came in an envelope from Senator Brown, and I thought, `We're in the middle of this big debate about regional forest agreements. Here's some more propaganda from Bob Brown—we've got to take this with a grain of salt,' particularly after some of those terribly insulting things that you have said about us in this chamber, Senator Brown.
—Well, they were accurate.
—They were not accurate, and you know they were not. I will come back to that in a minute. So I thought that I should look at the document carefully, but when I opened up the envelope and glanced through the publication I thought, `This could actually be useful. This could be like one of the many brochures that I've collected from hardware stores on how to build a barbecue using only a bag of cement and a trowel and you don't even get your hands dirty, or how to build a bookcase, but done nothing about.' I glanced through it and I thought, `Yes, there is some very useful information in this booklet.' But I was also intrigued. Why had this come from Senator Brown? I looked at it closely. It is a very subtle and, I would suggest, a somewhat deceptive publication because it also pushes a very strong message on behalf of the Wilderness Society that not only should we be moving to greater use of plantation timber—something that I am sure we all support—but that timber from native forests is all bad and we should not have anything more to do with it.
I can therefore understand why Dr Bain—who has long represented the interests of timber companies—and his organisation got a bit upset. But equally I have to say that just as we have extreme reactions on the environmentalist side of this debate, often represented by the views espoused by Senator Brown, we do get extreme reactions from the forest industry side. Unfortunately, on this occasion 
 that is what happened. NAFI—the National Association of Forest Industries—and Dr Bain did overreact. It is not as if they had not seen the sorts of claims that are contained in this book about the native forest industry before. They had heard those accusations for many years, and I agree that some of them are wildly inaccurate. So to take the step, as we understand happened, of putting pressure on the BBC Hardware company to withdraw this publication from its stores was, in my view, a major overreaction. I believe it did the association some damage and it certainly did not assist their cause of trying to promote rational debate and rational sustainable development of the timber industry in this country into the future.
So I do not defend the actions taken by NAFI. I think they could have just let this one slide through to the keeper. As I said, there is some worthwhile information in this booklet which I would suggest the vast majority of people—those who visit those hardware stores, like I do; and I suspect there are many hundreds of thousands of Australians who do—would be interested in reading. I can understand NAFI getting concerned when there is a page in the booklet which is headed, `We do not recommend use of any timbers or products made from native forests. Here is a list of timbers, products and companies to avoid.' And there is a very long list. If you followed that recommendation to the letter, you would never build anything out of timber in your life, because it covers just about every form of timber that is available on the market, other than some plantation species. So I can understand NAFI's reaction.
I also want to put clearly on the record—because we all know this is a very passionate issue—that, when the government gets around to bringing its Regional Forest Agreement legislation on for debate in this parliament, we will get a chance to debate those issues further, and hopefully in a more constructive atmosphere than we have in this debate this afternoon.
As I said, it is a very passionate issue. Extreme views, unfortunately, do exist on both sides of the debate. On one side, the conservation groups believe that there is no 
 other solution than to shut down overnight all operations with respect to logging of native forest timber—putting many thousands of workers out of jobs and affecting many thousands of families and many companies, particularly small sawmilling companies. On the other side of the debate you have the extreme views of those in the timber industry who—and I must say it is a small minority these days—do not want to have any truck at all with any arguments put forward by the conservation movement.
But I have to say this to Senator Brown: in putting forward this matter of public importance today—which we support in principle because we do have a concern about the attempt here to deny free speech, which is an issue that is going to be looked at by the ACCC, as has been acknowledged—it is a pity that you do not follow that other legal maxim which says, `If you are going to complain about conduct, come with clean hands.' There have been actions taken by environmental groups, particularly some associated with groups such as the Wilderness Society, which I would suggest have been just as damning in terms of their attempts to deny free speech and to deny companies the opportunity to carry out their legitimate operations.
One only has to look at the campaign that was conducted both in this country and in the United Kingdom against Tesco with respect to the sale of kangaroo meat to see the damage that can be done to our export industry by totally unfounded, extravagant claims made by some environmental groups. It is a legitimate industry, and Senator Brown's supporters have totally ignored that fact and have set out with some quite untrue claims—
—Do you want to ban their point of view?
—No, I do not want to ban their point of view. But what I object to, the same as you do, are the extravagant, extreme campaigns and claims. The point I am making, Senator Brown, is that if you are going to come into this chamber and complain about what NAFI does, then how about having a look at your own backyard as well?
I will finish on this note. The important thing to remember in this whole debate is that 
 a process was set up by the previous Commonwealth Labor government—and it has been endorsed by the present government and supported by the state governments—to, over the long term, develop and maintain a sustainable timber industry in this country. That is of course outlined in the National Forest Policy Statement, which we are all aware of. A central plank of that is the increasing development of a plantation industry and a move to the use of plantation timbers—but it must be done in harmony with the proper, sustainable use of native forest timber. 	Unfortunately, the environmental lobby do not accept the principle that the native forest timber industry can continue to exist along with a move to greater use of plantation timber. So I say to Senator Brown: whilst I clearly do not accept what NAFI did, and I object strongly to the pious comments made by Senator Abetz and his colleagues, have a look at your own actions.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-04-21,"—Right at the beginning, I want to say that I agree with a lot of what Senator Forshaw said, but I do have a real problem with having before us in this matter of public importance an argument as to whether or not NAFI or anybody else are using their legal rights—a method of censoring—to protect themselves when they believe they have been misrepresented. That is really what this is all about. They believe they were aggrieved. They went through the proper processes of informing the people concerned that they were considering legal action, and now they are being condemned in this place. If this chamber does not uphold the right of people to protect themselves in the law courts and use those mechanisms, something has gone wrong with the place.
—They haven't gone to the courts.
—No, they informed them. Listen to what I have got to say.
—They just used the threat.
—The Senate Regional and Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee went through the resource security hearings very recently in Melbourne. Who turned up there with legal opinions to chal 
 lenge the legality of the legislation on constitutional grounds? It was none other than Senator Brown. So it is fine for him, on the one hand, to put up a legal opinion and use it as a threat against legislation but, on the other hand, to say that NAFI does not have the same right. I find that incomprehensible, I find it inconsistent, I find it unfair and I find it wrong. Furthermore—and here I agree with Senator Forshaw—what is the mechanism that Senator Brown and his supporters use? They go and lie in front of bulldozers. They interfere with the legal rights of people to carry out their lawful business. They cost them money.
—The woodchippers sent in thugs and you know it.
—They interfere with their jobs and they carry on this process of unlawful activity. On the one hand, they come in here and say, `You cannot do this, this is a censoring of free speech,' which I disagree with absolutely and totally. On the other hand, they think they can take the law into their own hands. I sit in the middle of this debate on a proper sustainable development forestry policy—and I have sat there for a long time. I have argued very strongly for proper sustainable development in our forests and at the same time for development of our plantations. If I have got time, I will come to our very proud record in Western Australia on plantations. But his inconsistency in bringing this motion forward and activities elsewhere I think is a blight on Senator Brown.
At our committee hearings in Melbourne for two days there were a number of attempts made by people in the audience, supporters of Senator Brown, including some of his staff, to intimidate witnesses in front of us, to the point that on a couple of occasions I had to call them to order and I had to ask that his staff should at least demonstrate that they know the way to behave. They were endeavouring to intimidate witnesses who were putting a contrary point of view to the point of view that they held.
—Members of that committee were rude to environmentalists and you did nothing to stop it.
—I had to call those people to order.
—You were biased.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, you can let him rabbit on all the time. He is just helping my argument and my position.
—You were biased.
—Order! Senator Brown, I have been fairly tolerant of the level of exchange to date, but you are really getting out of hand. Would you please give Senator Crane a go.
—You can talk about all the bias in the world, the bias on one side and the bias on the other side. I do not think there is really that much difference in the level of bias. What we as legislators have to do is try and get to a balanced position, and that is what the National Forest Policy Statement was all about. That was developed in 1992, when the now opposition was in government, with our support at that particular time. What the RFA process is all about is getting sustainable development in the use of our forests and, alongside that, developing our plantation industries.
I want to deal with the issue of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Professor Fels made some statements last week and was investigating this issue. I have a statement here that has been handed to me which I am prepared to table with the letter. It is from NAFI. It says:
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has not found any breach of the ACCC rules by NAFI in relation to the Forest-Friendly Building Products book. In a letter to NAFI today they have indicated there is no suggestion of any threats or implied threats of exclusionary boycotts by the Association. We have been told that unless anything new comes up there will be no more contact with NAFI.
I just put that on the public record. In my remaining time I want to put some positive things into the debate from this side. I want to relate what has been happening in Western Australia in the development of the softwood and hardwood estates. While I cannot go over all the detail of this, can I just say that from 
 1960 we have seen an increase in the national estate for softwood from practically zero to almost 100,000 hectares today. That demonstrates the developments that are occurring. When we look at what is happening in the hardwood estate, by species, age and class, we find that we have seen an increase from slightly more than zero in 1960 to in the area of 68,000 hectares now, and that is still growing. I understand from my colleague Senator Murphy on the other side that Tasmania can demonstrate the same sorts of figures in the development of the plantation estate.
While this plantation estate has been developed at its present rate, we will find that there will be an even greater increase in the utilisation of timber out of the national estate developed through plantations. This piece of paper I have got in front of me informs us that in Western Australia something like 200,000 hectares have been planted and that there is potential for about another 150,000 that can commercially produce timber, and that is growing year by year. This does not include any areas on private land where there is also an extensive plantation industry being developed. I think the context in which this matter of public importance has been brought before us is very unfortunate. I am looking forward to the day when we can actually debate the forests in a positive manner in this place.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-04-21,"—In relation to this matter, it would indeed be regrettable if the legal processes of this country were being used to censor free speech. There have been many occasions when just such action has taken place. No matter how much that action has been permitted by the law, the intent of the action has been to censor free speech. The Labor Party is not going to support an action which is so designed. The best way to describe NAFI's actions in this matter is as ill-advised and as somewhat of an overreaction to a publication—which has, in effect, given the proponents of the publication the opportunity to get for it some headlines and some promotion that they would not otherwise have received.
If the intention of Dr Bain and NAFI was to stop the promulgation of the information in the publication, they have achieved exactly the opposite. To the extent that there is any censuring of NAFI in this matter, they are probably smarting more from their own misplaced actions than from any proposed censuring that might occur.
As I said, we do agree with free speech. I want to agree with the comments of Senator Crane, particularly arising from the legislation committee hearings into the regional forest agreements legislation. We were subjected to a process in hearings where we had, on the one hand, the proponents of the environment movement saying that we should be using no native forest timbers and that the RFA process was bad—and we heard those people in silence. But when proponents of the sustainable use of native forests under the proposed legislation spoke we heard all sorts of comments. We had someone blowing some form of whistle during the hearings and we had sniggers and attempts to belittle the evidence given by witnesses—which seemed to me to be an attempt to somehow hinder those witnesses' rights to give evidence to the committee and an attempt to belittle the evidence of those witnesses before the committee.
In respect of the matter before us, what has been said, particularly by Senator Forshaw, is true: the environment movement does from time to time engage in actions which are contrary to the spirit of the comments contained in the letter, from Senator Brown to the President, that brings on this debate. Senator Brown moved a motion to congratulate the proponents of the publication, and that was the subject of a vote in this chamber. I do not in any way intend to canvass the vote other than to say that I regarded the third paragraph, paragraph (c) of the motion, as a paragraph which in effect was condemning the use of native forest timbers. I think the term used was `wild forest'.
The Labor Party did propose to the motion of Senator Brown amendments of this calibre, removing that rather one-sided paragraph and replacing it with the following:
(c) notes that the RFA process, initiated by the former Labor Government, promotes an expansion of plantation based timber resources—
One would have thought that one could support that; but no, that could not be supported by Senator Brown—
(d) believes that a balanced approach to forestry, including the promotion of the use of plantation based forestry resources will reduce pressure on our native forests, maximising job opportunities and assist in sustaining our forest industries.
Was that acceptable to Senator Brown? No, it was not acceptable, because there is only one outcome which is acceptable to the Wilderness Society and to Senator Brown, and that is the locking up of our native forests. The Labor Party do not support that. We support a balanced approach to forestry. We support both a plantation based forest industry and a forest industry based on native forests.

It was the government's hope that the committee stage would commence immediately after the vote for the second reading. We are, of course, very pleased that the Senate has supported the second reading of these important bills. We had expectations, particularly having negotiated and had the support of the majority of the Senate to sit during this special and extraordinary fortnight, that this fortnight would be devoted to debating these `a new tax system' bills. We were informed early yesterday afternoon, via the Parliamentary Liaison Office, via the whip of the Democrats, that the Democrats would not be able to commence debate on the committee stage for another week, because their amendments were not ready. We were informed yesterday afternoon—that is Tuesday afternoon—that they would not be able to commence the debate until next Tuesday afternoon. That is one week from yesterday afternoon.
We were flabbergasted. We were disappointed. We thought there was a clear understanding that this week would be made available for the debate of these bills. To be told, less than a day into that debate, that the Democrats would not be available to proceed with this debate for at least a week was an incredible announcement to us. In the time since we were told that news—that we consider extremely bad news—we have sought from the Democrats an undertaking that those amendments would be ready to go to the committee stage perhaps tomorrow or Friday. In fact the Democrats had—
—Perhaps Tuesday, perhaps Wednesday.
—Who would know, Senator Carr?
—That is the point. You know.
—I do not know. I have asked the Democrats when they will be ready. I was given an indication yesterday afternoon that they might be ready on Friday but they could not be sure. Somehow the length of the second reading debate, because in the eyes of the Democrats it had 
 apparently gone fast, had stopped them from being able to do the committee stage on Friday. I am not exactly sure how. In fact, the second reading debate is one of the longest second reading debates in the history of this great parliament. It was longer than the native title debates on all occasions, longer than the second reading debate on workplace relations, longer than the second reading debate on all three tries at the Telstra bills, and it was just about as long as the infamous or famous, important debate that Senator Bolkus would remember on the political advertising and broadcasting bill, at about 14 hours or so. I am sure Senator Bolkus remembers it well.
So it has been an extraordinarily long debate on the second reading. It has not been a quick debate, as some people seem to imply. Indeed, these bills have been before the parliament since December last year, so the Democrats have had four months to prepare their amendments and to have drafting instructions prepared. We would have hoped this delay was not going to take place.
I have moved that debate on the committee stage of this bill not commence now until Friday. This gives the Democrats the rest of today and all of tomorrow to try and get their amendments in order. We would have preferred to have started the debate today. We would have preferred to start it tomorrow. We are not at all happy with the concept of having to wait till Friday. It is fair to say, however, from my own bitter experience, that if you do seek to start a committee stage debate when major players in the debate are not ready with their amendments and there is not a comprehensive running sheet available, then the debate bogs down and time is wasted and the time is not productive.
So I have moved this motion. I have asked the Democrats if they will be ready on Friday, but they cannot give me any assurance. In fact, all indications are that the Democrats will not be ready on Friday. I hope they will feel some obligation to be ready on Friday.
I have also sought from the Democrats—and I have informed the opposition of this very candidly, and I do not expect them to support what I am proposing—since we were working on the assumption that this fortnight 
 would be available for debating the tax bills, their support for extending sitting hours next week to make up for the time the Senate chamber will lose this week to consider these bills in the committee stage. I am still hopeful that the Democrats will see that there is some sort of obligation upon them to agree to that proposition. I have been assured by Senator Lees, and I accept her assurance at face value, that she is not seeking to delay these bills. But I have to say that assurance is undermined somewhat by their performance and behaviour.
Democrats senators interjecting—
—You cannot come to us and say, `Sorry, you can't have extra hours to deal with the committee stage of these bills next week, even though we are costing you something like nine or a dozen hours this week. So if we need it, we will give it to you later, some time down the track.' One could only expect that, with four months to prepare their amendments, their bona fides have to be brought into question. They can resolve the question of their bona fides on this matter if they agree to the proposition that we sit for longer hours to make up the hours that will be lost this week. So, with great reluctance, I have moved this motion which would defer consideration of the committee stage of these bills until Friday 23 April.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-04-21,"—This motion is not supported by the opposition. I think we need to be very clear about what is happening in the chamber right now: the government is preventing consideration of its own GST legislation. In the view of the opposition that is an absolute farce. What a shemozzle we have on our hands now, courtesy of the government. What an absolute disgrace from the government in relation to what they claim is the most important tax legislation in the history of the Commonwealth parliament. I suppose this is what happens—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! There is too much noise in the chamber.
—I suppose, Madam President, this is what happens when you leave such important tax legislation in the hands of people like Senator Alston and Senator Kemp. If the government actually wants to salvage its tax package, it ought to get John Howard back to Canberra now and see if he can run the show.
—That's right! Bring back John!
—And bring back Peter Costello and see if he can run the show. Let us see if the Treasurer and the Prime Minister can try to sought this mess out. The coalition Senate leadership has really let the Prime Minister and the Treasurer down. I have to say that I suspect this whole process has, unfortunately, not been assisted by the fact that Senator Hill has been overseas. When you have an indolent dilettante like Senator Alston running the show, this is what you get.
—Senator Faulkner! That language is not appropriate.
—If it was not appropriate, Madam President, of course I withdraw it. When you have someone like Senator Alston running the show, the government's strategy is bound to cause grief; it is just bound to run off the rails. Not only do we have the penchant of Senator Alston to not even attend the Senate when we have a division, but we also have a situation where Senator Alston has proven during all three question times this week that he just does not have a detailed grasp of policy.
But what has to happen now is that Senator Alston and the remainder of the coalition Senate leadership have to explain to the Prime Minister why they cannot deliver. Why can't the Senate proceed with this legislation now? Why has this legislation been delayed? Basically we have a situation where the Prime Minister, in my view, just adopts the NATO tactic, if you like—bomb the Senate, but don't commit the ground forces to come in here and debate the legislation.
—That is appalling.
—The Prime Minister needs to commit himself to sorting this out. 
 I think we are entitled to an explanation as to why Senator Ian Campbell and others have not explained this situation.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! There are far too many interjections. Senator Faulkner has the call.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! I am trying to listen to Senator Faulkner. Senators not in their own seats shall not interject.
—You had better stop Senator Vanstone, then.
—That is bolshie Mandy doing that, isn't it?
—Order! Your leader is attempting to address the Senate.
—We need to make it clear that the Labor Party has fulfilled its responsibilities in relation to this debate. We have constructively engaged in the committee, we have set out our case and we are ready, willing and able to commence the committee consideration of these bills now. The Labor Party stands ready to debate the detail of the GST right now. Let us look at the process that has led to this Costello induced legislative shambles that we have on our plate.
—Mr Costello.
—Mr Costello shambles. The four committees of inquiry were established on 25 November last year. Labor had proposed one select committee; the government rejected that and went for a four-committee model—three committees chaired by Labor senators and one by a Democrat. To expedite the process, the first committee met as early as 18 December last year. Labor senators properly participated in a very gruelling Senate committee process. On the legislation, the Labor Party has assisted expediting the passage of two of the tax reform bills—A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 1998 —and they, because of the constructive approach of the opposition, were improved with opposition amendment and passed prior to the 1 April start-up date.
We have been constructive. We are ready to deal with the committee stage of these bills and the government are not. I say to the government: join with the Labor Party, because you will get the numbers, and get the committee stage debate on now. The government themselves, in Senator Kemp's speech, circulated 128 amendments of their own to the bill. There is a question of timing here. We are facing a bit of an unreasonable legislative logjam in the Senate at the moment.
What you have to ask is: where has the Treasurer been in all this? Have Senator Ian Campbell and Senator Alston kept the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in the loop? What is the position of the Treasurer in relation to the consideration of these bills that the Treasurer claims are amongst the most important the Commonwealth parliament has ever debated in its history? Mr Howard and Mr Costello have demanded that the Senate get on with the job; they have demanded that we deal with the GST legislation. Apparently now they are saying, `That doesn't matter; we will adjourn these bills, perhaps to Friday, perhaps to next week.' They demanded that we get on with it but now they are willing to adjourn it.
The Senate was recalled for a two-week sitting period to deal with the GST legislation. And that is what we want to do. The government have simply made the decision, `We will avoid the debate. We are not going to stick with the views the Prime Minister has expressed so publicly for so long on this issue.' Remember what the Prime Minister went to the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party and said on 6 November. Let me quote it for you:
. . . we will use every legitimate means at our disposal to implement that tax plan with the minimum of delay . . . we intend to implement the policy that we took to the election with the greatest possible dispatch.
What did he say on the Sunday  program 18 days later? Let me quote him again:
The great fear I have of an inquiry is that it will be used as a device to delay and obstruct and to frustrate the will of the Australian people expressed at the election.
The greatest fear he has must be from people on his own team who are proposing now not 
 to deal. The greatest fear must be his own team—they do not want to go ahead with the debate. What about the Prime Minister trumpeting in the House of Representatives on 18 February this year in answer to a dorothy dix question:
I say again to those in the Senate who are delaying this taxation package, to those who would seek to defeat the verdict of the Australian people: listen.
That is what the Prime Minister said. Why aren't the people on that side of the chamber listening? Why aren't they listening to their own Prime Minister? They are flagrantly disregarding the views of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the views of the Treasurer, Mr Costello. According to your own Prime Minister, he obviously thinks that you are seeking to defeat what he claims is the verdict of the Australian people. We are entitled to ask the question in this chamber at this time: why is that the case? Why are you delaying a measure which the Prime Minister trumpets is so vital to Australia's economic welfare? Why are you, according to your own Prime Minister, delaying consideration of billions of dollars of personal income tax?
I have to say, and I am sure my colleagues know this, Mr Costello has not been quiet on this matter either. Who could forget what he said on the John Laws program on 20 April—yesterday. What about the eye rolling from Mr Costello, the deep sighing theatrics we had on the John Laws program? This is what he said:
The Senate's got a whole week this week . . . 
That is what Mr Costello said.
—No-one told him.
—No-one told Senator Campbell and Senator Alston. Mr Costello said:
It's got a whole week next week . . . 
He went on:
I think we should be trying to aim to get this debate on and the vote as quickly as possible. I don't even know why we have had to wait until now to have the vote.
What about Mr Costello on 1 February this year? He said:
Let's pass tax. Let's move on past reform of indirect tax and income tax and the welfare benefits 
 and we can move on then to business tax and we can move on then to faster growth and more employment.
Well, come on down Peter Costello. We are ready to debate your legislation, but your own government senators in this very chamber have put off the debate, probably until next week.
Mr Costello and Mr Howard have had enough time to do the groundwork for this. They have had months to talk to the Independents and the minor parties so that they can have a few contingency plans and the odd sleazy deal sorted out. Why haven't the Manager of Government Business and the abysmal and abject failure of an Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate told Mr Costello and Mr Howard about this? Why have they embarrassed them so much? Why didn't they tell them the risk was that they would say, `You want us to debate it, Mr Howard and Mr Costello, but, sorry, we are going to move a motion to delay debate'? Why didn't the government in the Senate keep their own leadership in the loop? This is the final humiliation—the government proposing a motion not to debate the committee stage of the GST bills.
Remember the agonising debate in December. Who can forget them organising the extra time for the Senate to sit? I think it was an extra three weeks. The Treasurer and the Democrats spent hours on the shape of the GST committee process. It was agonising. Who could ever forget it? You had so much time involved in that particular exercise so that you could assure everybody that the legislation would be considered by the Senate by 30 June. The bills have been brought back in plenty of time to allow the government to debate them.
The buck and the GST legislation stop with the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello. There was all that hectoring and all that exhorting of the Senate by Mr Costello to get on with the job. John Howard and Peter Costello tonight stand exposed as hypocrites and incompetents. We have heard the Manager of Government Business blame the Democrats. It is the oldest political trick in the book. You move the 
 motion yourself to adjourn the debate and you blame someone else. This is not the Democrats' legislation, it is the government's, and this is the government's motion to adjourn the debate on this legislation.
I want to make it absolutely clear that the Labor Party will join with the government right now to bring on the debate on the GST in the Senate. We are ready to go—bring it on now. Don't anyone listen to all the weaselly, slimy, sleazy sell-out words of Senator Alston and government members in the Senate. If the government wish to proceed with these bills and if the government wish to have the committee stage of debate on these bills, they can. We, the opposition, will give them the numbers for this debate.
The Democrats are being set up as fall guys for the government. I hope on this occasion that the Democrats are smart enough not to be the fall guys for the government's incompetence. Peter Costello is in charge of the legislation. He wanted extra time. We gave him extra time, and now he has squandered it. He has failed to do his job. He and his coalition Senate leadership have failed the Prime Minister.
We do not know when the government plans to bring the committee stage on. At the moment we have a motion before the chair rearranging business so that these matters cannot be brought on until before Friday of this week. We heard, in the speech the Manager of Government Business made, that it might take longer. So we may in fact be aborting consideration of these bills until Tuesday of next week, possibly later for all the opposition know.
What is absolutely clear to all opposition senators in this place—and what I believe will be clear to the Australian public—is that the government has brought this absolute farce upon itself. Bring John Howard back now; even he could not do any worse. Perhaps Mr Costello can play a bit of a role in this. Let us sort out Mr Costello's dog's breakfast—because that is what we are left with. What we say is: bring on the committee stage now. We have had enough of this farce and this nonsense from the government after the Senate and the opposition have been implored 
 for so long to bring this debate not only on but to a conclusion. We are ready, willing and able to debate it now. It should be debated now and the government stands condemned for adjourning it.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-04-21,"—I was going to start by talking about some of the very strange comments Senator Ian Campbell made, but I find that Senator Faulkner has made such an extraordinary contribution that I must start there. I do not think anyone sitting in this place believed a word of it for a moment. But, unfortunately, today—as no doubt Senator Faulkner knows and probably why we had the performance in the first place—we are on broadcast, so for the benefit of those people out there I will reiterate where we are at in this debate. We are some seven hours ahead of where we should have been thanks to the deal that the opposition did with the government.
—What deal?
—Order! Senator Carr, stop shouting.
—Why you are working with them, I do not know, when you have made it so clear that you have no interest in improving this package. You have no interest in supporting amendments that actually improve the GST package. You have made it very clear that you are going to vote down our amendments, the government amendments and presumably any Senator Harradine—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order!
—The Labor Party has made it very clear that they have no interest in these bills. They intend to vote down any constructive amendment in the interests of their own political beliefs, political interests, that the best thing that can happen is that we give the government—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order!
—In the hope that they can force us to vote this down in the short term so that there we have the start of a double dissolution trigger. Their game is political. It 
 has nothing to do with trying to work through what is a very complex package of 27 bills. It is very easy for a party to be ready to debate a committee stage when they have circulated no amendments, when there is nothing prepared. I had understood that you did have amendments. I still have none in front of me. Senator Margetts's amendments are ready. But there is nothing from the Labor Party, so of course they are ready to debate.
—Where are yours?
—That is where I was going to begin, but after the extraordinary contribution from Senator Faulkner I wanted to answer some of those statements first. Let us look at the decision that was made to force us to sit right through Tuesday morning and then through Tuesday night—some seven hours of speeches on the second reading that should have been continuing now through tomorrow and into Friday. We had always intended to circulate our amendments on Friday and we will keep to that deadline. The only possible delay would have been a matter of an hour or two, brought about by the fact that we have one staffer working on the final amendments who is also required up until Friday to work on our committee report to have it tabled on Monday. The other amendments are in draft form, but those final amendments relating to the last committee report are now being drafted.
I say this to Senator Campbell, knowing that you have no cooperation on this side: surely it would be in your own interests not to force the debate through, knowing how few staffing resources we have, in order to put us in a position where, unfortunately, we have to say to you that time simply does not allow us, given the tabling of the report on Monday and with one staffer working on our final amendments, to have them tabled in this place in sufficient time for you, Senator Harradine, Senator Margetts and Senator Brown to consider them. We know what the opposition are going to be doing with them, but all other senators need to consider them so that we can have a debate that does not take forever with amendments that people have had some chance to understand.
 I have to say at this point that, when we discussed with the government and indeed reached an agreement on how we would manage the sitting hours, we started off with 16 bills. We now have so many bills in the package that we have yet another report to write Friday week, particularly dealing with the wine bills—a very important industry that is not at all happy with what the government is doing. There, hopefully, we will see the Labor Party prepared to play a constructive role.
As for the bills we are going to begin dealing with, Labor have not indicated at any stage that they are actually interested in doing anything in the committee besides standing up and making a lot of hot-air speeches. Labor have moved what I take it are their amendments to the second reading. But, even if those pious amendments had passed, they would have achieved nothing. They would not see us with any improvements to this country's tax system.
A final message for Labor: if you do not want to be part of the committee stage, please let us get on with the job of doing the work we have to do in a reasonable time.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Labor senators will cease shouting.
—And to the government I say: you have circulated 128 amendments today, and we also plan to consider those. We go back to the situation with our economics researcher who will again have that job to do.
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—I know it does not bother you, Senator Faulkner, because I understand you are going to vote against them—please correct me if I am wrong. But we need to look through your amendments as well and to deal with those one by one as they merit. My final comment to Senator Campbell is that we are attempting to cooperate, but you are making it extremely difficult by working with the group that have no interest in cooperating.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-04-21,"—I guess what we have seen today is a certain amount of theatre. In the House of Representatives the opposition has put a 
 number of substantive amendments to the tax package. I understand that they included a number of amendments in relation to transparency in pricing, on which our office have been talking about Labor advisers. That means whether or not people, when they are looking at the package or at the changes that have occurred as this policy changes, will be able to find out just what is the actual increase in the goods and services that they are purchasing.
We are left in a position now where we still have not seen any amendments in relation to such things as transparency in pricing. I do not know, and I have not heard in anything Senator Faulkner has said, whether or not we will see from the Labor Party anything akin to the amendments that Labor moved in the House of Representatives. This means that there is some confusion. I guess we may ourselves have to draft amendments which we thought or assumed may have been moved by the ALP.
The fact that this extra week was negotiated to give extra time for the ANTS package of bills to get through does not mean to say we will not get time to debate other bills. But the reality is we still have not seen from the government the total program they want to get through before the end of June. We have not seen from the opposition any interest in having a meeting to discuss the matter so that we know what the total program is that the government want to get through before the end of June.
The reality is that if we go on with other bills we are still progressing the government's program—we have not lost time in the Senate if we go on with other bills. It is a nonsense for either side to suggest that if we go on with other bills that somehow or other we are not making progress in the program. We would like to see what the program is. What is it that the government want to get through by the end of June? It would be nice to understand what it is, the time allocated and how important the government see various bills, including the tax package.
The reality is that this is a very complex package of bills, but unfortunately we have seen great emphasis on only the economic 
 aspects of these bills. I call it the 40-minute club—the members of the Senate select committee who consider that the issues of the dollar economics are the real issues. Unfortunately that comes both from the opposition and the government—we have heard today that the opposition wanted the Senate select committee to look at only those aspects of the tax package. The Greens and many people in the community have said that the social issues—the issues of education, community groups and the arts, and the incredibly negative impact on the environment this tax package will force on Australia—ought to be given at least equal consideration with the things that are visible in terms of dollars.
Unfortunately, the approach that has been taken here, with the opposition saying they are not going to participate in widening that debate, is going to potentially let the government off the hook on the wider social, economic and environmental issues and the issues to do with community. I am not entirely sure what the opposition's agenda is that they want to deal with it now, when their amendments—if there are any—on transparency and other issues have not been circulated. Are they never going to move the same amendments they moved in the House of Representatives?
We have heard that there are 128 amendments from the government. I do think it reasonable that we get a chance to look at those. For proper committee process we ought to make sure that those people who are playing important roles in this debate have a chance to deal with this properly. Forcing a debate on any Senate when there are still uncirculated amendments—incomplete amendments for very good reasons—is stupidity. I have always said that it does not progress the debate at all.
What we have seen here is theatre. We will not lose total time in this session if we go on with other bills. We will, however, still be left in the dark about what the government want to get through in this program. I suggest it would be in everybody's interest if at some stage in the next few days we have an agreement from all parties to have some kind of leaders' and whips' meeting so the govern 
 ment can put on the table what it is they want to get through by the end of June—so that we do not continually have these farces and theatre in the Senate. If we know what we are being asked to deal with we can make consideration of the debating program and, when we do get to deal with the important committee stage, we can do it in a state of proper preparation.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-04-21,"—From this debate the first thing we can learn is that the sooner the war correspondent from Tirana returns to sort out the Democrats the better. The assertion from Senator Lees that because we are not moving a raft of amendments we have no contribution to make to the committee stage is an absolute nonsense. We will be looking at these bills clause by clause—in some cases raising questions or making points about it. So we will be making a contribution and we are ready to make that contribution now.
—We did that with native title in 1993. It's a great tactic.
—That is right—absolutely. Senator Campbell has acknowledged that this is one of the legitimate tactics of the chamber, depending on your attitude to the totality of the bills. Senator Lees said we have done some sleazy deal with the government. I will tell you the deal we did with the government about speaking hours. It was very simple. We are here Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Because we are all here on Tuesday morning and our relative party meetings are not meeting, the coalition said, `Why don't we sit then and use the time?' We said,`Yes, why not?' We will all be sitting around waiting for 2 o'clock to start, so why not absorb the three hours? Is it a sleazy deal to agree with the government on that? And then they said, `Look. We'd like to move the second readers along. As they are a matter of no division and no quorum, why don't we sit on Tuesday night and get another two or three hours?' We said, `Fair enough.' And there are plenty of examples where we have done this in the past, no matter what side of the chamber we have been sitting on. It is not a sleazy deal to move the debate along, and that is exactly what we did. So, in 
 terms of the two major points Senator Lees directed at the Labor Party:  firstly, we did not do any sleazy deal over time and, secondly, we do have a rigorous contribution to make in the committee stages of these bills, and we are looking forward to doing so.
What position is the government in at the moment? It has moved that the debate be adjourned, and we know the reality is that it is really adjourning the debate until Tuesday morning. A motion may say Friday but everyone knows that it is still  until Tuesday. The government says it is doing it in response because not all elements of the chamber are ready, but a good manager of government business would have found this out much earlier than Senator Campbell did. The political position we are facing is that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are running around the talkback circuit playing the second oldest card in the book—blame the Senate. The oldest card in the book is the state premiers running around blaming whichever federal government is in power. That is the oldest card. But the second oldest is for executive government to blame the Senate.
It was only yesterday that Mr Costello, that `Sydneycentric' minister, appeared on the John Laws program and demanded that the debate proceed this week and next week and be finalised by the end of next week. Doesn't Mr Costello talk to his Manager of Government Business in the Senate? Silly question—why would he?
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—You're not actually in that portfolio area. Madam President, I think he was removed from that portfolio area after the last election. But we could at least expect Mr Costello to liaise with the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Alston. Surely they can get together in Sydney and have a conversation about the program as it is going to be into the future. Why couldn't they have got together?
This is the dichotomy that we are most worried about: Mr Howard and Mr Costello running around the country demanding that the Senate get on with the job, and Senator Campbell and Senator Alston basically saying, 
 `No, we will defer the debate until the following Tuesday.' You cannot have it both ways as a coalition. Why not bring it on for debate now? We are ready. You say you are ready, although we do not know. It may well be you are using the Democrats as the fall guys. Maybe you don't want to bring the debate on. Maybe you are still negotiating some other deals that none of us yet know about and you haven't consummated them yet. Maybe it is another Telstra bill. Remember how urgent the Telstra bill was—how urgent it was that we get to the second reading? That was weeks ago and it has not been brought back on. Why? Senator Alston has not been able to round up the usual suspects and do the usual deals which get sold out down the track. Maybe the same thing is happening with this matter.
One thing Senator Margetts said was interesting. She wants to know where the forward program is. Don't we all? No-one knows what is on the agenda, no-one knows what the government ask is. A broad ambit claim is thrown out there. The manager should be able to say exactly what he wants to get through by 30 June or whether he intends to sit the Senate through into the first few weeks in July. We should at least know that at this stage. He is not being obtuse here, Senator Margetts. He does not know. He has not got a clue.
—How do you know?
—We know, otherwise he would come out and say so.
Senator Alston interjecting—
—Senator Alston says he is being deceptive! He is being not transparent! That is what Senator Alston is saying about his colleague. Senator Alston—always interjecting out of his seat. That is exactly what he is saying. That is very helpful; thank you, Senator Alston.
But we do not know what the forward program is, which in many ways means that we have got no idea how much time we should allocate for the committee stage of these bills. If we knew what the eventual ask was, we could actually work our way back and know what was a reasonable time to take 
 in the committee stage of these bills. But we do not know. We have got no idea whatsoever.
—Then they will blame us for not being ready for the next bill.
—Of course they will blame us. As I said, Senator Margetts, this is the blame game. This is the Prime Minister and the Treasurer running around the country blaming the Senate for everything, creating an artificial storm, saying we should change the voting system. We did not hear from any coalition members between 1983 and 1996 about curbing the powers of the Senate or rigging the voting system. All we heard was them extolling plurality. That is what they did.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—But we actually never went to rig the voting system in the Senate, Senator Margetts—never once. If they had, I know I would have been the one they came to to devise the system, and they never did.
What we are seeing here is the Senate being set up as the fall guy. That is fair enough as a political tactic. All executive governments do it; I acknowledge that. The point is: if you are going to do that, get your act together in this chamber. Don't have the Treasurer go out on a Tuesday morning and demand we debate this all week and have your Senate leadership pull the rug from under him at about 5.30 p.m. on the Wednesday and defer the vote.
We assume that the government are deferring this vote because they are responding to the Democrats, but we do not know for sure. Given their rather tricky performances in the past about some of these matters, one could not be really sure whether this is the motive. But let's give them the benefit of the doubt in saying this is why they are doing it. They should have got the intelligence earlier that this was the situation. They should have told the Treasurer, `Don't make yourself look like the biggest boofhead in history by going on the John Laws program and demanding the matter be debated when, a day later, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is going to sell you down the tubes.' 
 The responsibility that the three senators sitting there have is to keep your leadership informed. The problem is: if you do not keep your leadership informed, next time there is a reshuffle just watch out. Your job is to keep the Prime Minister informed.
Senator Heffernan interjecting—
—You do not have to worry, Senator Heffernan; you will always be looked after.
—Is that a promise, Robert?
—Any time we kick the Prime Minister in the behind, we know who gets concussion, Senator Heffernan. We have got no doubts about that whatsoever—none whatsoever. But these three gentlemen on the front bench need to keep the Prime Minister fully apprised of where this is going.
What we do not expect over the next week—because this motion will probably be carried today—is the Prime Minister and the Treasurer re-entering the list and saying, `The Senate is not dealing with this.' I hope the leadership here at least have the decency to contact him in Western Australia today and say, `Look, for a variety of reasons we have had to put off the tax debate until next Tuesday. Just lay off the rhetoric a bit. Just lay off beating the Senate for a few days because we have had this bit of a blip that we should have told you about in advance. We regret we haven't told you about it until now, but please don't go on with the normal, moronic Senate-bashing exercise simply to shift the blame in politics.'",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-04-21,"—I do not want to detain the Senate for too long, but I think it is important to understand what the attitudes of the parties are on this issue. I noticed Senator Ray was being very generous in offering gratuitous advice to this side of the chamber. I am surprised that he has not really taken the opportunity to offer a lot more constructive advice to his own leader because if ever anyone blew it comprehensively, it is Senator Faulkner. What Senator Faulkner has essen 
 tially said to the rest of the Senate is this: `Between us—Labor and the coalition—we have got the numbers. We don't care about anyone else. Screw `em.' That is the way the Labor Party operates; that is the way it works in the Trades Hall Council. But that is not the approach that we take in the Senate.
We would like to get on with this debate as quickly as possible. We have made that abundantly clear. We have said it in spades right from the time of the last election. Nothing would please us more than to have this debate out of the road. We do not for a moment expect a skerrick of cooperation from the other side of the chamber. We understand your agenda. You will be here to frustrate for as long as possible. You have no constructive amendments to make; you are simply going through the motions of delay.
We understand all that, but what is important is that there are some people who actually have amendments. We might say that they are misguided and wrong-headed. They might want to take out food and we do not like it, but at least they have got a few policy approaches, and the process of this place allows those to be properly debated and considered.
—You described them as fruitcakes.
—Indeed, and that will be reflected in the attitude we take when they put up their amendments. But we do not deny them the right to put their amendments on the table. But that is the very thing that Senator Faulkner wants. He wants to deny them the opportunity to put their amendments on the table. He does not want to have a running sheet; he just wants pure chaos. That is what your leader wants. He wants to fundamentally disrupt the processes of the Senate so that it is absolutely chaotic. At the end of the day, much and all as we are disappointed that the Democrats have not been able to use the time between the last election and now to come up with all of their amendments, we do give them the benefit of the doubt in the sense that we know they do not have the resources of the trade union movement behind them and they therefore have to do a fair amount of the work themselves.
—The hoary old chestnut.
—Come in spinner! It hurts, doesn't it? That is a very painful nerve. The trouble with that issue is that it will never go away. You can bury your heads in the sand, you can deny it, you can say it is not so, but when everyone looks at the background of the people on the other side of the chamber they know that overwhelmingly they are the lackeys of the trade union movement. It is within your control or the control of the preselectors. I simply say it.
Just to be clear, we have had over 14 hours of the second reading. In terms of speeches on the second reading, this is in the top half-dozen of second reading debates ever in this chamber. We have had a very substantial period of time. We are dead keen to get on with it, but we are prepared to give the Democrats an opportunity to ensure that the process of the Senate operates effectively. The only thing we regret, but we are not surprised about, is that Labor has no interest at all in pursuing that agenda.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-04-21,"—We just heard from the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. He has spoken for three minutes. You would have thought that with all his experience in this parliament he would have had a bit more to say than could be said in three minutes. What a miserable, mealy-mouthed performance that was that came from Senator Alston, the great champion of the lawyers' party in this parliament. What we have heard from him is gratuitous advice to the opposition. We have heard from him gratuitous advice to the Democrats.
Nothing could be more insincere than the proposition he has put before us today, because at core here we have the major problem with the government's legislation, a program which they have trumpeted up and down this country. Up and down this country they have said, `This is the most important legislation this country has ever seen.' We have been told that this is legislation that is immutable. That is the proposition that has been put to the people of this country. And now we are told that there needs to be more time to consider the amendments of the Democrats—amendments which you have already declared that you intend to vote against and have 
 already declared that you have no interest in. You have no interest in considering these issues.
The critical issue here about all of this is that you really need more time to get your deal together. The critical question that has to be attended to is that you have yet to organise the deal to put this package through the parliament. We say, of course, that this package is wrong. We say that a majority of Australians do not accept this package, that a majority of Australians understand just how wrong this package is and they demonstrated that at the last election. But you claim to have a mandate, you claim that this is the most important legislation this country has ever seen and you claim that this legislation is immutable. Yet you come in here with this mealy-mouthed nonsense that you want to provide more time for the Democrats to prepare amendments which you will vote against. What we have seen is a major U-turn by the government on this question.
I am perhaps a bit different from some of my colleagues in my perception of Senator Ian Campbell's role in this. I do understand the problem he faces. I do appreciate the difficulty he faces. Quite frankly, he is dealing with incompetents beside him in Senator Kemp and Senator Alston. He is dealing with fundamental incompetents. They do not bother telling him what is going on, and he is the one who has to come in here and find excuses for the incompetence of this government. We were told by Mr Costello only yesterday that the Senate should get on with the job, that he cannot understand why we need to wait another week, that this vote should be taken straightaway. Yet Senator Campbell is the unfortunate one who has to get up here and explain why this miserable, mealy-mouthed approach is being taken. Quite clearly he is at a loss to do so. I can understand just how weak his performance is, because what else could he do after so much has been made of this legislation by so many in this government with so little to show for it?
This parliament, we are told, has been considering this matter for 14 hours. We are told that there have been huge amounts of time spent in the committees of the parlia 
 ment, a select committee and three standing committees. We have been told that all this needs to be considered in two additional weeks of sitting. Yet we are told here at 5 o'clock tonight that we have to adjourn the consideration of this matter. After the consideration of a number of amendments which we have already put, a number of principal matters that we have already put, we are told that these matters cannot be discussed any more today. This is only after yesterday when we heard from Senator McGauran, who got a big run on the ABC news last night saying that this was a matter that the government was prepared to fight a double dissolution on.
—Who said that?
—Senator McGauran said it. He was only too happy to present this as being of fundamental importance to the government. Yet what do we hear from the government today? We have to adjourn. In a breathtaking act of hypocrisy, what you are trying to do is provide more time to stitch up your arrangements.
What we have demonstrated again is that the government seeks to blame the Democrats, and they are very easy to blame. You are only too happy to blame the Democrats when you get into trouble, and they fall into the trap every time of allowing you to blame them. One can understand why you used to call them the fairies at the bottom of the garden, the fruitcakes and the various other descriptions you have put on them. Unfortunately, I think their performance today does confirm some of those opinions that you have had of them.
We have been told that we have stitched up some deal with the government in regard to the proceedings in the bill. Nothing could be further from the truth. What we saw today from the Democrats was that they were the ones that voted with the government. It was the Democrats that voted with the government in terms of passing the second reading of the bills.
We had 14 principal amendments moved by the opposition—14 of them. What did the government do? They voted against them all—blanket opposition, as you would expect. What did the Democrats do? On issues such 
 as this proposal being an unfair tax that would see more than 50 per cent of benefits going to the top 20 per cent of income earners, and of it being a tax to benefit higher income earners which would far outweigh increases in social security benefits for low income earners—proposals which would see the creation of a situation where people with no children and earnings of $100,000 per year would get five times the benefit proposed for low income earners—what do the Democrats do? They abstain. What great principle; what a show of strength that was; what an extraordinary commitment to social justice was demonstrated by their abstention today!
On the issue of protecting retirees, what did the Democrats do? They abstained. On the question of defending Australian consumers and exposing the real impact of the tax on prices rises, the Democrats abstained. On the issue of defending small businesses, what did the Democrats do? They abstained. So I do not think it is appropriate for them to suggest that they are the persons of high principle and that they are the only ones that have an interest in social justice and equity issues.
What we have heard from Senator Alston, however, means that the government has once again demonstrated its hypocrisy. We heard only yesterday from the Prime Minister—and it has been contradicted by Senator Alston, I might suggest, in his actions today—`I have said all along that we are not going to alter the essential thrust of the plan. What I will happily do is finetune at the margins but I am not going to alter the essentials.' Senator Alston would have us believe that there is going to be some consideration of the measures being presented by the Democrats. I suggest to you that nothing could be further from the truth.
We saw Senator Alston in the Telstra debate, where he suggested that Senator Faulkner had acted in a way which was inappropriate and had indicated that, once you have the numbers, you just use them. Senator Faulkner did not say that. On the contrary, what we have seen in the Telstra discussion in this parliament is that Senator Alston has behaved in that way, quite clearly gagging the debate on Telstra and quite clearly using 
 Senator Colston in the most unprincipled of ways to secure the partial privatisation of Telstra itself.
I say to the Senate that this proposal is not about a proper consideration of the legislative program and it is not about an orderly scheduling of debate; it is about providing the government with more time to stitch up its deal to get this inequitable tax through—which of course will do great harm to this country.
—The question is that the motion moved by Senator Ian Campbell be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-21,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999  proposes to implement changes to the recognition of software expenses for businesses as announced by the government in the 1998-99 budget and modified by subsequent announcements.
Before I go to further comments, I point out to the Senate that this matter has been brought on very quickly and very unexpectedly, I might say. It is a mark of the cooperation of the Labor opposition in attempting to facilitate the government's program, particularly when, as we have just seen, we should be dealing with the GST package. That is what we are here to debate. We have had time set aside, specifically these two weeks, and we have cooperated in extending time in order to debate the government's GST package, but it has just been pulled. We should be going into committee to deal with that very important—one of the few points we would agree with the government on—package of bills. So the Labor opposition is being remarkably cooperative with the government in attempting to facilitate its program.
I can only reflect on the comments of Senator Ian Campbell, the Manager of Government Business, who castigated the Labor opposition a few weeks ago with respect to the second reading debate on the 
 Telstra bills. What happened when we got to the end of the second reading debate on the Telstra bills? The government pulled the bills. Likewise, what has happened when we want to get on with the GST legislation and consider that? The government pulls the bills, despite being here quite specifically to deal with the issues relating to the GST package.
I do not want to be too harsh on the government manager, Senator Campbell. We all know that Senator Heffernan is eyeing his job and that he is ready to take over. He is being trained because of the incompetence of Senator Campbell. We cannot just blame Senator Campbell of course. We have had a shambles today with the Acting Leader of the Government, Senator Alston, in the conduct of the Senate, not just with the GST bills being pulled.
For example, we had two government senators who were out to lunch early and missed the vote, so we had to recommit a vote on that GST legislation. Of course Senator Alston did not complain about that, because I can recall a couple of occasions when he himself has missed a couple of vital votes in recent times. And he is the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. I do not know what role Senator Kemp is taking in all of this. He is the Assistant Treasurer. We have very important legislation that we should be considering with respect to the GST package. I simply do not know what Senator Kemp is doing to assist in managing the government's program and attempting to get this vital legislation through.
The Labor Party is supporting the  Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999 . We have one very important amendment. I think this highlights yet again the positive approach that the Labor Party takes to genuine tax reform that is for the benefit of the whole community in Australia. That is one of the reasons we will be supporting this legislation.
The changes we are considering in this legislation fall into three broad categories: first, expenses associated with developing year 2000 compliance systems; second, minor or redundant software expenses; and, third, a new consistent regime for non-minor software 
 expenses. The first category relates to expenses associated with becoming year 2000 compliant. This bill will allow for an immediate deduction for expenditure in relation to new software or for substantially rebuilding current software to ensure Y2K compliance for an existing computer system. In relation to year 2000 compliance expenses, the taxation commissioner has ruled that expenditure incurred in initial work on computer software to determine the extent to which it is not Y2K compliant will be on revenue account, even if no further work is necessary.
Further expenditure incurred in modifying and testing computer software to make it Y2K complaint will be on revenue account, even if it also provides minor software improvements. Where expenditure incurred in modifying and subsequently testing computer software also involves substantial improvements not related to making the software Y2K compliant, it will be necessary to apportion the expenditure between the expenditure related to Y2K compliance which will be immediately deductible and the improvement expenditure which will be deductible over time.
However, Y2K compliant expenditure that involves replacement of the whole or substantially the whole of the unit of hardware equipment contained in a computer chip or firmware is of a capital nature. The government accepts the commissioner's ruling, but it is proposing to legislate to broaden the expenditures immediately deductible to also include expenditure on acquiring new software including upgrades, or substantially rebuilding current software which has the predominant nature of ensuring Y2K compliance, provided that it is incurred up to 31 December 1999.
The proposal to encourage Australian business to become Y2K compliant is sensible and it should be supported. There appears to the Labor opposition, however, to be a gap in these proposals. According to the proposed section 46(75), there is no scope for immediate deductibility of expenditure incurred after 1 January 2000. That expenditure therefore falls for consideration under the proposed new general rules and would generally be written 
 off over 2½ years. What the government is endeavouring to do with this bill is provide an immediate deduction for expenditure concerning new software where the purpose of the software is Y2K compliant and that capacity for immediate deduction will expire on 31 December 1999.
To Labor, this seems to be too short a timeframe because it seems entirely possible that problems which may emerge may not do so until that magical date of 1 January 2000—midnight—and that, if you do get problems of a Y2K kind emerging on 1 January, these problems would need to be fixed immediately. We think the general regime for deductibility may not be adequate and that the provision for immediate deductibility would be the better way to go.
The government's proposed treatment seems odd to us because expenses related to developing software to overcome the millennium bug incurred after 1 January 2000 would presumably be urgent. Labor believes that we should be encouraging business to remedy any problems and that we should give them an immediate deduction for remedial millennium bug expenses until at least 30 June next year. We think it would be more appropriate that there be an additional period of six months for businesses to get an immediate deduction for measures that they have to take to correct this problem.
To the extent that these costs have been factored into the government's estimates of the general software depreciation provisions, there would be savings against the forward estimates as Labor's amendment simply brings forward expenses that would be claimed later. We will be supporting this measure with an amendment, which we will move in the committee stage, to allow an immediate deduction for the year 2000 expenses incurred up to 30 June 2000.
The second item in this bill concerns minor redundant software expenses. All items of plant and equipment—for example, non-software valued at under $300—are allowed to be fully deductible in the year of acquisition. The rationale is that it is not worth depreciating the minor asset over its useful life where its value is so low. Software will 
 now be treated in the same manner as other minor assets but bulk purchases of software packages summing to more than $300 but individually valued at up to $300 will be covered by the new depreciation provisions.
The bulk purchase rule could be easily avoided by purchasing the same software under different invoice numbers or at different times. Therefore, the legislation includes a multiple purchase rule so that an immediate write-off of expenditure is available only where the total expenditure on identical software in an income year is $300 or less. This measure will be supported.
The third item in the legislation concerns a new depreciation regime for software. On 11 May 1998, the Commissioner of Taxation withdrew taxation ruling IT26 which deals with the taxation treatment of software expenditure. The commissioner concluded that IT26 no longer reflects the correct application of the existing law in relation to software.
Without a legislative response, the withdrawal of IT26 would mean that systems and application software would generally not be subject to deduction or at best would be depreciated over 25 years. The government therefore announced an intention to legislate with effect from 10 a.m. Australian eastern standard time on 11 May 1998 the timed withdrawal of IT26 to provide for systems and application software to be depreciated at 40 per cent per year, that is to say that it will be fully depreciated over 2½ years.
The new arrangements are proposed to apply to expenditure incurred in relation to contracts entered into to acquire software after the withdrawal of IT26. It will also apply to expenditures on specified commissioned and in-house development of software commenced after that time.
Expenditures on in-house development or commissioned software commenced or contracts entered into up to that time will continue to receive the previous treatment until 30 June next year. Therefore, any such expenditures will be treated under the new provisions. These new provisions are as follows. All software purchases will be eligible for taxation amortisation over 2½ years at 40 per cent per year. That is the 
 general regime that will apply. The software is to be depreciated over that 2½-year period at 40 per cent per year. However, there will be exemptions. If the non-renewable licence period is shorter than 2½ years, then taxpayers will be allowed to amortise their expenditure over this shorter period. Taxpayers who stop using software within the 2½ years of acquisition will be allowed an immediate deduction of the unrecouped expenditure at that time.
Software purchases up to $300 will be immediately expensed, as I indicated in discussing item 2. The cost of commissioning software or developing it in-house for their own use will be capitalised—that is, it will not be deductible until the project is completed, at which point it may be amortised in line with the new provisions, ensuring neutrality with purchased software. But should the commissioned or developed software be disbanded, capitalised costs will be deductible at that time. Finally, the treatment of upgrades and maintenance will be in line with the existing application of the law for determining capital and revenue expenses.
Broadly, expenditure on enhancing or upgrading the functional capacity of computer software should be treated on capital account. Expenditure that does not enhance functionality—such as maintenance, testing, code reviews, minor alterations, modifications and remedying defects—should continue to be treated on the revenue account. Moreover, systems software that has previously been written off as part of the computer hardware over 3.7 years under accelerated depreciation will not be amortised over 2½ years. The treatment of software that attracts concessions under other provisions remains unchanged. There should be advantages through reduced compliance costs of allowing expenditure incurred on software developed in-house to be written off from the year after it is incurred rather than being written off over 2½ years from the time each project is completed.
There will be special rules available for those who develop software. These taxpayers will be able to make a once-only election to pool that expenditure. Once that election has been made, all expenditure incurred in devel 
 oping software in an income year is to be pooled or written off at 40 per cent in the following two years and 20 per cent in the third year. There will be a transitional arrangement whereby taxpayers who elect to pool for the first income year after 11 May 1998 will be able to elect out of the pooling method in the second income year after 11 May 1998.
The government claims the write-off rate of 2½ years strikes an appropriate balance between considerations that software is an essentially capital expenditure which should be amortised for taxation purposes and the relatively short expected life of software arising from rapid developments in the IT industry. This does not seem to Labor to be a reasonable line of argument, but software these days does have a relatively short expected life. Labor also notes that this is a reasonable treatment in terms of overseas comparisons and international arrangements. Indeed, the proposed arrangements for software are broadly more generous than those applying in comparable overseas jurisdictions. For example, New Zealand allows software purchases to be depreciated at 30 per cent straight line or 40 per cent diminishing value. That is the equivalent to 3.3 years. The UK provides depreciation at 25 per cent diminishing value, equivalent to a six-year write-off. In Canada, software receives either a five-year or eight-year write-off period depending on the industry it is used in, while applications software is depreciated at 100 per cent, which effectively results in a two-year write-off period due to Canada's half-year rule. The United States provides a three-year write-off for newly purchased software unless the taxpayer can show that a shorter write-off is appropriate.
This measure is necessary to ensure that Australian businesses are not disadvantaged by the new ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation. Software expenditure is a significant and increasing expense of business and must have a reasonable taxation regime to ensure that Australian firms remain internationally competitive. As I indicated before, Labor will support the proposal subject to the amendment that we propose to move in the commit 
 tee stage, allowing the immediate deduction to be incurred up to 30 June 2000.
When we are talking about taxation arrangements for business, I suppose it is worth referring briefly to the fact that we have recently seen the second discussion of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. From Labor's point of view, as a matter of process, this is really the way that taxation reform ought to be undertaken, at least in its consideration, with the release of detailed options for public discussion before government makes a final decision. It certainly makes a stark contrast with the way the government has handled the GST package, and mishandled it in the Senate here today—simply dumping the GST package on people just before an election in a deliberate attempt to hide the detail under cover of a $20 million taxpayer funded, essentially party political, advertising campaign.
The Ralph team has produced a very lengthy and very detailed document. It deserves a considered response, and we certainly will not be rushing to judgment in relation to it. Labor agrees with the need for business tax reform, as indeed Labor agrees with the general argument for tax reform without a GST. We are prepared to give support with respect to business tax reform to those measures that come from that review where it can be demonstrated that those changes will improve investment, productivity and growth—adding jobs and strengthening industries rather than the reverse, as will be the case with a GST.
We will not, however, support in this exercise some kind of reduction of business taxation at the expense of individuals and families or anything which looks like simply dipping into the budget surplus. This exercise should not be about giving tax cuts to business while this government is on about imposing a 10 per cent GST on individuals and families. Labor certainly intends to hold the government to its promise that the business tax package will be revenue neutral.
As I said earlier, we should have been debating the GST package here. We have had somewhat of a shambles due to the incompetence of the government's handling of the 
 package of legislation. We stood ready tonight to debate the government's GST package in some detail through until next week in the committee stage, but unfortunately it has been deferred. For those listening, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, have been roaming the country saying, `Labor should get on with it in the Senate; pass our package, get on with it,' and when we are ready to get on with considering the legislation what happens? What has happened has been due to a combination of factors. Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, is away and we have the incompetent Senator Alston in his place leading the team—such as that team is. Senator Ian Campbell is part of the team as is Senator Kemp—the minister who cannot answer a question and pads it out with ums and ahs instead—who is going to be handling the important tax legislation in the Senate.
—If we ever get to be asked a question.
—Just quieten down, Senator Campbell. Here we are, cooperating tonight, dealing with legislation brought on at very short notice, doing our best to get the government's program passed, despite the shambles that we saw earlier this evening when you could not proceed with your own legislation. I just hope this is not an indication of how this legislation is going to be dealt with, Senator Campbell. We are here ready to support it.
To conclude, I have grave concerns for the future of small business under a GST, particularly with the problems associated with Y2K compliance. It is an unfortunate coincidence that, if the GST comes in, it will be coming in a short time after midnight of the year 2000. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SOFTWARE DEPRECIATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-21,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999  puts forward two significant proposals. This is one of those bills which dare not be delayed because it relates to the significant tick over of the 20th century. The first proposal is the requirement to depreciate computer software over 2½ years. Until May 1998, as a general rule software costs were deductible in the year in 
 which the expenditure was made, in accordance with Taxation Ruling IT26. In May 1998, the Taxation Commissioner, Mr Carmody, that expert on gingerbread men, decided that computer software should no longer be regarded as a revenue expense and consequently it should not necessarily be immediately deductible, and IT26 was withdrawn.
For what it is worth, and with respect to Mr Carmody from the tax office, we agree that computer software should not necessarily be immediately deductible. We believe that computer software is a capital asset and expenditure on that asset should logically be written down over a number of years, consistently with the treatment of other capital assets—when, of course, it is of significant cost. If it is not of significant cost then it makes no sense to proceed on that basis. We note, with approval, that software purchases of $300 or less will continue to be deductible in the year of expenditure.
Before I move on to the second proposal, I would like to comment on the withdrawal of income tax ruling IT26. Whilst we agree that the substance of that ruling—that is, that computer software expenditure be deductible in the first year—was inconsistent with the treatment of other assets, we are concerned that when the ruling was withdrawn software costs fell into a tax black hole in this regard. This was commented upon in the Australian Financial Review a couple of days after the withdrawal of the ruling. Appearing in the AFR on such a matter within such short notice of the change of that ruling is a sure sign that it has got up somebody's nose. That type of uncertainty and that type of interregnum between tax events can only adversely affect business. It is uncertainty which is entirely avoidable. It only requires communication and cooperation between the government, the tax office and the professionals in the tax business world.
The second proposal contained in this bill relates to expenditure incurred to cure the year 2000 problem—known everywhere now as the Y2K problem. The Y2K problem can potentially affect computer systems worldwide. Sometimes I get the feeling we are 
 facing those kinds of `end of the world is nigh' cartoons, and nobody is quite sure whether this Y2K thing will turn out to be an interstellar explosion or a relatively expensive and short firework bang. But I agree with the government and I agree with the commentators that you dare not take the risk. It is for that reason that people are spending billions worldwide to address this problem.
It is proposed that expenditure on software incurred before 1 January 2000 will be deductible if the principal purpose of the expenditure is to ensure that an existing computer system attains year 2000 compliance. Obviously the tax office is not going to be able to run around and ask everybody if that is true. It will be a declaration of trust, I guess, by those who put in their tax returns. But that is typical of our entire system. Our tax returns are submitted on a trust basis.
This concession no doubt comes as a relief to business, which was facing the prospect of having to depreciate this expenditure on the basis of a draft ruling the Commissioner for Taxation had in respect of expenditure on year 2000 compliance. That draft ruling stated that expenditure on acquiring new software or substantially rebuilding current software would not be immediately deductible because it was capital in nature. The Australian Democrats support this measure and take the view that business should be encouraged by government to undertake preventative measures like this one by the granting of these types of event-specific taxation concessions.
Another significant event which may potentially be facing this country in the year 2000, and one which is possibly as significant as the year 2000 problem in terms of its cost, is the imposition of a new tax system. I would like to comment briefly on the potential for computers and computer software to significantly ease the burden of compliance with the GST event, should that event in fact occur, and for the possibility that the government may provide concessional tax treatment for expenditure, the principal purpose of which is to ensure that existing computer and accounting systems are GST compliant.
The use of computing systems would without doubt be one of the best means of 
 minimising the costs arising from needing to account for GST paid on inputs and having to claim those credits against GST payable to the tax office on goods sold. It is our view that the government should seriously consider the use of tax concessions like this one to encourage business to be fully prepared for this new tax system, just as it will hopefully be for the year 2000 problem.
The government's regulatory impact statement says that the imposition of a GST will cost a minimum of $1.9 billion to business. Frankly, that is a cost which otherwise they would not have to incur, and it is our belief that the government should review favourably tax concessions to deal with that very significant tax event which business will experience. The Australian Democrats believe that the government needs to use tax policy as a flexible device to assist business and that it should not shy away from event-specific taxation in that regard.
In respect of the government's amendments to the bill, which have been circulated in advance, we will be supporting them. I foreshadow that the Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Labor Party amendment. The reason is that we believe the focus must be on preventive measures to address the year 2000 problems before they occur. This will not deny a deductibility to any subsequent expenditure; it will simply mean that it will not get concessional treatment and will not necessarily be fully deductible in the year of expenditure.
This kind of bill, this kind of proactive activity by the government with regard to tax concessions to deal with issues which are not the consequence of normal business activity, has to be welcomed. I think the government has behaved properly with regard to this particular issue and, as a result of this particular concession, will minimise potential problems which could exist in our business world, and indeed in the non-business world—in the charity sectors and in the Senate, and for anyone else who has computer systems—where the year 2000 problem might result in major problems.
I want to move on from these remarks to more general fears that I have in terms of a 
 coalition of events which may prove unmanageable for business. The first, as we know, is the year 2000 event. The assumption in the community at large is that, come the first week of January, everybody will breathe a sigh of relief—the planes are still flying, you can still draw your money out of the ATM, you can still go to the supermarket and use EFTPOS and you are safe. However, it is possible that year 2000 problems will continue in the months thereafter. For any business systems which do crash, those consequences could be pretty catastrophic and could continue for some months and result in a great deal of angst for those concerned.
To that potential event, we add the second potential event—the introduction of the new tax system proposals, particularly the GST, but also a number of other events. They are due to occur on 1 July 2000. So that is the second major issue that businesses have to face: having got through the year 2000 problem, they will then have to make sure their accounting software and indeed their systems—and for many small businesses it will require the acquisition of hardware—are ready for the GST. It is not as if they have a great deal of time to do that, because the ACCC is going to be pretty hot on their tails in the first month of July to make sure they are pricing their goods appropriately—taking off wholesale sales tax and putting on the goods and services tax.
But hanging over all of this is the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. It seems possible to me, given the way the government operates—and maybe this is so and maybe it is not—that when the Ralph review is completed the government will examine the recommendations and will produce legislation as a consequence for us to deal with later this year. It is possible that the Ralph review reforms or changes will be geared to be introduced also on 1 July 2000 because it is the nature of tax legislation that the government does indeed try, as far as possible, to use financial year dates to kick in new tax legislation or new tax provisions. If you do that, and we have the year 2000, the GST and the possible Ralph tax changes, we are going 
 to have a lot of angry tax professionals and business people.
—They might be happy because they will be so busy.
—Yes, some of them will be happy, and some will be making a lot of money. But the fact is that, with regard to these issues, we have to be aware of the kind of stress which may attend all these changes at once to business systems and to the business community at large. If the government decides to pursue that course of action, and it may—you cannot do anything about the two events I have discussed already—it is then incumbent upon the government to consider maximising the tax concessions which will allow people to lay off the costs which would arise from tax event-specific activity.
This bill does not do that; it deals with the year 2000 problem and some other general policy approaches on the tax side. But if the government is in fact to continue a good policy approach here of being proactive in this area, then it may well need to start to think about that. It would be better, quite frankly, if that was known earlier rather than later, so that people buying hardware and software can maximise the benefit of the investment with a view to perhaps having to change their systems and so on.
Those I think are the simple things, like the discussions about how depreciation will be treated in future. As you know, most major organisations have assets registers. The assets registers are recorded in software packages. They are very much a part of the business systems. The assets registered are all computed in terms of the year of write-off. If the government decides to change depreciation allowances and when things will happen, then you have to change those software packages and systems.
Similarly, the capital gains discussion is very much in the news. If the government decides to put up legislation which, for instance, had a sliding scale in terms of capital gains, or if it alters the capital gains percentages or the time in which capital gains events took place, again systems will be affected. The software that is available is affected, particularly in major organisations. 
 You can imagine what a place like Lend Lease, to give an example of a giant company with extensive investments in property, assets and equipment, would have to do with their systems and their software if you fiddled with depreciation and capital gains.
—It's the big bang.
—Yes, it is a big systems bang, if you like. What I am trying to encourage you to do in this important first step that you are putting forward is to think forward so that, if the government does decide to introduce tax changes in those areas, you provide well in advance tax facility for write-offs and favourable treatment of good investment in modern technology which can cope with the potential of all those changes. I am no computer expert, but I am very certain that that kind of tax coalition—tax big bang, as Senator Sherry expresses it—would require some kind of special treatment.
With that general admonition about some fears of what the year 2000 may bring to the systems engineers, tax accountants, tax professionals, financial directors and systems managers, I close by repeating that the Australian Democrats support this bill and will support the government's amendments.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SOFTWARE DEPRECIATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-04-21,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999  proposes to recognise the software expenses incurred by businesses seeking to remedy their year 2000 problem. There is currently quite a high level of confusion in the community about what Y2K actually means and what is involved in becoming compliant. Despite much of the publicity surrounding the year 2000 problem, it is not about the year per se. As we have reiterated in this chamber many times, the real problem is how computers have been programmed to read dates. Unfortunately, there is no universal law or ruling governing how we deal with the Y2K problem, so we have a rather ad hoc approach that by and large leaves the fixing of the problem to individual companies and governments seeking to take a socially and economically responsible position with respect to this issue.
We find ourselves a mere 250-odd days away from the year 2000 and in a situation where some countries have done virtually nothing with respect to becoming compliant while others are inching closer to preparedness as each day passes. Australia is in a comparatively better position than most other countries. I am ever hopeful that the effects of non-compliance, which will no doubt be felt throughout next year, will be manageable. However, any disruptions or glitches or whatever will occur could possibly have been lessened had the problem been recognised and acted upon earlier, particularly with reference to the role that the federal government have taken in their somewhat tardy response to the Y2K issue.
There is a great opportunity for leadership on this issue and we stand generally in a strong position within the Asia-Pacific region. In turn, this places a great deal of responsibility on this country. This bill represents another piece in the jigsaw puzzle that not only goes towards raising awareness in the community about Y2K but also puts in place a practical mechanism to encourage remediation work. We saw not so long ago the passage of the so-called `good Samaritan' legislation through this place which in its way encourages the sharing of information about methods of remediation and preparing for the Y2K problem by using a mechanism of allowing more open communication and sharing of information about strategies and methodologies to enable companies to become prepared.
This is the real challenge that presents itself to this government—this overall approach to preparedness. Just recently we saw the release of information by the government relating to their own levels of preparedness, which I will comment on a little later on. I presume that, in the near future, we will see some sort of public education and awareness campaign in relation to this matter to continue the work that has begun in the private sector of raising business and corporate awareness right across the board, to extend the same courtesy or service to the citizens of the country as opposed to our corporate and business sector only. 
What we are really looking for, as we have with the coalition government through so many issues, is some decisive action. As I said, I am hopeful that this piece of legislation will also contribute to that jigsaw puzzle of providing a framework to allow the Australian community to be in the best possible position come 1 January 2000.
While over 90 per cent of Australian businesses are aware of the year 2000 problem, barely 60 per cent have taken action or intend to take action to fix potential problems. Of those businesses that are not intending or have not begun to take action, the main reason they have not done so is that they are unsure about what they need to do, according to surveys. A quarter of those businesses that do not know anything about it claim that they will not be affected, and a staggering 16 per cent are unaware of what the problem is.
Many Australian businesses and organisations are looking to the federal government for direction and assistance. Time and time again they have been disappointed with the level of information available. This bill will serve a dual purpose in that regard: not only will it provide a practical mechanism, or almost a financial incentive, for businesses to take on the challenge of proceeding down a path of remediation and preparing themselves for Y2K but it also demonstrates that there are costs involved.
This brings me to the issue of how government agencies and departments will fare. As we have seen by the report recently released by the federal government, the state of preparedness within the government's own operations is very disappointing. The point has to be made—and the point is inherent in this bill—that remediation work costs money. It does cost business a lot. The 50 per cent of Australian businesses that have estimated the cost of Y2K compliance estimate that it will cost about $10,000 for each business. Even a similar, pro rata analysis of costing shows that it will be a relatively large imposition on government agencies.
Whilst we have seen the government allocate some funding through the last budget to be divided up amongst Commonwealth departments and agencies, surely questions 
 have to be asked about the state of compliance of those bodies. I will give examples of a few. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal lists their compliancy for business critical systems at zero—250 days from the year 2000. The Australian Customs Service is at 22 per cent compliance for business critical systems. The Australian Law Reform Commission is at 42 per cent. The most ridiculous and publicly well documented situation is that of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts—the very department that has the Office for Government Online, the section within that department handling the government's strategy for Y2K compliance. A mere 36 per cent of its business critical systems is compliant. The National Science and Technology Centre is at 33 per cent compliance.
The record is not good, but the point is that it costs money. It requires a commitment to fix this problem. This bill assists business in meeting the costs of becoming compliant. In the preparation of this legislation, the government can learn the lesson for themselves that if you want the problem fixed you have to invest in its remediation.
The  Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999  proposes to implement a series of changes to the recognition of software expenses for businesses by using tax concessions to alleviate the financial burden. These fall into three broad categories. Firstly, there are those expenses associated with the development of Y2K compliance systems. Secondly, there are minor or redundant software expenses. Lastly, the bill proposes a new consistent regime for all non-minor software expenses.
Following the ruling of the Commissioner of Taxation on year 2000 compliance expenses, the government proposes to broaden expenditures immediately deductible to also include expenditure on acquiring new software, including upgrades or substantially rebuilding current software to ensure Y2K compliance, provided these costs are incurred up to 31 December 1999.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1999-04-21,"—Tonight I would like to tell a story about a bank. `Which bank?' you might ask. I refer to a bank that was once known as the people's bank, a bank described by its founding father, Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, as a bank belonging to the people. Most of us have quite nostalgic memories of our little tin moneyboxes and our school bank accounts. In those days, the Commonwealth Bank was a community icon—a safe and secure repository for our savings and a part of the very important lesson about saving for a rainy day.
Over the years, the bank has grown and changed, as indeed has the Australian banking industry. But always the Commonwealth Bank continued to be a bank for the people. In fact, in 1993 it claimed, very proudly in its annual report, that it operated responsibly `according to commercial principles with industry related performance objectives'. Its mission statement proclaimed that it aimed to be `a preferred provider of financial services to customers, helping them realise their goals'. However, what we now know is that the goals that could be realised varied from customer to customer.
For many of the farmers of Australia, those wealth generators of this nation, the bank had a policy under the high interest rates forced upon all of us by the Hawke and Keating governments. I have no doubt that those hundreds, perhaps thousands, of farm families will never forget the way the Commonwealth Bank dealt with their particular goals and aspirations. Right across this country the Commonwealth Bank sold up, threw off, evicted, auctioned, foreclosed and bankrupted hundreds of farming families. Their problem was that they simply could not meet the Commonwealth Bank's demand for payment.
Who could ever forget those televised scenes of forced sales with court officials 
 dragging families out of their farmhouses, their belongings callously abandoned and their dignity totally disregarded. Let us recall a couple of them. There was Oswald, a 70-year-old Victorian war veteran, who was evicted from his soldier settlement farm because the Commonwealth Bank decided to call in his $½ million debt which had accumulated as a result of floods, poor seasons and, most of all, high interest rates. Another was Robert, a farmer who borrowed $120,000, a debt which eventually blew out to $½ million as Commonwealth Bank interest rates reached 22 per cent. He was forcibly sold up by the bank when he was unable to pay the bank the demanded $275 a day required to cover his debts. So this was how the Commonwealth Bank helped those farmers `realise their goals', and there were hundreds more of those tragic stories across this country. But not for every customer.
The Commonwealth Bank provided special deals for some very special customers. This afternoon the Senate heard how the Commonwealth Bank did some very special favours for another well-known farmer, favours which enabled him to pocket millions of dollars when he sold his farm, even though his property, a piggery, was also in debt to the Commonwealth Bank. It was not hundreds or thousands of dollars in debt but in fact millions of dollars in debt.
Farming Keating claimed that his farm was a `first-rate asset'. We now know that it was not. I seek leave to table a 1995 report by KPMG, which in paragraph (vii) declared that the Euphron group of companies could only continue to trade with the support of the group's shareholders and bankers.
Leave not granted.
—How interesting that leave is not granted. Why don't these people want to know the truth about this matter? But the Commonwealth Bank came to the rescue for this high profile farming Prime Minister—no doubt with its corporate mission statement in mind of helping customers to realise their goals—and it was a pork-barrelling exercise that would do a pig farmer proud. In a deal that would sicken the stomachs of thousands of hardworking, honest farm clients around 
 this country, the Commonwealth Bank wrote off nearly $5 million of this pig farm's debt. I now seek leave to table a document which shows that in May 1994 the Commonwealth Bank did write off $4.9 million of the piggery group debt.
Leave not granted.
—Madam President, on a point of order: I just want to put on the record that the opposition reminds government senators there are courtesies involved in tabling documents. If they do not observe the courtesies, they will not be granted leave.
—In this case the bank silently wrote off the debt at the same time as the sale to Indonesian interests was taking place. In doing so, it allowed the multimillion dollar purchase price to flow to Farmer Keating without any claim by the bank. In summary, this extraordinary write-off, favour, gift or special deal for the Prime Minister was worth millions of dollars—in fact, almost $5 million.
To put that into perspective, that year the Commonwealth Bank wrote off $26.5 million across the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries, mostly after the borrowers had been bankrupted and thrown off their farms. So Mr Keating's write-off accounted for almost one-fifth of the total debt written off, despite the fact that millions of dollars were on their way from Indonesia. There is little doubt that Farmer Keating was the only primary producer offered this gold plated financial deal.
 But there was more. The Commonwealth Bank took a second dip into the pork barrel, and it was equally generous and quite extraordinary. Keating and his partner wanted to maximise their take-out of the final settlement of the sale of their shares and Keating's option to the Indonesians. So at final settlement over the Anzac weekend in 1996 the bank came to the party again, this time with a gift worth almost $4 million to enable a successful sale. The gift was in the form of a six-year, no-interest loan which the bank granted the Indonesian purchasers at final settlement. 
On the same night that the bank did this deal, Farmer Keating walked away with more than $2 million as his final settlement. Not a bad consolation prize for a man who had been totally rejected by the Australian people only a couple of weeks before! Could any other of Australia's hardworking, wealth generating farmers get this special deal of a six-year, no-interest loan? Not likely. For the hundreds of Australian farmers who were thrown off their properties by the Commonwealth Bank, Farmer Keating's overflowing pork barrel must be sickening.
Recently, 60 Minutes posed the question of whether the bank and Keating conspired to blackmail Al Constantinidis to buy his silence about the piggery deals. It established that the bank settled its $11 million plus action against Constantinidis for $½ million. There is no doubt that Farmer Keating was a significant beneficiary of this decision, which until very recently bought silence from his former partner and, of course, was intended to buy his silence permanently.
 So there we have it: a barrel of pork containing special deals worth $20 million. It is enough to make Andrew Fisher turn in his grave—`a bank belonging to the people' indeed. Today, the Commonwealth Bank denied any wrongdoing, but standard denials by press release are no longer enough. The taxpayers and the farmers of Australia want to know why the Commonwealth Bank wrote this money off, they want to know who made the decision, and they want to know now. Pig farmer, Prime Minister, gold plated customer P.J. Keating must surely have been the only farmer in Australia who successfully and silently negotiated a $20 million gift from one of Australia's great public institutions—the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. During Senator Ferris's contribution, Senator Evans, by point of order, indicated that leave had not been granted for the tabling of the document sought by Senator Ferris on the basis that the courtesies of the chamber had not been observed. The courtesies had been observed and, therefore, I am asking by point of order whether that means—because they are the same documents 
 I sought to table earlier today—that the Labor Party is now willing to grant—
—We did not know that.
—It was indicated. Does that mean you are willing to grant it?",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Commonwealth Bank of Australia</title>,Adjournment,24,1
