"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—I rise to speak in the debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (National Investigative Powers and Witness Protection) Bill 2006 [2007]. Labor welcomes what would be described as the useful upgrades which the bill makes to law enforcement capabilities. However, the bill fails to uphold a number of traditions necessary for the passing of fair and balanced legislation. In truth, the bill runs hot and cold—perhaps, like the Howard government, it is increasingly unreliable and out of touch.
In February this year, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, comprising nine senators, of which the majority were Liberal Party senators, found several real problems with the bill. I will come back to that later. Labor, Liberal and Democrat participants unanimously passed recommendations to address the bill’s lack of transparency and focus. Why? Because it was the right thing to do. Labor will move amendments to improve the bill’s accountability and focus. Given that numerous Liberal senators want changes made to this bill, it would be unreasonable for the Howard government to oppose them. Obviously, we will give those on the other side an opportunity to consider their position.
As can be seen, this bill contains a number of schedules. It is, in truth, an omnibus bill. There are discrete schedules that deal with a range of issues, and I will go through them individually. I will now comment on each of the elements of schedule 1, which deals with controlled operations, assumed identities and protection of witness identity, sequentially.
With respect to controlled operations, defined as a covert or overt activity which would normally be unlawful but for which immunity is provided for the purposes of securing evidence of serious criminal offences, the bill enables controlled operations in the case of a serious Commonwealth offence or a serious state offence with a federal aspect. A controlled operation cannot be authorised where it could seriously endanger the health or safety of a person, would cause death or serious injury, would involve the commission of a sexual offence or would result in significant loss or damage to property other than illicit goods. A civilian can participate in such an operation, but only where the authorising officer is satisfied that a law enforcement officer will not suffice.
In addition, we are pleased that the Ombudsman features in schedule 1. The Ombudsman has been given comprehensive powers of inquiry and access to any records held by an agency. That is appropriate oversight for that schedule and that power. A problem does emerge in that this bill allows the government to prescribe by regulation a serious Commonwealth offence, and such an offence need not prescribe a maximum imprisonment period of three or more years. Two legal experts on the proliferation of delegated legislation in Australia, Pearce and Argument, have stated:
Australian parliaments, and particularly the federal parliament, have passed into law an enormous number of provisions authorising the making of delegated instruments that are legislative in character but which do not obviously fit within the established categories of delegated legislation.
There are four basic problems with quasi legislation. It can lead to: (1) a proliferation of quasi legislation; (2) poor quality drafting; (3) regulations that are inaccessible to the broader community; and (4) a lack of scrutiny by the legislature. Despite such advice, we are again dealing with what can only be described as more smoke-and-mirrors laws by regulation from the Howard government, and more attempts to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. The legal and constitutional affairs committee recommended that proposed subsection 15GE(3) be deleted from the bill to prevent offences carrying a penalty of less than three years imprisonment being included in the definition of ‘serious offences’ by regulation.
The government could argue that they need the framework in order to have flexibility. They make that argument every time. It would be helpful if they could come up with another line to pin their flag to. It is not enough to run that argument, because the result would be that you could have offences which carry less than three years imprisonment being included in the definition of ‘serious offences’ by regulation, and it is inappropriate to do so. It is much better to deal with that in the legislation itself.
I will now turn to assumed identities. An assumed identity is a false identity that is used by a law enforcement or security or intelligence officer, or other persons, for a period of time for the purpose of investigating an offence or gathering intelligence, or for other security activities. The reference to law enforcement or security or intelligence officers covers the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission, Customs, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the Australian Taxation Office or any other agency specified in the regulations. Assumed identities are necessary, it is said: firstly, for the purpose of an investigation or for gathering intelligence in relation to criminal activity; secondly, for the exercise of powers and the performance of functions of an intelligence agency; thirdly, for the exercise of powers and the performance of functions under the National Witness Protection Program; fourthly, for the training of people to carry out any of these functions or powers; or, fifthly, for any administrative function in support of any of these powers or functions, which would seem obvious. That list does not provide a coherent reason in itself for assumed identities.
As you can see, Customs are a designated law enforcement agency. They can use assumed identities, but they are not covered by the operation of the new federal anti law enforcement corruption body, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. It is Labor’s view that ACLEI should have coverage of Customs. We have said that numerous times now. This bill highlights again the need for ACLEI to have coverage of Customs, as the government has already included the Australian Federal Police and the ACC. Thought should also now be given to selecting the ATO employees falling under ACLEI who will perform these types of functions.
This bill makes provision for the return of evidence of the assumed identity in case of cancellation. People operating under an assumed identity, and third parties who assist them in creating and maintaining that identity, are indemnified against prosecution for acts which would otherwise be illegal. The penalties for the offences of the misuse of an assumed identity and improper disclosure of information about an assumed identity are an improvement on where we have been. Having said that, though, I think that the two-year maximum penalty does not sound particularly restrictive. Disclosing the identity of an officer could easily cost the person operating under an assumed identity their very life. Labor asserts that the maximum penalty of only two years for improper disclosure of an assumed identity does sound, in this instance, on the light side. I hope that the government can provide a reasoned and sustained argument for the basis of that and why the bill includes a penalty of only two years.
I now turn to witness protection. The witness protection provisions expand the program so that the Australian Federal Police can provide protection and assistance to former participants in the program, their families and witnesses in state or territory matters where it is necessary to protect them. The bill makes plain what these provisions do. These are tidy-up provisions. Part of the reason for having them is to ensure that we have national consistency across the various state and Commonwealth laws.
Schedule 2 covers delayed notification search warrants and provides for the establishment of a new class of search warrant. Delayed notification warrants are similar to traditional search warrants, with the exception that they do not require the occupier to be served with a notice of the search contemporaneously with the search occurring. This means that police or other eligible officers may enter and re-enter premises, conduct searches and examine, test, record, substitute or seize contents during that period without the knowledge of the occupier. The executing officer is also empowered to impersonate another person and enlist the help of a member of the public to assist with gaining entry to premises through the use of force.
Officers executing a search warrant are able to search not only material on computers located on the premises but also material accessible from those computers but located elsewhere. This will enable the tracing of a suspect’s internet activity and viewing of material accessed by the suspect. Where reasonable grounds are found to exist, the period for notification of the occupier may be extended by periods of up to six months in any one written application, up to a maximum of 18 months. It would be helpful if the government, in its response to this debate, could provide examples of how those powers might be utilised, especially when it comes to the use of computers and searching.
An extension beyond 18 months from the date of entry may be granted if the eligible issuing officer is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances and with the written approval of the minister. This recognises that some investigations may be undertaken over an extended period. Labor asserts that this schedule is in fact too broad. The bill applies to warrants for an extensive range of so-called relevant offences. It is not only Labor that thinks this is too broad.
There are Commonwealth offences that are punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period of 10 years or more. A state offence that has a federal aspect is punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period of 10 years or more. Other relevant offences are: an offence against sections 8 or 9 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978; an offence against sections 20 or 21 of the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945; or an offence against section 147.2(1) or (3), section 270.7, section 471.11(2) or section 474.15(2) of the Criminal Code.
In considering whether to authorise an application, the process is as follows. A chief officer must have regard to a three-part test which must be satisfied before the authority can be issued. The applicant must apply the same test prior to requesting authorisation. The concern is that the safeguards in this bill are linked to the prescriptive list of relevant offences and that that list of relevant offences is too broad for such sweeping powers, and powers that can be quite invasive.
Offences punishable by 10 years are of course serious offences. But in terms of the warrant, which requires and provides such an invasive power for investigations without notification, Labor considers the prescriptive list should be linked to terrorism related crimes and to offences involving or resulting in the death of a person or an offence against the person with a maximum penalty for the offence being imprisonment for life. Labor foreshadows that it will move an amendment to that effect at the committee stage. For instance, in relation to section 29 of the Crimes Act, which deals with damage to and destruction of Commonwealth property and carries a maximum term of 10 years imprisonment, the question has to be answered whether it should fall within the ambit of the proposed power. The government asserts yes, but it has not made the case, nor did it make the case in the Senate legal and constitutional committee. It is up to it to make it here today. I do not think it can make that case, quite frankly. I think—and Labor believes—that those powers should be circumscribed in the way that the Senate legal and constitutional legislation committee has outlined. Crimes of planning to conduct a terrorist attack that could kill, maim or injure hundreds of people are very different and significantly distinguishable from damage to Commonwealth property. This bill in this part should focus on terrorist related offences activity.
Schedule 4 amends the Witness Protection Act 1994. The National Witness Protection Program provides protection and assistance to witnesses involved in serious or high-profile legal proceedings which could pose a risk to them or to their families. The amendments aim to provide greater protection for witnesses or other people who are protected under the NWPP, the National Witness Protection Program. Members of the Australian Federal Police who serve in the witness protection unit and other Australian Federal Police employees who are involved in the operation of the NWPP similarly fall in that area. There is no need to go into significant detail on the remaining schedules 5 and 6. The amendments contained in schedules 5 and 6 are primarily technical. They negate the need for communication warrants to be served on the relevant telecommunications carrier under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to seize electronic information.
As I indicated earlier, there has been a Senate inquiry into this matter. The Senate inquiry provided a substantive report in respect of this bill. The matter first arose on 7 December 2006 for reference to the committee that I have referred to for examination and report by 7 February  2007, so a reasonable period of time has elapsed since that committee reported. Not only does it provide the usual overview of the bill but, more importantly, it highlights key issues where amendments have been proposed by the Senate committee. I will not go to them in total, but they go to the issues that I have raised in the second reading debate today. They go to the matters where the committee recommends that proposed section 15G subsection (3) be deleted from the bill to prevent offences carrying the penalty of less than three years imprisonment being included in the definition of ‘serious offence by regulation’. They also go to recommendation 2, in which the committee recommended that the bill be amended to retain the requirement for extension of controlled operation for a three-month period to be approved by a member of the AAT. In recommendation 3 the committee recommends that the bill be amended to impose an absolute limit of 12 months on each authorised controlled operation. The committee in recommendation 4 also ensured that the Commonwealth Ombudsman would have input into the program. The committee recommendations go to the proposal that I have outlined as well, which deals with circumscribing the use for which the delayed notification warrants can be used. That can be found in recommendation 6, where the committee recommended that the federal government limit the offences in relation to which delayed notification search warrants may be issued to offences involving, as I have said, terrorism, organised crime or death or serious injury with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
The committee also went on to recommend a number of other things, but given the limited time I will not go to those in any great detail. I note that the government has provided a series of amendments to this bill. I have not heard yet as to how many of those recommendations have been picked up by the government. I expect that they have looked seriously at all the recommendations and that they have considered the improvements to the bill that they entail and we would hope that, in a meaningful way, they would choose to adopt all of the recommendations so that this bill not only enjoys the support of Labor but has been improved by both the committee process and by the government in adopting those recommendations. As I have said, there are significant concerns about this bill. It needs fixing. Whilst not declining to give this bill a second reading, I foreshadow that all words after ‘that’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-07,"—I would like to let the chamber know that this afternoon the Australian Democrats will give notice of a proposed select Senate inquiry into the nation’s antiterrorism laws. We do that for very good reasons. One is to ensure the public confidence in our nation’s laws but, more broadly, particularly in light of the Dr Haneef situation, there is good reason to review the myriad pieces of legislation that have been passed, particularly in recent years. If you add them all up, Mr Acting Deputy President, over the past few years, through you to the minister, I think possibly 40 pieces of legislation have been passed by this government in order to provide, arguably, an effective antiterrorism regime.
I preface my comments today with regard to the enactment of new and potentially very wide ranging additional powers for some of our law enforcement agencies and others. I am not sure whether that debate should be taking place now against this backdrop. Maybe we should be considering a comprehensive examination of previously passed laws, looking at how they interact with each other, before we move down this path. Having said that, I have probably read the numbers in this place, and obviously we are going to get on with the debate today in relation to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (National Investigative Powers and Witness Protection) Bill 2006 [2007].
The Democrats acknowledge that at least an ancillary aim of this legislation is to harmonise the controlled operations, assumed identities and protection of witness identity regimes across the nation. We consider that national uniformity of such laws is quite a worthy goal, particularly if it actually aids law enforcement officers in combating organised crime and acts of terrorism, which obviously permeate beyond state boundaries. However, the Australian Democrats are concerned that the legislation before us goes well beyond these aims and actually represents another example of an unwarranted attempt to extend the unsupervised powers of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, potentially at the expense of privacy and other rights of Australian citizens.
The Law Council of Australia believes that the manifest need for these extended powers has not been demonstrated and that no further erosion of Australian citizens’ rights should be sanctioned by this parliament. I think this rings true in light of the last few weeks, particularly in the handling of the charges against Dr Haneef. I worry about the impact that that has had on public confidence and I think that is worthy of investigation. But, in relation to the bill, there are alarming aspects to this legislation. I will try and cover several in detail. Like the opposition, the Democrats have amendments, which I do not believe have been circulated, but we do not have a second reading amendment, so I look forward to seeing Senator Ludwig’s on behalf of the ALP.
A ‘controlled operation’ refers to a covert police investigation in which law enforcement officers and civilian informants are authorised to engage in unlawful conduct. Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914 already authorises controlled operations to be undertaken with respect to any serious Commonwealth offence attracting a penalty of over three years imprisonment. Schedule 1 of the bill is based upon model laws developed by the joint working group of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australian Police Ministers Council. The intent of the model laws is to harmonise controlled operations, assumed identities and protection of witness identity regimes in Australia. What we have already seen across the past decade is a systematic expansion of offences to which controlled operations provisions apply.
When first introduced in 1996, the powers were confined to a limited number of drug importation offences. In 2001, an amendment was sought via the Measures to Combat Serious and Organised Crime Bill to expand their application to any Commonwealth offence, with little or no justification. Quite rightly, the proposed expansion was met with significant opposition and, based on recommendations from the legal and constitutional committee, the powers were substantially watered down. Further amendments were passed in 2004 to allow controlled operations in respect of a state offence that has a serious federal aspect and that has the characteristics of a ‘serious Commonwealth offence’.
In this bill, the effect of section 15GE is to remove the element of seriousness from the sorts of offences that will fall within the ambit of a controlled operation authorisation. This will mean that any offence carrying a three-year term of imprisonment is captured, including relatively minor offences, such as those dealing with damage to Commonwealth property. Further, the bill will allow controlled operations to be expanded to an offence prescribed by regulation, effectively allowing any Commonwealth offence to be subject to a controlled operation authorisation in the future. The justification from the government is that the expansion of powers is required to allow law enforcement agencies to deal with emerging categories of crime and in the interests of national harmonisation, yet we have been offered no real justification, or evidence for that matter, that suggests that the present powers are insufficient. Again, this kind of response sadly reflects the current environment where law enforcement agencies are beginning to regard extraordinary powers as ordinary tools of law enforcement. Our environment is changing completely. The Democrats consider that the range of offences in relation to which controlled operations may be authorised is already, arguably, too broad and that no further expansion, as outlined in this legislation, is necessary.
Division 2 of schedule 1 of the bill deals with authorisation of unlawful conduct. Under the present regime, only designated high-ranking officers within law enforcement and intelligence agencies may hear and grant an application to conduct a controlled operation. The Democrats have concerns about the extent to which these internal authorisations lack adequate safeguards to guard against the misuse of the power to confer immunity for unlawful conduct, and we consider that there is room for a greater form of scrutiny, particularly independent scrutiny. We believe that is entirely desirable.
In the Senate committee inquiry into the 2001 bill, I note that the Victorian Bar stated:
Legislation which would in effect allow a branch of the executive to choose which laws to enforce, and which laws to break, substantially diminishes the potential for independent judicial control of the exercise of police power.
Historically, the judiciary has sought to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice by insisting that those who enforce the law respect it. It has defended the right of the courts to protect the integrity of their processes by not granting implicit approval for wrongdoing by admitting evidence obtained through unlawful conduct by police. Under the regime proposed by the legislation, a high-ranking authorising officer will be able to issue a very broad authorisation of unlawful conduct and delegate effective responsibility for nominating who is authorised to engage in unlawful conduct, including, potentially, civilians and themselves. That is, there is the possibility to delegate that to an authorising operational officer. This represents a departure not only from the Crimes Act provision but also from the model laws upon which the bill is purportedly based.
The bill does not require the enforcement officer to have regard to the same criteria as the authorising officer, which are designed to ensure that controlled operations are only authorised in the most serious of cases and, of course, to minimise the risk of entrapment and civilian participation. The government justifies the vesting of extraordinary powers in ordinary law enforcement officers on the basis of the need for—and Senator Ludwig talked about this—greater flexibility during operations. The Democrats do not consider that this notion of greater flexibility is sufficient justification to empower ordinary law enforcement officers to authorise civilians to engage in criminal conduct with impunity, particularly when it comes in the absence of clearly defined standards. It will do nothing to enhance public confidence in the administration of justice.
The Democrats are also concerned that the bill removes any independent scrutiny of applications to extend a controlled operation and that it has the potential to allow controlled operations to continue indefinitely. Under the Crimes Act, controlled operations can be authorised for a maximum period of six months, and an extension beyond three months must be reviewed by a member of the AAT. Given that we believe there is no substantive evidence that the current six-month period is inadequate, the Democrats are opposing the extension of this time, particularly if it comes without any definitive cap. Controlled operations should not be used as de facto intelligence-gathering exercises and should be subject to clear time limitations. Any application to extend a controlled operation should be made to the AAT and be accompanied by detailed information regarding the success or otherwise of the operation to date, the need for an extension of time and any adverse impact that the operation has had on competing public interests.
The bill purports to extend protection from criminal responsibility and indemnity from civil liability to civilian participants in a controlled operation. In other words, the bill will allow police to authorise criminals to continue to undertake criminal activity. The Criminal Bar Association considers that proposals to allow police to authorise criminals to continue to undertake criminal activity are a ‘recipe for disaster’ which will result in police favouring particular groups of criminals for use in operations over other groups of criminals and police being subject to manipulation by criminal elements and corruption and would yield evidence of arguably minimal value.
The Democrats consider that the risk foreshadowed by the CBA is greater when the power to authorise controlled operations is devolved to investigating officers who are directly involved in the conduct of those operations. If informants are to be granted protection from liability, the power to authorise controlled operations must remain with high-ranking officials who are removed from the operations and must be based on clear and definite criteria that adequately balance the benefit of the proposed controlled operation with any potential adverse impact upon the public interest or the perception of the administration of justice.
The bill seeks to replace part IAC of the Crimes Act with new part IACA dealing with assumed identities and witness protection. Once again, it is relating to the argument for the need for harmonisation of these laws. The aim of the part is to protect the true identity of covert operatives who give evidence in court, including foreign law enforcement officers and civilians, via the issue of a witness protection certificate, or WPC, as you have already heard outlined by Senator Ludwig, that is issued by the chief officer of a relevant law enforcement agency. The decision to issue a WPC is not appealable or capable of being called into question by a court. While the WPC will contain sworn information about the operative, including the details of any previous charges or adverse findings of credibility, the true identity of the witness will only be disclosed in extremely limited circumstances, and that is when a court is satisfied that there is evidence that, if accepted, would substantially call into question the operative’s credibility. In the view of the Law Council, it is highly unlikely that such information will allow defence counsel to properly test the credibility of a witness whose identity is protected by a WPC. Without access to the true identity of the witness in the first place, it will be impossible for the defence to determine whether any issues of credibility may arise.
I note that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs noted that there was no justification for the court to be denied the opportunity to consider the matter of witness identity on its merits and the committee emphasised that the rights of each party must be respected for justice to be done and to be seen to be done, which is best achieved through leaving intact the court’s discretion to balance the various interests at stake in individual cases—yet the committee made no recommendation to amend the bill in this regard. The Democrats like the model that has been put forward by the Australian Law Reform Commission, which would place the authority to issue a WPC in the hands of a court after it conducts an independent and thorough assessment of the competing public interests.
In relation to delayed notification search warrants, schedule 2 of the bill, which deals with delayed notification and what have been called ‘sneak and peek’ warrants, will grant the power to secretly enter, search and seize property. It does represent a pretty blatant invasion of privacy and a clear interference with an individual’s right to security on their premises. The introduction of such extraordinary powers should only be tolerated in the most extreme circumstances and even then be subject to the strictest conditions. While the power to authorise similar warrants exists at a state level, that power, as I understand it, is restricted to only the investigation or prevention of terrorist acts. This bill purports to expand those powers to the federal agencies in respect of a range of less serious Commonwealth offences. It also allows the renewal of the warrant for a potentially indefinite period.
The explanatory memorandum provides no clear rationale for the introduction of such extreme powers, nor does it explain or justify why extraordinary existing powers to search and monitor individuals have proven insufficient. The Democrats have made the point repeatedly in the past that, if government comes to the chamber with a good argument on this or other matters, a good case to show why current laws are inadequate, then we will listen. But, as I have said repeatedly, current laws are in many respects quite extraordinary and extreme in some circumstances, and I think this is one case where the moves in the legislation are incredibly concerning.
The expansion of powers of the Australian Crime Commission is another element of this bill about which we are concerned. We believe schedule 3 of the bill purports to expand the coercive powers of the ACC beyond reasonable limits. In particular, the bill seeks to abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination by requiring persons to provide a written statement potentially containing self-incriminating information and effectively requiring a person to make a case against themselves. A person under investigation should not be burdened with the ACC’s legwork and should be able to choose to provide evidence via oral testimony and document production if preferred.
The ACC will also be able to use information obtained in such circumstances as evidence in a prosecution for previously providing false information. The Democrats do not consider that the threat of prosecution based on compulsory testimony will engender candour in suspects, and we consider that it will do nothing to further the cause of the ACC in obtaining accurate and relevant information. In some respects, this seems a little like deja vu or groundhog day. I know that over the years we have had comparable debates with the precursor of the ACC, the National Crime Authority, and others, but we believe this is an area in which this legislation goes too far.
Alarmingly, this bill also seeks to restrict access to a legal practitioner for persons giving evidence under compulsion, by granting an ACC officer the discretion to allow an interview to continue when a preferred legal practitioner must be excluded from an interview. The rationale offered, as I understand from the Attorney-General’s Department, is to prevent the safeguard of a legal practitioner being used as a delaying tactic. To me that seems a little flimsy, at best, as a rationale. As the Senate committee noted in the report, the right to legal representation is a fundamental one and is especially important where, as is the case here, refusal by a witness to answer a question results in a penalty. The discretion to allow an adjournment should be removed.
As I have outlined, dealing with specific aspects of this bill, the Democrats are genuinely concerned about the attempt by government to make these changes—again, to another piece of legislation—in a raft, a myriad, of laws dealing with crime prevention and antiterrorism law. The Australian Democrats will be moving amendments to ameliorate what we consider to be the worst aspects of this legislation. It does need significant amendment, and without that significant amendment we will not be supporting this legislation.
I also put on notice to the chamber the fact that the Democrats will be seeking a select committee, a balanced Senate committee that will examine the comprehensive pieces of legislation that this Senate and the parliament have passed over the last four or five years. I think that is called for, and it is particularly timely at the moment, in an attempt to restore public confidence in the antiterrorism regime that we have in this country.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-07,"—Law and order auctions are a feature of state politics: Labor and Liberals compete on who can announce more funding for police and prisons and who can hand out tougher sentences or be stronger on tackling crime. It is never very edifying to watch party spokespeople compete to make the pages of the tabloid media in this way, and it certainly does not make good policy.
This inflationary dynamic of law and order policy in Australia has been accelerated by the declaration of the war on terrorism, and we are now seeing it migrate into the federal arena. Just as we saw with the Tampa, the government has tried to use national security and the pursuit of Dr Haneef as political tools to ramp up fear. The appalling debacle of this latest chapter in the government’s serial abuse of its extensive security powers should give pause to any further consideration of additional powers for security forces, but instead the government is pursuing further powers, an extension of powers, for the Australian Federal Police in the Crimes Legislation Amendment (National Investigative Powers and Witness Protection) Bill 2006 [2007].
Unfortunately—although it remains to be seen—this may be another instance in which the opposition joins the government and disappoints people in its lack of courage to oppose the erosion of our civil rights. We have seen in the past that new proposals from the government in relation to national security have been met with a resounding ‘me too!’ from the opposition. There is plenty of opportunity for this bipartisan assault on human rights when security agencies have a voracious appetite when it comes to requesting additional powers. The Law Council summarised the problem in this way in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this legislation, when they said:
... in recent years a culture has developed which has increasingly inhibited the type of detailed and robust debate which, in a healthy democracy, ought to precede any extension of Executive power or interference with previously entrenched rights and liberties.
5.        The pattern which has emerged is as follows:
           (a)           Typically, over objection and with reticence, extraordinary powers are granted to law enforcement agencies in order to meet what is asserted to be an extraordinary risk to the community. It is acknowledged that the exercise of those powers will involve an infringement of rights or invasion of privacy but is said to be justified by a countervailing threat to the community.
           (b)           Later, the law enforcement agency which has been the recipient of those powers reports that the powers have assisted greatly in combating crime. No one is in a position to argue whether the same result might have been achieved by a different method. No one, other than the law enforcement agency itself, is privy to detailed information about the day-to-day use of the power and its implications.
           (c)           Rights which are infringed in the process of exercising the power are largely invisible. This is both because those rights are regarded as ceasing to exist from the moment they are traded off in favour of more efficient law enforcement and because it is assumed that only a certain criminal class is materially affected.
The Australian Greens, however, believe it is the parliament’s responsibility to not only protect citizens from crime but also protect citizens from the overreaching powers of an unaccountable state and its agencies. We share the concerns of the Law Council of Australia, who are opposed to this never-ending parade of new powers for security agencies. Like the Law Council of Australia, we are opposed to this bill that is the latest step in the extension of such new powers. It is a question of balance and accountability, and there is no balance and accountability in this legislation. Amongst other things, this legislation: creates ‘sneak and peak’ warrants that enable police to search people’s homes without them knowing about it; extends the use of controlled operations in which undercover police and informants are able to break the law to potentially cover all Commonwealth offences; fails to provide independent and external approval processes for controlled operations; removes the role of AAT members in approving the continuation of controlled operations beyond three months; removes the maximum time limit on controlled operations; extends the protection from criminal and civil liabilities to civil informants who participate in controlled operations; reduces reporting requirements for controlled operations; extends powers for police confiscation of electronic equipment such as mobile phones, thereby avoiding the requirement to obtain a telecommunications interception warrant; and extends the coercive powers of the Australian Crime Commission.
The Greens are concerned about all these aspects of this bill. They increase powers without justification and they remove accountability and oversight of these powers. In particular, the introduction of the delayed notification warrants, or the ‘sneak and peak’ powers, is a major departure from basic civil rights. I want to focus my remarks on those aspects of the bill. For centuries, the English common law, based on Roman principles, held that a man’s home is his castle and that an infringement on a person’s property whether by the state or by individuals must have significant limits. This has its most well known expression in the United States Fourth Amendment, which states:
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated; and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
The so-called ‘castle doctrine’ has also been an important part of Australia’s common law. This bill will violate that doctrine giving the Federal Police extraordinary new powers to secretly enter, search and even take things from people’s homes. This is an enormous encroachment on Australians’ civil rights and should not be supported by this parliament.
Currently, if an officer wants to search a person’s home or property, they must identify themselves to the occupier, give them a copy of the search warrant, allow them to observe the search and provide them with a receipt for anything confiscated under the warrant. These rights enable a person subject to the warrant to challenge the validity of the issuing or execution of the warrant and they enable a person to call a lawyer who can be present during a search. These rights are very important rights designed to ensure equality before the law and to provide protections from abuse of state power. They are a fundamental check and balance on our criminal justice system. But this bill throws those rights out the window and replaces them with a regime that would be familiar to anyone who had lived in East Germany or other totalitarian societies.
Schedule 2 of the bill introduces a new division into part IAA of the Crimes Act that sets out various powers of police, including those in relation to search warrants. The new division will create delayed notification search warrants, or covert search warrants, and an approval regime. These ‘sneak and peak’ powers will enable police to obtain a warrant to search premises covertly and seize or copy items without informing the occupier for up to six months or longer in certain circumstances. Such powers are a major intrusion on the privacy of citizens and their right to security in their home and property. Such powers should only be available in extraordinary circumstances and in a carefully circumscribed manner. The secrecy inherent in the powers means that the capacity of an individual who is subject to such a warrant has virtually no capacity to ensure that such powers are used lawfully and in justifiable circumstances. The government has made no attempt either in its second reading speech or in its explanatory memorandum to justify why such new powers are needed. As the Law Council say in their submission:
It is not enough to claim, without more, that it will greatly assist police. The removal of the need for warrants entirely would also achieve this aim. Likewise it is not enough to couch the proposed new provisions in the language of balance and to offer assurances by reference to accountability and oversight mechanisms.
The Law Council goes on—and the Greens agree:
As a first step, the agencies which seek the creation of this extraordinary power, must establish, in precise terms, the need for this covert warrant regime, and the public interest goal it serves. Only then can a proper discussion follow about whether the asserted need greatly outweighs the obvious and substantial risk to individual rights and whether that risk can be sufficiently safeguarded against with appropriate accountability mechanisms.
Security and police agencies already have a raft of powers to address serious crime, including terrorism. These include: controlled operations where undercover police and informants can engage in unlawful conduct; warrants to secretly enter property and install surveillance devices; tapping of telephones and other communication devices; and the coercive powers of the Australian Crime Commission to compel a person to provide self-incriminating evidence and the extensive powers of ASIO, including the capacity to secretly enter homes and property, and collect intelligence. Given these powers, it is incumbent on the government and police to explain why they think that these powers are inadequate for the job. To date they have not done so. Just because these powers, which in many cases also violate a person’s privacy, have been enacted is not a justification for further powers. Rather, they make the requirement for justification on the part of the government and police all the more compelling.
Where are the holes in these existing powers that make these ‘sneak and peek’ laws so necessary? Where is the evidence that criminals or terrorists are getting away because the powers in this bill do not currently exist? It is also not enough for the government to point to state laws in relation to covert search warrants that relate to terrorism offences that were introduced without justification by Labor state governments. The proposals in this bill go far beyond what is contained in state legislation.
Covert search warrants will be able to be issued in relation to a broad range of offences, including Commonwealth offences that carry penalties of 10 years imprisonment or more, state offences with a federal aspect that also carry 10 years and some terrorism offences and a scattering of other offences that carry less than 10 years, including threatening to cause harm to a public official or using the post to make threats. As the Law Council points out, this is a very broad list of offences, ranging from receiving stolen mail to selling a controlled plant to dishonestly receiving stolen Commonwealth property.
The government and the police have not explained what the rationale is for this hotchpotch of offences or why these powers are needed in each case to adequately investigate the commission of such offences. It seems that the approach has been to come up with the idea for this power and then collect up the greatest pool of offences that could underpin it, giving the police free rein.
A similar approach seems to be adopted in the bill in relation to the length of time for a covert search warrant. The existing warrants in division 2 of the Crimes Act are allowed a maximum duration of seven days. This bill will allow covert warrants to endure for 30 days. Once again, no explanation has been provided for why the length of time should increase fourfold.
Central to the Greens’ concerns regarding these ‘sneak and peek’ powers is the length of time before police are required to inform a person that their property has been searched. In fact, in certain circumstances the bill would allow police to delay informing a person indefinitely. In other words, police could secretly search a person’s home or property without ever informing them that they had done so. In the first instance, police who are issued with a covert search warrant are able to delay notification for up to six months. However, on application to a nominated member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a judge, this can be extended twice for another six months. After 18 months, with the approval of the minister, a judge or a nominated member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal can extend the delay even further.
If you accept that such covert warrants are necessary, how can such a length of time be justified? These warrants are not meant to be used for collecting intelligence but rather for the investigation of offences. The length of time of such warrants plus the allowable further delays mean that inevitably they will be used for intelligence-gathering and fishing expeditions rather than for the prosecution or prevention of offences. No guidance is provided to AAT members or judges about how to decide on extending a warrant, except that after 18 months exceptional circumstances must exist. The inference that one could draw, therefore, is that up to 18 months delay is almost automatic and certainly does not require any exceptional circumstances to exist. A further major flaw that has been identified by the Law Council is the lack of any requirement that a person be notified of the covert search warrant even if they have been charged with an offence.
In summary, the time frames involved seem designed to enable police to build a case against an individual without that individual having the capacity to challenge evidence or prepare for their defence. This is a fundamental attack on a person’s right to due process and a fair trial.
Before finishing my remarks, I want to mention a further two aspects of the bill in relation to covert search warrants—the ‘sneak and peek’ powers—which deserve the Senate’s attention. Legal professional privilege is essential to the rule of law. It underpins equality before the law and a person’s right to a fair trial. Currently, if a person’s home is searched by police, they are in a position to make a claim for legal professional privilege for documents or things that police attempt to seize. These documents are then not able to be examined by police until the issue of privilege has been resolved by a court. This regime of covert search warrants will ride roughshod over the principle and the practice of legal professional privilege. Police now will be able to confiscate documents, regardless of the privilege that might attach to some items, because a person or their lawyer will not be aware that the search has occurred or that the seizure of documents has occurred.
Another concerning feature of this bill relates to what are designated as ‘adjoining premises’, which are able to be entered for the purpose of entering the targeted property. An owner or occupier of an adjoining property is also subject to the same delay in notification as the subject of the warrant—that is, they may not be told for six, 12 or 18 months or more that the police secretly entered their property. Once again, this is a significant derogation from a citizen’s right to privacy and property that has not been justified by the government or by the police.
The Greens do not support these provisions or the others that I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks. The government had the opportunity to take on board the concerns of the Law Council and others about this bill, and it could have modified its provisions. In its present form the bill is unbalanced. It gives too much unaccountable power to law enforcement agencies, and it tramples on fundamental civil rights. Given the circumstances that we have seen in recent weeks in relation to the case against Dr Haneef, now is not the time to be giving these extraordinary new powers, which trample on some fundamental tenets of our civil liberties in this country, to the Australian Federal Police. Therefore the Greens will not be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—I want to thank all senators for their contributions to this debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (National Investigative Powers and Witness Protection) Bill 2006 [2007]. The bill makes important amendments to the law relating to the investigation of criminal activity and the protection of witnesses. The majority of proposed amendments that I will be moving later on, when this bill comes on, come in response to recommendations by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and I thank that committee for their comprehensive report.
I would like to respond to a few of the items mentioned in today’s debate. By advancing this bill, the Australian government is fulfilling the government’s election commitment to have a national model of legislation on assumed identities, controlled operations and the protection of witness identity. The learned senator on the opposition side with custody of this matter, Senator Ludwig, made the point that we are going to leave open the possibility of the government adding additional offences to schedules by regulation. I am surprised that the learned senator has not read the government’s amendments, because 15GE(3)—
—I have now you circulated it.
—Good, but I think you might have had them before you made the reference—
—No.
—And if you did not, it was not our responsibility. But the point is you can see that the amendments do—
—I saw.
—Yes, that is good. I would like to hear you say that so that you can correct the record of all the things that you said about what the government is seeking to do in regard to that which are clearly incorrect. I suppose that just highlights one of the important things that people should understand with respect to these sorts of powers, which is, of course, that these are not powers that the opposition relate to or understand. Indeed, we have had 10 years for the opposition to come forward with any proposal, particularly after September 11, to deal with national security and, of course, all we have is a vacuum of inane carping with no leadership and no policy whatsoever.
This bill addresses problems relating to the conduct of organised criminal networks which operate with ease and dexterity across jurisdictional borders, including international borders and state borders. Contemporary policing requires law enforcement agencies to undertake investigations that extend beyond the boundaries of any one jurisdiction. To address this increasing threat, it is critical that the Australian government adopt this model legislation. The creation of a national set of investigative powers facilitates seamless law enforcement across the jurisdictions. I pause to state that for many years now the states have had late notification search warrant powers, all of which have gone unheralded and uncommented upon. But, of course, when the federal government seeks to enact such powers, the opposition suggests there is something wrong in that. Indeed, the playing of politics and point scoring with matters as important as this is something which I think the opposition can take absolutely no credit in.
The addition of delayed notification search warrants also brings an important investigative power to police that will enable them to adequately respond to, prevent and investigate terrorist activity and other serious offences. The opposition says that the definition of serious offences in sections 8 and 9 is too broad. Of course, we know that the definition commences with offences that carry 10 years or more imprisonment—given that tag, title and qualification, they are obviously very serious offences. Also the defining section of serious offences says sections 8 and 9 of the Crimes Act—foreign incursion and recruitment—which, of course, relates to persons who engage in hostile activities with the intention of overthrowing a foreign state or engaging in armed hostilities in the foreign state. I would have thought those provisions were very serious, but the opposition says they are too broad. I would have thought that it was a very serious offence if we had a group of people onshore in Australia seeking to overthrow a government of another country. It is interesting that the opposition cannot see that.
The definition section of serious offences goes on to talk about sections 20 and 21 of the Charter of the United Nations, and those sections deal with wrongfully dealing in freezable assets. The United Nations can freeze assets of companies breaching trade sanctions and undertaking unauthorised activity in circumstances where there are human rights abuses, and the UN can prohibit dealing with them. But the opposition says, ‘Oh no, that’s all right; that’s too broad.’ I would have thought that, given what we have seen with respect to a whole group of matters of recent times in breaching prohibitions on trade sanctions, it would not have been too broad.
Further, the definition sets out serious offences as set out in sections 147.2, 147.2(3), 474.11(2) and 474.15(2) of the Criminal Code as serious offences. Those offences are offences related to threatening to cause harm to a public official. How on earth could that be too broad? It is patently obvious that the opposition is soft on crime here or has not read or understood the bill. A further serious offence set out is using a postal service to make a threat, again a very serious matter. Also, a serious offence is using a carriage service to make a threat. Police have indicated that a delayed notification search warrant will be particularly beneficial during an investigation into such offences when the threat has originated from a syndicate—for example, an extremist political group—where police do not want to alert the syndicate that they have been identified. These are matters of logic that flow with any understanding of the way police conduct operations. Sadly, the opposition in this chamber has no real understanding and, of course, this is not the core understanding of the Australian Labor Party—not that they have much understanding of anything at all. But the point here is that to say that these definitions are too broad is to completely misconceive what is sought to be done by these matters. I would like to hear Senator Ludwig say on the record again that these matters are too broad, because we are talking about people-trafficking, sexual slavery and a whole host of other similar offences which are caught by the definition section.
At the end of the day, these definitions and these police powers are vitally needed. If you had any grasp or understanding of the way the police operate with respect to outlaw motorcycle gangs and organised crime in circumstances where these criminals have diverse assets and numerous places from which they can conduct their operations, particularly clandestine drug laboratories, you would understand that to raid or search one of those premises would, if you were to provide notice, tip off the broad network. But, of course, it would be too much to ask that the Labor Party understand how police conduct operations. Indeed, to suggest that ACLEI be responsible for Customs again shows a lack of understanding of what it means to have police powers in this country.
ACLEI is responsible for law enforcement integrity, which relates to the Australian Federal Police. Of course, the Australian Federal Police have extensive police powers of arrest and of being able to use lethal force in certain circumstances, and other powers of that nature. Again the opposition sit there, not having provided a single drop of policy on these very important matters, and want to take ACLEI further than it was originally legislated and designed to go. Obviously, in the circumstances of police powers, ACLEI going beyond that function is clearly bad policy.
These powers are important. It is very important that people who criticise them actually understand them and actually relate to why they are being used, and in circumstances where the bill has been read and the safeguards acknowledged. The safeguards here are extensive with respect to reporting from the Ombudsman, with respect to the commissioner granting original position and with respect to a judicial officer or member of the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal granting the warrant in the first instance. These powers have enormous oversight and transparency but are vitally needed—and should be understood by the opposition—in circumstances where there are serious threats from a very dynamic and diverse group of organised criminals and from terrorism. The police need to be able to conduct operations without providing any assistance in the nature of a tip-off or explanation to people who would use such information to avoid prosecution. This bill does all of these things effectively and I commend it to the Senate.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-08-07,"—On 20 June 2007, Senator Humphries asked me about housing affordability and the loss of housing stock in both the Australian Capital Territory and nationally. The figures for housing stock reduction in the ACT given in my answer were correct for the period up to 2005, not since 2005. The Australian government’s draft independent audit of government contributions to housing assistance showed that there were 637 fewer social housing dwellings funded under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement in the Australian Capital Territory between the periods 1996-97 and 2004-05. The report also showed that, nationally, there was a loss of 13 dwellings for the same period.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-08-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
In particular, I would like to take note of the response by Senator Minchin to my question about the negligent way in which he has been performing his duties.
In the Financial Review today is a list of programs that the government has announced since the budget, which is totalling the better part of $8 billion. We have seen that the government is now outspending Labor by a figure of almost three to one. What we have seen, of course, much to the government’s chagrin as shown by the Crosby Textor reports that have been presented by some helpful soul from the government to the Murdoch press, is that this desperate spending binge has not made any serious impact on the government’s popularity, simply because the Australian people are awake to the clever politics that this Prime Minister thought that he had perfected over his long period of time in office.
However, what we have seen is the extraordinary running-down of the standards of professional conduct within the government itself. In May, this minister told us that he saw his role as being the custodian of taxpayers’ money, whose job it was to make sure that the money was spent wisely. But when it came to the spending of $10 billion, costings were presented to the public which basically reflected a ‘back of the envelope’ approach that had been taken. We saw a similar case in regard to the Northern Territory intervention program, where the program had grown from some tens of millions of dollars to $587 million a year. And, again, no serious action was taken by the Department of Finance and Administration to cost those initiatives.
Now we are seeing a proposal for a takeover of the Mersey hospital in Tasmania of some hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It has been stated here on a number of occasions this afternoon, even from the government’s own backbencher, Senator Parry, who has said that this would be a disaster. He has reflected the attitude, as I understand it, of many in the local community. If Senator Parry doubts that what I am saying is the case, he has the opportunity, and I would urge Senator Parry, to make a personal explanation. If he says that this is not what his attitude is, if that is not what he is saying, then he can make a personal explanation and correct the record. It has been put in this chamber that that is what you are saying, Senator Parry. So this is your chance. Correct the record. If you have not been saying that this is a disaster—
—I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy President. Should the speaker be talking directly to other senators, or should he be referring his comments through you?
—You should be referring your comments to the chair, Senator Carr.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. At least I am talking to Senator Parry, which is more than this government is doing. If Senator Parry had had his way, he would have explained to the government that their actions were a disaster. What the Burnie City Council is drawing to their attention is that the proposition being advanced is essentially based on polling. It is based on the Textor formula of trying to buy your way back into office. It is not based on any serious analysis of the needs of the region or of the capacity to actually provide services to the people.
This is what the Burnie City Council said:
You can’t possibly try to fractionate the services in a small region like this, it really will spell ultimately the end of Burnie Hospital and probably the end of Mersey.
That is the situation, and Senator Parry acknowledges what I say to be the case. He acknowledges that that is the view that is being expressed by the Liberal Party in the region, but that is not the view, of course, that this government seeks from its own backbench. We have a situation now where this government is being driven by poll desperation. It is a government that will say anything, do anything and spend anything in a desperate bid to cling to office. We have a government that essentially ignores not only its backbench; it ignores its frontbench! It ignores the Minister for Finance and Administration. It basically provides him with the occupation of doormat. In fact, I ask the question of Senator Minchin: how do you pick up your pay every month? How do you pick up your pay when you are treated with such contempt by this Prime Minister? Why is it that you are not doing the job that you said you would do in the Senate?
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Carr has already been reminded that he should address his comments through the chair, and he is addressing them straight to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I ask you to bring him to order.
—Senator Carr, your comments should be directed through the chair.
—Once again, I thank you for your observation, Mr Deputy President. At least I speak to the senator, unlike the rest of the government. He is being ignored, he is being treated with contempt and he is essentially performing the function of the doormat of this government. It is a tragedy to see a person who had such high standards in the past, who explored such very noble sentiments about the role that he was to perform, being treated in such a contemptuous manner. It is very sad that it is the opposition that has to come to his defence. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-08-07,"—If you hang around politics long enough you really do see everything—the great centralising party of Gough Whitlam has become federalist. The Australian Labor Party has become the great champion of states’ rights. Labor is now arguing that the Commonwealth is treading on the sacred rights of the states and territories, as though Commonwealth-state relations are somehow fixed. The truth is that federalism is constantly evolving.
I will let those senators opposite in on a little secret: the Commonwealth actually have no great desire to directly fund state hospitals; we do not have a great desire to put money into schools to pay for carpets, classrooms and air conditioners; we do not have a great desire to intervene in health, education, law and order and housing in the Northern Territory. It is not actually the Commonwealth that is putting the states out of business; it is the states themselves that are putting the state governments out of business. If the states were not abrogating their core responsibilities, if they were not failing to execute their core functions, the Commonwealth would not have to intervene in areas such as the Mersey hospital. We would be quite delighted if state Labor governments looked after their core responsibilities.
But, if a vacuum is created in core services, that vacuum will be filled, and the public quite rightly will ask government to fill that vacuum. We have seen it in the area of schools, where the states do not ensure literacy and numeracy standards. We have seen it in the area of school facilities, where they will not ensure adequate facilities. We have seen it with state governments not ensuring adequate urban water supplies. We have seen it with states not ensuring adequate public hospitals and decent public transport.
Quite clearly, federalism is not working as it should. We as a government did try to breathe new life into federalism. We introduced the GST because the states said that they wanted a secure and growing revenue source. So we give every single dollar to the states and territories. In 2007-08 we will be giving them $41.9 billion. Silly us—the Commonwealth government—we actually thought that this money would give the state and territory governments the freedom and the ability to fund their core services, which is what they were asking for. But the state governments are not doing that and that is why we have had to step into the Northern Territory, the Mersey hospital in Tasmania, and schools: it is because those basic and core services were not being provided.
Labor’s ‘killer’ point today in the debate about the Mersey hospital was costings. They allege that the government had not undertaken costings. As Senator Minchin has said, it is not unusual for prime ministers to announce policy intention and for that to then go through the regular processes of government, including costing by relevant agencies. There is nothing unusual at all about that.
I come back to the point that we will give, in 2007-08, $41.9 billion of GST revenue to the states and territories. Despite that sort of money being in the hands of the states and territories they still cannot provide basic services. Despite the fact that in the five years to 2010-11 the state governments will be borrowing $70 billion—going into debt to the tune of $70 billion—they still cannot afford those basic services. In contrast, we have paid off Labor’s debt, we are running a surplus, we are providing our core federal government services and we are also providing core state government services. What the state governments do, I do not know.
Coming back to the issue of costings, I take a little bit of heart from the fact that Labor are raising the issue of costings. In the 1998, 2001 and 2004 elections we, along with the departments of Treasury and Finance, waited in vain for Labor to submit their policies for costings. In 1998, Labor submitted only 36 per cent of their commitments for costings and, of those 36 per cent, 100 per cent were submitted too late to be costed by the Finance and Treasury process. In 2001 it was no better. In 2004 it was the same again, with something of the order of 20 significant policies not submitted by Labor for costings. Labor have no interest in transparency, they have no interest in accountability and they do not put their policies in for costing in the election period. We will; we do. (Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-08-07,"—We can feel an election in the air at the moment, because, six weeks out from the calling of an election, we can start to see the Howard government say and do anything. They have form on this, and they have been building up to a crescendo for quite some time. It is very clear now that the Howard government have one strategy and one strategy only. Fortunately, we do not have to look too far to understand what it is, because most of it was laid out on the front pages of the nation’s newspapers just yesterday. When we look at the tactical, strategic and political spin constructed by Crosby Textor, no less, we see that the Howard government’s pollster has been engaged to do the government’s work. More than anything else, what this tells us is that not only are the Howard government completely void of any true leadership and vision for this country but they need Crosby Textor, like a crutch, to tell them what to do in an election year.
The stakes are always high in an election year. There is no doubt about that. We are always trying to come up with the best polices. But, I have to say, even I was amazed at the bluntness and the completely led-by-the-nose approach of the Howard government in following that Crosby Textor line. Evidence of this is very clear for all of us to see. At the same time this material was leaked, we saw the strategy being played out on the ground. The best example this week is that of blaming the states. There it was from Crosby Textor: ‘Blame the states; good strategy. It will give us some cover.’ And there we had it: the Prime Minister, standing proud and tall, saying, ‘The states are to blame for everything, including interest rates.’ He cannot back away from the fact that there have been eight consecutive interest rate rises in Australia and we are on the verge of a possible ninth. So what does Mr Howard do? He blames the states for this. This is evidence not only that he has lost touch with what working families are going through but also that he is incapable of thinking for himself on how to manage the issues in an election year—and he relies on the crutch of Crosby Textor to tell him to do the latest trick and spin, which is to blame the states.
This amounts to nothing more than a deceitful attitude to the population of this country, because it undermines any claim by the Prime Minister of having leadership and a voice for the future. He is trying to build a campaign around this whole experience thing, but the evidence we now have before us shows that he is incapable of doing that. His attempts to blame the states for interest rate rises come nowhere near passing the believability test for Australia’s families. Everybody knows that interest rates have always been the responsibility of the federal government. I note with interest as well—just to remind people of the rapidly sliding credibility of the Prime Minister, who people now know cannot think for himself and does not have a leadership bone in his body—that he never mentions that when he was Treasurer in the 1980s interest rates hit an all-time high of 22 per cent. So, make no mistake, state governments of all political persuasions have always borrowed for infrastructure—for things like roads, schools, electricity, water and hospitals. And we all know that that lifts the productivity capacity of the economy and puts downward pressure on interest rates. So there is nothing the Prime Minister can say at all to spin this around and suggest that interest rate pressure is coming from the states. He has been discredited by economic commentators. He has been discredited politically. And, thanks to the Crosby Textor argument, he has been discredited—finally—because Australians now know that there is no substance to the Prime Minister.
Concluding on the Mersey hospital circumstance, under the Howard government the Commonwealth’s share of public hospital funding fell from 50 per cent to 45 per cent between 2000 and 2005. In the last health funding agreement with the states, the Commonwealth ripped $1 billion out of public hospital funding, and the government has no strategy to prevent illness and promote health, resulting in 500,000 preventable hospital admissions each year. The shortage of GPs puts immense pressure on public hospitals because of people presenting to emergency. All of these things the Howard government is responsible for, yet the Howard government has done nothing. (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-08-07,"—It is a great pleasure to speak on this particular motion and to ask the question right up front: why was the question asked by a Labor senator from Queensland to our leader in the Senate, Senator Nick Minchin, rather than by a Tasmanian Labor senator? I think I know the answer. The answer is that Labor want to fudge their position. It is very sad and disappointing that federal Labor want to do that. The candidate for the Labor Party in the seat of Braddon is having two bob each way. In fact, it is a really big fudge of his position, and he has been caught out. He has been caught out by Senator Richard Colbeck today. In a statement, he has made it clear that the Labor candidate for Braddon is refusing to commit to a position on the Mersey hospital. It is a downgrading of that hospital by the state Labor government, and the federal Labor candidate will not to commit to that hospital. He will not take a position. We have seen that that hospital will be and is being downgraded by state Labor.
However, in today’s media we note the state Labor member for Braddon, Brenton Best. What does he say about the federal policy? What does he say about the Prime Minister’s announcement of 1 August? He says, ‘Bring it on.’ In today’s Advocate, he said: ‘The Prime Minister, John Howard, should start to roll out his Mersey hospital rescue now.’ He went on to say: ‘I do not think it is a huge challenge. If the money is there, he’—meaning the Prime Minister—’should do it now instead of mucking around until July next year.’ That is one of the candidates who have the guts to stand up and express their position. But, again, Sid Sidebottom, who is the federal Braddon candidate for Labor, simply does not have the guts to nail his colours to the mast—unlike our Liberal member for Braddon, Mark Baker.
Fascinatingly, a former state Labor candidate, now mayor of the Latrobe City Council, Mike Gaffney, has an opinion piece in the Advocate today. In it he says:
Congratulations to Mark Baker and his staff for their efforts which have surely put the eyes of Australian on the Mersey Community Hospital in our municipality.
The mayor supports the decision to retain services at the Mersey hospital. He opposes the views of Lara Giddings and the state Labor government. So there is a mishmash of opinions between state Labor and federal Labor in Tasmania. Yes, the Prime Minister’s commitment is categorical and clear. In fact, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, whom I spoke to last night, is in Tasmania today outlining his views and his plans for the Mersey Community Hospital, supporting Mark Baker and seeking information and advice from the state government. In fact, the minister had a meeting earlier today with the Minister for Health and Human Services, Lara Giddings. I can advise the Senate that the feedback that I have is that the state Labor government, and Ms Giddings in particular, has been unhelpful. In terms of her approach to providing information, the meeting has been very limp and dilatory. Despite a genuine effort and an offer from the Australian government to put $45 million or thereabouts on the table, the response has been dilatory at best and most definitely unhelpful. In my view, it is really a matter of priorities as to how they wish to get the money.
Let us look at the big picture. They have $700 million to run public hospitals in Tasmania. That was increased by $220 million, so it is now $920 million over a five-year period. That is a 17 per cent increase in real terms over that period. In addition to that, you have a $117 million GST windfall. The money is there; it is a matter of priorities. What are they doing with that money? I want the state Labor government to lay out the plans for the extra $45 million. What are they going to do with that money? I know that Ben Quinn, the federal Liberal candidate for the Lyons electorate, wants that money spent, as do I, at Rosebery and Ouse in those hospitals that need it so much. Those communities are screaming out for it and the federal Labor member down there has done very little to support those communities. Ben Quinn, on the other hand, has done a great deal and I commend him and congratulate him. (Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-08-07,"—The answers given by the various members of the government today reflect the core issue that we are struggling with on a daily basis in this place. There are so many issues that demand and require a cooperative relationship between state and federal governments. The need to work together to effectively fund and come up with a transparent response to the issue has been transcended today into the same old model responses.
The government’s response is, firstly, do not listen to the question; just give the answer written on the little piece of paper in front of you. We have heard today what that piece of paper says. I do not pay much attention to media leaks—they happen all the time. Certainly, over the last few days there has been considerable media attention to a plan supposedly that has been put out within the Liberal government containing concerns about how they are moving towards this election. We all know it is going to happen soon and there have been quite significant leaks in the media about what the government’s model will be as we lead into the next election. Their model is very clear: attack the states at every opportunity, blame the states for all problems and talk about state finances, state leadership and state policies but do not talk about the federal government’s responsibilities in this process. We saw this today all the way through question time: there was detailed analysis of various state budgets. But the government’s responses only went across the top, with a cursory look at selected areas, various state budgets and the amount of lending and processes that have gone on.
We can talk about that all day, but that is not our job. Our job is to look at how, as part of the federal parliament, we can most effectively deal with the issues for which we are responsible. That does not mean allocating blame, not listening to what the core issues are and just dumping the messages that make the most effective media grab. Also we have returned to exactly the same old process of trotting out links of union thuggery. Again, Minister Abetz waved around three pieces of paper that impugned various people and talked about processes within the Labor Party including our very transparent and known links with the union movement. There is no argument about the fact that there are links between the Australian Labor Party and the union movement. But is it a really effective response to a question that does not mention those issues to wave paper around and cause fear, division and antagonism? Once again, the response was to go for the individual, go for the person and attack their credibility. That is not an effective answer to any question, not a process for moving forward and not an explanation of a policy development but rather a quick, easy attack to which we are all supposed to sit on this side of the chamber and say: ‘That’s got us. We can’t respond to that. We may as well go home.’
We have this ongoing process such that, when questions are asked, it is immediately an opportunity for someone to attack. People have asked quite clear questions about detail of policy, detail of funding and in particular what is happening in what should be a cooperative arrangement between state and federal governments. They were clear questions of meeting the demands of health care and education and, in particular, we were talking about what is happening in the Northern Territory at the moment with the major expenditure that is going on there. When people asked questions about detail, funding and expenditure across the period of time, the response was not to answer the question or respond to the requirements of those questions but rather to come up with a glib response which automatically blames the Territory government and does not look at our collective responsibility.
Much has been said about the environment in which we are operating now as we move towards an election. So many things will be coloured by people’s attention; they will try to grab the media and try to grab whatever small moment of attention they can claim. Through that process, we must be clear that, when there is a request for information, there is no attempt to hide. There should be a simple understanding that, when questions are asked, there is a need for an answer. There may not be agreement in the response but at least we should be able to get detailed costings and a detailed understanding rather than just being caught up in some ongoing debate about which side is stronger, bigger or greater than the other.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-08-07,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
APEC Public Holiday Bill 2007
Appropriation (Northern Territory National Emergency Response) Bill (No. 1) 2007-2008
Appropriation (Northern Territory National Emergency Response) Bill (No. 2) 2007-2008
Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Northern Territory National Emergency Response and Other Measures) Bill 2007
Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007
Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Payment Reform) Bill 2007.
I table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—
STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2007 SPRING SITTINGS
APEC Public Holiday Bill 2007

Purpose of the Bill

The bill ensures that all federal system employees who work in the local government areas in which the APEC public holiday on 7 September 2007 is to be observed, will be entitled a paid day off on that public holiday.  On 4 July 2007, the Industrial and Other Legislation Amendment (APEC Public Holiday) Act 2007 (the NSW Act) was enacted by the NSW Parliament.  The NSW Act deems 7 September 2007 as a public holiday under State industrial instruments for NSW employees who work in the local government areas in which the APEC public holiday is to be observed and would otherwise be required to work on that day.
To the extent possible, the bill mirrors the approach taken in the NSW Act.  It applies only to those federal system employees working in areas in which the APEC public holiday is to be observed, and who are not covered by the statutory minimum public holiday entitlement in Part 12, Division 2 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.  For this reason, the legislation applies only to employees covered by pre-reform certified agreements, pre-reform Australian Workplace Agreements, s 170MX awards, preserved State agreements and transitional awards and whose instrument does not provide for public holiday entitlements on that day.

Reasons for Urgency

The bill relates specifically to public holiday entitlements on the APEC public holiday and therefore must be in place before the APEC public holiday on 7 September 2007. The bill will need to be introduced and passed by 16 August 2007.
Social Security And Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Payment Reform) Bill 2007
Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007
Families, Community Services And Indigenous Affairs And Other Legislation Amendment (Northern Territory National Emergency Response and Other Measures) Bill 2007
Appropriation (Northern Territory National Emergency Response) Bill (No. 1) 2007-2008
Appropriation (Northern Territory National Emergency Response) Bill (No. 2) 2007-2008

Purpose of the Bills

The package of bills will:
provide the legislation for new national welfare measures to help children at risk of neglect, or who are not enrolled at school or adequately attending school, by establishing a national income management regime, under which part of a person’s payment will be used to pay the priority needs of that person, their partner and their children, without reducing overall payments;
establish an income management regime that applies in respect of people on certain welfare payments in the Northern Territory, as part of the Commonwealth’s Northern Territory National Emergency Response, and in Cape York;
provide the remaining legislation in relation to the Australian Government’s response to the national emergency confronting the welfare of Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory, including restrictions on alcohol, bans on prohibited pornographic material, acquisition of certain leases, provision for government retention of interest in buildings and infrastructure constructed or upgraded on Aboriginal land using government funds and certain changes to the provisions governing access to Aboriginal land; and
provide Supplementary Appropriation Bills that request legislative authority for further expenses to be incurred in 2007-2008.

Reasons for Urgency

The impact of sexual abuse on Indigenous children, families and communities is a most serious issue requiring decisive and prompt action.  To protect children and put an end to the dysfunction of communities requires a national emergency response.
Early passage would secure the early implementation of these important measures to help ensure that children receive appropriate care and attend school.  It would also secure the emergency response necessary in relation to the Australian Government’s response to the national emergency confronting the welfare of Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory, including by allowing funds to be made available to agencies.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-07,"—I seek leave to take note of one of the documents that was just tabled: the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the legislation dealing with the citizenship test.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I was involved in the Senate inquiry into the citizenship test. We heard from a range of witnesses—in fact, quite a large number of witnesses. Over 50 submissions were made to the inquiry and a number of witnesses appeared before the committee. The committee heard from those witnesses a number of concerns about this legislation. Firstly, there were arguments put forward by a number of organisations that the bill was not needed. Their view is that the existing citizenship laws are working extraordinarily well and that the government has not made a case for why there needs to be the change that is proposed in the legislation.
As part of that discussion, there was no additional justification provided by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship when it appeared before the committee. There was reference to the fact that there had been consultation—we were all aware of that—and to the fact that citizenship tests exist in other countries, but simply because it is done in other countries is not a justification for why we should do it. In fact, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship was not able to provide any information to the Senate committee about ways in which a citizenship test had assisted with the project of improving the cohesiveness of society in any of the countries to which it pointed as examples of countries which have citizenship tests. Indeed, the committee heard evidence from people who pointed out that perhaps, rather than them adding to the cohesiveness of societies, they had done the opposite. One example that a witness pointed to was from the United Kingdom. That witness spoke about the London bombings and the fact that the people involved in that act were indeed British citizens and may well have been subject to and have passed the UK citizenship test. There was a concern from a number of witnesses—in fact, all of them that I can recall apart from those from the department—about there not being a need for introducing this citizenship test.
There was, beyond that, a concern that the test itself would, rather than helping to assist with improving the cohesiveness of society, do the opposite and be divisive in setting up a mechanism by which some people would be seen to have passed and some people would be seen to have failed. There was one witness, an educator, who talked about this and said: ‘Tests have been developed to gate-keep. That is what they are there for.’ That is a concern that the Australian Greens share about this proposed citizenship test—that it will see the community divided between those who are seen to be deserving and those who are not. This was also a concern raised by FECCA—the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia. They were concerned that the existence of a citizenship test would prevent some people from choosing to make an application to become a citizen. They talked about it creating a two-tiered society through the division that it would create within society. Other witnesses put forward similar concerns.
There was another witness who said that she was worried that it would disenfranchise, disengage and marginalise people and the consequences of that could be to do exactly the opposite of what the test aspires to achieve. There was quite a lot of discussion in the committee about the test as proposed by the government not meeting the government’s own objectives that it outlined in the second reading speech by the minister on this legislation about improving the cohesiveness of society. As I mentioned, some concerns were that a citizenship test would, rather than improving cohesiveness, actually promote divisiveness and discourage people from putting in applications to become Australian citizens.
The other issue that the committee heard about was English language teaching. The government has put forward that the test is not only a citizenship test but an English language test as well and that one of the government’s other objectives is improving the English language skills of migrants. My office has been involved in looking through the information from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Australian Bureau of Statistics about the English language skills of migrants in Australia. We found that they are extraordinarily good and that they have improved over the last 10 years. We have had such an improvement in the English language skills of migrants in Australia that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has actually had to restructure the way that it measures people’s English language proficiency. The English language skills of migrants over the last 10 years have improved so dramatically that the bottom two categories are not useful for the department anymore in assessing people’s English language skills. Far from the picture which the government has sought at various times to paint for us that the English language skills of migrants is an issue that needs to be improved, we have seen over the last 10 years of this government a massive improvement in English language skills.
The committee also heard the concerns that people have about the impact that this citizenship test could have on existing English language programs. The concern put forward—again, by educators—was that, when you put in place a test, teachers teach so that students will pass the test. The concern is that, if we impose a test, the effectiveness of existing English language programs—which require expansion and if we actually wanted to improve migrants’ English language skills the way to achieve it would be by investing in and expanding the English language programs that are available—will be undermined. Rather than teaching people the English language skills that they need to thrive in Australian society and the community—such as understanding Centrelink, how to get a job, how to catch a bus and all of the information that they need to exist in our society—the test will mean that students in those language classes, those who can attend the classes because they do not have family responsibilities or have to be out working, will want to ensure that attending an English language class means that they will be able to pass the citizenship test. As we have seen in other circumstances, the test will change and shift the way in which teaching occurs such that, rather than people learning much-needed skills to survive in Australian society, the teaching will become about helping students to pass the citizenship test.
Those were some of the concerns that were put forward. The government has not put forward a need or a justification for this change. Indeed, our citizenship laws as a whole are working quite well. The example of overseas countries was the only justification put forward to us and the government could not even provide us with an example of how the test had helped in other countries. In fact, we heard evidence to the contrary. Then there was the issue of whether or not the government’s proposed citizenship test would achieve its objectives. We had an extraordinary number of witnesses appear before the committee to say that, no, it would not achieve the objective of improving cohesiveness and that, rather, it was likely to fuel division within our society and undermine existing English language programs. It was a real opportunity for the government to hear from people in the community with expertise in this area, those people who teach English as a second language and know what kind of test you would need to accurately assess somebody’s English language skills. None of them said that 200 multiple-choice questions, of which 20 would be randomly chosen, would be anywhere near an adequate testing regime to assess people’s level of English language proficiency.
Through the Senate committee process, other concerns were raised regarding the level of discretion that, in this case, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has—that is, to write the test and to design the questions. There are no proposals under the legislation for the questions to be tabled in parliament, for them to be made available or for there to be any oversight or assessment of the appropriateness of the questions that are being proposed. That was one of the issues that many of the witnesses went to. Indeed, this matter of needing to ensure that there is some level of transparency and accountability in the operations of the minister is a matter that the Australian Greens addressed in our report on this, which has just been tabled in the Senate. It is worth pointing out that, in the last few weeks, there has been much questioning about the exercise of ministerial discretion by this same minister. The level of ministerial discretion proposed in the citizenship test is extraordinary; it is very expansive in the way it operates. The Senate inquiry heard from a number of witnesses about the concerns that people had about this matter.
It is important to recognise that there were many voices throughout that Senate inquiry that raised numerous concerns, some of which are addressed in the committee report and are certainly addressed in the related report by the Australian Greens. They went to the fact that, if we really want to improve the cohesiveness of society and migrants’ English language skills, we need to invest in the existing programs for English language skills and for people to gain an understanding of citizenship. A test is not going to help us; in fact it is going to make things worse.

Ordered that the document be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the report be adopted.
This report is the 50th—so we have made the half century—in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be afforded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified, in the Senate.
On 29 March 2007, the President received a submission from Mr Darryl Hockey relating to comments made by Senator Glenn Sterle in the Senate on 29 November 2006 during motions to take note of answers to questions without notice. The President referred the submission to the committee under privilege resolution 5. The committee considered the submission in May but was unable to finalise the matter until now because Mr Hockey was overseas. It recommends that Mr Hockey’s proposed response, as agreed by the committee and Mr Hockey, be incorporated in Hansard.
As always, the committee reminds the Senate that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or the persons referred to. Rather, it ensures that these persons’ submissions, and ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. I commend the motion to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
The response read as follows—
Pursuant to Resolution 5(7)(b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988
On Wednesday 29 November 2006, at 3.23pm, Senator Glenn Sterle from Western Australia delivered an address to the Senate generally on the subject of AWB and the Oil-for-Food program.
In his address, Senator Sterle stated: “There is gun-toting Trevor Flugge, former director and chairman of AWB, who was paid $900,000 out of the AusAID budget for a few months work in Iraq. He is a former National Party candidate. There is Darryl Hockey, AWB’s government relations manager, who is a former adviser to the last National Party leader, the member for Gwydir. They are part of the dirty dozen. They all have deep National Party ties, and what a pack of crooks they are”.
I wish to correct the flagrantly inaccurate statements made by Senator Sterle:
(i) I am not AWB’s government relations adviser.
(ii) I am not one of the twelve people whom Commissioner Terence Cole referred for further investigation by Australian law authorities following the Cole royal commission. The so-called ‘dirty dozen’ was a description used by the press across the front pages of major newspapers on Tuesday 28 November 2006 following the release of the Cole report, with photographs of the twelve people accused. I was not one of these people. One day later, on 29 November 2006, before making his statements, Senator Sterle only had to check the front page of the previous day’s newspapers to see that I was not one of the people implicated.
(iii) In his final report, Commissioner Cole explicitly stated that I had no prior or subsequent knowledge of the adverse activities which occurred. This report was publicly released on Monday 27 November 2006, two days before Senator Sterle made his statements. As such, the Senator had ample opportunity to check the veracity of his statements in advance, and in my opinion the absence of such diligence when the truth was so readily available at his fingertips is reprehensible.
(iv) I do not have deep National Party ties, I have had no association with the National Party since I finished working for Minister Anderson in 1998. In fact I worked for a Liberal Party Minister in South Australia for three years from 1999-2001 and have held no political affiliations since that time.
(v) I am not a ‘crook’, and there is no evidence or suggestion to support the statement of Senator Sterle. This is a slanderous and defamatory statement without any basis whatsoever. His suggestions are a savage and unwarranted attack on my integrity, and I believe should be redressed. I am a former Western Australian Citizen of the Year, and have been awarded the Centenary Medal and Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal for services to the national and international communities.
I greatly respect the processes of the institutions of Australia’s parliamentary system, including the important matter of privilege. However because of its potentially damaging nature to innocent individuals, in my view parliamentarians have a clear responsibility to take reasonable steps to establish facts from available sources before making personal criticisms. I believe that a failure to adopt reasonable due diligence would be considered by the broader community to be an abuse of the important parliamentary privilege of the exercise of free speech.

Question agreed to.
The response read as follows—
Pursuant to Resolution 5(7)(b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988
On Wednesday 29 November 2006, at 3.23pm, Senator Glenn Sterle from Western Australia delivered an address to the Senate generally on the subject of AWB and the Oil-for-Food program.
In his address, Senator Sterle stated: “There is gun-toting Trevor Flugge, former director and chairman of AWB, who was paid $900,000 out of the AusAID budget for a few months work in Iraq. He is a former National Party candidate. There is Darryl Hockey, AWB’s government relations manager, who is a former adviser to the last National Party leader, the member for Gwydir. They are part of the dirty dozen. They all have deep National Party ties, and what a pack of crooks they are”.
I wish to correct the flagrantly inaccurate statements made by Senator Sterle:
(i) I am not AWB’s government relations adviser.
(ii) I am not one of the twelve people whom Commissioner Terence Cole referred for further investigation by Australian law authorities following the Cole royal commission. The so-called ‘dirty dozen’ was a description used by the press across the front pages of major newspapers on Tuesday 28 November 2006 following the release of the Cole report, with photographs of the twelve people accused. I was not one of these people. One day later, on 29 November 2006, before making his statements, Senator Sterle only had to check the front page of the previous day’s newspapers to see that I was not one of the people implicated.
(iii) In his final report, Commissioner Cole explicitly stated that I had no prior or subsequent knowledge of the adverse activities which occurred. This report was publicly released on Monday 27 November 2006, two days before Senator Sterle made his statements. As such, the Senator had ample opportunity to check the veracity of his statements in advance, and in my opinion the absence of such diligence when the truth was so readily available at his fingertips is reprehensible.
(iv) I do not have deep National Party ties, I have had no association with the National Party since I finished working for Minister Anderson in 1998. In fact I worked for a Liberal Party Minister in South Australia for three years from 1999-2001 and have held no political affiliations since that time.
(v) I am not a ‘crook’, and there is no evidence or suggestion to support the statement of Senator Sterle. This is a slanderous and defamatory statement without any basis whatsoever. His suggestions are a savage and unwarranted attack on my integrity, and I believe should be redressed. I am a former Western Australian Citizen of the Year, and have been awarded the Centenary Medal and Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal for services to the national and international communities.
I greatly respect the processes of the institutions of Australia’s parliamentary system, including the important matter of privilege. However because of its potentially damaging nature to innocent individuals, in my view parliamentarians have a clear responsibility to take reasonable steps to establish facts from available sources before making personal criticisms. I believe that a failure to adopt reasonable due diligence would be considered by the broader community to be an abuse of the important parliamentary privilege of the exercise of free speech.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2007-08-07,"—I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into the structure and operation of the superannuation industry, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The inquiry by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the superannuation industry generated substantial interest from a range of corporations, organisations and individuals. We received 96 submissions and held public hearings in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. Representatives of corporations, industry bodies, consumer groups, academics, government and regulatory agencies were all consulted.
In early 2007, total superannuation assets reached the $1 trillion mark, up from $761.9 billion as recently as June 2005 and four times the value of superannuation assets in June 1995. These increases have occurred through strong returns on equities and a guaranteed flow of contributions that some researchers estimate could double in size by 2015.
Regulatory framework
Despite the success of superannuation as a retirement savings vehicle, peak industry associations and other stakeholders argued that the laws and regulations governing superannuation have become too complex, onerous, and conflicting in some instances, and have not kept pace with industry developments.
The committee shares these concerns and recommends that the government undertake a comprehensive review of the laws and regulations governing superannuation to identify how they may be rationalised and simplified. The review should be carried out by the Treasury.
Promotional advertising
An inevitable consequence of choice of fund with regard to superannuation has been the emergence of promotional advertising in the sector. While funds should be entitled to advertise, the disclosure of expenditure on such activities is important. The committee recommends that peak superannuation bodies and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority work with the Australian Accounting Standards Board to form appropriate compulsory accounting and disclosure by all funds for promotional advertising, sponsorship expenses and executive remuneration.
Third party transactions
Another concern raised with the committee relates to the use of the term ‘not-for-profit fund’ where services are tendered out to related-party profit making entities. While payments to third-party service providers are compatible with being a not-for-profit fund, members ought to be getting value for money and transactions should be conducted at arms length. In this context, it was disappointing that representatives of Industry Super Network refused to answer questions taken on notice from the committee. In order to ensure transparency in this area, the committee therefore recommends that the government develop an effective disclosure policy to address deficiencies in reporting related-party transactions and that trustees of superannuation funds publicly tender key service provision agreements.
Member investment choice
An area of some confusion during the inquiry concerned the responsibilities of trustees in the member investment choice environment.
This issue needs further clarification. The committee recommends that APRA release its legal advice on the role of the trustee in a member investment choice situation and consult further with industry to clarify the duties of trustees that offer member investment choice. It recommends that APRA review its written guidance and further clarify its interpretation of the role of the trustee to ensure that the reality of investment choice and the obligations of trustees under the SI(S) Act are better integrated.
Safeguarding superannuation savings
A strong case was made for a mandatory unit pricing methodology for public offer funds. The committee agrees that unit pricing is the most appropriate way to allocate investment earnings and appears to be the best way to ensure equity for members who move between funds. The committee recommends that the government mandate a uniform unit pricing methodology for all public offer superannuation funds, including any necessary transitional arrangements.
Under Super Choice, portability and consolidation have become increasingly important. The committee is concerned at anecdotal evidence that some funds deliberately are slowing the process of transferring funds and placing administrative hurdles in the path of fund members. It encourages APRA to be conscientious in enforcing the new 30-day limit on funds transfers. The committee also heard evidence of the potential for exit fees to undermine competition. It encourages the government to monitor the application and quantum of exit fees, particularly in cases where fees bear no apparent relationship to the real administrative cost of exiting a fund.
Cost and accessibility of financial advice
The introduction of superannuation choice has drawn attention to the role of funds and professional advisers in helping consumers to navigate their way through the options they now face. There are concerns over the adequacy of the current regulatory arrangements to enable the affordable provision of basic advice on superannuation.
In particular, the broad definition of ‘financial product advice’ in the Corporations Act was blamed for increasing the cost and restricting access to financial advice on issues where consumer protection should not, on the face of it, be a serious concern.
In trying to achieve greater proportionality between consumer protection and accessibility of advice the government has proposed a measure to exempt advisers from providing a statement of advice where personal advice is provided that does not involve recommending a product or remuneration for the advice. The government also has proposed the introduction of a threshold for disclosure on a superannuation investment of less than $15,000, where the advice recommends consolidating investments or making additional contributions. These initiatives are both supported by the committee.
The committee also has recommended that further regulatory guidance be provided to enable funds to provide targeted information to different categories of membership and provide benefit projections to their members.
The role and regulation of accountants in this sphere was raised as well. The committee does not believe accountants should be exempt from holding an Australian financial services licence when providing financial product advice. However, the committee recommends that accountants be able to advise clients on altering their superannuation contribution levels and consolidating superannuation investments into an existing fund, without requiring an AFS licence.
The committee believes that the readability and comparability of disclosure material could be improved by ensuring important information is prominently displayed, in summary form, at the front of product disclosure statements. If this cannot be achieved by the industry of its own volition it should be mandated by the government. The committee recommends that the government conduct market research on the readability of superannuation product disclosure statements and consult with the industry to finalise a preferred standardised format.
Remuneration models for advice
The effect of different remuneration models on the standard of superannuation advice was a major issue during the inquiry.
The committee does not recommend the prohibition of commissions on superannuation products as many consumers cannot afford to pay for up-front fee-for-service advice on their superannuation. Banning commissions on superannuation simply would compound the problems of accessibility to advice that already exist.
The committee is more concerned about shelf fees. They can be anticompetitive and may encourage products to be listed and subsequently recommended that may not be in the best interests of a client. The committee recommends that ASIC work with the industry to provide investors more effective and detailed disclosure of shelf fees.
The effective disclosure of conflicts of interest is critical to ensure that consumers are able to judge their likely effect on the quality of the advice they receive. The committee is of the opinion that disclosure will not be effective unless the nomenclature attached to financial advisers accurately conveys to consumers the adviser’s relationship with, and interest in, the superannuation products they recommend. The committee therefore recommends that the government should investigate the most effective way to develop appropriate nomenclature where the product recommendation advice available to consumers is limited by sales imperatives. The committee also recommends that financial advisers be required to disclose the ownership structure of the licensee under which he or she is operating.
Education and financial literacy
A priority must be to arm consumers with the skills to interpret the quality and independence of the advice they receive. The committee believes this challenge can be addressed effectively by improving the accessibility of advice for those already in the system, and ensuring that future fund members are provided with appropriate guidance during their school years. The committee notes with approval the government’s Better Super television and radio advertisements designed to inform and educate people about the reforms to superannuation that came into effect on 1 July 2007. The committee also supports the government’s Financial Literacy Foundation initiatives and recommends that they be reviewed when their effectiveness is able to be measured against clear performance benchmarks.
Self-managed superannuation funds
The committee heard evidence that the current limit of four individuals who can own and manage a self-managed superannuation fund should be increased in response to the prevalence of many family businesses and funds that operate over two or more generations. The effect of this restriction is likely only to worsen in the future, and should be addressed sooner rather than later. The committee therefore recommends that the Australian Taxation Office consider raising the maximum number of trustees for any one self-managed super fund from four—which currently applies—to 10, in line with current and future demand.
On the regulation of self-managed funds, the committee accepts that greater reliance should be placed on safeguards offered by accountants as the key interface between members and the regulatory and compliance system. The committee recommends that self-managed funds run by qualified accountants be audited annually for three years from their commencement and, subject to no irregularities, thereafter only every five years.
Consistent with its findings and recommendations from previous inquiries, the committee supports the argument by peak accounting bodies that the licensing exemption for accountants advising on self-managed funds should be extended to include general structural advice on all superannuation funds. The committee recommends that the exemption be broadened to enable accountants to provide advice on the structure of, but not investments in, superannuation funds, rather than being limited to advising on self-managed funds.
My thanks go to David Sullivan, the committee secretary, and the other committee staff for their support and expert contribution to our committee’s deliberations on this important subject.
I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Financial Services Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-07,"—The report of the inquiry into the superannuation industry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services that has been delivered today has been a long time in gestation, but it is a singularly important report. Broadly speaking, it will effect, hopefully, savings amounting to well over $1 trillion Australian dollars, so this is not a minor matter. There are 31 recommendations in the report, and it is a sign of the committee’s common conclusions that Labor have only disagreed in part or in whole with five of those. Of course, their point of view has substance, although with respect to their disagreement over the issue of unit pricing I am afraid that I think on balance that the majority report is correct. However, I welcome both the very short Labor minority report and the report itself as seeking to significantly advance an improvement in this sector.
Particularly important, I think, from the perspective of advancing legislation is recommendation 2, which asks the government, through Treasury, to conduct a review of the laws and regulations governing superannuation to identify how they may be rationalised and simplified. There are very real problems in terms of overlap, inconsistencies, complexities et cetera, and the committee has recognised that a major rationalisation would be to the benefit of industry.
The other recommendation I draw attention to is recommendation 5, where the committee recommends that the government formulate and implement an effective disclosure policy for both product disclosure statements and annual reports to address any deficiencies in reporting related party transactions—that is a critical recommendation. Recommendation 8 recommends that Treasury examine and report to government on the issue of overlapping, inconsistent and conflicting requirements of superannuation funds from a number of regulators. That, too, is vital to ensure an efficient and effective industry. I am not one of those who are persuaded by the view that APRA and ASIC need to be united; I think they are separate institutions which function effectively but could function much more efficiently, but I do not have a closed mind to the improvement of regulations in this field.
The committee notes of course the important role the regulators play in superannuation, and five of the 31 recommendations are devoted to APRA and five are devoted to ASIC, so not all the recommendations are directed at the government. In my own case I have a particular interest in the issues of nomenclature, an issue raised by the chair in tabling his report. I think that, until such time as consumers of superannuation products can easily identify the sort of advice that they need simply through letting their fingers do the walking through yellow pages or observing a sign, we are not going to get the kinds of advice channels to fit the consumers that are necessary. Much more needs to be done in that field. Many people do not understand what you mean when you say ‘nomenclature’. If you go to buy a motor car you know what a dealer is, you know to expect that a Ford dealer is entirely different from a Toyota dealer, whereas a second-hand car dealer would, of course, offer you many varieties of car, so it is that kind of nomenclature which is easy for consumers to understand.
There is one area in which I felt the report could have been enhanced, and that is the superannuation guarantee contributions. I am of the view that, because those contributions are required by statute and are compulsory, the superannuation guarantee contributions should be quarantined from being used to pay for commissions to financial advisers. I was not able to persuade other members of the committee to that view, but I think you have to deal with superannuation contributions which are compulsory in a different way to those which are voluntary and I am very wary of financial advisers being able to be ‘free-riders’, as it were, on compulsory contributions.
Overall, in my view, the chair, other members of the committee and the secretariat have done a very useful and helpful job with respect to this report. By its nature, of course, it will not be able to be rapidly implemented or responded to, but I do hope it contributes very materially to the greater efficiency, productivity and effectiveness of our superannuation schemes.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—I will continue the remarks I was making before question time with respect to delayed notification search warrants. The legal framework will require the Ombudsman to conduct an inspection every six months. This will ensure that the inspection of records is more frequent and that the Ombudsman has a more comprehensive external oversight role. This amendment is in response to recommendation 8 of the committee report.
With respect to search warrant execution and the Australian Crime Commission Act amendments, I am proposing amendments to the definition of ‘executing officer’ in items 4 and 19 of schedule 3 of the bill so that a search warrant may only be executed by, or reassigned to, a person within the ACC who is also a qualified member of the AFP or a member of a police force of a state or territory. Making this amendment would eliminate the possibility of a non-police officer executing a search warrant and would also ensure that only a police officer has the capacity to exercise the use of force. This responds to recommendation 9 of the committee report and is consistent with the Crimes Act model.
With respect to further amendments to the Crime Commission Act relating to legal representation and examination, I will move an amendment to remove proposed section 25B of the bill. This amendment responds to recommendation 10 of the committee report. Removing proposed section 25B would ensure that no witness would be examined without a legal representative unless it is his or her express and informed desire to proceed without representation. This complies with the High Court pronouncements in the case of Dietrich.
The next amendment to the bill that I am proposing would correct an anomaly in the Australian Federal Police Act. The amendment is unrelated to the national investigative powers or witness identity matters. I propose that the maximum penalty of two years imprisonment for the secrecy offence in section 60A(2) of the act be reinserted. This penalty provision was unintentionally omitted when the commencement of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commission (Consequential Amendments) Act 2006 resulted in section 60A(2) of the Australian Federal Police Act being repealed and replaced. The re-enactment of this penalty would be retrospective to when the penalty was repealed. Although such retrospectivity is unusual and is likely to attract criticism from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and others, I consider that on balance it is better not to leave a gap in the capacity to prosecute breaches giving rise to such an offence. The secrecy offence has been in force since it was first enacted and there is no legitimate excuse for conduct that breaches this provision. Individuals should not be able to escape prosecution because of the previous inadvertent repeal of the penalty.
With respect to the aviation amendments, a minor but necessary amendment that I am also proposing is the correction of an anomaly in the Crimes (Aviation) Act. Currently, section 15 of that act makes it an offence for a person on board a ‘division 2 aircraft’—an aircraft flying interstate or overseas—to do, or omit to do anything, that would be an offence against the law of the Commonwealth or the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT). Section 15 is intended to ensure that standard criminal offences—for example, theft and assault—always apply on such flights. However, with the current amendments to the Crimes Act (ACT) and the Criminal Code 2002 (ACT) many offences are no longer in the Crimes Act (ACT)—for example, theft—and instead appear in the Criminal Code (ACT). I propose amending section 15 of the Crimes (Aviation) Act so that it applies to Criminal Code conduct on relevant flights. In addition, to provide flexibility in the event of future changes to ACT criminal law, I propose that section 15 of the Crimes (Aviation) Act provide that regulations may be made to specify ACT law that do or do not apply on relevant flights.
I seek leave to move government amendments (1) to (19) together.
Leave granted.

(5)    Schedule 1, item 1, page 16 (after line 23), after section 15GO, insert:
15GOA  Variations resulting in authority extending beyond 12 months
         (1)    To the extent that a proposed variation of an authority for a controlled operation:
              (a)    is of a kind referred to in paragraph 15GO(2)(a) (extensions of period of effect of authority); and
              (b)    would have the effect that the period of effect of the authority would be longer than 12 months (including any extensions under a previous variation);
the following rules apply:
              (c)    an appropriate authorising officer may not make the variation; and
              (d)    an application (theextension application) for the variation may be made under section 15GP to a nominated Tribunal member, instead of to an appropriate authorising officer; and

                    (i)    references in sections 15GO, 15GP, 15GQ and 15GR, and in subsection 15GH(2) as applied by subsection 15GQ(2), to an appropriate authorising officer were references to a nominated Tribunal member; and
                   (ii)    references in those provisions to the authorising officer were references to the nominated Tribunal member.
         (2)    To avoid doubt, an extension application made to a nominated Tribunal member must not propose a variation that would authorise participants in the controlled operation to which the application relates to engage in additional or alternative controlled conduct.
15GOB  Minister may nominate AAT members
         (1)    The Minister may, by writing, nominate a person who holds one of the following appointments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to deal with extension applications:

              (c)    part‑time senior member;
              (d)    member.

              (b)    has been so enrolled for not less than 5 years.
         (3)    A nomination ceases to have effect if:
              (a)    the nominated Tribunal member ceases to hold an appointment described in subsection (1); or
              (b)    the Minister, by writing, withdraws the nomination.
         (4)    A nominated Tribunal member has, in relation to the performance or exercise of a function or power conferred on a nominated Tribunal member by this Act, the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court has in relation to proceedings in the High Court.
         (5)    In this section:

extension application has the same meaning as in section 15GOA.

(7)    Schedule 1, item 1, page 28 (after line 6), after paragraph 15HH(2)(b), insert:
            (ba)    in relation to extension applications (within the meaning of section 15GOA) made to a nominated Tribunal member, being applications that would have been made to an authorising officer of the agency but for the operation of section 15GOA:

",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—As I understand it, the government amendments have been moved en bloc. I will speak to them in that way. So that we can at least have a debate on some of the issues with regard to the amendments to this bill, given that the government has now moved en bloc its amendments, I can indicate that our amendments (1), (6) and (8) to (12) will no longer be required to be moved. We will still move amendments (2) to (4), and (5). We will not move amendment (7).
In terms of the amendments moved by the government, the Labor Party do thank the government for moving to address the Senate committee recommendations and ensuring that the Crimes Legislation Amendment (National Investigative Powers and Witness Protection) Bill 2006 [2007] has been through reasonable scrutiny in this place. What I think has been lost in the debate on this particular bill is that while there has been some commentary in respect of one part of it—and I will come back to that particular part—the majority of the bill is a tidy-up exercise in addition to an exercise in ensuring that the legislation is up to date and that there is consistency across jurisdictions. That is the greatest import of this bill. It is, as we said in the second reading debate, an omnibus bill that achieves that process.
Turning to the individual amendments moved by the government, amendments (1) to (3) contain various items. I understand there is a sheet which deals with matters which the government proposes by way of amendment. It would be helpful to have that; it was tabled earlier today. There may not have been an opportunity to photocopy it and provide it to the opposition at this point in time, but I make no complaint about that. When we look at the position that the government has outlined, we see that recommendation 1—which is accepted to the extent that, although the government indicates that it departs from the national model legislation developed by the joint working group of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers Council—is accepted, as it would be rare that a controlled operation would be desirable in circumstances where no suspected offence with a maximum penalty of at least three years was involved. The Labor Party thanks the government for that amendment.
The government has indicated that recommendation 2 has been accepted in part. Recommendation 3 is not accepted, but the alternative recommendation is accepted in part. As fully outlined, recommendation 4 is similarly accepted. I am not sure whether the minister outlined in his statement before parliament today the additional part, which may or may not be presently to hand, as to which amendments go to which recommendations. If he did not, it would be helpful. If the minister is in a position to do that, it might help to facilitate the process. I will assume that the minister does have that information or that his advisers can provide it. That would allow us, when we look at the various amendments, to compare them to the recommendations of the committee and examine the position that the government has indicated on the response to the recommendations of the Senate standing committee.
We note that recommendation 6 is not accepted. The committee recommended that the federal government limit the offences in relation to which delayed notification search warrants may be issued for offences involving terrorism, organised crime, death or serious injury with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. It is with disappointment that the Labor Party see that the government has not circumscribed that amendment in terms of recommendation 6 of the Senate committee. We differ with the justification. We are more broadly in agreement that the power should exist. We just differ over when it should be available—unlike the Democrats and Greens in respect of this debate. Recommendation 10 and the remaining recommendations have all been either accepted or accepted in part.
I think that demonstrates the strength of the committee. I usually take the opportunity of thanking both the secretariat and the chair of the relevant committee—in this case, it is the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—for ensuring that there was a joint response from the opposition and the coalition senators, because the strength of the committee process is demonstrated by the ability to obtain recommendations and amendments that accord with those recommendations from the government. Therefore, the committee deserves recognition for that work.
If the government could also indicate which amendments were moved which are not part of the recommendations and which are also not procedural in nature, it would be helpful. I do not expect those which are of a procedural nature to be advised on but, for those which are of a substantive nature, it would be helpful to understand which government amendments have been moved in that way. Of course, this happens when you move them en bloc. We have not had the ability, other than today, to examine them. For the record, what usually occurred with the previous minister was that at some point we would have that type of exercise so that forearmed would be forewarned and so that we could confine the debate in this chamber to the issues which we disputed or disagreed on. Rather than have a wide-ranging debate in the committee stage, we could confine it to the matters which we disagreed on.
It does seem that at least we disagree in respect of confining the delayed notification warrant. On that matter, if I could, I would ask that to be taken out of the bloc because we do not want to agree with the government on that amendment but rather we want to divide on it. We would oppose it and prefer Labor’s amendment in respect of that matter. I think that is reflected in the running sheet. It seems that government amendment (11) is in conflict with opposition amendment (8).
As I said earlier, we will not be moving opposition amendments (1), (6) and (8) to (12), and government amendment (8) would be withdrawn. You have made no change to the delayed notification warrant amendment. If that is right, by the look of it it falls to a position where we can agree with all of those amendments and then continue with our preferred position in respect of opposition amendments (2) to (4), (5) and (7)—if that is helpful.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-07,"—I want to ask the minister a question about government amendment (8). I apologise if it was answered while I was walking down to the chamber. I would like an explanation about that amendment. Looking at it, it seems as though there is a concern about the presiding officer—the tribunal member or the judge—being able to keep a record of the interview and the decision. Is there a concern that the tribunal member should not be able to write down and keep record of it? Is it so that it cannot be asked for later? Could the minister explain the rationale behind government amendment (8)?",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—This is in response to recommendation 5 of the committee’s report to amend proposed section 15KP to prohibit the retention, copying or recording by a presiding officer, whether he is a judge or magistrate, of any information or documentation provided to them under that provision—that is, information or documents that relate to an operative’s true identity. So it is about undercover operations.
Although this would lead to a departure from the national model, this proposed amendment would ensure that the true identity of an operative was not revealed or compromised by the actions of the presiding officer, albeit inadvertently. In circumstances where operatives are conducting a controlled operation with organised crime, outlaw motorcycle gangs or drug traffickers, you could understand that, as a sole source of evidence, they would be potentially in great jeopardy and danger were their identities to be revealed. This is a risk management exercise and a security measure for policing.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-07,"—I want to clarify with Senator Ludwig which amendments he was seeking to withdraw. The Democrats will be supporting the opposition amendments, just as we were happy to support the government amendments, but I was wondering whether perhaps Senator Ludwig would not mind reiterating which ones he was seeking to move and not move.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—We will not be moving opposition amendments (1), (6) and (8) to (12). If you look at the running sheet, those have nearly fallen within that first government amendment, and opposition amendments (1), (6), (8) to (12) would have been the next amendments to have been moved. We will still move opposition amendments (2) to (4) and (5) but we will withdraw (7).",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-07,"—by leave—I move Australian Democrat amendments (1) to (6) on sheet 5327:
(1)    Schedule 1, item 1, page 14 (line 3), omit “principal law enforcement officer”, substitute “authorising officer”.
 (2)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 14 (line 15), omit “controlled conduct”, substitute “unlawful conduct”.
 (3)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 14 (line 18), omit “controlled conduct”, substitute “unlawful conduct”.
 (4)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 14 (lines 20 to 24), omit subsection 15GL(3), substitute:

        
 (3)
   
 As soon as reasonably practicable after giving an oral authorisation, the authorising officer for the controlled operation must give to the person authorised

 to engage in controlled conduct and the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation a written authorisation stating the matters in subsection (2).

 (5)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 14 (line 34), omit “principal law enforcement officer”, substitute “authorising officer”.
 (6)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 15 (lines 2 to 6), omit subsection 15GL(8), substitute:
(8)  As soon as reasonably practicable after cancelling an authorisation orally, the authorising officer for the controlled operation must give written notice of the cancellation to the person who was authorised to engage in controlled conduct under the authorisation and the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation.
These amendments deal with unlawful conduct and authorisation. We are seeking to amend schedule 1 of the legislation to ensure that the authorising officer and not the principal law enforcement officer be required to identify each person who may engage in unlawful activity for the purposes of the controlled operation. We also seek to identify (a), with respect to law enforcement participants, the nature of the unlawful conduct in which those participants may engage and (b), with respect to civilian participants, the particular unlawful conduct, if any, in which each participant may engage. There are also some related amendments there that relate to written authorisations and cancellations.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-07,"—I am wondering whether the Labor Party or the government want to put on record their concerns, or otherwise, with those amendments. In my speech in the second reading debate I outlined some of my concerns, but I thought that particularly the first set of amendments in relation to unlawful conduct was probably not as scary as the government anticipated that it might have been.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—The government is opposed to these amendments. Democrat amendments (1), (4), (5) and (6) would remove the two-stage authorisation process contemplated by the bill. The two-stage process was implemented as a result of consultation with law enforcement agencies and it concerns the privacy and protection of individuals involved in a controlled operation. Accordingly, the government has considered the amendments but opposes them.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—I usually respond to Senator Stott Despoja in these debates. The opposition will not support the amendments. The argument that the minister raises is sound. The opposition have confined ourselves to certain matters, and you obviously would be aware of the position we have adopted, Senator Stott Despoja. The Labor Party have looked at the committee recommendations; we have asked questions about them and received submissions on them. The committee came to a unanimous position about those recommendations to try to improve various parts of the omnibus bill and the various schemes within it. It would not come as any surprise to Senator Stott Despoja that, in this instance, we would confine ourselves to those recommendations. The earlier part of the proceedings was then to sort out which ones were accepted or rejected by the committee, which ones the government has now moved and accepted and which ones the Labor Party no longer need to move here. We will still be moving the remainder of our amendments. We understand in principle the position that Senator Stott Despoja has put but note that, without significant scrutiny of them, the Labor Party cannot find our way clear to support these amendments.
I seek leave to move together opposition amendments (2) to (4) on sheet 5190.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(2)    Schedule 1, item 1, page 15 (line 29), after “has effect for”, insert “the lesser of three months or”.
(3)    Schedule 1, item 1, page 17 (after line 23), at the end of the section 15GQ, add:
         (3)    Nothing in this section permits an authorising officer to extend the duration of an authorisation beyond three months from the date of the initial authorisation.
(4)    Schedule 1, item 1, page 17 (after line 23), after section 15GQ, insert:
15GQA  Extension of authorisation
         (1)    An authorisation expires in accordance with section 15GN unless, while the authorisation is in force, a nominated Tribunal member has:
              (a)    reviewed the authorisation; and
              (b)    decided that the authorisation should remain in force for a longer duration.
         (2)    The authorisation must be reviewed by a nominated Tribunal member within two weeks before to the date on which the authorisation would expire without an extension granted under this section.
         (3)    The nominated Tribunal member must not extend the term of the authorisation under this section unless the Tribunal member is satisfied on reasonable grounds of the matters described in subsection 15GH(2).
         (4)    The nominated Tribunal member must not extend the term of any authorisation beyond one year from the date of the commencement of the authorisation.
15GQB  Who are nominated Tribunal members?
         (1)    A nominated Tribunal member is a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in respect of whom a written nomination by the Minister is in force that permits the member to conduct reviews and to make decisions under section 15GQA.
         (2)    The Minister must not nominate a person unless the person:
              (a)    is a Deputy President or full-time senior member; or
              (b)    is enrolled as a legal practitioner of a federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory and has been enrolled for at least 5 years.
         (3)    A nominated Tribunal member has, in conducting a review or making a decision under section 15GQA, the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court has in relation to a proceeding of that court.
These deal with controlled operations and the requirement for the AAT to authorise extensions. The government’s position is that they oppose these amendments and have provided that extensions for longer than 12 months are required to be authorised by the AAT. These amendments are superior to the position that is indicated by the government. These amendments ensure that there is sufficient oversight. One of the problems that has been identified in this bill—in some parts—is the degree of oversight that is required to ensure that all of the provisions have adequate safeguards within them. I seek the support of the government on these amendments, although it may fall on deaf ears.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1

This amendment relates to controlled operations and seeks to ensure that there is—following the Senate committee’s recommendation—greater accountability within this area. I will not speak to this at length. I spoke to this matter during my speech in the second reading debate. The numbers in this place are not going to support me on this amendment. Therefore, I will not take up more time than is needed to make that point.

This goes to the heart of issues of accountability and I do not see why the government cannot support this particular amendment.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—The government does not support opposition amendment (5) as it has the potential to have serious operational consequences should information be revealed that could endanger the success of the operation—which I think is quite obvious. The government does not think that Labor’s amendment, which places an absolute time constraint on controlled operations, is warranted. This could have serious operational ramifications, requiring a long-running operation into money laundering, for example, or terrorist financing, to be aborted at a sensitive stage.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—Is the government saying that it does not report on any of these matters? As you know, the Australian Federal Police do report on a range of issues: warrants, telecommunications interceptions. They take on board and then report on a broad number of matters. Is the government indicating that no report is made at all in respect of matters which are ongoing in a broader sense and that the reporting every six months would be both onerous and difficult for ongoing investigations? Is that the point that is being made?",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—I thank the minister for that. That does go to some of those matters that I spoke about earlier. These sorts of matters sometimes continue to be sorted out, whereas issues related to recommendations, although we see them as minor in some respects, have a clear answer. There is nothing stopping or preventing A-G’s from filing a post report or a post explanation if they have missed something, or even following that up in their advice to the committee so that it can be passed to members. I encourage A-G’s always to take that opportunity. If there are matters or omissions that they may want to add to their submission, they can always make a supplementary submission. It would, I suspect, always then be dealt with in the report to the legislation committee by the minister. But, as the parliament will know, it is not always the case that the government provides a report on the Senate committee recommendations. It is helpful for that to be done, but the government reserves its right to not always do that and to use the legislative process itself to provide a response. It does, of course, provide responses to the broader reports but not necessarily always in respect of legislative reports.

              (a)    how effective the operation has been to date in gathering evidence in relation to the offence and targeted person specified in the original authority that may lead to prosecution of a person for a specified serious offence;
              (b)    whether any unlawful conduct authorised and/or carried out in the course of the controlled operation up until that point was outside the scope of the initial authority or went beyond what was necessary to conduct an effective controlled operation;
              (c)    whether any conduct up until that point by an authorised person in the controlled operation:
                    (i)    seriously endangered the health or safety of any person; or
                   (ii)    caused the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or
                  (iii)    involved the commission of a sexual offence against any person; or
                  (iv)    resulted in loss of, or serious damage to, property (other than illicit goods);
              (d)    the participation up until that point of any civilians in the controlled operation, particularly any authorised unlawful conduct engaged in by civilian participants, and whether the role played by any civilian participant could have been adequately performed by law enforcement officers.
         (4)    An extension granted under subsection (2), must only be granted if the certificate has been reviewed by a nominated Tribunal member during the last 2 weeks of the period of 3 months after the day on which the certificate was given under section 15J.
         (5)    An extension granted under subsection (2) can extend a controlled operation to a total duration for the operation of no longer than 6 months.
         (6)    The nominated Tribunal member must not decide that the certificate should be in force for 6 months unless he or she is reasonably satisfied:
              (a)    as to all the matters referred to in paragraphs 15GH (2)(a) to (h); and
              (b)    that the benefits of the operation to date, with respect to gathering evidence which may lead to prosecution of a person for a specified serious offence, substantially outweigh the degree and scope of the unlawful conduct required to obtain that benefit, particularly where civilian participants are involved, having regard to factors set out in subsection (3).
         (7)    The nominated Tribunal member must give written notice of his or her decision on the review to the principal law enforcement officer in charge of the controlled operation and the chief officer of the agency to which the certificate relates.
 (8)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 49 (line 15), after “agency”, add “except for granting of extensions as required under 15JA”.
Democrat amendments (7) and (8) are in relation to the granting of extensions for controlled operations. We seek to amend schedule 1 of the bill to retain the requirement that extensions of controlled operations for three-month periods be approved by a member of the AAT and also require that a principal law enforcement officer applying for an extension of the controlled operation authority must provide a progress report to the AAT which addresses the effectiveness of the operation, whether unlawful conduct has exceeded the scope of the initial authority or has endangered the public and whether civilian involvement is still necessary. Essentially we are looking to strengthen the monitoring role of the AAT. I referred to this, obviously, in my speech in the second reading debate. Amendment (8), dealing with the extension limits, seeks to limit the ability of the chief officer of an agency to vary or extend the operation in line with the expanded role of the AAT. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-07,"—Through you, Chair, to the minister, I am going to say something to goad you, Senator Johnston, just to get something on record.
—I have tried.
—You have tried, yes. I have to say, Senator Ludwig and Senator Johnston, that you did have a bit of a chest-beating exercise before this debate adjourned earlier today. I move Democrat amendment (9) on sheet 5327:
(9)    Schedule 1, item 1, page 69 (line 14) to page 70 (line 5), omit subsections 15KI(1) to 15KI(3), substitute:
         (1)    A court or tribunal may grant a witness protection certificate provided:
              (a)    the court or tribunal has undertaken an independent assessment of the asserted need for witness anonymity and satisfied itself that the need is genuine and well-founded in the interests of:
                    (i)    national security; or
                   (ii)    the personal safety of the witness;
              (b)    all other less restrictive protective measures have been considered and found to be inadequate in the circumstances;
              (c)    that a court or tribunal may, only in exceptional circumstances, convict (or enter a judgement against a party) based either solely or to a decisive extent on the testimony of any anonymous witness.
Democrat amendment (9) is in relation to witness protection certificates. We seek to remove the ability of the chief officer to grant a witness protection certificate and to replace that with a court or tribunal. Again referring to my remarks in the second reading debate, obviously we see this as being a stronger mechanism and do not believe that there is a sufficient argument before us to support the changes proposed in the bill.

It was not a matter that was raised in any broad way before the Senate committee. As I read it, I can see the point that you make, but I think it is probably more than what is necessary in this instance. It appears that the current system does not and has not thrown up any significant issues that need addressing. Therefore, the Labor Party will not support this. But, having looked at them, they are certainly matters that I will keep in mind.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-07,"—The Greens oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:
(1)    Schedule 1, page 3 (line 2) to page 85 (line 6), TO BE OPPOSED.
The purpose of this amendment is to oppose the part of the legislation that deals with controlled operations. I spoke about this matter to a limited extent in my second reading debate speech. The Greens understand that in some circumstances the police must work undercover, and this often involves collaboration with a whole range of people involved in criminal activity. It is clear, however, that such activity has a great risk of contributing to corruption and abuse. For those reasons, and to ensure public confidence, it is very important that such undercover work or controlled operations are tightly regulated and that the police involved are accountable. We are concerned that the section of this bill that deals with controlled operations waters down and removes some of the important mechanisms of accountability that exist for such controlled operations. That is why we are moving the Australian Greens amendment.
I have a couple of questions for the minister about controlled operations, in particular the use of foreign intelligence officers in controlled operations and the immunities that are provided for foreign intelligence officers in these operations. Can the minister explain what the purpose is of foreign intelligence officers being able to use assumed identities as part of these controlled operations and whether or not foreign intelligence officers and their agencies would therefore be participating in controlled operations with the Australian Federal Police? Is the minister able to provide any more details about which agencies and which countries? In particular, is it intended that these powers be put in place in order to prepare for APEC, which will occur in Sydney in September?",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—I think that is probably a legitimate question. Where we are working in cooperation with a person from another country on a controlled operation inside Australia, it is arguable that they would be breaking the law if they were to be carrying out acts with an Australian Federal Police officer who is covered by the legislation. Given that there may be a cross-border duality of criminality and that the evidence is gathered onshore in Australia, we must incorporate that person into the regime so that that person, who is acting in his country’s best interest, is covered.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-07,"—Your answer has made it a bit more unclear to me. From your answer, I am not sure now whether the foreign intelligence officer will be involved in undercover operations in Australia or overseas. I thought what we were talking about was the foreign intelligence officer’s involvement in breaking Australian law in Australia, but your answer seemed to suggest that they will be operating in their country and AFP officers can be breaking the law here. Can the minister clarify that? I thought we were talking about foreign intelligence officers breaking Australian law in Australia. Are you talking about them only being involved in their home country?",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—This bill was drafted in 2006, introduced at that time and subsequently dealt with. I am not sure if APEC was in the minds of the drafters of this bill. Perhaps it would be worth while for the minister to answer that point, because, as I understand it, the Greens amendment seeks to take out the whole of schedule 1—that is, to take out effectively what has been around for some years now as a power that is available to the Australian Federal Police to work with states. It relates to a controlled operation, which is defined as a:
… covert or overt activity which would normally be unlawful, but for which immunity is provided for the purposes of securing evidence of serious criminal offences.
It came—I will add a bit of history here—from model legislation which was published in 2003 in the report Cross-border investigative powers for law enforcement. The intent of the legislation is to harmonise as closely as possible the controlled operations regime across Australia. The removal of schedule 1 would leave a serious hole in the ability of the Commonwealth to work with the states on serious crime. If that is the intent of the Greens then not only can I not agree with the position they have put but I also criticise them, in taking this opportunity to remove schedule 1, for not being serious about fighting crime—cross-border crime particularly—through the use of powers that have been available for some time. If there are elements of schedule 1 that the Greens disagree with then this is the appropriate place to debate them, but to use this opportunity to say that you do not want controlled operations powers that have been around for some time misses the point of allowing our law enforcement officers sufficient powers to conduct their investigations and to fight crime.
The bill covers the spectrum of controlled operations and defines the method of authorisation required for each. There is a regime in place that deals with how the controlled operations should be undertaken and dealt with. I will not go into the detail of that, but I think it is important to at least highlight the gulf between Labor and the Greens on this matter. Notwithstanding that the power has been around for some time, that it has been brought forward to harmonise with the states, that it came from a report back in November 2003 and that it is ensuring that the Commonwealth can deal with cross-border crime in an effective way with the relevant controls and safeguards in place, the Greens are taking the opportunity of seeking to remove that power completely, which would leave the Commonwealth unable to deal with controlled operations on a cross-border basis. On that basis alone, I find the Greens’ position extreme and I am not able to agree with it.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-07,"—As I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate and my comments in relation to this amendment, our concern is that this bill removes the accountability mechanisms that are currently in place for controlled operations and undercover operations. We have all been talking about that. We are concerned that undercover operations are precisely the kinds of operations for which we need to have significant accountability mechanisms in place. That is the intention of the Greens amendment.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-07,"—First I want to acknowledge that I understand what the Greens are trying to achieve. The Democrats have sympathy for that because we agree that the legislation before us is not sufficiently full of the various appropriate accountability mechanisms or safeguards. Looking at the debates we have had and the amendments that have been moved in relation to schedule 1—from time limits on controlled operations right through to who can or cannot issue WPCs—I think that the effect of this is to return to the status quo.
We understand that the said aim of the legislation is to do those things to which Senator Ludwig referred, particularly harmonise laws and ensure Commonwealth-state cooperation and the ability to work together. But there are some instances where you need to say that the government, in drafting legislation, needs to go back to the drawing board. In the last half an hour or so, there have been a series of amendments, some that have come from the crossbenches, that have gone further than the Senate committee recommendations. There were also Senate committee recommendations that were totally worthy and appropriate and should have been adopted. I acknowledge that the minister and the government have adopted, in a limited form, some of those recommendations, but I think it is entirely legitimate for Senator Nettle to move an amendment to oppose the schedule in full and, as a result, seek to return us to the current circumstance and ask the government to come up with new legislation or a new schedule that incorporates some of the safeguards that the various submitters to the Senate inquiry and others have called for. It is quite concerning that it is considered extreme. It is certainly blunt but it is not unwarranted. So, based on the fact that my amendments on behalf of the Democrats have not been supported in this circumstance—nor, indeed, have the opposition’s amendments, which quite appropriately put forward the bipartisan view of the Senate inquiry recommendations—I have no qualms about supporting this amendment in relation to schedule 1.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—I am sorry, Senator Stott Despoja, that I have raised your ire in this respect. The point I am making is that this legislation was the subject of a report dating back to November 2003; the direction that the government is taking is not new in that sense. Having read that cross-border investigative report some time ago now, and noting that the bill was introduced back in 2006, in this regard schedule 1 was not unexpected. In providing an update of controlled operations and harmonisation across the states, to ensure that the Commonwealth has the ability to work with the states, we have moved on since the time when the states and the Commonwealth, at least for law enforcement purposes, did not adopt a cooperative approach. But they do now, and they have done so for some time, for a range of very good reasons. By removing this schedule, we would be going back to a position where we might inadvertently hamper, hinder, obstruct or make things difficult. I am sure the government could outline the purposes of ensuring that there is the ability to have, in this instance, effective cross-border investigative powers. That is the point I was making.
Having followed the debate since 2003, it is a quite different point to make that you have complaints about oversight, additional oversight or something which is, in my view, legitimate. It is not for me to judge, but I am referring to matters that you could quite rightly point to and say that they require strengthening. It is quite another matter to say that the Commonwealth should be denied the ability to move towards harmonisation to ensure that the impediments to cross-border investigative operations are removed.
When you juxtapose those positions, you see that the Labor Party entered the debate constructively, as it did during the committee process. I do not like saying this, but the government did respond to the committee recommendations, and it did respond positively, to the extent that it picked up most of the recommendations. I am not always in a position to be able to say that in this place—that the government has picked up most of the recommendations. In fact, in this case it has picked up all bar recommendation 6. There were a range of recommendations dealing with oversight issues and the like. Of course, it only picked up some in part and it changed some others. However, my summation is that it has done better than 50 per cent, and that has been quite a rarity during the last 12 months or so that the government has been in control of the Senate. I do not like to give credit where credit is due when it involves the government, but I will do so in this case, because it has risen to the challenge and provided a response. We have now been able to work through the legislation, and it is better than many other pieces of legislation that we have looked at. I know that is a rather long-winded explanation, but the matter did require one.
 (Senator Moore)—The question is that schedule 1, as amended, stand as printed.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—I move opposition amendment (7) on sheet 5190:
(7)    Schedule 2, item 8, page 88 (lines 4 to 16), omit the definition of relevant offence, substitute:

relevant offence means:
              (a)    an offence under Division 72 of the Criminal Code Act 1995; or
              (b)    an offence under Part 5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995; or
              (c)    an offence involving or resulting in the death of a person; or
              (d)    an offence against the person, where the maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for life.
This is one area where we do fall out with the government. In its response, the government indicated that it did not accept recommendation 6. The Senate committee recommended that the federal government limit the offences in relation to which delayed notification search warrants may be issued to offences involving terrorism or organised crime, or death or serious injury with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. In that instance, the government has provided a response, and the opposition thank the government for that. It said that delayed notification search warrant schemes will only apply to offences which justify the use of such warrants. These include specific listed offences or offences which carry a penalty of 10 years imprisonment or more. The government claims that, if the recommendation were accepted, a range of serious offences may not be subject to the scheme, including child pornography, sexual servitude and child sex tourism offences. If there are a range of serious offences that it wishes to include, while excluding the less serious offences, it would be incumbent upon it to put that position, but it has not done so.
The rationale for the Senate committee’s position, and Labor’s position, was to be in accord with the states’ position as far as possible. Our understanding is that terrorism or organised crime, or death or serious injury, are matters which can fall within the state jurisdiction and that, if we are looking at cross-border harmonisation of investigative powers and the use of delayed notification warrants, the outcomes should be similar. If there is a complaint that some of those offences that should be dealt with by the states are not being dealt with, the minister has the ability to put those matters on the agenda of the police ministers’ council, to pursue them more broadly, if it has not already done so, and accept the outcome. The other thing it could do is provide a more detailed explanation. The complaint we make is that it seems to be too broadly drafted. That is the position that we have argued, both in the Senate committee and here. If the position were to be argued differently, it would have been helpful if the Attorney-General’s Department, in providing advice to the Senate committee, had pointed that out. If they did so, I will withdraw those remarks.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—I think I have already dealt extensively with why the government did not accept the committee’s recommendations on this point, and those reasons apply equally to this amendment. Outside the terrorism context, delayed notification search warrants are needed to investigate, obviously, drug trafficking, child sex tourism and sex slavery networks. They are required to bring those engaged in such activities to account and to enforce the law against them. Also, in circumstances that I have set out with respect to outlaw motorcycle gangs and organised crime, using delayed notification search warrants would mean that those networks could not be tipped off through the provision of a document that would indicate what the enforcement officers were seeking and which would then be challengeable in a jurisdiction such that further evidence would have to be given in support or rebuttal of an injunctive proceeding.
By way of assistance to the opposition, I have provided a short table setting out the government amendments relevant to the Senate committee’s recommendations. I can further provide references to the recommendations with a view to the opposition amendments, should you so require.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1

This amendment is identical to Greens’ amendment (2) on sheet 5211. It deals with our objections to the delayed notification search warrants. I thought that Senator Ludwig’s points were well made in terms of restricting the offences to which you would have delayed notification search warrants—
—I realised I didn’t want to get into the argument!
—so I am surprised and disappointed by the withdrawal of that amendment, having supported the recommendations of the Senate committee, certainly as a next best step or an ameliorating provision, if you like, in relation to this legislation.
I have put on record already our concerns with this provision. So what this amendment seeks to do is essentially to oppose broadly the provisions that relate to the delayed notification search warrants. The Democrats believe that there is a strong argument for getting rid of this provision, and we oppose the provision and hope that that will be supported.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-07,"—I spoke extensively on this matter in my speech on the second reading. This amendment, as Senator Stott Despoja outlined, is about removing the power of the Australian Federal Police to carry out secret searches in people’s homes, to confiscate their equipment, to plant listening devices and to access their computer equipment, all without those people ever knowing. As I explained in my speech, and as Senator Johnston has heard me explain before, our concern is that, if evidence is gathered as part of that covert search which is subsequently used against an individual in court, they will not be able to contest that evidence because they will not know that the search was carried out.
As I explained in my speech, currently the way in which warrants are issued is that you know someone is searching your home or your property and you are able to be there to check that they carry out the search properly. You get receipts for things that they take, and you are also able to have a lawyer present. What that means is that you are able to check to see that the search is carried out lawfully and properly. If the search is carried out covertly and you never know about it then, if evidence is gathered and brought into a court and used against you, you cannot contest the accuracy of the collection of that evidence or whether that evidence was collected legally, because you were not able to observe or be aware of the search or receive receipts for documents taken because you would not know that the search had been carried out.
As I said in my speech, the government’s rationale is that this is about evidence. The position I have put forward is that, given the delay in notification of the search warrant, it is inevitable that it will be used for intelligence. But, if I take the government’s rationale that it is for evidence, you would not be able to contest that evidence in a court if you were not aware of the way in which the search was carried out because you would not have been notified, you would not have had anyone present, you would not have had a lawyer able to observe the search and you would not have been able to access receipts for the process.
The amendment is about ensuring that there is not an abuse of the power to carry out the search. I am not saying that there will be an abuse; that is not what I am saying. I am just saying that this mechanism prevents you from being able to ensure that such a search is carried out properly. If evidence is gathered and is used against you in a court, you have the right to be able to ensure that that evidence was legally and properly collected. But this takes away your right to be able to ensure that evidence used against you in a court is appropriately collected. That is the concern that the Greens have in relation to this, and that is why we do not support giving these new ‘sneak and peek’ powers to the Australian Federal Police.
I dealt with the issue of the time delay in my speech on the second reading. It is an extraordinary length of time. If it is for evidence gathering in particular, I cannot see why you need six months extended to 12 months and then 18 months. And, with the approval of the minister, the extensions can continue. That might make sense if it were for intelligence gathering, but it is not. The government’s rationale is that it is for evidence gathering. Presumably, you are gathering evidence to use in the courts, so why such long delays?
It is interesting to compare it to the USA PATRIOT Act. In that act, at section 213, it says that such warrants are only able to be delayed for 90 days. What is being proposed here as the initial period of time before there is any requirement for notification is double what is in the USA PATRIOT Act. Then this legislation allows for further extensions to make it 12 months or 18 months and then, with the approval of the minister, to extend it beyond that. So it is quite extraordinary, even when compared with overseas examples such as the USA PATRIOT Act.
Where you give powers to the Federal Police to carry out a search of somebody’s home, there needs to be that accountability. Our concern is that this model for covert search warrants, the ‘sneak and peek’ powers for the AFP, does not allow you to have the oversight that you need, particularly if evidence is being gathered that is being used against you in your court case, because you cannot contest it. That is the concern that the Greens have, and that is why we strongly support this amendment. We are concerned, and I outlined this in my speech in the second reading debate, that the process outlined in the bill suggests that an 18-month delay in notifying anybody can be easily obtained. This goes to the matter of there not being guidelines for Administrative Appeals Tribunal members or judges on making a determination about when there are extraordinary circumstances and the delay in notification should be extended even further. That allows 18 months to become standard. Obviously there is an additional approval from the minister for a period beyond 18 months, so the length of time indicates to us that it is of concern. As I have said, that is far longer than is allowed in the United States, for example.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—I see that Senator Nettle does have some grasp of the way this might work. But I need to explain to her that, for evidence to be admissible as a primary question, every judicial officer in a proceeding can consider admissibility, so that evidence can be challenged, notwithstanding the fact that a late notification warrant gave rise to it. What we are saying is that providing notification to someone who is in certain specified circumstances such as I have already set out to you is counterproductive. In fact, it threatens the success of the operation to set out in warrant form the basis of the warrant and to provide advice to the person who is the subject of the warrant. That does not preclude the person from subsequently, upon the charges, challenging the evidence derived from the warrant. They would have that right with notification. They still have the right at the proceedings—which would hopefully and likely flow from the evidence gathered from the execution of the warrant.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1

My concern is that if you are not there, present at and aware of the search, then you do not have a basis on which to challenge the admissibility of the evidence. I accept that you are able to challenge the admissibility of the evidence in court, but my concern is that if you did not know the search was carried out—you were not aware and you did not know how the search was carried out—then that would make it difficult for you to determine a basis on which to challenge the admissibility of the evidence and the way in which the search was conducted. So I accept that you are able to challenge it—being able to challenge something is good; it is appropriate and you should be able to do it. But if you are not aware of the search and how it was carried out then the basis on which you challenge it is removed—your opportunity to do that is removed.
The minister has, both here and in other fora, pointed to the example of not wanting to tip somebody off that a search is being carried out. I suppose it is about recognising that, in practice, the cops rock up to your house with the warrant and go in. It is not like they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to come and search your house in two weeks.’ You are not told: ‘Hey, clear up your place. The cops are coming around in two weeks. They’ll be searching, so you’d better clear out all the evidence.’ It just does not work like that. The cops rock up to your house with the warrant, they show it to you and in they go. I accept that the minister is trying to make a point, but I just do not think it aligns with the reality of the way in which the searches occur.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—Without seeking to create any defences, in terms of evidence obtained through a late notification warrant, the warrant would have to be obtained according to the law. That would obviously be a starting point if the admissibility of the evidence was to be challenged. It would be a starting point whether or not a person was standing there observing the execution of the warrant. With the greatest respect, Senator Nettle, all I am saying is that I think you are seeking to jump at shadows because you do not like the authoritative nature of the powers that police have.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-07,"—That is a bit provocative.
—Did that raise your ire?
—Yes, it did. I would like to place on record here that it is possible for people to support the work of investigative and police agencies—
—And covert operations.
—My gosh, Senator McGauran is here! It is possible to support the work of those agencies and to support the granting of powers—and sometimes additional and extraordinary powers, particularly when dealing with burgeoning and new offences as we find in this new era of terrorism. But, by the same token, we are entitled to have a debate—that perennial debate, regardless of the era to which you belong—about the balance between human rights, personal liberty and freedom and the public interest and, of course, national security. I notice that Senator Nettle invoked The Castle earlier—so it is about the ‘vibe’ of the Constitution too.
Seriously, though, as part of this debate—through you, Madam Temporary Chairman Moore, to the minister—I am not doubting a natural order here or questioning instinctively the powers of the police per se, but I am looking at this issue. We are dealing not just with the specifics of the collection of evidence, whether or not you can challenge it and test its admissibility, but also with broadening warrants in relation to the agencies and the offences to which they apply. We are dealing with a broad range of federal agencies that are scooped up as part of these new proposals. We are dealing with, arguably, the potential for indefinite warrants—when you look at the renewal provisions of these warrants. So we are dealing with broad-ranging powers in the legislation before us. Hence the amendment before us, the one in my name—and I note Senator Nettle’s amendment—that opposes this particular section in relation to delayed notification search warrants.
I acknowledge that the minister has put forward an example or an argument as to why this would be beneficial, but I want to clarify whether the government is in a position to put before the chamber anecdotal evidence or quantify the circumstances in which the current powers have been insufficient so that this change is necessary. In my second reading debate remarks, I made the point that I did not feel the explanatory memorandum justified these new, broad-ranging powers. Have the existing powers in relation to the searching or monitoring of individuals come up short? Is this an argument that the government can sustain with examples, anecdotes or information from the agencies?",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—There are circumstances in which police involved in operations, not having obtained a warrant, see evidence but cannot get it because they need to get a warrant. To advise the subject of a warrant of the nature of the warrant and specify what the warrant is for will clearly, in a network type situation, lead to the removal of the evidence. I have given the example of clandestine drug laboratories. When you are seeking to close one laboratory and you have suspicions about others, and the headquarters of the operation contains information about the location of those other laboratories, then the disclosure of the information in the warrant and having the owner of the headquarters present will mean that the evidence will be removed from the other clandestine laboratories; they will be closed in the blink of an eye. There is an anecdotal example.
The government is very conscious of the need for balance. Can I take you through the balance again. For an officer to get a delayed notification search warrant, he must go to the chief officer—defined as ‘the Commissioner or his delegate’—and spell out on reasonable grounds his suspicions that serious offences are being carried out in circumstances that would give rise to a late notification warrant—that is, that this type of warrant would suit that particular operation. Serious offences are defined as offences carrying a jail sentence of 10 years or more. The chief officer—that is, the Commissioner—has to consider all of that and then give his permission. Then that constable has to go before an eligible issuing officer—a judge or a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—and fulfil nine legal requirements. He has to make a written application; specify the name of the applicant; specify the name of the constable who, unless he or she inserts the name of another constable in the warrant, is to be responsible for executing the warrant; provide details or attach a copy of the authorisation given to him by the chief officer; specify the address, location or other description of the premises and any other adjoining premises; specify the proposed duration of the warrant; provide a description of the kinds of things proposed to be searched or seized, copied, photographed, recorded, operated, printed, tested or sampled; provide a statement on whether things are to be placed in substitution for seized things—in other words, in a controlled operation; and support all of that with an affidavit. Then you get the warrant.
And then we have the follow-up over the six- and 12-month regime with respect to the Ombudsman reviewing those things if the operation goes on, and the minister tables the report. I am having difficulty imparting to you, as lawful citizens, the level of criminality that we are seeking to deal with here. This is the great unknown; people do not understand the dynamic nature of serious organised crime, serious organised drug trafficking and serious organised terrorism financing. These are the things that, in the face of those checks and balances, we seek to arrest. With respect, Senator Stott Despoja, to want to throw those out with no substitution, in the face of what I have just said, strikes me as being seriously unable to come to terms with the level of criminality we are dealing with here.

Usually an examiner requires someone to attend and, on occasion, to produce documents that are associated with the original summons so that they can examine them about those documents and put questions to them. That is the purpose of an examiner. I am curious about where you got the additional, singular view about giving evidence by tendering written statements. That, in fact, might slow the process down and hamper an investigation. Obviously, if there are follow-ups required on the written statement we could end up with a lengthy period of examination.

(15)  Schedule 3, item 45, page 134 (lines19 to 24), TO BE OPPOSED.
These amendments, like the last one to which I referred, Senator Ludwig, are pretty much sourced directly from the Law Council submission. They deal with the determination of incrimination, the use of incriminating evidence and reversal of the evidential burden. I outlined in my comments in the second reading debate the concerns that the Australian Democrats had with the effect of the bill in seeking to abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination by requiring people to provide a written statement potentially containing self-incriminating information. We have expressed, on a number of occasions, concerns about provisions such as that in law.
So amendment No. 13 would remove the ability for evidence which a participant has indicated may be self-incriminating to be subsequently used in evidence against that witness under section 35 of the Australian Crime Commission Act. Amendment No. 14, dealing with the use of incriminating evidence, would delete the note which reverses the evidential burden of proving that evidence is not false in a material particular. I am happy to commend those to the Senate. Amendment 15 is the one to which I just referred. ‘Removing the ability for evidence for which a participant has indicated may be self-incriminating to be subsequently used in evidence against that witness under section 35’—I think that was No. 14, and No. 15 was: ‘Amend schedule 3 to delete the note which reverses the evidential burden of proving that evidence is not false in a material particular.’
Again, they essentially go to the heart of our concerns, which are the changes involving self-incrimination and also the fact that we are concerned that we are doing the legwork for the ACC. I hope that little messy explanation goes to the heart of our amendments and I commend them to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-07,"—In response to the self-incrimination aspect, in practice the requirement of a witness claiming protection against self-incrimination before each answer creates a disruption in the interrogation process in this framework. In addition, the process is often confusing for unrepresented witnesses, who regularly need a lengthy explanation of how the process works. Item 39 allows examiners to expand the privilege against self-incrimination to all evidence given in relation to a question or a class of questions, a document or a class of documents or a thing or a class of things. As a result of the examiner’s direction all evidence given in relation to a question or class of questions, documents or thing or class of things or documents specified in the direction will be subject to a claim of privilege in accordance with section 30(4)(c) of the ACC Act and the immunity provision in subsection 30(5) will apply.
In this framework the person is given the caution with respect to self-incrimination but must answer the questions. In other words, this amendment will simplify proceedings for witnesses and reduce the duration of examinations as the interruption caused by witnesses making a claim of privilege before answering each question or producing each document or thing will be alleviated at the examiner’s discretion. This aligns with the Evidence Act 1995 by requiring the examiner to caution a witness about self-incrimination before beginning questioning, and the amendment will reduce the potential prosecution of many witnesses who follow.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1

This amendment goes to the matter of the ability of the Australian Federal Police to hold people without charge. This relates to the case of Dr Mohamed Haneef, who we all know was held for 12 days without charge. This was the first time that we saw these terrorism laws exercised in Australia—the ability to hold somebody without charge—and it is worth us reviewing how those laws came into effect.
At the time that the legislation was put before the parliament, there was a Senate inquiry into the matter—in 2004—and there were also a number of questions that were asked in the Senate chamber in relation to this matter. The government was well aware at the time of what it was asking for: an extraordinary power to be able to hold people without charge. At that time, understandably, there were a number of questions from myself, from other members of parliament and also from public interest groups, who had a concern about how such powers may be exercised. I want to remind the Senate what we were told at the time about how such powers would be exercised. I will do so by quoting the Hansard of the Senate inquiry into this matter and, in particular, the comment by Mr Geoff McDonald, who at the time was the assistant secretary of the criminal law branch of the Attorney General’s Department. He told the Senate inquiry:
I would be extraordinarily surprised if the dead time—
and, perhaps to explain: the ‘dead time’ is the period of time for which somebody can be held whilst questioning is not occurring. He said:
I would be extraordinarily surprised if the dead time, for example, in relation to the time zones, would get anything like the sorts of time periods that were being suggested by Professor Williams.
That is referring to Professor George Williams, who was suggesting 24 hours. The Attorney-General’s Department said they would be extraordinarily surprised if somebody would be held for 24 hours in the dead time. And he said:
I have spoken to the Victorians about cases in Victoria concerning reasonable time and what the court has considered to be reasonable time, and the court has considered periods like 16 hours to be reasonable.
This was in response to evidence given to the committee by Professor George Williams from the University of New South Wales who was concerned about giving the extraordinary power to the Australian Federal Police to hold people without charge. He mentioned that it could mean that people could be held for 24 hours. The Attorney-General’s Department indicated that they would be extraordinarily surprised if that were the case. There was a debate around the issue of what the court would consider to be a reasonable period of time to hold somebody before they were charged. The examples that were pointed to were determinations that the Victorian courts had made about what would be a reasonable period of time—as I just quoted to you: 16 hours.
Mr Geoff McDonald from the Attorney-General’s Department went on to say:
In fact, I actually expect with this legislation that in reality the periods of the extensions will not be up around the full 24-hour limit. I expect that they will be within that period and that in fact the dead time will in many cases still come within that limit.
So there we have an indication from the Attorney-General’s Department, at the time that the legislation was being debated, that we are talking about the realm of 24 hours. We all accept that the legislation allows people to be held indefinitely without charge, as long as they get approval from the court along the way, but the capacity is in the legislation to do that and this was pointed to by a number of individuals, including the Greens. At the time that the legislation was being debated by the parliament, the proposal was that 24 hours was the sort of time limit we were looking at.
The very first time that these powers were used by the Australian Federal Police, in the case of Dr Haneef, he was held for 12 days—that is, over 200 hours. So the parliament was told: ‘Give us these extraordinary powers.’ The parliament was told that 16 hours, maybe 24 hours, was the kind of time frame, the realm, that was considered to be appropriate or acceptable when the government was saying, ‘Give us the power so that we can do this,’ and the very first time they were used Dr Haneef was held without charge for over 200 hours—12 days.
I think there are a number of matters in this. Of course, there is the fundamental issue about whether or not people should be held without charge and whether people’s liberties should be taken away, unless it is decided so by the court. We also have the matter of what the government told the parliament at the time that they were asking for these extraordinary powers, which, as I have indicated, was 16 hours, maybe 24 hours or less than 24 hours. I think there are lessons to be learnt from what we have seen in the case of Dr Haneef and the period of time for which he was held. One lesson is that the government cannot be trusted with these extraordinary powers.
I am moving this motion today, on behalf of the Australian Greens, to return us to the situation that we used to have: the situation that has been acceptable in this country all the way through until the decision to put in this law occurred in 2004. Just to outline that situation: it allows people to be held for four hours and then for an application to be made for an extension of that period of time. Again, that is where the debate was: the court had considered it reasonable to extend the time to 16 hours. So we are talking about maybe 20 hours or even 24 hours for which people are able to be held. That is actually what representatives of the Attorney-General’s Department were telling us would occur with the extraordinary powers that were given in 2004. The realm we were talking about was 24 hours and, the first time that we saw the powers exercised, it was for over 200 hours. This amendment returns us to that situation.
That does not prevent investigations continuing. We have seen that in the case of Dr Haneef. Commissioner Keelty and others have talked about ongoing investigations continuing. Charging somebody does not prevent investigations continuing. In fact, it allows the proper course of the court to operate so that there can be bail applications, cases can be put forward and the magistrate can determine the decision in relation to whether or not the granting of bail should occur. This amendment from the Australian Greens seeks to offer the parliament the opportunity to learn from the case of Dr Haneef, where we saw these powers exercised for the first time, and he was held for over 200 hours when the parliament had been told that what would be considered reasonable when this power was used was in the realm of 24 hours. That is what we are saying: given that is what we were told at the time and that that is what was put forward as acceptable and appropriate, let us have that in our law rather than this indefinite detention—the capacity to hold people indefinitely without being charged, as long as the court agrees all the way down the course. What we have seen is that, the very first time that the legislation was used, it was used for over 200 hours. This is the opportunity for the parliament and the Senate to learn the lesson from the case of Dr Haneef and return us to a situation where people cannot be held indefinitely without charge. That does not stop investigations occurring, but it says: ‘Let’s operate properly in the way we have always operated, until this case of Dr Haneef.’",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-07,"—This is unsurprising, but Senator Nettle does understand the position that the Labor Party articulates when we see these matters that she occasionally runs up the flagpole. It is not and was not part of the original bill—Senator Nettle knows that. It certainly was not part of the matter that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs could deal with—Senator Nettle knows that. It is not related in that sense to this bill or the parts that fall within this bill—Senator Nettle also, I am sure, understands that. And I am sure that Senator Nettle also understands that the response that I am providing is the principal response of the Labor Party when matters that have not been through the usual process are run up.
This is a matter that Senator Nettle feels strongly about. I have usually been forthright in advising her that there are ways to bring these things before the parliament so she can consider them. There are private member’s bills and a range of other devices. As I understand it, she has also foreshadowed a committee. Be that as it may, Senator Nettle knows that there are a range of mechanisms to be used to appropriately deal with these things. I am not saying it is inappropriate or that she should not do it; I am simply saying that the Labor Party’s position is that we will not go to the substance or merit of the argument because it is a matter that has been tacked on to this bill and has not been through the committee process. It certainly has not been through our process in order to be able to deal with it in a proper and appropriate way. Senator Nettle knows that. I accept that occasionally she does bring these things on in this way. The response of the Labor Party should not surprise her. She has certainly heard me say this before. I can certainly recollect having provided the same view to her in the past.
On the other matter, the Labor Party has said that we think it does require an additional inquiry. We have said that publicly and we maintain that position. In terms of investigating the whole of the Dr Haneef matter, it should be dealt with in that way. I remind Senator Nettle—and I am sure she knows this—that the Australian Federal Police have an ongoing investigation into this matter. There is also an appeal of the 457 matter which is currently being proceeded with by Dr Haneef’s lawyers. This matter, as Senator Nettle knows, goes to the actual legislative regime itself and not so much to the Dr Haneef matter more broadly and so I will not argue that here. It is an inappropriate time to be doing that. I have set out the reasons we will not support this amendment to the bill.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-07,"—This is an opportunity for the Australian Democrats to also place on record our preferred mechanism for the handling of the Dr Mohamed Haneef inquiry. Like the Labor Party, we support the notion of an independent inquiry. That may be a judicial inquiry, which would probably be the strongest and most appropriate way to proceed. Having said that, in the early days of concerns emerging as to how this inquiry would proceed, we suggested that an appropriate channel for investigation or an appropriate independent authority would be the Ombudsman, recognising of course that the Ombudsman has the opportunity to operate as a law enforcement ombudsman and can investigate the policies, procedures and processes of the AFP. Obviously I note Senator Ludwig’s comments on the AFP investigation.
In relation to the broader issue of the functioning, appropriateness or success or otherwise of the operation of the antiterrorism laws that we have in this country, as I have made clear today with the notice I have given of the terms of reference for a proposed Senate select committee, the Democrats feel strongly that there is very good reason for a comprehensive analysis of the broad-ranging antiterrorism laws looking at how they function, how they are working and how they interact with reference to various rights and roles in the community. We are very much in favour of a cross-party Senate inquiry into the broader issue of the legislation, not specifically the Haneef case. I think that Dr Haneef’s case is worthy of an independent judicial inquiry—hence my concerns about the Greens’s proposed Senate inquiry into the Haneef case. I certainly think it is a good backup call, but I also feel very strongly that this is something that needs to be independently examined and I am not quite sure that politicians are the best people to do it. In fact, I am fairly confident that it would not be the most appropriate thing for us to do that.
In relation to the amendment before us, which obviously draws on the use and operation of the antiterrorism laws, I certainly understand and share the concerns that Senator Nettle has outlined. The Democrats will support this amendment, but I think that there are a couple of points that have been well made. In relation to the process, I do not particularly have a problem with people seeking to make broader amendments to legislation even if the legislation before us deals with a specific or other issue. As Senator Ludwig made clear, it is not procedurally incorrect; it is the right of any legislator to do that if they choose. It is a great opportunity. A lot of the amendments—including my own, I acknowledge—were circulated and tabled only today. I do not think that was the case for the government, but certainly the non-government parties circulated their amendments during the debate today. Possibly it would have been opportune to have examined this amendment earlier, simply because I think there are potential ramifications of this amendment that I may not be aware of. We have not had an opportunity to fully explore the effect of this particular amendment; although, as I said, from what I have heard from Senator Nettle, I certainly support its intent.
I am also wondering if this process adequately addresses some or indeed all of the concerns that the Democrats have about the handling of the Haneef case or those concerns that have been articulated by Senator Nettle for the Greens. For example, were ASIO powers involved also, not just those of the AFP? There are obviously some issues that have not been made public and that we cannot address in the chamber. I certainly appreciate Senator Nettle’s canny use of the Senate today in order to bring to the attention of the parliament and the community the issue of detention, ongoing detention and detention without charge and the impact they have on some basic civil liberties and human rights. I think a lot of Australians share those concerns. I am not sure if today is the day that we are going to resolve those concerns—hence my preference for a committee—but, on behalf of the Democrats, I will support Senator Nettle’s intent and thus this amendment before us, although I suspect the numbers are not in Senator Nettle’s favour.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This report, Same-sex: same entitlements, is a very important report and a very welcome one. It is the result of a national inquiry into discrimination against people in same-sex relationships and particularly deals with their financial and work related entitlements and benefits. The report is a very comprehensive one and I really would recommend it to people who have an interest in this area. Any issue that deals with discrimination against same-sex couples or issues relating to gays, lesbians and transgender people often get mired in some degree of controversy. But I believe this report is valuable because it cuts to the human reality, and that is what we are debating here: the human reality of a significant proportion of the Australian community who have fewer entitlements than everyone else in the community purely on the basis of the gender of the person to whom they are partnered—and I believe that is an unacceptable situation.
It should be noted, indeed, that no less a person than the Prime Minister himself—back around the end of 2005, I think it was—said that that was an unacceptable situation and he did not think that people should have fewer financial rights and financial entitlements purely because they were in a same-sex relationship. Unfortunately, whilst he made that statement, he has not actually done anything to remedy that longstanding discrimination.
This area is one that the Democrats have a very longstanding interest in. Indeed, it goes back to the era of Don Chipp, the founder of the Democrats, some of these issues having been raised in the Senate in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In terms of more specific legislative reform going right to the heart of what this report is about, the Democrats have had legislation before the Senate since 1995 that seeks to remove discrimination against people on the basis of sexuality from all areas of Commonwealth law. That mechanism has been before the Senate for 12 years now. It was first introduced by former Victorian senator Sid Spindler—and I am pleased to note, as an aside, that I saw him just last week at a function marking the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Democrats, an event that Sid Spindler himself was very heavily involved in—and this area is a key legacy of his six years in the Senate. That legislation has been updated once or twice. It was the subject of a very comprehensive Senate committee inquiry that was the precursor in many ways to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry that is before us here today. The report of that Senate committee inquiry—by the legal and constitutional references committee, from memory, chaired by former Labor senator Jim McKiernan—is another very worthwhile document, not just because of the technical details but because of the human reality, the human stories that are within it.
I note the introduction to the community guide of this HREOC report. For those who do not want to wade through a large, voluminous document, there is a very nice thin community guide for this report which basically gives the guts of it. It gives the recommendations. It outlines the areas of discrimination: discrimination in employment, discrimination in workers compensation, discrimination in tax benefits, discrimination in social security benefits, discrimination in veterans entitlements, discrimination in healthcare subsidies, discrimination in family law, discrimination in superannuation entitlements, discrimination in aged-care fees, discrimination in access to visas—and those are just the broad oversights. You drill down, and there are a range of different areas there.
Indeed, the inquiry found 58 different federal laws that deny same-sex couples and their children financial and work related entitlements which are available to opposite-sex couples and their children. That is a totally unacceptable situation. I know many other people from all parties have spoken about the need for change in this area, but we have not had action. Despite many efforts by the Democrats over many years, moving amendment after amendment, we have not had that. This report has now been tabled, and it is now no longer any excuse for any of us not to act.
I mentioned that the Democrats will be introducing new legislation that we have given notice of today to fully implement the recommendations of this report straightaway. It is very simple to implement. It basically just means amending the definition describing de facto relationships to include same-sex couples. That can be done. We will introduce the legislation to show how it will be done, how it should be done, and I urge all senators to support it as soon as possible. If nobody else is going to speak to this report, I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2007-08-07,"—This year, 2007, has been proclaimed by the Australian government the Year of the Surf Lifesaver. It is a fitting recognition, as it was 100 years ago, in 1907, that the organised surf lifesaving movement of Australia began. In that year also, the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club was formed. Its first clubhouse was an old tram car. Over the years I think it has occupied five different types of premises and today is housed in a historic building on Cronulla beach.
As it celebrates its centenary, the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club can boast of being one of the most successful clubs in the history of surf lifesaving in this country. During the past 100 years, members of the club have carried out over 9,000 rescues. In the course of that 100 years, in all of those rescues, not a single life has been lost—a wonderful achievement.
The Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club has also been one of the most successful clubs, both in Australia and internationally, in surf lifesaving competitions. I would argue that it has been the best club, but of course others would say I am biased. But a brief look at the record demonstrates how formidable it is. Cronulla has won 139 gold medals at the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships, 254 gold medals at the New South Wales State Surf Life Saving Championships and 591 gold medals at the Surf Life Saving Sydney Branch Championships. It has been the champion club at the Australian championships on five occasions and, most significantly, it has been the only club, ever, to have won three consecutive world, Australian, state and branch championship pointscores in competition.
The Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club has produced some of the legendary names in surf lifesaving competition and administration in Australia. There are too many to mention here tonight and I apologise to all of those that I am unable to mention. I particularly want to note pioneers and stalwarts, some of whom are deceased—people such as Joe Munro, who, I think, was president of the club for some 40 years and indeed a pioneer of the Cronulla area; people such as Bill Eady, Tony Purcell, Don Lucas, Nick Dixon, Jack Crawford and the current patron, Bill Marshall.
Two of the great names and members of the Australian Surf Life Saving Hall of Fame—a very exclusive list of 60 inductees—are legendary iron man John Holt and the supreme belt swimmer Peter Tibbets. The current club president—and I might say an old boy of De La Salle College at Caringbah and Cronulla—is Kevin Neilsen, one of Australia’s greatest ever surf swimmers. I recall Kevin at a young age being good enough to win, I think on the one day, both a junior and an open surf swim race, a feat that I believe has never been repeated and one that is certainly significant.
The tradition of these people and many others continues today through current champions such as Daniel McLellan, Nathan Smith, Tiarne Smith and Elly Graf. It continues, and the club continues because of the substantial effort that is put into its Nippers program. Every Sunday morning in the summer season, hundreds of young children from the age of five onwards gather on the beach, as they do on beaches throughout this country, to participate in the swimming and beach events. That is what ensures that surf lifesaving will continue into the future. Surf lifesaving in Cronulla, but also in every other club, depends upon strong community support. In that regard, the Sutherland Shire Council has been involved in a huge way over many years in supporting the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club and the other three clubs that make up the Bate Bay clubs, namely North Cronulla, Wanda and Elouera.
It was a privilege last Friday night to attend the centenary ball of the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club. There were over 500 people in attendance. It was a great night with some tall tales and true—or at least mostly true. I do not think I have heard as many nicknames in my life. When people take up surf lifesaving it seems they are immediately given a nickname which sticks with them for life.
Last Sunday the 100th annual general meeting of the club was held. There was a substantial attendance of community representatives and political representatives. Local federal member for Cook Bruce Baird, state members and I were honoured and privileged to attend the meeting and speak at it.
It is fitting that we place on the record of this parliament the wonderful work that is done by members of surf clubs around this country, and when they reach milestones such as a centenary it should be particularly noted. I want to congratulate the committee, the life members and all the other members and supporters of the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club for reaching this significant milestone—100 years of vigilance and service, which, of course, is the motto of the surf lifesaving movement.
In closing, I want to note that the retiring member for Cook, Bruce Baird, of a different political persuasion to my own but someone whom I regard as a good friend, has been a very strong supporter of surf lifesaving in his electorate. As I said, there are four beaches along that Bate Bay coastline. Bruce himself is a noted participant. Every year he swims in the Shark Island Challenge, and I think he is a champion in his age group in ocean swimming both here and in other states. Indeed, he has also competed overseas. Most importantly, following the terrible riots in Cronulla at the end of 2005, Bruce was an initiator of promoting dialogue between the surfing community, the local community, the surf clubs and the Lebanese and Muslim communities. They have developed a program, which is now bearing fruit, involving a great deal of cooperation and community spirit built around the idea of service to the community through surf lifesaving. I want to place that on the record and acknowledge Bruce’s efforts. I may not get another chance to say it before the election, so I wish Bruce Baird and his wife, Judy, and their family all the best in the future. I congratulate, once again, Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club on its centenary. No doubt we will see a further 100 years of great service and vigilance.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Year of the Surf Lifesaver</title>,Adjournment,24,1
