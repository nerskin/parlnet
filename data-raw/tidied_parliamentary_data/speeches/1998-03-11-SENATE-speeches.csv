"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-03-11,"—Yesterday I pointed out that the five premises on which we base our censure motion against Senator Bolkus are beyond dispute. In summary they were—and allow me to quote from 
 the motion—that Senator Bolkus revealed certain contents of a confidential Federal Court document which formed part of legal proceedings undertaken to recover assets allegedly concealed by Mr Skase; that Federal Court affidavits may only be obtained by leave of the court or a judge; that in relation to the affidavit revealed by Senator Bolkus no such leave had been obtained; and that Mr Donnelly had not authorised the release of the affidavit.
That is irrefutable and indeed accepted by the Labor Party. The evidence is absolutely irrefutable. What we heard yesterday was a tirade against Senator Vanstone and against this excellent government. For argument's sake, let us set aside all concepts of truth, logic and commonsense. Let us accept the violence done to truth, logic and commonsense and say that what Labor alleges is correct. That in no way excuses or exculpates Senator Bolkus from his own personal actions which are the subject of this motion.
It is like a little child caught with a hand in the cookie jar who, when accused, says, `Oh, Jimmy did it as well.' It does not excuse the behaviour of the child that was caught with the hand in the cookie jar and, in this circumstance, it is Senator Bolkus. The opposition can obfuscate as much as they like, they can filibuster as much as they like, but the reality is that Senator Bolkus has been caught out, and the case has been made very strongly as to the five premises on which we base our case.
On the basis of that, we believe that Senator Bolkus ought to be censured for revealing the contents of a confidential Federal Court document. Why is that such a serious matter? Our whole society and its structure and stability are based on the rule of law, that there are certain rules which people abide by. If the would-be first law officer of the country cannot abide by those fundamental principles as the upholder of the rule of law in a community, then the whole basis on which our society is structured is under challenge.
This is a very important and very serious matter, one which cannot in any way be underestimated. Senator Bolkus himself admitted to revealing the information and, 
 what is more, revealing more than what was already on the public record, and that was shown in his statement to Kerry O'Brien on the 7.30 Report. He said, `If you look at what I announced on that day and compare it to the article, there is very little different information,' and then the telling point, `Very little extra.' He admits to revealing extra information. The revealing of confidential court documents, as I have said, strikes at the very heart of the administration of justice in this country and in the way our society operates. As a would-be Attorney-General, that is completely unacceptable.
Our second basis for asking the Senate to censure Senator Bolkus is his disregard of the larger public interest in putting at risk the success of the legal action to obtain Skase's assets. This case against Mr Skase is being funded by the taxpayers of this country. Senator Bolkus owes an obligation to those taxpayers not to prejudice their hard-earned dollars which are being used in the chase for those Skase assets.
Our third point is that Senator Bolkus did this knowingly. In the Senate only some two or three years ago we censured a fellow senator for unwittingly revealing a tax file number in a document that he tabled in this place—might I add with the leave of Labor senator, Senator Crowley. I refer to the circumstance of Senator Michael Baume. Senator Michael Baume and Senator Crowley, in agreeing to it being tabled, did so unwittingly. They did not realise what they were doing. But Senator Bolkus, out of his own mouth, knew exactly what he was doing because in the transcript Senator Bolkus tells the media, `I can't give this document out.' He knows that he cannot do it but he said, `But maybe if I just read it out off the record.'
He knew what he was doing. He did so deliberately, he did so knowingly, in stark contrast to what Senator Baume did. Nevertheless, the Labor Party found it appropriate to censure Senator Baume. If somebody does something inadvertently and they are censured for it, is there not all the more reason that, when somebody deliberately and knowingly engages in that sort of behaviour, they ought 
 to be censured and are deserving of the condemnation and censure of this Senate?
We then call on Senator Bolkus to apologise for his actions. First of all, he should apologise to the trustee of the bankrupt estate, which makes sense; that he ought to apologise to the Federal Court for breaking their rules; and that he ought to apologise to the Senate. I have to say that there is one more very important point that is missing in this motion, and that is that he ought to be apologising to the people of Australia for prejudicing the whole case against Mr Skase.
Above and beyond that, we should call on the Leader of the Opposition to sack Senator Bolkus. For the would-be first law officer of this country to deliberately and knowingly breach the rules of the Federal Court is unacceptable behaviour. That stands to reason, it is very clear, and I would urge the Senate to support the censure motion.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-03-11,"—Let me say a few things about this censure motion. Firstly, I would put on the record that this is nothing more than an act of desperation by a government that is desperate. The only purpose of this motion is to cover up the government's failings, and the only outcome of this motion is to expose the government more.
Secondly, what we have here in this saga is the embodiment of abuse of Australian Federal Police resources and ministerial roles in respect of the Australian Federal Police. There has been selective police investigation and there has been selective use of police information. That is something for which the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice will continue to be condemned.
Thirdly, here we have nothing more than a political frame-up. I tell you, Senator Vanstone and Mr Williams: I am not going to take the rap for your mess-up; I am not going to take the rap for your incompetence. The government leaked a story in the silly season. It got a big run for it—`Skase hoard found' displayed across the Murdoch tabloids. I tell you what: that was the tip-off to Skase. I am not going to take the rap for your tip-off and for your incompetence once again, Senator Vanstone. 
Fourthly, let me put this on the record: I see this as nothing more than an act of revenge from a spiteful Prime Minister—a Prime Minister who, with the rest of his government, is prepared to smear, use innuendo and use police resources in pursuit of political objectives. This is a `get even' with me because I exposed the Attorney-General's inaction and condoning of an injustice in the High Court in respect of Mr Justice Callinan. I am being got at here for doing the job that Attorney-General Williams should have done, or that he was unable to do or too scared to do.
Let us face it, in this particular case ask anyone in the gallery; they all want to know: why is this most trivial of trivial pursuits being pursued? This most trivial of trivial pursuits is being pursued because the Prime Minister has lost his balance; little Johnny has lost his marbles in respect of this issue. That is why this matter continues to run.
—Order! Senator Bolkus, I think you should refer to the Prime Minister by his title.
—The Prime Minister has lost his marbles with respect to this particular matter. That is why he and those driven by vengeance on his side of the parliament continue to run this issue. The essence of this matter is that it would not stand up in any court in any country. I must say to Senator Abetz, `Eric, after your performance this morning, don't even try and defend people on parking fines.'
Let me put one thing clearly on the record. I did what the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice should have done last week: I rang the Australian Federal Police last Thursday at 12.55 p.m. They returned the call and I was told that I was not being investigated, that the investigation was not completed, that there were a couple of matters still to be resolved, but that I was not the target of them. Let us put that on the record. Let us put on the record that this is what the government should have done before they went into parliament, before the Attorney-General went 
 into parliament and smeared my name in a most dishonest way.
Let us put something else on the record as well. Had the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice done the most basic of checks—and I believe that the Attorney-General had been alerted to this anyway—they would have found out that I had not spoken to the Australian Federal Police since about 30 January, almost six weeks ago. For the Attorney-General to allege and imply and, by innuendo, put on the record that I was being investigated was basically wrong. But this basic fact has not stopped the campaign of smear—a campaign, as I say, which reached its highest level when the Attorney-General said in the House of Representatives last week, on 4 March, that the Minister for Justice had requested the AFP to investigate me.
—That's not true, and you know it.
—I will go through it again, Senator Vanstone. We have here a case of misleading the House of Representatives. Senator Vanstone's performance here can also amount to misleading of the Senate. Let me say to the government at this particular stage: call off the witch-hunt, it is getting you nowhere, it is exposing your deficiencies and it is doing absolutely nothing in terms of the standards of government in this place.
There was a leak on 5 January—there was a monumental leak on 5 January. It appeared in all the Murdoch tabloids across the country and it was written by David Luff in the Canberra bureau. It was detailed, it was revealing and it was the tip-off to Christopher Skase—and it was well sourced. The government's fingerprints were all over both pages of it—all over both of them, and you know it.
The initial response of Senator Vanstone was to say, `Well, Bolkus spoke to Luff.' But that did not carry at all because she knew that it was not true. She knew exactly who spoke to Luff, and it was not me. Anyone who has wanted to check this out since knows that neither I nor my office nor anyone on my behalf was the source of this particular article.
At midnight Australian Eastern Standard Time on 4 March, Christopher Skase would have had this article faxed to him in Majorca. It would have been 3.30 p.m. on a sunny  Sunday afternoon in Majorca. Skase would have picked this up, he would have rung his lawyers, he would have got them to shift the assets and he would have opened another bottle of champagne—all because government sources deemed it fit to leak a silly season good news story to try to prop up this incompetent, inept failure of a minister, the windbag that never stops.
Let me tell you what was in this article. What did this article reveal? Let us remind people what this article revealed. It revealed the nature of the action, the location of the assets, the objective of the action, investigations so far and future strategies—all that Christopher Skase needed to know was on this front page, good news for the minister, story on 5 January.
Let us have a look at it. What does this article say? It is worth putting this on the record because government members have conveniently glossed over it. The first paragraph says:
A fortune hidden overseas by fugitive tycoon Christopher Skase has been discovered by federal government investigators.
Christopher Skase knows where his assets are. He knew where they were. That first paragraph told Christopher Skase that they were on to him and they were pursuing his assets. The article continues:
The Daily Telegraph  has learned that the government has started legal action to recover the cash which has helped Skase fund his extravagant lifestyle.
It goes on to say:
The two main goals of the international legal proceedings—
and it is `proceedings' in plural—
are to freeze the fortune and then to liquidate the assets so that they can be returned to creditors in Australia.
It goes on to say how much; it was $10 million dollars. Then it states:
The money was moved out of Australia after Skase left after the failure of Quintex.
It goes on to revealingly state again:
Investigators have found their way through a maze of legal, business and banking systems to pinpoint the Skase assets.
What we have so far is a revelation from the government. `We know where your assets are. We have taken proceedings in a number of countries and we are about to get them.' The article says:
The proportion and location of Skase's hidden fortune which has been identified has not been revealed, but Skase has held bank accounts in Switzerland, Austria, England, Spain and the Caymen Islands.
Come on! We are not talking about Johnny the mug down the street here; we are talking about Christopher Skase, and a government sourced article that says, `We know where your assets were. We have traced them. We continue to trace them and we have started legal proceedings to seize them and bring them back to Australia.' What do you reckon he is going to think? Do you think he is going to think, `Vanstone is incompetent. She won't know where they are'? He may think that. It would not be a bad presumption, but what he would do is twig to it and shift the assets. That is exactly why investigators that morning were really down on the government, because the government had blown it. The article goes on:
Once Skase's assets are frozen, the government will attempt to liquidate the funds and return them to Australia. It is believed that Skase used the interim period to set up intricate international corporate networks to hide the assets from Australian authorities.
So you have told him what you know, but who told him? Slap bang in the middle of this article, it says—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, one is always reluctant to take a point of order in the course of a censure motion, but this is a very serious matter. There are specific allegations on the record. This person has had 10 minutes and he is talked about nothing to do with what is part of that motion. In those circumstances, despite the latitude one normally extends, he does not have a licence to simply distract attention and point to other issues that he might find sufficiently distracting. Mr Acting Deputy President, you ought to require him to address 
 those issues. If he has a defence and he is pleading not guilty, let us hear the evidence.  He has been given 20 minutes; he has wasted 10 of them so far.
—On the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President—
—I was going to rule that there was no point of order.
—I appreciate that you would do so, because it is a deliberate attempt on Senator Alston's part, when they are losing the argument in the debate, to try and make a miserable, pathetic debating point. He knows it is an abuse of the standing orders. I am pleased that you were going to rule him out of order.
—I thank the Leader of the Opposition. There is no point of order.
—I can understand why Senator Alston gets up, because I was going to say that slap bang in the middle of the article it says:
Justice Minister Vanstone is understood to be ready to announce the legal action attempting to freeze the assets.
It goes on to say:
Government sources said yesterday the minister now is awaiting confirmation that legal action can proceed, making it impossible for Skase to gain access to his fortunes.
This was to make the minister look good. What did you do? You blew it. You tipped him off and as a consequence people investigating the case felt really cheesed off that morning.
I am the one who has been hounding this government on Skase for the last 18 months. I am the one who, when the Attorney General, Mr Williams, fell asleep at the wheel and would not fund Mr Donnelly, pursued this matter both inside and outside this place. What I was doing that morning was telling this government that they should not continue to leak this information and should not proceed with this big-noting of themselves. The main game here was always to pursue this government to pursue Skase. What I was 
 doing was making it clear that the minister had totally messed up and the minister should stop messing up. It was definitely in the public interest for me to do that.
As I say, by 3.30 p.m. Majorca time Christopher Skase would have known from that article what the game was and it was about time the government was told—as they were the first time—that they ought to focus properly on the game. Mr Williams fell asleep, flicked off the file and did not provide cash last year to Mr Donnelly, and this time this minister should have clammed up and should not have leaked in the way that she did. The process had been blown and the investigation had been blown.
This monumental leak was not deemed worthy of investigation. On 8 January the minister ordered an investigation into the second leak, but not the first one. Why not? Because her messy fingerprints were all over the first one and the minister, her staff and the Prime Minister's political staff were all up to it. I spoke to the Australian Federal Police twice. They were very short and casual discussions. But when I spoke to them the first time, I said to them, `How can you investigate this leak without investigating the tip-off?'
The fact that I raised it with the Federal Police—not you, Minister—meant that it was squarely on the agenda that they should investigate the first leak. What we have here is the Minister for Justice abusing her position in respect of the Australian Federal Police. What did I do? We had a huge leak. I did a doorstop interview and quoted from two pages of a 32- or 33-page affidavit—two pages that were freely available to the media that morning.
I was given that document on the basis that I could read out one particular point but not others. What point did I read out? What was the point that I added to the public record? The point was from paragraph 109—but it appears elsewhere in the affidavit—where Mr Donnelly said that if this matter comes to the attention of the respondents, and in particular to the attention of Mr Skase, before interlocutory orders can be obtained in all jurisdictions, he had serious concerns that steps 
 would be taken to prejudice the substantive proceedings. 
—What about the press conference? Tell them what you did there.
—In the press conference, I drew the facts out of David Luff's article—and it was not hard to draw conclusions—and I made the point that this minister and this government ought to get back on the main game. We have here a document which most of the gallery knows was in the public domain. Not one person here would not have been given a bit of information from time to time from a journalist on the basis that only part of it be used or that it be used in certain ways. As appeared in the press the next day, Terry McCrann, with whom I have never had any contact, let alone on this issue, a person with whom my staff were in contact, had the whole story. Other journos had the affidavit—
—He couldn't bring himself to talk to scum like you.
—Senator Alston, I ask that you withdraw that remark.
—Okay.
—I ask you to stand and withdraw the remark.
—Very reluctantly, I do.
—I ask you to withdraw the remark.
—And I have.
—I ask you to withdraw it appropriately.
—I have.
—Would you stand and address the chair. I ask you to withdraw the remark.
—I have withdrawn.
—What is the government saying about a document which has public currency, is in the public domain, which the media discussed later that day and which appeared in full the next day? The government is saying that everyone else can use it, but not me. Why? Because the point I was making—and the only part of the affida 
 vit that I actually referred to and used to pursue that particular point—was to stress to the government that they had blown it.
—Why did you go off camera?
—I have already answered that, Senator Vanstone. In respect of everything else, blind Freddy could have read the David Luff article and drawn the inferences that I have drawn today and which I drew in that press conference. As I said, it appeared in full the next day. Pardon me for thinking that I had a right—and, in fact, a responsibility—to pull this government up on the abandoned way in which it was pursuing this matter.
A matter of urgency? A matter of censure? Senator Vanstone, if it has taken you 60 or 70 days to read what I said at a doorstop interview in Adelaide in January, no wonder Christopher Skase is still on the loose. No wonder you have not seized his assets. You blew this, Senator Vanstone, and I am not taking the rap for it. The real issue here goes to your incompetence, your big mouth, your leak, and it also goes to the administration of justice.
When an Attorney-General goes into a parliament and says that a particular person is being investigated when, through his question time briefs, he knows full well that that person is not; when a Minister for Justice comes into this place and says that there is no innocent explanation, when she knows through her question time briefs that there is one and that the federal police are not pursuing me, then you have an abuse of ministerial position.
You have an abuse of ministerial position in a most unsavoury and undemocratic way. When you use the resources of the police to pursue political interests, you are embarking on a police state. When you use the resources of the Federal Police to pursue political objectives, when you leak operational details, you have crossed the line. But we know that of you, because you always cross the line.
—On a point of order: I cannot give you a particular standing order, Mr Acting Deputy President—and I am sure 
 the clerk can be of assistance to you on that if you need it—but I have sat here quite patiently, not wanting to interrupt Senator Bolkus's opportunity to defend himself, but  I am not prepared to tolerate the imputation that I would misuse my position as Minister for Justice to inappropriately direct any investigation or, for that matter, to misuse police resources and turn Australia in some way into a police state. Not only is that not true—and I understand that that is a matter that I can answer for at another time—but it is a direct imputation against me and I do not ask, I demand, that it be withdrawn.
—On the point of order: neither of those matters is an imputation, those matters are facts, and the record should stand.
—I have been advised, Senator Vanstone, that it is a matter for debate and there is no point of order.
—Let me just stress the point again—
—And you'll keep too.
—Senator Vanstone, I heard that, and I ask you to withdraw what you said.
—In order to allow the debate to continue, I will withdraw.
—Let me go back to the point: I have pursued this government on Skase, and I will continue to do so. When this government tips him off, I will continue to haunt them in respect of it. What you had here, and what cannot be denied no matter how you try to fit me up, is my quoting from a document which was already in the public domain.
But I had two pages of a 32-page document. What you have to ask yourself, Minister Vanstone, is why people lost confidence in you that morning, after that leak. Everyone involved in the administration of this matter was convinced, as I and the media were, that that story came from your office. It was in the public interest for me to pursue this, and I will continue to pursue it.
Last Thursday afternoon, when this matter was brought on by the government, I was in here and I got an urgent phone call. I took it. It was a call from my son who rang me to say, `I was in Lygon Street this morning at a reasonable hour and someone attacked me from behind and mugged me.' I talked to him about it. He said, `You sound a bit distracted.' I said, `They're trying to mug me in here.' We had a chat about it, and I said, `Nick, you've been mugged by professionals. I've been attacked by Vanstone, Costello and Howard. Let's talk about your problem rather than mine.' Senator Vanstone, lift your game or get out of the job.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-03-11,"—With a good deal of regret, I rise to speak in support of this censure motion against Senator Bolkus. The basis for my regret is that, having listened very carefully to Senator Bolkus's non-explanation, which failed to address a single one of the issues in the case made out against him, there still remains such a clear and unequivocal case. The case shows a senator revealing the contents of a confidential court document, in reckless disregard of the consequences for the creditors of the bankrupt estate of Christopher Skase and for the taxpayers of Australia.
Last week, in the debate to suspend standing orders and on precedence, questions were asked in this place about the urgency and importance of this issue for the Senate. I was amazed that any senator, whatever their political persuasion—and this particularly goes for the Democrats—could fail to appreciate the overwhelming public interest in the Senate both debating and establishing one way or the other whether Senator Bolkus, an aspiring first law officer, acted in breach of his duty and in breach of trust and, thereby, brought the Senate into disrepute. I am sorry to say that, on examining the facts, this is the clearest possible case of an alternate first law officer undermining the authority of the Federal Court that he is supposed to uphold.
What compounds this outrage is that in a press conference he called—and it was not a doorstop but a press conference he called deliberately on 5 January 1998—he revealed 
 matters that were not in the public domain at that time. And it is worth remembering what those were. First, he confirmed that the government had started legal proceedings to freeze certain of the Skase assets. That had never been said. Then he revealed that the  proceedings were held in camera. That had never been said. As well, he identified that action was actually proceeding in four of the designated countries: Spain, the Cayman Islands, the United Kingdom and in the Federal Court of Australia. He did that deliberately, with reckless disregard for the consequences.
At first I honestly believed that Senator Bolkus must have done what he did in ignorance, that he did not appreciate that he was risking the very point of the court action being taken in the first place.
—No.
—No, deliberately.
—I did, I thought he must have just been ignorant about it.
—No, he is an absolute sleaze.
—Yes, Senator Alston, he is an absolute sleaze.
—Order! Senator Coonan, I think it would be appropriate if you withdrew that remark.
—It is a debating point.
—No, I think it is appropriate that you withdraw the word `sleaze'.
—I have a lot to say and not much time to say it in and so I will withdraw it, so that this debate can continue.
Unfortunately in the events that have happened it is impossible not to conclude that Senator Bolkus knew that he was behaving improperly and that what he divulged in public had the potential to sabotage the whole purpose for which these injunctive proceedings were taken in the first place. On closer examination, we find Senator Bolkus sneaking around at a critical stage of proceedings, divulging information that could scuttle the 
 whole case. He might as well have rung up Christopher Skase himself and read the affidavit to him direct.
The fact that Senator Bolkus had an acute appreciation of the seriousness of what he was doing is revealed in the transcript of his press conference in Adelaide on 5 January this year. He said:
I can't give this document out, but, maybe if I just read it out . . . This is the proceedings in the court—
and he knew! He said:
If this matter comes to the attention of the respondents and in particular the attention of Mr Skase, before the interlocutory orders can be obtained in all jurisdictions—
and remember, he has just talked about proceedings in four of them—
I have serious concerns that steps will be taken to prejudice the substantive proceedings.
When he was bleating all over the record, he knew and appreciated that proceedings were at a critical stage. The relevant sequence of events shows conclusively that Senator Bolkus's press conference was the first time there was any confirmation of recovery proceedings against Skase's bankrupt estate in those nominated countries.
What is really disappointing about Senator Bolkus's conduct is not only that he was the one to reveal the specific critical information about the legal strategy, but that he then sought to deny it. We have had this extraordinary performance this morning where he has sought to continue to blame the minister, Senator Vanstone. It has been a cowardly and unwarranted attack.
But no matter how much Senator Bolkus tries to wriggle and squirm out of this, he is condemned out of his own mouth. Let me tell you why. If Senator Bolkus truly believed that the story was already leaked and that the affidavit was already with the media, as he has since confirmed on the ABC 7.30 Report, why was he so reticent about handing it over to the media at his press conference on 5 January? He said:
I can't give this document out, but, maybe if I just read it out. . . This is the proceedings in the court. . . 
I ask honourable senators: why would he bother doing this if he genuinely believed or 
 knew at that time, as he now says, that the affidavit was already with the media? That is just nonsensical. Secondly, Senator Bolkus now says in a doorstop interview on 5 March  1998 that he made an assessment of the material that was in the media.
—`A careful assessment'.
—`A careful assessment,' Senator Alston. He made a judgment that nothing he read out on 5 January added much more to what he had already revealed. Implicit in that statement is an admission that he did add more and that what had appeared in the media that morning was, in fact, not as much as he was now talking about. How much more he revealed is not the point. How was Senator Bolkus to know what effect what he had said would have? He just did not know that. He was reckless in what he did because he did not know what effect what he said that was extra would have. Then, to compound it, two critical pages from the affidavit conveniently marked up with parts Senator Bolkus had read out at his press conference got boxed in the parliamentary press gallery. If Senator Bolkus did this, isn't it curious that he would be actually giving back to the media what he said they already had?
The sad conclusion to be drawn from Senator Bolkus's antics is that not only does he lack the precision of judgment to be expected from an average lawyer, but he also lacks the integrity essential to discharging the duty of a legal practitioner to the court and, as we said in the debate last week, any disciplinary body would have to look seriously at whether that would be something that would warrant his being struck off. He has also destroyed any public confidence that could remain in his trustworthiness to be the first law officer of Australia. He has brought the Senate into disrepute.
This is not just a case of dropping the dead donkey; this is a serious case of reckless indifference to the public interest, which lies overwhelmingly in effectively pursuing the scurrilous Skase. Senator Bolkus has raised the barrier for the government, the nation and the taxpayers of Australia just that little bit 
 higher, and for that alone he should be censured and sacked.
There has been a great deal of debate about the status of this affidavit and how it got into the hands of Senator Bolkus and one or more of the journalists.
—I wonder if he told the police where he got it?
—I do not think he has told the police, Senator Vanstone. What is blindingly obvious is that, however it got there, it was improperly obtained. I think it is worth saying that in an ex parte application to a court, confidentiality and speed are of the essence. The point of this application was to freeze assets before they could be moved. The usual procedure in the Federal Court is that an appointment is made through the registrar with a duty judge, and counsel attend the judge in chambers. Orders are then made including orders for service and sometimes substituted service—I am quite certain it would be substituted service in this case because it is so difficult otherwise to effect service—and you also get a return date, when you go back to court and review the matter.
In these circumstances there is virtually no opportunity for the documents in support of the application to be inspected before they are served on the respondent, and letters have been tabled from the trustee saying he did not authorise anyone on his behalf to look at the documents. A letter from the deputy registrar in the Federal Court has been tabled advising that no affidavit can be inspected without leave of the court and that no application had been made for that purpose, and the registrar also confirmed that no application had been made in those circumstances.
However, the affidavit had been obtained, and it is clear that it had been improperly obtained somehow. Even though Senator Bolkus may not have been in practice in the superior courts for many years, the confidentiality of these proceedings and the consequences of dealing with journalists—who, to their credit, behaved more responsibly than Senator Bolkus—must have been pretty obvious.
But the biggest blow to Senator Bolkus's credibility is that he contradicts himself. In the 7.30 Report transcript, he says he got his copy of the document from a journalist, and in Hansard on Monday, 9 March he denies that he quoted from an illegally or improperly  obtained Federal Court affidavit. Senator Vanstone says it was clearly shown that Senator Bolkus had quoted from an illegally or improperly obtained Federal Court document. Senator Bolkus says:
You know that's not true.
Senator Vanstone says:
I recognise that interjection. `You know that's not true'—is that what you said?
Senator Bolkus says:
Of course you know it's not true.
So we have two contradictions from Senator Bolkus: one that he did it and one that he did not do it, and for Senator Bolkus to effectively deny that he was aware that the document was improperly obtained just simply strains the bounds of credibility. Either Senator Bolkus is duplicitous or stupid—
—Or both.
—There is a third possibility, Senator Abetz, and that is he is an opportunist prepared to risk the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars in this country for his own grubby, political ends. What is laughable is Senator Bolkus's ham-fisted attempt to blame Senator Vanstone for leaking the document. What a preposterous suggestion! Even the Daily Telegraph , in the responsible way in which it dealt with this matter, said in its editorial on 6 January this year:
We took the decision to publish the report against the wishes of Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone, who expressed a fear that our article would somehow imperil that legal process.
—Why would you leak and ask them not to publish?
—Exactly that. The Daily Telegraph  went on to make the pretty obvious point that any suggestion that the government was the source of leaking this document was `nonsensical'. Labor has simply bungled the chase for Skase in a spectacular fashion and Senator Bolkus seems 
 to be doing his level best to compound it. He ought to be censured.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-11,"—The Democrats consider this matter a particularly serious one. As I understand the motion before us, Senator Bolkus has misused information in a way that is directly contrary to the public interest. The background to this particular debate is that the newspapers reported on 5 January this year that the government was moving to freeze the Skase assets. The office of the Minister for Justice as we have heard in this debate and previously, has claimed that it was very particular to limit comment on that particular report on the basis that it was likely to affect the conduct of ongoing proceedings in the Federal Court. On the same day Senator Bolkus held a press conference where he read from a document. I know this has been put on record a number of times, but this is a particularly important point in the Democrats making a decision. Senator Bolkus stated when he read from this document:
I can't give this document out but maybe if I just read it off the record. This is the proceedings in the court.
I am advised that he then read from a document which was an affidavit from an in camera Federal Court proceedings. As I understand it, this was a leaked document. The Democrats have obtained from the minister in writing an assurance that the Federal Court did not release this document. The minister has also provided my party with a copy of a letter from Max Donnelly which clearly states that he did not authorise the release of the affidavit, nor did he authorise his solicitor to release it.
The Democrats have not seen, and I certainly have not seen, the affidavit in question. In fact, I have refused to see or take a copy of this document. I would suggest that if my party, and I, as the spokesperson for the Attorney-General and justice portfolios, can make a judgment that a confidential document with potentially detrimental effects should not be disclosed then perhaps Senator Bolkus and others in this place should make the same judgment. However, I rely on the assurances 
 from the minister that the document which is the subject of this motion is in fact the document from which Senator Bolkus was reading on 5 January 1998. I am happy to be corrected on these points. I have listened to the debate so far and I have not heard a contrary argument on this particular point.
—Senator Bolkus admits that.
—I know you are trying to assist me, Senator Abetz, but you have had your turn. Therefore, the essence of what we have is that Senator Bolkus received a document which was confidential and a privileged court document. The contents of this document were then disclosed, and I am advised that this disclosure then damaged the court proceedings. I accept that this may be, and this is a debatable point, but that is our advice.
The Democrats are not going to participate in the `he says, she says' arguments that we have had here, and we have certainly witnessed them in question times over the last week or so. We do believe this issue is clear: Senator Bolkus disclosed the contents of a confidential and privileged document. How much of this had already been disclosed, that the interview was effectively over and how available the document was are all irrelevant to this debate. We certainly took on board the arguments of Senator Bolkus and others on the opposition side in relation to the sense that the document may have already been leaked or be available or have been distributed, but that is not relevant to the debate in relation to this motion. It was a confidential and privileged document and yet the contents of that document were disclosed to the public at large.
Claims that the document was leaked from the minister's office are also irrelevant to this debate for now. If it turns out that the document did come from the minister's office then we will have another issue which will need to be addressed on another occasion, but that is not the matter of debate before us. These are serious allegations and the veracity of these claims must be tested. Similarly, we take on board concerns of Senator Bolkus and his 
 claims that he feels he has been smeared by statements by members in this place and the other place that he is somehow subject to investigation by the AFP. That is a matter that is not directly relevant to the motion in front of us. I say now that the concerns I express here apply equally to the possible disclosure of this document by the office of the minister or by any other office. But just because another has disclosed a confidential and privileged document does not justify any following disclosures.
The only circumstances where it may be justified to disclose a confidential or a privileged document is where the public interests are served by that disclosure. Cases, for example, where whistleblowers have released confidential documents are examples of this, and I would examine each of those matters in the particular circumstances. However, I do not think providing information that allows Christopher Skase to further evade the law is sufficient excuse. I have said in discussions with members of the opposition and, in fact, with Senator Bolkus himself, that my party was happy and willing to be convinced on a matter of public interest. So far we have not been.
Many of us here, certainly on the crossbenches and perhaps on the opposition benches, understand the temptations to disclose documents that lead to criticism against this government. As I have said, there are times when this may be appropriate, and we would need to analyse those reasons. But it is wrong to disclose confidential and privileged information just because you have access to it or perhaps it will make a good story.
Today's censure motion asks Senator Bolkus to apologise for his actions to Max Donnelly, the Federal Court and the Senate. Unless there is an extremely good excuse—and I have not heard an extremely good excuse this far in the debate, and certainly not from Senator Bolkus—these apologies are acceptable and my party will support them. We have listened to the arguments, we have listened to Senator Bolkus, and I must say that some of his political arguments sounded quite convincing, but his legal defence was not. He may be hounding the government 
 over Christopher Skase but, as I said, a lot of that issue is irrelevant to the issue before us, which is whether or not certain contents of a privileged document, a Federal Court affidavit, were revealed on the public record. It does not matter how little or how much of that affidavit was revealed or where it originally came from—or even the consequences of that particular action. They are not the relevant matters.
I am also anxious to place on record the functions and the role of the Attorney-General and those in opposition who hope to fill that particular position. The Attorney-General has a dual function as both the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and as the first law officer of the Commonwealth. It is this second function which attaches to the office the responsibility to strive to promote the law and the rule of law in a representative democracy. I am concerned, and so is my party, that in this case a would-be Attorney-General has acted contrary to the legal institutions in Australia. Our court system depends on legal practices, such as in camera hearings, in order to achieve justice. The Attorney-General and those aspiring to that position must recognise the important first law officer function by striving to maintain these institutions.
As I have said, my party has treated this matter with utmost seriousness. We have been a little dismayed over the last couple of days with the protracted nature of this debate. We place on record our concern at some of the filibustering. We thought it was time to air the arguments and to resolve this issue. I believe the arguments have been aired satisfactorily; we have listened carefully to the debates and we now believe that this matter should be resolved. We are not interested in the politics of this debate. We are interested in the facts, the legalities and the consequences. There is one fact that cannot be denied and that is that Senator Bolkus read onto the records certain contents of a Federal Court affidavit.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-11,"—I might say that I am somewhat disappointed by the position taken by the Democrats. It was clearly and well 
 articulated, but that does not mean the conclusion is right. Before turning to the body of my remarks, I would like to take up the conclusion that the Democrats have reached in their presentation here this morning. They say that the offence is that there was a quotation made by Senator Bolkus from a privileged document. That is the offence and therefore, since that is established in their minds, Senator Bolkus should be censured.
I want to put to the Democrats that that is in fact not the offence here. What is clear is that the information that breached the confidentiality of that court document was in the public domain before it reached Senator Bolkus. It was published in the press as such and the alerting of Mr Skase, and therefore his ability to take evasive action to protect his own self-interest against the self-interest of this nation, had occurred. It had occurred before Senator Bolkus did anything at all with any particular document.
The offence is the leaking of the document. This is a document of the Federal Court and it is a document that we, on our side, believe was leaked by the Minister for Justice or her office. It is peculiar and, in the context of all the heat and fury generated by the government over this issue, extremely odd that the investigation commissioned into the leaking of this document was not into the leaking of it but into the use of it by Senator Bolkus. That was the investigation that the Minister for Justice undertook. Why didn't she—and this question has never been answered to any satisfactory extent—do the obvious thing that she ought to have done, that her public duty screamed out to her to do, and commission an investigation into who leaked the document? That is where the offence occurred. Why didn't the investigation address the offence?
—It did.
—It did not. The investigation did not address the question of who leaked the document. Until that is investigated and until we actually know who did it, we do not know who breached the confidentiality of the Federal Court. What is notorious in this matter is that the information about Skase was in the public domain. The covenant of secrecy had been breached. The public interest was in 
 jeopardy because Skase could then escape. All that happened before Senator Bolkus touched the document. That is the offence here and that is what ought to be addressed in this debate. I ask the Democrats to reconsider their position on the basis of that argument as well and not, I respectfully put to them, rush to judgment on the basis of a very narrow  interpretation of the particular motion before the chair. This is a targeted motion to try to assassinate the career of someone who has been a very effective shadow spokesman and who has illustrated in public debate and by his actions the perfidy of this government when it comes to the meting out of justice in this nation.
The Leader of the Opposition here in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, has rebutted in considerable and clinical detail the arguments put forward by the shadow minister and has revealed in fact that there is no case to answer. Senator Bolkus himself has stood in his place and defended himself from the scurrilous attack upon his standing and his reputation, and revealed as well that there is no case to answer. What is worth asking in this debate is: do the accusers of Senator Bolkus come to this matter with clean hands? What are their motives?
I submit to this chamber that they do not come with clean hands, that they do not have honest motives in this matter, and that they do have something to hide. I submit that the government does have an obvious political reason for attacking Senator Bolkus in this way and trying to bring him down. Senator Bolkus's key accusers on the government side are the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, the Minister for Justice, Senator Vanstone, and that very odd being, backbencher Senator Abetz.
Let me take up this thread of argument and develop it a little further because basically it goes to the government's motive here in attacking the shadow minister. At the beginning of this year, the Liberal Party held a retreat at Thredbo to contemplate their tactics for the coming year, 1998—a year in which there is obviously going to be an election. What is clear from their tactics is that they 
 decided they would go on the offensive but, when they rose from their meeting in Thredbo, they encountered their first obstacle—Senator Bolkus. The issue in the public domain at around that time was the High Court matter concerning the Hindmarsh Island Bridge case, and the first obstacle they encountered was a forensic Senator Bolkus, who nailed the fact that the High Court Justice Callinan—
—The only connection he has with the law is as a defendant.
—Will you just shut up and take your turn.
—Order! I know that this is a robust debate but it would be better run if you addressed your remarks through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will. Let us recall what happened in this case. Here was a case in which the government of Australia was a litigant. That is fact No. 1. Here was a case in which the question was: had a newly appointed High Court judge, who many people in Australia thought had a particular public bias in many of his expressions of opinion, expressed an opinion on a matter that he was going to be called to sit in judgment on? As far as the judge was concerned, he had not. A court proceeding began to test that argument. The evidence that was adduced in that court proceeding was not all the evidence within the knowledge of the government of this country. They were a litigant in this proceeding; they took the view, it could be clearly argued, that they wanted this judge to sit on that case so that the bench would be stacked in their favour—it was a case that they were arguing.
But did they put in the public domain all of the information about whether or not this judge had expressed an opinion on the matter that he had forgotten about? They did not. Senator Abetz, who is the chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, derives no credit from the fact that Senator Bolkus wanted to convene a meeting of that committee to adduce a document which made the issue clear. Senator 
 Abetz walked out of the meeting, thus depriving that committee of a quorum. That deliberate act of sabotage to the interests of justice of this nation was carried out by Senator Abetz.
As it turned out, Senator Bolkus, in persisting in the pursuit of justice here, obviously drew the matter to the attention of the High  Court judge, who then disqualified himself saying that he had forgotten—he could not remember—that he had expressed the opinion in this way. If we had known that up-front, the legal action about whether or not he was entitled to sit would not have taken place. But who knew this evidence all along and did not say a word? The Attorney-General of Australia. I am surprised to hear from Senator Vanstone that this man is described as the first law officer of the Commonwealth. The first law officer of the Commonwealth surely has an obligation to the concept of justice in this nation. Surely, the first law officer of the Commonwealth has an obligation to see that, when a High Court judge is being dealt with in a legal proceeding to see if he is right, fit and proper to sit on a case, all the evidence about his conduct is known. It is surely an obligation on the first law officer to see that the process of justice is observed.
Surely it is an obligation on the first law officer of the nation, as well as in the interests of all litigants, to see that the game is conducted fairly and that justice is not only done but is seen to be done. But what did the first law officer of the Commonwealth do? He said nothing. He sat mute. He had the information. He did not disclose it. Who revealed all of this? Senator Bolkus. It was a major embarrassment for a newly sworn-in High Court judge on his first major case, a significant embarrassment for the government, and the very reason why now the trained legal talent of the government side is on Senator Bolkus to try to bring him down. He revealed your improper actions in this matter and he disgraced you in the public mind because of your conduct.
Let us get it clear that in this particular circumstance there is real motive and the 
 Attorney-General's actions here cannot be held, in any circumstances, to be actions in the public interest. The Attorney-General has simply acted not as the first law officer of the Commonwealth but as the legal officer for the government. Moreover, as a legal officer for the government he withheld information that ought to have been in the public domain when the government was a litigant in a case so that the government's chance of winning their case was improved.
In saying that I am not taking a position on the matter before the court. But at least in terms of the procedure here the first law officer of the Commonwealth ought to have conducted himself not as the government's legal officer but as the first law officer of the Commonwealth. The fact that he was disgraced by Senator Bolkus adds absolutely to motive when we look at the scurrilous attempts now to try to bring the reputation of Senator Bolkus down.
Let us now turn to Senator Vanstone, who is Senator Bolkus's accuser in this chamber. Senator Vanstone is not without form on the matter of leaking. Let me go to October, 1990—a month that would ring in the ears of Senator Vanstone because it involved the disclosure of in camera evidence given to the Joint National Crime Authority Committee. This is the allegation that is being made—
—On a point of order: how can a convoluted discussion about Mr Justice Callinan, followed by some suggestions of involvement between the National Crime Authority and Senator Vanstone, have anything whatsoever to do with a censure motion that is specifically confined to the conduct of Senator Bolkus?
—Senator Cook is entitled to go to Senator Vanstone's motives if he believes they are simply malicious. This is the reason for moving the motion so he is entitled to go to that. He is also entitled to go over other areas so that people can make a judgment as to the seriousness of Senator Vanstone's charges as compared with how other people are treated and other areas are considered. Of course he is entitled.
—That is simply carte blanche for saying that you can throw around 
 as much mud as you like on any subject as long as it reflects adversely on the person who moves the motion. That cannot possibly be the rule in this chamber. The fact is that it is a debate about the conduct of Senator Bolkus. You cannot in any shape or form use that tawdry excuse to justify an attack on the motives of the mover of the motion, let alone suggest that somehow it is a contest between  the two parties. This is an issue that goes to the heart of Senator Bolkus's conduct.
—I think Senator Alston has slightly misinterpreted what I said. I made two points, the first of which was about intent, which he did not contest. Senator Cook is entitled to discuss other issues so that people may make a weighty judgment as to whether the charges made by Senator Vanstone deserve merit given the circumstances of other treatment that has not been censured.
—How can it possibly affect the weight that one attaches to the conduct of Senator Bolkus to know whether Senator Vanstone might have done a range of other things? That is like saying that if an accuser has ever been in trouble with the law that person is not entitled to make allegations. It is like saying that if someone has been raped and they happen to have a conviction for shoplifting, they should not be heard. It is saying that you can somehow defend the case by purely attacking your accuser. That cannot be right. Senator Cook has had nearly 15 minutes. This is a debate about the conduct of Senator Bolkus. It cannot affect the conduct of Senator Bolkus to know what other people might think of the conduct of Senator Vanstone. That by definition is unrelated. Hypothetically, she might have all the motives in the world for seeking political advantage—it would not be the first time in this chamber—but how can that possibly assist people in understanding the merits of the allegations contained in this charge sheet? This is about the conduct of Senator Bolkus.
—This is not a court of law.
—It is an attempt to try to deal with issues. It is a parliament in which a motion is before the chair, and we are 
 trying to determine whether or not there is any defence—Bolkus certainly has not adduced one this morning—to explain away those allegations. It cannot possibly assist in that process to try to smear Senator Vanstone.
—I hear the points from both sides—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I will make just one more point on the issue. It is the government's time we are wasting here; it is a government motion.
—I realise that.
—Senator Cook's right to question  Senator Vanstone in terms of what credibility she has generally and then relate that back to the credibility of her claims is absolutely in order, because if we are to test the credibility of Senator Vanstone's claims she has to be a credible person.
—In a censure debate of this nature—a wide ranging and at times robust debate, to use the kinds of words that have been used here this morning—I would expect accusations to be made from both sides. I take the point of Senator Alston, but I rule that there is no point of order. However, I would ask Senator Cook to keep as much as he possibly can to the subject at hand.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think that is the right ruling, and I am pleased you have made it. I am developing in this chamber at the moment a point which is obviously uncomfortable to the government, hence their squawking. The point is this: an absolutely scurrilous attack has been made upon Senator Bolkus's reputation, and an attempt to censure him in this parliament has arisen from that. It is entirely proper for the opposition, as we have done through Senator Faulkner and through Senator Bolkus himself, to demolish the argument made against him that is the substance of this attack.
It is also entirely proper for the opposition to look at the motives of the attackers. It is convenient for the government to argue that only Senator Bolkus is on trial here. Senator 
 Alston seems to think that this is a court. It is not; it is a political chamber. He is the first to use it as a court for every political purpose he can when it suits him.
It is entirely appropriate to look at the motives. The first motive is that Senator Bolkus is a thorn in the government's side. A High Court judge stood down from a case. The government did not introduce the evidence to justify why he should; Senator Bolkus did. This is a High Court case in which the government itself is a litigant. The ordinary person on the street has an entitlement to say, `Let us get it right: the government was taking this case; it knew that the judge should not sit; it thought the judge was going to decide in its favour so it did not say anything.' That is surely relevant to this matter.
Before I turn, as I will in a moment, to Senator Vanstone, it is also relevant in this case that the Attorney-General and Senator Vanstone have been repeatedly making allegations about Senator Bolkus while knowing that the AFP, the Australian Federal Police, have investigated Senator Bolkus and that Senator Bolkus is cleared. Questions that ought to be answered in this debate is: when did they find out that the Australian Federal Police had investigated Senator Bolkus and cleared him, and did they find that out before they started making their allegations about Senator Bolkus or after? That is, are they continuing to make allegations about Senator Bolkus knowing that in fact the AFP investigation of Senator Bolkus has concluded and that that investigation has cleared him?
This does raise questions about justice. The obligation of the first law officer of this nation is to protect the institution of justice. Engaging in this political debate to score political points, knowing the fact that the investigation has concluded and has cleared the person he is attacking, hardly serves justice in the true sense of the word; it serves political opportunity. That is the nub of this debate. That is why the motives of those people making these allegations should be investigated.
I now turn to Senator Vanstone and October 1990, when she made public in camera evidence given to the Joint Committee on the NCA. In a minority report, Senator Vanstone and three other coalition members of the committee released confidential evidence not authorised for release by the committee. Does that sound like the allegation being made here against Senator Bolkus? Is it being made by someone without form, with clean hands? It is not.
Senator Vanstone has form in leaking in camera evidence. The fact that she is making that allegation about Senator Bolkus as loudly as she can, at the top of her lungs whilst drawn up on the balls of her feet, is to deflect attention from the issue that the opposition contends remains at the nub of this: who leaked the documents in the first place? It is something that Senator Vanstone has not investigated.
Let us go to the next example of where Senator Vanstone's hands are far from clean. I have here an excerpt from the Adelaide Advertiser of 6 September 1996 headed `Vanstone wants uni spies on spending'. We know that Senator Vanstone, the former minister for education, was dumped from the cabinet by this government to the role of Minister for Justice, the junior minister for the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, because of her unfortunate inability to handle the education portfolio in a way that students and educationists of Australia could feel any confidence in her stewardship at all.
This is back in the days in which Senator Vanstone had glory, back in the days in which she was a minister in the cabinet. What did she say? She said—I assume the Adelaide Advertiser quoted her accurately:
""What's the problem with an academic—when they realise there is an administrative inefficiency—dobbing the university in?""
The article goes on to say:
They should contact the media to alert the community to the wastage.
Then she says:
"". . . put a piece of paper in a brown bag to raise the problems— 

and she goes on. Here is a person about whom there is a real suspicion in the public mind and a direct accusation from us that she leaked this material telling people how to leak material.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I know you have already ruled on the point of order raised by Senator Alston, but this is a separate matter. Senator Cook is discussing something to do with higher education. It has absolutely no relevance to the—
—On the point of order—
—Hold on, I have to finish.
—On the point of order—
—Wait until I hear what Senator O'Chee has to say, Senator Cook, and then you can make any point you like.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, this discussion which Senator Cook is now leading relates to higher education. I know you have already ruled that it is appropriate to look at the circumstances surrounding an allegation against Senator Bolkus, but this can in no way relate to the circumstances of the allegation against Senator Bolkus, nor can it in any possible sense relate to the motives that we on the government side have in raising this censure motion. This is just a time waster.
—I have already ruled that a censure motion does range far and wide. In this particular case Senator Cook has been getting wider but, with one minute to go, I would like to hear what else he has to say.
—The point that I am making here is that we believe that the material was leaked by Senator Vanstone's office. Here in the Adelaide Advertiser  of 6 September are leaking instructions issued on the public record by Senator Vanstone. One cannot say that this person is innocent and does not know how to do that job. She is advising others how to do it.
—To whistle blow.
—A whistleblower; that is right—how to go about leaking material. We know Senate Vanstone is a past master at this. The accuser in this case stands accused. But the real offence here is who leaked the material and broke the confidentiality in the first place. Senator Vanstone should plead guilty.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-11,"—A censure motion in this chamber is a very serious matter indeed. I have listened carefully to what has transpired. Most of the time I have found it more beneficial to listen from my office rather than get mixed up in the acrimony that has flowed from either side of this chamber.
Censure motions are normally directed against ministers of the Crown for perceived failure to perform their functions as ministers of the Crown. There have been a number of those censure motions over a period. Very few censure motions have been directed against individual private senators who are not members of the government. I will come to that in a moment.
The motion that we have before us notes a number of things. It states:
that Senator Bolkus, during and after a press conference on 5 January 1998, revealed certain contents of a confidential Federal Court affidavit . . . 
That has been made out. It is clear. It is correct in that that occurred. The motion continues:
that this affidavit formed part of legal proceedings undertaken by Mr Max Donnelly, trustee of the bankrupt estate of Mr Christopher Skase, to recover assets allegedly concealed by Mr Skase . . . 
Again, that is a fact. It continues:
that Federal Court affidavits may only be obtained by leave of the court or a judge . . . 
That is a fact. That is the rules of the court.
that in relation to the affidavit revealed by Senator Bolkus no such leave had been obtained,
Again, that is correct. It further says:
that Mr Donnelly had not authorised the release of the affidavit by either his firm or solicitors acting for him;
Again, that is clearly not in dispute. But then the motion goes on to censure Senator Bolkus for:
	 (i)	 revealing the contents of a confidential Federal Court affidavit,
	 (ii)	 his disregard of the larger public interest in putting at risk the success of Mr Donnelly's legal attempts to recover assets belonging to the bankrupt estate of Mr Christopher Skase, and
	 (iii)	 his knowingly taking a course of action directly contrary to the public interest . . . 
I will just deal with that before I go on to paragraph (c). With regard to those particular matters, let me first of all come back to the  point that there have been only three, I think, censure motions that I know of that have been directed against private members—the latest one of which was against Senator Baume in March 1995. That was a motion which censured Senator Baume for including in some of his tabled documents a tax file number of a particular taxpayer. He did so inadvertently and it was clear that he was not aware of that. As a matter of fact, I moved an amendment that we note he was not aware of the tax file number. It stated:
. . . that Senator Baume, in seeking the leave of the duty Minister and the Senate to table the documents in question, was not aware of and thus did not draw attention to the tax file number identified therein, publication of which otherwise than under cover of parliamentary privilege was a criminal offence.
That was included in the motion. I actually voted for that motion. Just for the record, Senator Bolkus also voted for that motion. But here we have a very serious matter indeed. A lot of the discussion here has been absolutely irrelevant. The question is whether Senator Bolkus should be censured for doing what he did. On balance, I would have thought that, whilst he is not a minister of the Crown, he certainly is the shadow Attorney-General. If the opposition wins the next election, in due course Senator Bolkus will no doubt be desirous of being the first law officer of the Crown. I think it is important for the Senate to take this action to uphold not only its credibility as an institution but also the credibility of the courts. I will be voting accordingly.
Paragraph (c) calls on Senator Bolkus to apologise for his actions to Mr Max Donnelly, the trustee of the bankrupt estate of Christo 
 pher Skase, to the Federal Court and to the Senate. I am always a little hesitant about asking people to apologise like kids. An apology has to come from within. One hopes that that comes from within Senator Bolkus himself. But I am not keen on that. It reminds me of being asked 30 years ago to apologise to certain members of the federal executive of the Labor Party for expressing a view that they were friends of the communists. I really do not think it is terribly appropriate to push that particular part of the motion. With regard to the rest of the motion, it seems to me to be a clear-cut case and I will be supporting that.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-03-11,"—Senator Harradine is absolutely correct. This is a very serious matter which goes to the heart of the administration of justice. It clearly has a great deal to do with the standards that are applied in public office and the extent to which legal forms and ethical proprieties are upheld. The critical issue, and I think Senator Harradine put his finger on it, is that Senator Bolkus has simply pleaded no contest. He has come in here and sought to distract attention by talking about everything but the real issue.
The fact is that he should not have used these documents, even to confirm a speculative press report. But to deliberately go further and release critical information is to compound the felony. To see this, we do not need to go very far beyond the 7.30 Report interview which Senator Bolkus gave on 5 March, where he told Kerry O'Brien, `I did a very close check of the articles that morning.' In other words, these were not the actions of a political tyro, someone who did not understand the process; someone who got a bit carried away with his enthusiasm. This is a seasoned political operator. This is basically a person who has never had a job in his life other than as part of the political process. He knows the game backwards; he knew exactly what he was doing and he carefully checked the articles that morning.
He then told Kerry O'Brien that in fact he had released information that was additional to that contained in the press reports. That is what says it all. The fact is that he should not 
 have even laid a finger on those documents, even if they were in the public arena. The argument of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate seems to be that because these documents are, he thought, on the public record—what he meant by that, presumably, is that they are outside the court—it is then open season; anyone can do whatever they like. Bolkus did not think that because Bolkus said, `I can't give this document out. But maybe if I just read it out, presumably off the record, this is the proceedings in the court.'  He then proceeds to quote from it and ends up by saying, `As I say, I cannot give them out.'
So this is a conscious and deliberate action on his part. That is what concerns us so much. This is not only a deliberate flouting of the rules of the court, but it is also action that has very significant consequences. It puts at risk the successful recovery of assets of someone whose behaviour is notorious, someone about whom the Australian public has the greatest concern and is wanting action to be taken. Of course, millions of dollars have been invested in the pursuit of those assets and indeed the bankrupt himself, and at this stage to very little avail.
Quite clearly, there was a significant operation being undertaken. It is unfortunate that the matter got into the public arena. But clearly it was against the wishes of Senator Vanstone, because that is made abundantly clear by the editorial in the Daily Telegraph, where they confirm that she had sought to dissuade them from running the article. Then they effectively said that Bolkus's line was simply unbelievable.
—Order! Senator Bolkus.
—Senator Bolkus's line was unbelievable because he was simply trying to smear his accuser, and that is par for the course. The fact of the matter is that Senator Bolkus's record shows that he has never had any respect for the law and he has never had any respect for ethics or propriety. In fact, ethical standards and Bolkus is a contradiction in terms.
—Order! Senator Bolkus.
—Senator Bolkus. What we have here is a deliberate and calculated action to put political advantage ahead of the interests of the taxpayer in seeking to recover assets by deliberately going on the record and doing whatever it takes, at whatever cost and at whatever expense to the taxpayer or the trustee of the estate, in order to achieve personal aggrandisement and political advantage. It has backfired spectacularly and that is quite clear. What is entirely regrettable is that Senator Bolkus has not been prepared to come into this chamber and accept responsibility for his actions. It is a classic example.
It is one thing to effectively hope that it will all go away and to not contest the issues—which he has not done. But he is brazenly carrying on and trying to throw as much mud as possible and raising all these red herrings about who leaked what documents. There is nothing to suggest, from what he said, that when interviewed by the police he did anything other than refuse to cooperate and suggest that they widen their investigations to take in the actions of Senator Vanstone. In other words, he was not in the slightest bit interested in assisting them in their inquiries; but that is an irrelevancy. That is not the issue before this chamber. The issue is that he revealed the contents of a confidential Federal Court affidavit. He did not do it accidentally or inadvertently. He did it absolutely deliberately and in a calculated political fashion to achieve political advantage.
Those are actions which deserve not only utmost censure; they demand action from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who I see has done yet another backflip on the charter of budget honesty. He is someone who has no conception of what is expected of the Labor Party by the Australian public. He might have his own standards, but he is simply not interested in ensuring that any standards apply to behaviour and conduct. In those circumstances, he should have no choice at all but to stand Senator Bolkus down. He is quite clearly unfit to hold office in this country again. His behaviour over a long 
 period of time—going back more than a quarter of a century—makes it perfectly plain that he has utter contempt for anything that gets in the road of political advantage. In those circumstances, not only does he deserve censure from this chamber, but he ought to be stood down. He ought to be told by the Leader of the Opposition that that behaviour is totally unacceptable.
I am grateful to Senator Ray for pointing out to us that we have already had valuable government time expended on this issue—well beyond what it should have taken. We saw a deliberate and calculated filibuster  yesterday. We have had MPIs and we had 29 notices of motion. They are doing absolutely everything to avoid having this matter dealt with, and even as late as last night it did not look as though Senator Bolkus was even going to come in here and say anything on the record, because he was clearly afraid he might mislead the chamber. So eventually he decided on a tactic of coming in here and talking about everything else.
—Rubbish!
—I take Senator Ray's point that enough valuable time has been spent on this matter. I therefore move:

Presumably he would like to have yet another diversionary discussion on the issue. In those circumstances, we are prepared to grant him leave.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-11,"—That is most gracious of you, Senator Alston. Mr Acting Deputy President, we are faced with a censure motion that has been gagged. That is most unusual. When former Senator Baume was facing a censure motion in this chamber—two years ago, almost to the day—the debate was not gagged at any stage, and it was never, ever suggested that it be gagged. But in case those opposite complain about interruption to their program, let me go to the brilliant source on this. Let me go to what Senator Hill, the then Leader of the Opposition, said in March 1995:
This is your choice; this is your program; this is your priority.
That is what he said then. We say exactly the same. This was your choice to bring it on, this was your priority to use government business time and this is your priority. But, having put your rather weak case, you want to run up the white flag. You want to vote on it now. You do not want the issues fully and properly debated.
—If you think the case is so weak, you would be happy to get rid of it.
—On this particular issue, we have several senators wanting to 
 make a contribution to refute the various accusations made by Senator Vanstone and her colleagues. But, Senator Vanstone, you are not willing to face the music. You are not willing to have what you regard as a serious matter debated in this chamber; you are not willing to have that tested. You are willing to invest everything on what you say is a serious matter—that is, a censure motion; you are willing to say that. But you do not actually want it tested. You do not want senators on this side—and presumably you have also gagged Senator Ian Macdonald, who was on the speaker's list, to prevent him from expressing a point of view. Why is this government running scared on this particular issue?
—We are not running scared. You wasted an hour yesterday on notices of motion.
—Senator Alston refers to us wasting an hour. Let me go to another source, Senator Alston. Let me quote our now esteemed President, someone whom I admire enormously. In terms of the Baume motion and taking up government time, what did she say? She said of Senator Evans, `He brought in a censure of one of our senators; he will wear the consequences for having done that.' I am not making any threats; I am merely quoting from one of the most esteemed presiding officers this chamber has ever been blessed with who at that time was acting in another role as chief whip.
What this apparently is about is that the moment they come in here to gag the debate basically they are saying: this is a political stunt; this is just a political vengeance thing. If anyone would have summed it up—and I am sure that he will read the transcripts in New York—it would have been Senator Michael Baume. What did he say about the 1995 censure, which was not gagged, compared with Senator Vanstone's 1998 one? He said that it should not be a political stunt or some kind of political `get square'; it must rest on principle. If it is going to rest on principle, let us debate the principles.
Instead, Senator Alston comes in here and not only makes a few accusations but does not have the courage to have anyone respond to him; he moves a gag so that no-one can reply 
 to the gutless Senator Alston. Why is that so, Mr Acting Deputy President?
—Order! I would ask you to withdraw that remark.
—Yes, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will withdraw `gutless' and I will replace it with a minister who totally lacks courage, who comes into this chamber and attacks Senator Bolkus—but refuses to have anyone else respond. And, in moving that motion, he cannot even go to precedence in terms of an attack on an opposition senator. The whole move by this government on this issue has been botched from start to finish.
The tactics finally got right on Monday. Their normal tactic on these things is to come in on a Thursday, pre-plan it but not notify us and ambush us with a censure motion after question time, knowing that if it runs its full course the whole of general business will be expunged. They did that some weeks into the previous session with Senator Sherry: they ambushed after question time. They even ambushed the noting of answers to questions—a historical precedent that I hope will never be repeated in this chamber because it grossly embarrassed the President of this place. But then they come in on general business day by way of ambush, knowing that it is not going to cost them any time.
The fact is that, if governments censure opposition senators, they have to pay the price in terms of time. They have to say, `We are willing to give this precedence over all other business and debate it out until its conclusion' if they are serious about a censure motion. But if anything reveals this as a totally grubby, cynical political exercise, it is the fact that they have gagged it. How many gags were moved in this chamber in the life of the Hawke-Keating government? I am not talking about guillotines.
—Order! Senator Ray, I think you have had a fair amount of time to put your statement.
—I have unlimited time, once I am given leave on a statement, Mr Acting Deputy President. You know that.
—I thought it was given with the limit being put on it of `a reasonable amount of time'.
—No, there was no limit put on it whatsoever—and, Mr Acting Deputy President, this is going to be full tote odds. So you can sit back and relax and wait to be replaced in an hour's time, or whatever, and you can go back to your room and listen to me speaking there, if you like. But it was leave without a time limit. You concede that? No response.
—Senator Ray, I think leave was given on the understanding that it was going to be a statement, not an epistle; it was not going to  go forever. I thought that was the understanding.
—That might have been their understanding; it was not mine. Leave was given.
—It was my understanding as well. If we want to argue that the original question on the notice of motion should be now put, that does take precedence.
—I am sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. Can I apologise and sit down while you are giving a ruling? I was still standing.
—I thought leave was given on the understanding that a statement would be made, but I did not expect a statement to go forever. I took advice on that matter. There is some doubt, in fact, about the motion that Senator Alston moved: that the question be now put. It does take precedence. I think, in the spirit of trying to get on with the debate, Senator Alston gave leave for you to speak. But I think he gave it on the understanding that it would not be endless.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. What I think we are seeing here is yet further evidence of Senator Ray's absolute determination to avoid debating the merits of the issue. The fact is that we moved a gag because you have had 
 three speakers who have not addressed the subject matter of the issue.
The fact is that Senator Ray indicated that he believed that his seeking leave should have precedence over the gag motion. That is certainly not my understanding of standing order 199. But, in the circumstances, when he effectively threatened that he would spend half an hour on a contingent notice of motion, I was prepared to accept that this might be a more expeditious way of dealing with it. What he was saying was, `If you don't give me leave, I will spend half an hour on a contingent notice of motion'; in other words, he was making it clear that he expected that we should give him leave to save time, less than half an hour.
If what he is now saying is that, under guise of seeking to speed up the debate, he is now going to spend an endless amount of time on talking about everything that interests him, then that is a clear abuse of process. It exposes him as someone who is not interested in the forms of the parliament. All these weasel words about what a wonderful person the President is and `I would like to sit down and hear you in silence' should not disguise the fact that what he is doing, if he persists in this conduct, is simply trying to frustrate the processes of the parliament and the government's agenda. I can certainly confirm that Senator Ray made it very clear to us that leave was in lieu of his spending half an hour on a contingent notice of motion.
—I might be able to assist the chair. I was pointing out, having been given leave, what my rights were and the potential exercise of those rights. I doubt that, even as verbose and garrulous as I can be, I will even get to the half hour that the contingent notice of motion allows for. But it should be made clear to the genius of tactics over there that if he gives leave with that qualification—and he effectively did—that could be the consequence. But I will leave you to make a ruling and then I will get back to the relevant points.
—On the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—I did not believe there was a point of order.
—You let Senator Alston speak for five minutes on a point of order. I am speaking to the point of order that Senator Alston so eloquently addressed at length. I wanted to make the point that leave was given by the Senate. What happens to be in Senator Alston's mind at the time, while of interest to us all, is not the crucial point in any ruling you make, Mr Acting Deputy President. Leave was given by the Senate for Senator Ray to make a statement. I gave that leave, as did other senators around the chamber. While it is of interest, if there is anything in Senator Alston's mind or not, I do not think it is relevant to any ruling you make about the decision to grant leave.
—When the Senate gives leave, I believe it does give leave with a reasonable amount of time. It is up to whoever is in the chair at the time as to what they believe is a reasonable amount of time. I will rule that Senator Ray still has the leave of the Senate to continue, but I will listen and when I think the senator has had enough time, I may put the motion.
—We would obviously challenge that ruling, and move dissent to the ruling, but that is for a later time. What I was saying in terms of the proper procedures here in relation to this gag is that the government finally at least got its tactics right. Rather than moving suspension of standing orders and then having a long debate over precedence by way of ambush, they gave notice properly on Monday so that it would come up for debate as government business on Tuesday.
I wanted to make the point that it is very important that this procedure be followed in future. The reason why it should be followed and the reason why it will always be resisted like it was last Thursday is that it is an ambush. It is quite clear that the government decided some time Thursday morning to do this, but did not have the courtesy to notify us. The problem for us then in terms of preparation time is that probably only one 
 speaker on our side can speak to it, and that is the person accused. The others do not know about it and cannot prepare. Therefore, the procedure to this point of time of moving it one day and giving people time to prepare for the second day is always going to be the appropriate approach.
If you are looking for precedents you have to go back 17 years to the last time a government tried to gag a censure motion in this place. This was a censure motion moved by Senator Durack. It was to censure an opposition senator. Again the government tried the gag motion.
—No, the gag was moved by Senator Durack.
—The gag was moved by Senator Durack.
—On an opposition senator.
—On an opposition senator. The gag was moved by Senator Durack then. The Senate was a more benign then; it was defeated. My point to the Senate is that it should be defeated again today because the government has had four speakers on the attack—notably Senator Vanstone, Senator Abetz, Senator Coonan and Senator Alston. Our side has been given only three speakers to respond. That in itself is a manifestly unfair use of the gag.
To go back to the President's previous statement, there will be knock-on consequences of that in this chamber, because you are actually using a device to prevent at least equal numbers in this place speaking on the motion. We certainly had Senator Quirke and Senator Cooney who wanted to address different aspects of it. Senator Alston can say what he likes about irrelevancies, but he can be assured that one of our next speakers, Senator Cooney, would have gone right to the heart of matter.
The only precedent we have for gagging a censure motion against an opposition member—not the traditional ones—goes back 17 years and that was defeated in this chamber. The question comes up: why won't this government, having given notice of a motion 
 in government business time, actually debate the resolution out? Why won't they give the opposition at least equal time to debate the motion? The only conclusion that we can draw on this matter is that they do not want to face the counter-attack; they do not want to face up.
—Counter-attack! Hit me with a feather.
—Hit Senator Vanstone with a feather? Senator Vanstone has made accusations. You do not have the political courage to allow the response to be given. You have to sleaze out of this chamber using the device of a gag—
—Just closing the debate.
—You are not closing the debate at all. Are you going to have a right of response as well? Is that what you are saying? Mr Acting Deputy President, are we also going to have a right of response so that their side gets five speakers?
—Order! Senator Ray, I would remind you that you are making a statement and I would ask you not to be distracted by interjections.
—It was actually a very pertinent one. Let me explain it to you so you understand. I thought Senator Vanstone indicated that that side of politics is not only going to gag this debate; they are going to have another speaker and right of response. Is that what you said?
—No.
—You are not going to have a right of response? You are just going to leave it at four government speakers and three opposition speakers? That is fair according to you? The old stacked jury; that is fair according to you. I thought there was some redemption for Senator Vanstone; never argue that with Senator Alston.
What we have here is a government that says censure motions are serious. Clearly, I do not agree with that. I think they have been scattered around like confetti. They have absolutely no relevance. They are carried on political grounds, as happened in the House of Representatives the other day. All this 
 government needs to censure an opposition is to round up two of the other 11 votes. No-one will ever tell me that every one of those will vote on the facts of the case.
Sometimes they might vote for Senator Bolkus because they like him, and not listen to the arguments. Sometimes—and I cannot understand how—they might vote against him in the censure motion because they do not like him. It is an absolute joke. This is not a judicial finding; this is a highly politicised chamber and this is a highly politicised motion in which the views will merely reflect party lines. Can you imagine someone opposite voting in favour of Senator Bolkus or someone on our side voting against him? It probably never happens. Voting on censure motions goes along party lines. For the rest, some will address it on the merits and vote accordingly for or against; others will just vote according to their particular bias at the time.
Today, this government has said that it is willing to censure an opposition senator without other senators being able to express their views. The government is saying, `We're now into this particular issue but we want to bail out.' Why does it want to bail out? It is saying that government business time is more important than censuring Senator Bolkus. To go back to Senator Hill's comments as they apply to this, he said, `This is your choice; this is your program; this is your priority.' To reverse that: the government has made the choice that government legislation is more important than the censure motion on Senator Bolkus. The government is willing to countenance an unfair distribution of speakers and to gag debate when it has had more speakers than the opposition.
To wind up, we have a government too gutless to debate this and too scared to have all the issues put on the table. It is an absolute disgrace that Senator Alston has moved a gag motion here today. It took 17 long years for the coalition to return to the tactics it used in 1981, move a censure motion on an opposition member, and then gag the debate because it cannot hack it. We are dealing with a pathetic, miserable government. Senator Vanstone, you have been involved in these 
 sorts of exercises because you were undermined by David Kemp, sacked by the Prime Minister, and bullied by the state governments over gun control. You are prone to invention under attack and you have never found a bad microphone yet.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-03-11,"—I rise today as a senator from Victoria to discuss the very important issue of waterfront reform. The Victorian business environment is robust and the state government is very supportive of business enterprise. I was not surprised that the NFF chose to situate their new business at Melbourne ports.
Victorian businesses, farmers, horticulturalists and others in the business area are among the most competitive in the world. They are efficient, well organised and have taken up the challenge to expand their businesses through overseas exports with enthusiasm. Their enthusiasm for export and keen eye for new business opportunities prompted me in my capacity as the parliamentary representative to the Australian mission to the United Nations to take a particular interest in multilateral procurement.
The interest which greeted all of my discussions on this issue with Victorian business representatives left no doubt in my mind that Victorian enterprises could and should gain a greater slice of the multi-million dollar international multilateral procurement business. I had many discussions with the heads of international procurement agencies. I was told by both the World Bank, which I visited on two occasions in Washington, and the United Nations procurement officers that they would like to do more business with Australians.
I was told innumerable times how good we were at supplying consultants, what a tremen 
 dous reputation Australia has in supplying consultants to the United Nations and the World Bank and yet how we fell down on supplying goods.
In order to win procurement contracts, Australian businesses must be involved in the process and be active participants. Also, they have to have the preliminary qualification of guaranteeing a reliable supply of the relevant goods.
The Committee for Melbourne—a committee which has been established to promote Melbourne, Victoria and businesses—has in fact worked assiduously in the multilateral procurement area and has secured the United Nations procurement conference, which is a conference of officers from the United Nations who purchase goods and services who have a meeting once a year. The Committee for Melbourne has secured that conference for Melbourne next year. That was one of reasons they asked me to get involved and meet as many of the procurement officers as possible.
The Committee for Melbourne is also working towards establishing a World Bank partnership centre in Melbourne—and hopefully a centre which also includes United Nations activities—to provide a focus for not only Victorian businesses, but also Australian businesses to get in at the ground level and learn about the sorts of things that the United Nations is purchasing and the sorts of things that the World Bank is doing. One of messages that I received when I was at the World Bank and the United Nations was that  you need to be involved in the preliminary stage so that, when the actual tenders are let, you have more knowledge of the process. Sometimes we are coming into it too late in the process. I commend the Committee for Melbourne for the work that it is doing to assist Victorian and Australian businesses to get involved.
Australian businesses are very responsive. When I was visiting the Antarctic I got to know the helicopter company down there that was responsible for all the flights and the servicing of the helicopters in the Antarctic. They are a Western Australian company. I rang them and said, `The United Nations wants to send helicopters. Would you be 
 interested in getting involved with them?' They said, `Look, if we can deliver a helicopter service in the Antarctic, we can deliver it anywhere in the world. That is the toughest environment.'
There are Australian companies that are keen to get in there and do it. They are keen to be involved in this multilateral procurement, but it is no good if cannot get the goods from the production point to overseas points, especially in multilateral procurement, and get it there on a timely basis. It is just counter-productive.
I am naturally concerned that, even as all levels of government strive to assist businesses with their exports, even as the Committee for Melbourne is working towards establishing a World Bank partnership centre and a UN procurement centre in Melbourne, and even as the Minister for Trade is busily promoting Australian exports overseas, Australian businesses cannot make this basic guarantee of reliable delivery.
I have given the example of my father's business before. He manufactures artists' paints and poster paints. He had two orders from America some years ago two years in a row. One lot was left sitting on the wharf in the heat. The tubes exploded because the containers became too hot. They were sitting there during a strike and he did not get the delivery to the American market in time for the school year. He was trying to even out his production over a year. He had a peak period here for the beginning of the school year in Australia and a peak period in July/August for the American market. He tried to maintain jobs here in Australia and he had to put people on and off to meet the peaks and troughs in his business.
In the second year there was another strike and he did not get the paints to America on time. What happened was that he set up a subsidiary company in Canada and 12 jobs went to Canada. This was mainly because our wharves were so inefficient and he was delayed. It was only a very small business with 35 employees, but 12 jobs went down the drain and became Canadian jobs. So, that is the sort of thing that happens when our wharves are not reliable. Businesses make 
 other decisions. They cannot afford to invest money, make losses or get a reputation for being an unreliable supplier.
An international survey of reliability was reported by the Herald Sun on 31 January this year. Melbourne came a miserable seventeenth on the scale of how well we performed as a supplier. On value for money we did one point better; we went to sixteenth position. Our waterfront strike action is 10 times the national average. It is the only area in which the Australian waterfront leads the world. We lead on the worst score.
The National Institute of Labour Studies at Flinders prepared a report late last year which shows that the level of industrial disputation on the waterfront is second only to the coal mining industry. Every day around Australia there is a stoppage. You think about that. That is some paints that are not going to be delivered on time or some food that might spoil. That is another group of businesses who are seen as unreliable suppliers in overseas markets. Every day there is a stoppage, a go-slow or some other form of interruption to service, resulting in ships missing sailings.
Ships regularly calling into Australia build several extra days into their schedules to allow for delays, damaging Australia's reputation as a trading partner. It is damaging the reputations as reliable suppliers of each of those businesses, small and large.
It is clear that Victorian businesses are not hampered by the tyranny of distance. They are hampered by the tyranny of disruption and  delay on the waterfront, particularly on the Victorian waterfront. As proof of this point, another nation, even further from the major European and North American centres of commerce, New Zealand, has managed to overcome its tyranny of distance with its extremely efficient waterfront operations. I will quote Mr Ron Longley, who runs a shipping line exclusively between Australia and New Zealand and who would be more qualified, I suppose, than anyone else to make a comparison on waterfront costs in both nations. When he was asked how much more expensive Australia was, he replied:
Over three hundred per cent more than New Zealand, and that is on a like per like basis for a ship calling into a 
 New Zealand port or into an Australian port and getting exactly the same services at both ports.
With a like to like comparison, we are 300 per cent more expensive than New Zealand. Australian waterfront productivity levels are woefully below those of our competitors. Auckland manages 25 crane movements per hour compared with Australia's average of 18.3. Auckland wharves are 37 per cent more productive than Australian wharves. Thai ports average 30 movements per hour, which is 64 per cent more productive than Australian ports. All of this is after a $400 million investment in the last three years by the major Australian stevedores to bring their terminal equipment up to date. With figures showing virtually no movement in productivity over the last year, this is a demoralising example of the problems that exist on our waterfront.
As I travel throughout Victoria, I am often asked how it was possible that the Labor government managed to rack up so much debt. I do not blame people for finding it hard to believe the size of the Beazley black hole, but it is due to grossly incompetent economic management. It is hard to credit this, even from the Labor Party, but it is true. There was enormous mismanagement.
One example I often use is the Labor government's $420 million waterfront industry reform authority process used, as former minister Graham Richardson put it, `to bribe the wharfies into retirement'. That is what the former minister said, `to bribe the wharfies into retirement'—$420 million. Labor's attempts at waterfront reform, the much maligned WIRA process, cost the nation $420 million. After the money had been paid in redundancies and other outlays, the monetary improvement in productivity and reliability fell away, and the restrictive work practices again brought the Australian waterfront back to a level far behind our international competitors.
When I explain that the previous government paid $420 million to `bribe wharfies into retirement' and that, as a result of this investment today, our five port average crane rate of 18 per cent per hour is currently 45 per cent below the modest Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics benchmark 
 of 25 containers per hour, peoples' jaws drop. Then they understand very quickly how we got so disastrously into debt.
We have paid $420 million, and we are no better off. That $420 million to retire about 5,000 wharfies is a very generous rates for mates deal, even by the standards of the Australian Labor Party. The unproductive and unreliable nature of Australian waterfronts is compounded by featherbedding, restrictive work practices, overmanning and rorts.
When I was down in the Antarctic on the Aurora Australis with members of the Australian Seamens Union and other unions, I saw what those union fellows could do when they really needed to, when they really wanted to. When they realised that people's lives were at stake and that it cost $70,000 every day that ship was late, they worked in minus 10 degree temperatures. They worked in blizzards, they worked in the freezing cold, and they worked on Christmas Day. They were fine examples of what people can do when they put their minds to it. They were tremendous examples of union guys who, when they decided that they were going to be productive, could do it. They showed the sort of example that could be set. Around the wharves in Australia, if the temperature drops to nought degrees, the wharfies will stop work. These guys were working in minus 10 degrees—freezing; your hands froze on to the steel—and they were working in slippery conditions. 
I said to people, `Isn't this an example of what can be done when people feel a commitment to the Antarctic project?' What we want to see from the waterfront workers—and there are many of them, I am sure, who have a commitment to Australia—is a demonstration of that commitment. We want to see them putting themselves where their mouths are, showing that commitment. We know it is possible.
The Maritime Union of Australia's claim to be interested in productivity is belied by its actions in rejecting an Arbitration Commission recommendation on 20 October 1997 that it improve productivity to a modest 22 containers per hour before laying claim to further 
 benefits. The MUA will not agree to further reform unless Patrick Stevedores agrees to a guaranteed minimum wage of $75,000, plus improved superannuation benefits.
Practices such as two up, two down manning, eliminated in New Zealand half a dozen years ago, are still practised on the Australian waterfront. One outstanding example of inefficiency is the procedure for unloading cars on the waterfront. At Webb Dock, a car gang comprises 29 wharfies, including the supervisor. Of the 29 men, only 15 drive the cars off the ships, three men are supervisors, three men are on clerical duties—there must be so much paperwork involved in unloading cars that you need three men—one man to direct traffic with a flag, three men to provide taxi services to save walking back on board and four men to unlash cars. When the men are on ordinary time, productivity is three cars per man hour. When the men are on double time, and are allowed to knock off after all cars are unloaded, productivity soars to 7.5 cars per hour per man—an increase of 150 per cent.
I can go on and on. High costs, low productivity and unreliability on the waterfront are hampering the ability Australian businesses in general, and Victorian businesses in particular, from fulfilling their export potential.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Waterfront Reform</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-11,"—My question is to Senator Warwick Parer, Minister for Resources and Energy. Is the minister aware of a report in Monday's Financial Review  that Australia's minerals and energy exports are under serious threat from the Asian economic crisis? Minister, what has this government done to protect Australia's important minerals and energy exports from serious economic downturn? Is it not a fact that you, as Minister for Resources and Energy, have done absolutely nothing to protect critical Australian industries like coal—industries critical to your home state of Queensland—from the ravages of the financial crisis in the Asian region? What justification can there be for your spokesman to state that the outcome for these industries remains positive?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minerals and Energy Industries</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-03-11,"—I am delighted that at long last I am asked a serious question about what has happened with the Asian fallout, instead of the stupid, nitpicking stuff that usually comes from the other side.
As Senator Cook says, the energy and minerals sector is vital to Australia. Our major markets in the Asia-Pacific region are Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Very little of those energy materials goes to the other Asian countries that have been part of the financial meltdown. The country that has suffered most is Korea. I am having continuing discussions with people within the industry. In those discussions, it is their view and mine that one of the major things we have done relates to export controls. I took great exception to Senator Cook saying we have done nothing, and I will list some of the things we have done. 
You persisted in keeping export controls over the whole 13 years you were in government. By doing that, you forced those countries to diversify to other countries at the expense of Australia. We got rid of export controls. Countries such as Korea, Japan and Taiwan are now free to purchase more from Australia rather than diversifying between countries. In other words, they can diversify within Australia without the threat of a hostile 
 government holding them hostage in the future. That is an opportunity.
With regard to the Korean situation, the government acted very quickly. I had a number of calls just before Christmas from exporters who were concerned about the fact that banks in Australia were not prepared to accept letters of credit from Korea. We acted very quickly. We increased the EFIC finance by some $300 million. We also added in another $300 million, approximately, in respect of what I think is called public interest, or words to that effect. As I understand it, there is no restriction whatsoever at the moment with regard to the export of coking coal and steaming coal in respect of Korea.
Korea was the country with which we were most concerned. It has been a long-term trading partner of Australia, going back over 20 years to when the first contracts were signed between Australian coking coal companies and Pohang Iron and Steel. I will take you back to those days, Senator. In those days the Korean economy was not that great, but the early suppliers to Korea actually sold their coking coal without letters of credit and on trust. This was very much appreciated by the Koreans, and I know from the discussions I have had in recent times with the Korean purchasers that they are very appreciative of the actions taken by this government in supporting their industry in their time of need.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minerals and Energy Industries</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-03-11,"—My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Minister, is it a fact that the Howard government last year announced a $3.6 million funding cut to the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation? Can you confirm whether fishing is the only primary industry to have had funding cuts to its R&D corporation?
—Didn't you hear that?
—Order! Senator Vanstone. Senator Murphy, have you finished the question?
—No, I want to add a little more to the question. I thought I might find something about shares in here. Minister, given that recent reports have supported an increase in research into fisheries, how do you justify this cut taking effect as it does in 1998—the Year of the Oceans?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Fisheries Research and Development Corporation</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-03-11,"—Madam President—
—Declare an interest.
—Yes. This was very much canvassed in an estimates committee, but let me point out the background to it. Yes, there was a $3.6 million cut and it came from reserves held by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. The background to it is that, when we came to government, we inherited a total disaster in the south-east fisheries—something that the last government should be totally ashamed of. There was litigation after litigation by people who had been unfairly dealt with by the previous government. The only way to handle this was to go into a buy-out scheme, so I appointed a special committee to look at a buy-out scheme so that those people who had been unfairly treated could be given the chance to sell their licences. Compensation was paid in certain cases.
An estimate was made and, if my memory is correct, about $6.9 million was required. We had to find the funds. It is difficult to find funds when you come into government and you need to do something like this but you have a $10.5 billion black hole left to you as a legacy of the mismanagement of the previous government.
Two sources were found. Part of the moneys was obtained from AFMA, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, from a fund that they had set aside for adjustment, but there was not sufficient funds to be able to do that. The rest we sought and it was obtained from reserves that had been built up by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. We naturally would have preferred not to have taken that route, but the priority was to fix up a disaster left to us by the previous government and, because of the stringent financial conditions at the time, this was the only way it could be done.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Fisheries Research and Development Corporation</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-03-11,"—Yesterday in question time Senator Quirke asked me a question with regard to the spending of $25,328 for the sod-turning ceremony at the AGSO building. He then went on to ask a number of other questions, such as, was there an open tender process and how could I justify paying this ludicrous amount of money for a sod-turning ceremony without testing the market. When he referred in his question to the fact that this had been something that Senator Faulkner raised, he should have been on his guard. You always have to be careful of the Left. My reason for saying that is that this contract with Burson-Marstellar was given under the term of the previous government.
—Ha, ha!
—I have here a letter written on 15 January 1996 where Burson-Marstellar were advised that they were successful and that they should spend no more than $25,000 depending on the cost of printing the kits.
The other question raised is in respect of a shovel. I think Senator Faulkner asked me whether I had declared it. So I thought had I better check as to what the cost of this shovel was. It was apparently bought at the local BCC Hardware, taken out for chrome plating, and has a total cost of $110.
One of the concerns I had was what to do with this shovel. I thought to myself that probably a more appropriate use of the shovel would be if I gave it to Senator Quirke; he could use it to clean the bulldust out of this place that we are used to from day to day. Another thing he could do would be to use it in an appropriate way to get back at Senator 
 Faulkner for giving him a question where, as pointed out in a headline in the Daily Telegraph today, it says `Sod it, it happened under us'.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Geological Survey Organisation</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to questions without notice asked today, relating to the financial interest of Senator Parer.
Today the opposition has raised a number of questions regarding very serious matters—questions that we believe it is appropriate for the Minister for Resources and Energy to answer comprehensively on the public record. We now, of course, have a situation where apparently the government believes that it is not appropriate for the opposition to hold the executive accountable during question time. We will not be adopting that level of ministerial and parliamentary accountability when, as we have a situation here, we have been provided with information—
—Have you been at the ASC again looking up dead directors?
—Order! Senator Campbell, it is disorderly to interject, in the first place; but it is even more disorderly to interject out of your seat.
—When we have information that indicates that discrepancies exist between the minister's own statements, his entries on the Register of Senators' Inter 
 ests and publicly available Australian Securities Commission companies information.
—He is very good at looking up dead directors.
—Order!
—We believe it is appropriate that the minister set the record straight on these issues. We invite the minister to provide answers to a number of questions, and they are important ones. Senator Parer ought to address himself to the issue of whether his Register of Senators' Interests lists all shares.
—You found your way down there!
—Order! Senator Campbell. Senator Faulkner, excuse me.
—Take your seat.
—You are not sitting down either, grub.
—Yes, I am.
—Order! Senator Ray. It is not appropriate to interject in this place at any stage, and it is more inappropriate to interject when you are not in your seat. I would please urge you to observing standing orders and to cease your interjections. Thank you.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. We ask Senator Parer: does your Register of Senators' Interests list all shares held either directly or indirectly by your family trust? If not, why not?
—When is the next meeting of dead directors?
—We ask Senator Parer: does your register of interests identify your apparent interest in a coal-mining company as a potential conflict of interest; and, if not, why not?
—Why don't you apologise, you scumbag?
—Order! Senator Campbell.
—When is the next meeting of dead directors?
—Order! Senator Campbell.
—We ask: have you divested yourself of all shares in the area of your portfolio responsibility; and, if not, why not? We ask Senator Parer: is your directorship of a trust which holds mining shares likely to conflict with your public duty? We ask Senator Parer—
—We ask you to apologise.
—We ask Senator Parer: do your business interests expose you to charges of using public office for private gain? We ask Senator Parer, in relation to the details of his family trust—and we know that it owns the shares in QCMM from third party sources—what else does it do?
—We ask: when are you going to apologise, you scumbag?
—We ask: is it, or its related entities, engaged in activities related to Senator Parer's ministerial responsibilities? We ask: where does it get its income? We ask: does it have the power to influence, directly or indirectly, any other company?
The opposition is asking for substantive answers to what we believe are very important questions, because we are well aware of the requirements incumbent on ministers regarding their public duties and private interests. For example, there is the statement of registrable interests which says that:
Any senator must notify any relevant interest in any shares which enables the senator, the senator's spouse or dependent children to exercise control over the right to dispose of those shares. This includes shares held by a family or business trust.
The notes also state:
The senator must list any other interest which in the opinion of the senator holds the potential for real or apparent conflict of interest with the senator's public duties to arise.
We ask about the discredited Prime Minister's guidelines on ministerial conduct. We just say that the Prosser defence, that is, `I have complied with all requirements', is not good enough. This minister must be accountable on these important issues.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-11,"—Another grubby attack from the gutter by the Labor Party. Regrettably, the attack is a smokescreen to try to hide the absolute inconsistencies and the smearing by the Labor Party in this chamber of the parliament.
But the distressing thing is that the Labor Party choses to attack one of the ablest ministers of the Howard government, Senator Parer. Senator Parer has devoted his life to Australia and has created something of real wealth for this country. He has done something which employs hundreds of workers in the coalmines and elsewhere and he is a very great Australian. The Labor Party choses to attack and smear this man, just as they always do.
We thank Senator Richardson for his book, Whatever It Takes. He told us how the Labor Party, when they are in trouble and want to attack a competent person, brings out the smears and lies to do it. That is what has been happening today.
—You should hear what he says about John Faulkner.
—I know what he says about John Faulkner, but he does not take much notice of Faulkner and neither does anyone else. It is the old Labor Party, union, bully-boy stuff to attack one of the ablest ministers.
It is a smokescreen to hide the censure of the would-be first officer of this nation, Senator Bolkus, from those very serious charges of which he has been found guilty; not just in this chamber and not just in the other chamber, but in both chambers. They know that this is a rare and very serious thing and they will smear and tell lies to try to hide that from tomorrow's media.
It is also a smokescreen to try to hide the ineffectual leadership that the Labor Party has in this chamber. We all know how Senator Faulkner and Senator Cook got their jobs here. It is without question that Senator Ray—for all his faults—is the real leader of the Labor Party in this chamber and should be on the frontbench. Senator Faulkner and 
 Senator Cook got their jobs because the Labor Party has to share the factional jobs around. In the other chamber Mr Beazley happened to be elected as leader and Mr Evans happened to be elected deputy leader and they were both from the Right.
You would know, Madam Deputy President, as everybody over there does, that they had to give the Centre Left and the Left a job. What did they do? They put the most able, Senator Ray, up in the back row—and Senator Ray acquiesced in this because he knows the deal—and they put some dummy from the Left at the main table and some guy from the Centre Left who was the second choice behind him. That is how we get this weak ineffective leadership in this chamber.
The Labor Party will smear and tell lies about Senator Parer and anyone else to try to hide this lack of leadership. It is also a smokescreen to hide the ineffectiveness and absolute lack of any intestinal fortitude of Mr Beazley as the Leader of the Labor Party. Can you imagine what would have happened in this very hypothetical instance if Mr Howard had been Leader of the Labor Party over the last week? Senator Bolkus would not have lasted five minutes, because Mr Howard would not have anyone on his frontbench who deliberately leaked a stolen document and distributed it to the world just so that Mr Skase—that criminal who used to be in Australia—could escape retribution. Senator Bolkus has released that information so that a criminal, Mr Skase, can escape.
—Why did he do that?
—Senator Calvert might well ask, `Why did he do that?' Mr Beazley's leadership is what tells. Everybody knows that Senator Bolkus will never, ever be the first law officer of the land. There is not a person sitting opposite who would argue with that. What it shows is that Mr Beazley simply cannot control his troops. He would like to get rid of Bolkus, but he cannot stand up to the Left and Centre Left of his party.
Also, Mr Beazley is showing lack of any leadership in the way he has dealt with the Oxley preselection. There is a woman who wants to get up there and the national exec 
 utive of the Labor Party has threatened to tip a bucket over her so she will be put out of the race. Where is Mr Beazley coming into this? He should show some leadership and stop the ALP from threatening to tip a bucket over this woman. You would understand, Madam Deputy President, that the women are supposed to have 35 per cent of the safe seats in the Labor Party. Where is Mr Beazley's leadership? This whole attack is a smokescreen to hide Mr Beazley's inefficiencies.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-11,"—The questions asked of Senator Parer today do require an answer—maybe not immediately because there were some complex questions asked and we will certainly give Senator Parer time to answer them. It did appear from some of the questions today that he either was confused at the type of questions that went to him, or on a couple of occasions said that he was having some difficulty with his memory in this particular area. We await him going back, going through the records and giving us answers to those particular questions that he could not quite focus on today. But the one thing he consistently said was, `I have complied with the Prime Ministerial guidelines.'
We do not know whether to challenge that totally or not because we do not see the declaration Senator Parer makes to the Prime Minister. What we do see is the declaration that Senator Parer makes to this chamber and to the public as a whole through the parliamentary process of disclosure. That is on the record, not only in its basic text but also in any amendments made over the last four years. We see that. But if Senator Parer has accurately stated all of his interests to the Prime Minister and it is not reflected in his pecuniary interest form in the Senate, then it reflects badly not only on him but even more so on the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to whom the Prime Minister himself has said he entrusted the task of checking it all carefully. Surely he would have compared the Prime Ministerial declaration form with the Senate one to see if there were any inconsistencies.
While I am on the Senate one, I still have this problem with Senator Parer: he lists a company, as I understand it, that controls his family trust. I do not think he ever actually goes to the point of declaring his family trust, but that could have been an oversight or a belief that, by putting the organising company in there, that would be good enough in terms of declaration.
We did have a letter go out some time in March 1997, following some controversy, asking people if they owned family trusts that had substantial shareholdings and to put some more detail on the record. Senator Parer has made no such amendment. But the thing that really confused me today was when Senator Parer said, `I think some of these things may have happened more than 10 years ago.' The basic thrust of our questioning, in terms of owning shares that may have a benefit in coalmining, is that this was set up in 1994—just four years ago. I would have thought Senator Parer would have remembered this arrangement for these 16 C class shares. For anyone thinking that 16 shares is not much, there are only just beyond 1,100 shares in totality for a company that values its own assets at $153 million—so we are not talking about peanuts.
Apparently he cannot focus on and remember the allocation of those shares in 1994. I will tell you why I am even a little more shocked by that: guess who chaired the meeting in 1994? Senator Parer. It was more than one meeting—at least three that I know about. He chaired the meeting in which these matters were discussed and decisions were made. So we do want him to go back, check his records and find out.
It is no use Senator Parer coming in here and saying, `I don't own any shares personally.' The fact is that, if the investment company that runs his trust and the trust own 16 shares that are valuable, and they depend on the fortunes of the coal industry and he is the minister directly responsible for export controls on the coal industry, for diesel fuel rebates and all of these other things that impact there, an allegation could then be made of a potential conflict of interest. So as to avoid those allegations the Prime Minister 
 has properly ruled that, if you own shares either directly or by way of a family trust—other than a blind trust, and no-one has argued that this is a blind trust—and if you are going to get what we understand is a very substantial franked dividend out of all this process into the family trust in which you have an interest, and you are making decisions that affect it, the allegation can be there of a potential conflict of interest.
I would never think for a moment that Senator Parer would consciously and directly take a decision affecting the coal industry to directly benefit himself but that is not the point. The whole point is that he should have declared, in some detail in his Senate pecuniary interest form, the details of the holdings in this particular company. So it is no use the other side going on and saying these are absolute smears; these people are accountable.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-03-11,"—Anybody who has watched question time since the parliament resumed would have been aware that Senator Bolkus was in the sights of the government for having leaked confidential Federal Court documents. As a result, the Labor Party have engaged in a deliberate besmirching tactic dealing with people who have been dead for decades, the Baillieu family, and with the Natural Heritage Trust. Do we get any apology from them? No. What do they do? They simply move on to the next issue, such as Senator Quirke making a false allegation about a contract that he alleges this government let, only to find it was the previous Labor administration that let the contract. Do we get an apology from the Labor Party? Absolutely not.
We had the spectacle of Senator Sherry asking his first question on his return, making some very grubby allegations in relation to the minister and Deloittes. Today, that was completely debunked. Do we get an apology from Senator Sherry? No. We then had the allegation yesterday from Senator Kerry O'Brien from the Labor Party about an employment agency. That was completely debunked today at question time and exposed as untrue and incorrect. Do we get an apology from Senator O'Brien? No.
Today we moved a censure motion with the support of every senator in this place, other than those from the Labor Party, against Senator Bolkus for his most outrageous behaviour in deliberately and knowingly leaking a confidential Federal Court document. He did that deliberately and knowingly. The Senate has quite properly condemned him for that by censuring him. So what does the Labor Party do? They say, `They finally got Bolkus. They nailed him. What do we do? Our little besmirching tactics on the Natural Heritage Trust, bringing in dead people, making accusations against Deloittes about employment agencies and about contracts being let, and the question Senator Quirk asked have all failed. What are we going to do? We will embark upon a deliberate campaign to besmirch Senator Parer as a smokescreen.'
Senator Parer is one of the most honourable people in this place. To his great credit Senator Ray, in his speech, was very careful not to besmirch the character of Senator Parer. Indeed, he made this telling point. If Senator Parer did something that was not within the guidelines it would have been done inadvertently, in sharp contradistinction to the behaviour of Senator Bolkus, who did what he did knowingly, connivingly and with a deliberate intent to put on the public record a confidential court document in breach of the Federal Court rules.
This taking note of answers today and the Labor Party tactic at question time have been designed simply as a smokescreen to try to protect Senator Bolkus. Senator Bolkus cannot and will not be protected from his own actions and activities. He deliberately embarked upon leaking those two pages of that confidential court document. The Labor Party can try as much as they like to besmirch innocent citizens of this country, dead people or companies but there is nothing as rock solid and as proven as the case against Senator Bolkus for deliberately leaking the information he did.
The Labor Party tactic in this matter is so transparent and such a sham. The Labor Party know what they ought to do; that is, remove Senator Bolkus from the frontbench. If Sena 
 tor Bolkus will not move, he ought to be moved. If Mr Beazley is not willing to move him, I am sure the Australian people will ensure that Mr Beazley never becomes Prime Minister, let alone Senator Bolkus becoming the Attorney-General of this country.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-11,"—It is a pity that Senator Parer is not here and that he has not taken the opportunity to defend himself in this debate. With the greatest respect to Senator Parer, he moved more rapidly out of this chamber than I have seen him move at any other time around this building.
The issue of the probity and the honourable conduct of government ministers was made an election matter by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself at the last election. He promised the people of Australia that there would be a code of ministerial conduct which would ensure that private and public dealings by responsible ministers in this country were at the highest possible level and he promised that he would hold his ministers to that code.
In his document, the Prime Minister said:
Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
That is what the Prime Minister has said is required in these circumstances. What is beyond doubt is that there is an interest of a particular sort by Senator Parer in a mining company, and we know that Senator Parer is the Minister for Resources. That would appear to be directly in conflict with what the Prime Minister requires.
As well as that, there are the Senate's own requirements. The Senate requires that, in stating what their interests are, senators should say what their shareholdings in public and private companies, including holding companies, are and should indicate the names of the companies. This goes to the issue of family and business trusts and nominee companies as well. What we have here are quite clear, fundamental requirements to which senators and ministers have to comply. 
 We also have an obligation by the Prime Minister to ensure that ministers hold to those standards.
What are the facts of this debate, as we know them to this point? In my view, we know that in his words in answers to questions at question time Senator Parer was quite careful in what he said. He said, `I have exactly complied with the Prime Minister's requirements.' I do not know, and I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt at this stage, whether that means in a technical sense or in a full blown, proper sense. He said as well, `I have personally no shareholding in a mining company.' Again, that may be a very tightly drawn, technical meaning of what he has said compared to what the facts are and it may not meet the intent or the requirement of the provisions.
What we do know now is that the Parer family trust owns 16 shares in QCMM. QCMM wholly owns Advanced Queensland Resources and Mining which operates the Jellinbah Coal Mining Company in the Bowen Basin. Those 16 shares amount to, I understand, about 1.4 per cent of the company; that is, the trust owns about 1.4 per cent of the mining company, which is valued, according to its June 1996 annual report—the last I have a reference to—at $153 million, which is not an insubstantial amount. Therefore, it is proper and reasonable to conclude that the minister has a beneficial interest in QCMM through a family trust. Apart from the interest QCMM has in Advanced Queensland Resources, the operation company of Jellinbah Coal Mining, QCMM also has a 70 per cent interest in Bowen Basin Coal Pty. Ltd. There is a substantial case to answer here.
In addition to that, the ASC records show that on 30 June this year Senator Parer held 44 shares personally in QCMM Group (ESP). There is a substantial case for the minister to answer here about how those facts set out in the ASC records and documented in the proper way in the companies commission tally with his allegations that he has properly complied with the ministerial code of conduct and that he has no shares in a mining company. It may not be directly that he does but 
 through his trust. He has to answer those allegations fully and properly. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-03-11,"—I do not know why you hate successful people so much on your side of the chamber. As soon as anybody is successful, you find the best way you can to try to smear them in any way possible. When Senator Faulkner stands before this chamber and uses the option of his quietly spoken voice to talk, we know that his heart is not really in it. After a series of questions to Senator Parer, he then had to make the big decision about whether to take note of the answers or not, because no answers given by Senator Parer were likely to raise any issues other than those you have tried to raise by trawling around and conducting this smear campaign you have started today—a tactic you have used on practically every other person you have chosen to vilify, inside or outside the Senate chamber.
I think I heard Senator Faulkner say during his speech that he was accusing Senator Parer of using public office for personal gain. I think that was the phrase that he used—using `public office for personal gain'. Talking about using public office for personal gain, how do you measure the personal gain that anyone gets from holding a public office? Is it a monetary gain? Is it some position that they gain after they have held public office? I can think of a couple of examples. Former President Kerry Sibraa: was it personal gain after holding public office when he was given a job by the former government as an ambassador overseas? Neal Blewett, a former member: was that personal gain from holding a public office? Graham Maguire: just an ordinary backbench senator all his life who managed to score a few jobs on some boards when he finished—was that personal gain from holding public office? I would not want to go too far if I were you.
There are a great number and you can name as many as you like but, if you are going to talk about personal gain from holding public office, you had better be careful about where you start and where you stop. Can you remember your defence, only two or three years ago, of a former Prime Minister who had a 
 very considerable involvement in a piggery? Would you have considered that to be personal gain from public office? Probably only a few million but that is neither here not there, just a drop in the ocean for these people. `Personal gain from public office'—former member Wayne Swan would not have had a job of personal gain from the public office that he held before; I am quite sure about that. So when you come in here and start talking about personal gain from public office and when you talk about a senator who has spent his life working in the mining industry—as Senator Parer did, and he is well respected and is someone who has been successful; he did not have to have his job propped up by any factional colleagues—
Senator George Campbell interjecting—
—Senator Campbell, let me tell you that he was not responsible for the loss of a hundred thousand jobs either. Senator Parer was responsible for employing people. He actually created employment and, Senator Campbell, a former Prime Minister accused you of costing this country a hundred thousand jobs. That is something you will always remember, Senator Campbell, and we remember it well because the comment was made by someone from your side.
Let us get down to the real issue of why the so-called attack on Senator Parer was made today. As Senator Abetz highlighted, it is a fact that we have had a situation today where one of your colleagues has been censured by this parliament. He has been censured in the House of Representatives and he has been censured in the Senate, where the government does not have a majority. A person cannot be censured unless you get the support of other parties in this chamber, and the only ones who stuck by Senator Bolkus were the Labor Party senators.
Let me tell you that some of those did it very reluctantly. I would not want to name names but, although some of those were sitting on that side of the chamber, when the votes went up—and the vote was 44 to about 26 or 27—I could not help but notice a bit of a wry smile come over the faces of some of Senator Bolkus's so-called colleagues when he was censured by this parliament. So this 
 effort today to try and attack Senator Parer for some alleged mistakes in his register of interests can only be described as a very poor effort to try and protect Senator Bolkus. (Time expired)

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-03-11,"—The state of the citrus industry is a very important matter. It is certainly important to those many primary producers who are affected by the fact that the government has done nothing to prevent the collapse of their industry. I would like to point out, not in my own words but largely in the words of the industry itself, what the failure of this government has meant.
I will quote from a number of different sources. The first quote is from a media release by Sunraysia Citrus Growers Inc. headed `Orange growers dump Canberra'. They do not actually mean the city of Canberra, or even all the politicians in Canberra—quite specifically, they are dumping on the government. This press release is about 
 impoverished citrus growers who want to draw attention to their dying industry which has been ruined by imported orange concentrate and improper labelling. Mr Peter Crisp, chief of Sunraysia Citrus Growers Inc., is reported as saying:
It beggars common sense that a government of economic rationalists is sacrificing an industry which is not only internationally competitive but in the export arena outperforms beef, wheat and wool!
He goes on:
We have been lied to, conned, ignored and patronised by the Federal Government because they just won't act nationally or internationally to save our industry . . .
Sunraysia Citrus Growers went on to say in their press release that `Australia is awash in a sea of cheap Brazilian orange juice concentrate'. Mr Crisp then says:
This will lead to the destruction of 500,000 orange trees within two years making a total of 1.1 million Australian orange trees ripped up over five years, all because the Government—
including the former government—
places political expediency above rational economics. We believe consumers will react with horror when they discover this means the loss of more than—
this is where the figure comes from—
440 million fresh Australian oranges a year.
He goes on to say:
What makes us angry is Australian companies, some of whom received financial support from their State governments, are selling Brazilian concentrate as an Australian product! Because of ludicrous labelling laws this amounts to misleading Australian consumers in a big way—again promises from Federal and State politicians/governments have resulted in no tangible action!
—So what is your solution? Have you got some solutions?
—Again, talking about pre-election promises for labelling legislation, the South Australian Farmers Federation, Senator Ferguson would be interested to know, said to me that this government has done nothing and they are very upset that the legislation promised to them has not eventuated. The press release continues:
Lending support to the growers plight, Mr Adam Thyssen, manager of the nation's largest fresh 
 orange juice enterprise, the Original Juice Company, said today, ""We have been running a TV and radio campaign to convince consumers to buy Australian orange juice because, quite frankly, if they don't the industry will simply disappear. An unnecessary, tragic loss for Australia"".
Let me also quote some facts and figures from an orange fact sheet supplied to me by the industry:
Due to Federal Government trade policies and inadequate labelling laws, 1.1 million Australian orange trees will be destroyed by 2000. Reducing the amount of oranges grown in Australia by a staggering—
I will repeat the figure because I know some members were incredulous when they read it on the Notice Paper ; this is from the industry—
440 million per year!
That is a loss of food to this country. Let me give some more facts:
Orange juice is still the only breakfast food that pays a wholesale tax of 12%. Milk, coffee, butter, cereal, tea and bread are all tax free.
In a 1997 benchmarking study the Australian citrus industry was confirmed as being internationally competitive.
So the industry are doing their best. They are not relying on just domestic markets. They are trying to be competitive in export markets, but they are having the ground stripped from underneath them. The fact sheet continues:
During the last two years Brazilian orange juice concentrate has flooded into Australia at an alarming rate equivalent to 300,000 tonnes (of fresh fruit) per annum, or 150,000,000 litres of orange juice a year.
Despite promises from both State and Federal politicians to reform labelling laws, Brazilian concentrate is still on our supermarket shelves labelled in such a way that it can easily be confused by the consumer for an Australian product.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Southern Australia's 2,400 citrus growers (located in NSW, Victoria, SA) employ directly and indirectly around 7,000. Australia's juice processors employ approximately another 3,000 people—
this is the industry that this government refuses to support—Together they are an economic rationalist's dream in terms of efficiency and export performance. These industries contribute $millions to the national economy. So why is it that Federal and State governments alike sit on their hands watching the entire industry crumble? 

The Original Juice Company pays Australian orange growers $210 per tonne and the average labour rate is $110 per day.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-03-11,"—I thank Senator Woodley for giving us this opportunity to talk today about the true state of the citrus industry and how the government is assisting growers. This situation is not new. Citrus growers have been aware for a long time that they need to move into higher value produce, and indeed many have done this. The returns from whole fruit for export and the production of whole fruit for the domestic market compared with the returns for juice have been and always will be very much higher. In view of Senator Woodley's comments that the industry is disappearing, it is important to note that in 1996-97 total citrus exports were valued at $175 million—3½ times the level of citrus imports. So we are obviously exporting far more citrus than we import.
The decision as to what people grow and how they grow it is made by, as in any other industry, growers. It is not a government decision that trees are being removed. On the other hand, it is the decision by growers to deliberately concentrate on either growing trees that will produce better or other products such as wine grapes or table grapes that will return a far greater level for their investment.
As far as Senator Woodley's charges are concerned that the industry will disappear, it is also important to note that citrus exports in 1996-97 were five times the value of exports seven years ago. That is a growth of over 30 per cent per annum—a good improvement in anyone's terms and certainly not an indication that this very important industry is disappearing. The returns from the 20 per cent of citrus production that is exported represents about 50 per cent of total citrus returns. It is in that production of whole fruit that the real value of the industry lies. The progressive citrus producers are now pruning, thinning and consciously culturing their trees in order to increase the quality pack-out ratios and thereby reduce their reliance on the juice 
 concentrate sector. I must emphasise that that reworking of trees does not necessarily involve pulling the trees out.
I do not deny that the Asian currency crisis has obviously had an impact on fresh product, particularly that going to Indonesia. But the government is acting to minimise this impact through IMF assistance packages to Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea as well as through the Export Finance Insurance Corporation's short-term credit insurance through the national interest facility. I would like the Senate also to note that, as a result of recent events, Indonesia has recently reduced tariff levels on imports of fresh citrus from 25 per cent to five per cent—an event which will help Australian exporters considerably in the longer term.
I chair the Citrus Market Development Group, which over the previous five years has had a budget of $8.4 million to assist citrus growers. This money is available for a variety of projects that will benefit the industry in terms of developing market opportunities. Since 1994, projects have been funded to assist the industry with export market and development, with technical adjustment and with promotion of 100 per cent Australian fresh orange juice on the domestic market. We look forward to further activity on behalf of this group, which has $500,000 to commit in this financial year and a further $1.54 million in the next financial year to fund these projects. But it is up to the industry to determine how they want that money spent and to put it to that group for consideration. It is not for government, Senator Woodley, to tell growers what they should grow or how they should grow it.
I would now like to move to the issue of labelling. The industry believes strongly that one of the key ways in which the government can assist the industry is through improved labelling laws. I am pleased to say that the Hon. Warren Truss, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, will be introducing legislation very shortly to improve our labelling laws, not only to benefit the industry but also to provide further information to consumers in a way that is much clearer.
Like me, all senators and indeed all those listening will have been into supermarkets where they have been unable to read the very fine print on labels to determine where exactly the product comes from. Under these new laws the label `Product of Australia' will mean just that: 100 per cent Australian content. To use the `Made in Australia' label, two tests will have to be passed: one, the product will have to be substantially transformed in Australia to be a new and significantly different product; and, two, at least 50 per cent of the cost of production must have been incurred in Australia.
The regulations will specifically address the very point that Senator Woodley made. It will no longer be possible to add Australian water to Brazilian concentrate and pass that off as an Australian product. They will specifically preclude that advantage being taken. Senator Woodley, we expect you and the Democrats to support this legislation when it comes into the Senate. So, having taken into account the remarks you have just made on labelling, we certainly expect to see the Democrats voting with the government when those labelling laws arrive.
—We will vote with you. We will probably have to fix it up, though, before we do.
—No; it is such carefully crafted legislation that any assistance from you probably will not be needed.
I would now like to move to the rural partnerships programs. The government has made funds available to the major citrus growing areas of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia through the rural partnership program. The kick-start Sunraysia strategy centred around Mildura will provide $10.8 million over three years to the Sunraysia region to enable irrigation farmers to initiate redevelopment programs and move towards planting some of the crops that I mentioned earlier. They will then become sufficiently viable to be able to continuously invest in the world's best technology for production and sustainability. Similar plans are under way for the final form of the Riverland and Murrumbidgee irrigation area strategies. A commitment is in place by this 
 government. Funding is available and we await the cooperation of the state governments in this happening.
The other assistance that we have provided includes such items as the tri-state fruit fly strategy; the government advancing agricultural Australia package of $500 million, which assists citrus farmers, among others, with farm business plans; the research and development matching dollars provided by the government through the payment of industry levies; and the benefit of a more open trade environment, with new markets being opened in Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines and the US.
I must emphasise that industry has its part to play in this. We are looking for expressions from industry through the Citrus Market Development Group, the Australian Citrus Growers Association and all those grower, processor and marketing groups which take an interest in the citrus industry. All of those groups have avenues to government. We look for expressions of interest from them. There will be no heavy-handed government interference in this industry, Senator Woodley. The days of that have passed.
This government looks for an open expression of interest from the industry as to the way in which this government can best assist it. We will then move towards that assistance through the programs that I have already mentioned, certainly through my own activities as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. John Anderson, and in my role as having particular responsibility for horticulture and, through that, the citrus industry. Those citrus growers with whom I have already spoken on my visits to the Riverland, the Murrumbidgee irrigation area and Queensland know that I am always very happy to hear from them about the way in which this government can continue to assist their industry.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Citrus Industry</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-03-11,"—Let me say at the outset that the opposition supports the terms of the matter of public importance that has been proposed by Senator Woodley today. We strongly support the proposition that this government has failed and failed dismally when it comes to doing anything effective about the crisis in the 
 Australian citrus industry. It is a pity that the Australian Democrats earlier in the day did not show the sort of concern for a serious matter like this that they are now showing. It is a pity that we wasted a lot of time on the disgraceful censure motion that the government moved. It would have been better spent devoting more time to this important issue.
Let us look at the government's position. The parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, at the conclusion of her remarks called upon the industry to put forward their views and their strategies, to be a partner in an approach to looking at the problems with the industry. That is all well and good. The problem, however, that Senator Troeth, Minister Anderson and the government have to come to grips with is that this is a crisis. The word in the motion is correct; there is a crisis in the citrus industry.
I have had the opportunity over a number of years to be involved closely with the citrus industry and the fruit growing industry particularly in my former capacity as an official of the Australian Workers Union. Whilst members of the government like to deride anybody who happens to have a trade union background, the fact is that that gave me an opportunity to visit many, if not all, of the fruit growing regions of Australia and talk to employers, particularly family orchardists, fruit growers and their employees. Many of those employees, as Senator Ferguson coming from South Australia no doubt recognises, are hardworking seasonal itinerant workers. They come back year after year to the same district to bring in the fruit crop.
The problem we have today is that, because of a range of factors, particularly because of the depressed—in fact, collapsed—price for fruit internationally, Australian fruit growers are being hit harder than they have ever been hit before. It is no good standing up and talking about strategies and plans for partnerships when you have the jobs of 9,000 employees under threat and you have the interests of 3,000 fruit growers under threat. Action has to be taken and taken now.
—What are your solutions? 
—I will come in a moment to what we propose, Senator Ferguson. We are here talking about the  failures of this government.
This is one of Australia's major rural industries. It has a great tradition in this country. For a long time Australia has been about 75 per cent self-sufficient in terms of its requirements for fruit and fruit juice. As Senator Woodley referred to, and as I think all members of parliament know—if they do not they should know because of the constant cries from industry representatives and from my former trade union, the Australian Workers Union, to members of parliament who have been lobbying us—we have this major problem of the importation of large quantities of Brazilian fruit juice concentrate.
We all recognise that Australia played a leading role in the promotion of trade liberalisation. Our government, the former Labor government, was at the forefront of that with the establishment of the Cairns Group. We do not resile in any respect from that, but the dilemma that is faced today that was not necessarily faced even a couple of years ago is that, with this massive collapse in prices that has occurred in the last couple of years and with the ability for manufacturers in this country to import huge quantities of Brazilian fruit juice and then market it often in a disguised way or in a misunderstood way as if it is produce of Australia because it has Australian water added to it, we have fruit growers and fruit industry workers on their knees.
This government has talked about what it is going to do in the areas of labelling, but when is it going to get around to it? This issue has been on the government's doorstep for at least 12 months. This government has talked about the fact that industries should cooperate and participate in developing alternative products. That may be a good long-term view, but when it came to the crunch in the textile, clothing and footwear industry and when it came to the crunch in the motor vehicle industry this government was forced to backtrack on the implementation of its policies. That was because of the 
 critical situation that was reached in those industries.
It is quite clear that one can support quite openly the appropriate reduction of tariffs over time. But crisis situations do arise in industries, as they did in the steel industry when our government was in office—and we dealt with it at the time, as would be known about by Senator George Campbell. Your government eventually was forced to the table with textile clothing and footwear and vehicle manufacturing industries. So why can't you also do the same thing in respect of the citrus industry?
We have a situation where growers and grower organisations have been screaming for months now, sending deputations to the government, and they are still waiting for responses; they are still waiting for some glimmer of hope from this government. But, of course, this government is preoccupied. It does not really seem to have too much of a concern about the crisis facing many people in rural and regional Australia. As I said the other day, we have not heard boo from this government or this minister about the problems that have affected the people in Cobar, or in Grafton, or now in Woodlawn Mine—and equally in respect of the citrus industry.
In contrast, Senator Ferguson referred earlier to the ALP's position. The position of the ALP was firmly put down at the national conference held in Hobart only a couple of months ago. In relation to its position, I would like to read to you, Senator Ferguson, from a newspaper report of that conference. This is from the Area News, a country newspaper in rural New South Wales, of Wednesday 28 January. These are not newspapers that are necessarily noted for their great support for the Labor Party. But the heading of the article is `Welcome citrus news from ALP conference'. It states:
Citrus growers should be heartened by the knowledge their plight has been recognised and taken on board by the Australian Labor Party at national policy level.
By embedding anti-dumping measures in its core policy, the Labor Party is formally acknowledging that Australian industries must be allowed to compete fairly in order to survive. 

The Shadow Minister for Trade, Simon Crean has declared his view that Australian industry should not be forced to compete unfairly against product coming in that itself is not fairly priced.
. . .              . . .             . . .
. . . Labor is giving some hope to citrus growers and other industries which have suffered under the current trade conditions.
Then it goes on:
Support for the citrus industry has also come from Russ Collison, the State Secretary for the Australian Workers Union, who was in Griffith last year and spoke at the Citrus and Chicken Meat Rally.
The citrus industry is now waiting on a response from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer, following on the meeting at Tooleybuo recently.
As many in the industry recognise, now is the time to put pressure on politicians while they're in election mode.
So, Senator Ferguson, I would say that you can expect a few more phone calls from the citrus growers. The article concludes:
Unless something is achieved soon, then growers will be waiting for the ballot box to make their views known in the only way some politicians understand.
So the position of the Labor Party is that there needs to be urgent action; there needs to be a package of support for citrus growers and employees in the citrus industry—and that package of support should be developed and should be provided urgently. Furthermore, the long term position of the industry, particularly in respect of how it can cope with the depressed price market and the quite unfair comparative tariff levels in other countries, needs to be resolved.
In conclusion, we support this motion. It is self-evident that this government has failed the citrus growers and the citrus industry. They are but one group of many in this country that are complaining long and loud about the lack of support for rural and regional Australia.
I note that Senator Boswell will be speaking after I have concluded. Senator Boswell no doubt will try and get up here in some pathetic attempt to defend the government's record. But Senator Boswell knows just as I know that, when you go out—and Senator Woodley 
 knows this—into the rural and regional areas, as I am constantly doing, and talk to the sugar growers, or the wheat growers, or the meat industry employees, or the miners, or the local government representatives in country towns, or when you talk to the citrus growers, as I have done down in the Riverina, they have one message. That message is: this government has failed them.
What they are even more concerned about, what they are even more upset about is that the National Party has failed them. All these seats in these areas are invariably held by National Party members. I go up to Page fairly regularly—
—You have not made much impression then, have you?
—We have made a large impression, I tell you. Ian Causley is a very worried man. Just as the electors of Clarence elected Harry Woods to the state parliament with a resounding victory at that state by-election, they are going to kick Ian Causley out of his seat because he has done nothing for the farmers and people in that area. I support the motion wholeheartedly.
—Order! Senator Forshaw, would you refer to members of the other side by their proper title?
—Member Causley.
—Mr Causley, thank you.
—Mr Causley.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Citrus Industry</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-11,"—I am encouraged by the words of some members of the Labor Party today, in particular those of Senator Forshaw saying that the Labor Party has discovered some of the problems in relation to the citrus industry. I am encouraged because, as some honourable senators will know, the citrus industry was extremely concerned in the lead-up to the Uruguay Round of GATT about the implications that so-called free trade would have on the industry—and they were basically left floating at that time.
The current crisis in the citrus industry is no surprise to the Greens WA. During the 
 debate on the Uruguay Round of GATT and the World Trade Organisation, and currently in relation to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, the Greens have repeatedly warned the major parties against embracing these agreements wholeheartedly without thorough consideration of the impacts and implications for Australians. We wanted to look, if you recall, at the social, economic and environmental impacts of these changes over time. What would be the impacts on productive capacity; what would the impacts on employment; and what would be the impacts in the long run on the balance of trade—and we know what the impacts have been on that.
We also know what the impacts have been on some of those industries which were meant to be the big winners—the beef industry and the wool industry. A lot of those other rural industries were basically told to be quiet because there was going to be so much benefit for other parts of the rural industry—and, of course, it did not happen.
The major parties have assumed, without investigation, that the benefits will be realised and everyone will be a winner. The citrus industry is a shining example of the devastating effect that can result from this kind of blind attitude. The industry has been burdened with a reduction in tariff protection from 35 per cent to five per cent in the last decade, and a sales tax of 12 per cent on freshly squeezed orange juice, without adequate assistance for the industry in the adjustment phase. As a result, there has been a flood of cheap Brazilian concentrated orange juice, the citrus industry has had to destroy thousands of trees, and the viability of the industry is under threat.
We acknowledge that the export figures have increased over the last six years, and this evidences the commitment of the citrus industry to building up export markets and pursuing international areas. However, a strong home base is crucial for the continued survival of this industry, which is trying desperately and valiantly to adjust and diversify. Figures stated in the Australian Commodity Statistics 1996, produced by ABARE, show that imported orange juice has increased from a mere 7.1 per cent of domes 
 tic availability in 1988-89 to 67.8 per cent in 1995-96—or from 6.3 million litres in 1988-89 to 129.7 million litres in 1996-97. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Citrus Industry</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-03-11,"—I am not surprised at Senator Woodley's contribution to this debate, or Senator Margetts's, because they are entirely predictable. Senator Woodley travels around Queensland and other rural areas of Australia trying to canvass some support for the Democrats in those areas, and he will never get it because everything he says is totally illogical. Senator Woodley tries to highlight what he perceives to be problems but he never offers a solution. In all the time that he spoke, not once did he offer any solution. I am not surprised at his contribution, or that of Senator Margetts, but when it comes to Senator Forshaw's contribution, I am somewhat surprised.
Senator Forshaw, your government was in power for a long, long time, and a lot of the things that we have in place are there as a result of the actions taken by your government. Yet now, for some perceived political gain, you choose to change practically every view that you have had. You are now getting to the stage where you never get up and say, `All we did was wrong and we are going to change our ideas.' All you are saying is that you are going to tinker at the edges. I asked you to provide some solutions as to how this problem could be overcome—because you said you had all the solutions when you were in government, which in fact you did not—but you did not come up with one concrete solution. What would you like us to do? Would you like to raise imports?
—Senator Ferguson, address your comments through the chair.
—I am sorry, Madam Acting Deputy President. The question I would put to you is: what would Senator Forshaw have us do? Would he have us prevent imports and raise tariffs? That is one solution. That is really what you are after.
You say that many growers have called for restrictions on imports of orange juice concentrate and that is a fact; specifically, they have 
 talked about stopping imports from Brazil. But let me ask you, Senator Forshaw: what would happen if we did decide that we were going to cut our imports? If we cut off any of our markets to overseas suppliers, how is that in Australia's interest? As well as increasing prices, restrictions on imports would be challenged by our trading partners—who are members of the WTO—and this could only lead to retaliation, which would not be in the best interests of Australian industry, Australian farmers or Australian jobs.
You allude to the fact that orange juice concentrate is dumped in Australia. There are anti-dumping measures in place, but nobody has made use of the anti-dumping measures to try to stop what they perceive to be dumping of concentrated orange juice. Lost export markets, if we have retaliation, would not be in the best interests of Australian industry, Australian farmers, rural producers or Australian jobs. There are 130 countries in the World Trade Organisation and there are another 28 countries seeking to get into it because of the benefits it provides. Not once, Senator Woodley, did I hear you mention any of the benefits it provides, because with 0.3 per cent of the world's population and only one per cent of the world's trade, Australia cannot gain by closing off our markets and having our export markets shrink.
We do not believe that we can just naively go outside the rules agreed on in the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations which were finalised by the previous government. Your government finalised them, and we do not believe that we can just naively go outside those rules. That hard-won market access has benefits of an estimated $5 billion per annum to Australian industry, including $1 billion to the agricultural sector. The government is not prepared to put at risk these benefits to the wider Australian community.
The benefits of open trade are not always well known because this is the good news that no-one complains about. But in citrus alone over the past two years, as my colleague Senator Troeth said, new markets have been opened up in Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines and the United States. We know that the situation is not a level playing field, but we 
 must work hard to make it fairer. That is what this government has been consistently trying to do for a number of years now, and yet you would turn your back, Senator Forshaw, on those things that have made world trade much fairer today than it ever was—
—What about all the blue-collar workers?
—I am not sure that he is very concerned about the blue-collar workers, but let me tell you that it has been made fairer and we have not turned our backs like you have on your policy.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-03-11,"—My contribution may surprise the government, but I am largely going to agree with the position and strategy taken by the government on the citrus industry to date. I will be critical in respect of the resources allocated to the strategy they are following. I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate Senator Troeth on being appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.
The difficulty facing the citrus industry is, fundamentally, the importation of cheap concentrate from Brazil. There are a number of other sources but, in the main, it is coming from Brazil. The very difficult and sad fact is that the Australian industry, when it is producing for the juice market—the fresh juice market aside—cannot compete against Brazilian and other imports. Production costs in that segment of the market, for a variety of reasons, are much lower in Brazil than can be achieved in Australia. Unfortunately, Australian citrus producers—if they are producing in the main for juice concentrate—cannot compete against Brazil.
We had this debate back in 1994, and I am glad Senator Boswell is in the chamber because he was one who contributed on that occasion. We had the debate when we were considering eight bills in respect of the World Trade Organisation.
The simple solution that is advocated is to put a tariff on imported concentrates of juice. The fact is that the juice concentrate being imported into this country does not fit into the category of dumping. It is produced at a 
 lower cost and we cannot compete in that segment of the market. If you were to consider a tariff, putting aside the difficulties that Senator Ferguson has mentioned for example, it would have to be a tariff of massive proportions. It would have to be a tariff of 100, 200 or 300 per cent and that is simply not possible if we are to meet our obligations in respect of the various GATT agreements and the World Trade Organisation. It is simply not possible and I certainly do not advocate that.
The approach that the Labor Party took when it was in office was to try, in a proactive way, to assist the industry to refocus and to restructure—to deal with the fundamental problems that the Australian citrus industry faces. Except for Queensland—and I am sure Senator Boswell is aware of the structure of the industry in Queensland—the producers of citrus are generally small scale land-holders, especially in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Many of them have properties that have been inherited from solider settlement days. These are very small properties where it is difficult to obtain an economy of scale.
The citrus industry, in common with many other areas around Australia and many other sectors of the agricultural industry, is facing the phasing of full cost recovery for water in the area of irrigation. That is a substantial problem of adjustment, particularly for the citrus industry, which is a very substantial user of water. The cost recovery of water is a position subscribed to by Labor, and Liberal and National Party governments at a federal and state level.
One of the critical problems for producers in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria is that their pack-out rate—in other words, the proportion of their crop that is produced and sold as whole fruit where it is possible to make money—is very low. I do not know the latest figures—
—Sixty per cent, isn't it?
—In 1994 I think it was about 30 per cent. I suspect it has actually improved since then.
—Forty per cent go and 60 per cent are for juice.
—That is right. If it is 40 per cent at the present time then 60 per cent of their crop, which is hand picked, goes to juice. It is a market they cannot compete in against the Brazilian imports.
That is contrasted to the situation in your home state of Queensland, Senator Boswell, where the pack-out is between 80 and 90 per cent. Eighty or 90 per cent of the fruit that is picked is for the whole fruit market, whether it is domestic or export. Only a very small proportion of the crop goes to the juice market. That is one advantage that Queensland growers have. Also, because of the climatic differences, Queensland growers are able to market in the domestic market and to some extent in the export market before southern growers. That is another important advantage that Queensland growers have. Thirdly, the properties of Queensland growers, on average, are larger than properties in southern Australia, so there is an economy of scale factor. I also understand that substantial sections of the Queensland industry are relatively new in a sense compared to the three southern states. Therefore it is very difficult for producers in the three southern states to compete in the juice concentrate market.
What was the approach of Labor when it was in government? I think Senator Ferguson was a little uncharitable in his remarks. Labor did recognise that there were some fundamental structural problems. Labor and the minister for primary industries and energy at the time, Senator Bob Collins, announced the allocation of $9 million for various programs in the citrus industry. This was a good example of the role of government in being proactive in industry development and industry assistance.
What was the $9 million for? It was for a variety of proactive programs to benefit the citrus industry, including citrus promotion, additional research for new markets, fresh juice promotion, export marketing and product identity. That was a Labor Party initiative. I know Senator Boswell argued at the time about whether or not it was enough.
The area where I will be critical of this government is their reduction of the funding from $9 million to $8.5 million. That is very 
 disappointing given the very serious nature of the problems facing the citrus industry. It could certainly be argued that in the current climate, with the continuing increase of imports, particularly of Brazilian concentrate, the allocation of money could have been increased. I hope you take that suggestion on board, Senator Boswell, because I would like to see the National Party flex its muscles in this and other primary industry areas. Unfortunately that muscle is sadly lacking. That is not a personal reflection on you but unfortunately, under the current coalition arrangements, the voice of the National Party is not being heard in this and some other areas. That has been reflected in that budget allocation of $8.5 million.
The fundamental challenge for the citrus growers, particularly in the southern states of Australia, is to improve the pack out rate. I acknowledge that that is not easy to do. It means a significant change in practices. Unfortunately, I think it does mean a significant increase in the average size of properties. Unfortunately, that means some rationalisation of the industry. I have to be honest about it. I think that is happening and is inevitably going to continue. But there is an important role for government in providing both positive assistance and assistance in other forms to the growers in that industry.
I also think this does mean ongoing upgrading of many of our irrigation projects around Australia. I do not hold federal governments responsible for this, but it is a sad fact that successive state governments have neglected the irrigation infrastructure in this country. It is all very well to have constructed irrigation projects around the country and to have encouraged soldier settlement. I applaud that. But over a long period state governments did not upgrade the irrigation infrastructure in this country. We still have open channel irrigation in this country, and that is very inefficient for the delivery of water.
I have touched very briefly in my contribution to this debate on some of the essential elements and problems that are facing the citrus industry. I do have some time left so perhaps I will highlight the last figures I have available, which I think are for 1992-93. I am 
 sure these have changed, but they do illustrate the problem. The average return to a grower for concentrate was $90 per tonne. The average cost of production was $150 a tonne in 1992-93. It is probably worse now. Fresh juice products gave an average return of $176 to a grower and the production costs were $150, so they could just make ends meet in the fresh juice area. Domestic fruit orange sales were $200 a tonne and production costs were $150 a tonne. Export navel oranges gave a return of $324 to the grower and had a production cost return of $150. I am sure those figures have got worse. I can see Senator Boswell nodding. He may have some updated figures.
I have been a touch critical of the government and I have to conclude by saying that the government has reached some agreements for export marketing. It could have been a little more balanced and acknowledged that in 1995 we did improve the market access to Thailand.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-03-11,"—At the outset, let me commend Senator Sherry for a speech that was truthful and honest. Sometimes in this place you have to do that. You have to stand up and tell people what is good for them, although they might not want to hear it. Going out and misleading them, telling them you can build up artificial trade barriers and raise the tariffs sounds good, Senator Woodley, but it is not. You are playing right into the hands of Pauline Hanson. You are where the left meets the right. You are firmly jammed up together with her, arms around each other, walking towards dishonesty and towards misleading the primary industries of Australia.
—Who is going to swap preferences with whom? That will really be the test, whose arm is around who.
—Your arm is firmly around Ms Pauline Hanson's shoulders, as you march together, misleading the primary producers of Australia. Much as he would like a tariff barrier to help him out, any primary producer knows that it is not feasible. As Senator Sherry correctly pointed out in his 
 contribution, if we were to do that we would need tariffs of around 200-300 per cent. That is not feasible.
Senator Woodley, let me address a couple of items you brought up which were relevant. When I was listening to you on the TV, I responded to your address by ringing Warren Truss's office up and saying, `When is this labelling legislation coming through?' I was told that the labelling legislation would be coming into this parliament around 30 March. I have two press releases here to verify it. The points you pick up on labelling are valid, and I believe the government has responded to those points by having legislation which it will introduce on the 30th of this month. Let us put the labelling issue to one side and say that that has been fixed.
The real issue is that Australia exports $23 billion worth of food and fibre. Through that process, it creates 180,000 blue collar jobs. Those are the jobs of people that work in Golden Circle, in the sugar mills and in the abattoirs. They all depend on trade liberalisation. The more the tariffs come down in overseas countries, the more our export markets increase and, therefore, the more blue collar jobs increase. The highest employer of blue collar workers in this nation is the food processing industry. It produces and provides 180,000 jobs to Australian workers. I expect you have been down to Golden Circle, Senator Woodley—
—On a number of occasions.
—on a number of occasions, as all good Queensland senators would. The reduction in the sugar tariff meant about $800,000 to Golden Circle. It meant $200,000 to the ginger industry. They can increase their production and their profits and their workers' wages. They can put on more workers and export. That is how it works. If you reduce your costs, you can increase your production.
But then you talk about the industry being in crisis. I accept that some sections of the industry are in crisis—I have to acknowledge that—but some sections of the industry are doing very nicely. Some sections of the industry, particularly the ones in Queensland 
 where they have gone into easy peel fruits and they have access to early markets, are doing exceptionally well. Mention a tariff to them and they will run you off their property. They do not want a tariff because they can get into the export markets, and they do not want any retaliation from Asia or the US, which have cut their tariffs and provided them with export market opportunities. We are now exporting $175 million in citrus—$175 million worth of oranges and easy peel fruits, including mandarins, are going out. So $175 million of navels are going out and around $46 million in the equivalent of orange juice concentrate is coming in. Where the swings meet the roundabouts the industry is doing reasonably well.
I accept totally that some people in the industry are not doing well, and I hear it ad nauseam from John Forrest in our party room—how we have got to do more and how we have got to provide more adjustment. I hear it, I listen to him and I know the agony that he is going through.
—A true National. He is a good man.
—Yes, he is. I know that he has fought for and won some $3½ million worth of concessions for the fruit industry in his electorate. The way out of this—and we have got to understand it because we are doing so well—is with our exports: $23 billion worth of exports and we are actually importing about $4 billion worth of food.
The dairy industry is going particularly well: $1.6 billion worth of exports. Mention tariffs to them and they go into cold shock. The sugar industry is going particularly well. The wheat industry is going particularly well. We are exporting $23 billion worth of food and importing $4 billion worth of product.
Senator Woodley, if you got your way—and I do not think you do this out of ignorance; I think you actually do it out of goodwill, but your intentions are very misplaced—we would rely totally on a domestic industry. We would stop imports, we would stop exports, and someone has then got to go out to the Australian farmer and say, `I am totally sorry. Four out of five of you have got to go be 
 cause we need only one farmer in five to grow enough, to produce enough, for Australia's domestic industry.' If your policies were implemented, Senator Woodley, someone would have to go out and say `You are redundant' to four out of five farmers.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-03-11,"—in reply—I will reply particularly to some of the statements made by some of the government senators on this matter of public importance. I am really amazed that Senator Boswell did not actually say what his government was going to do. He spent most of his time saying what he thought my policy was and, of course, he is wrong—but that is okay. In reply to Senator Boswell, Senator Ferguson and Senator Troeth, let me give you one solution: how about some support for our domestic markets instead of destroying them? I am not saying that we should close our borders, but I will tell you what the orange growers are saying. They are saying, `Give us a little bit of support for a change instead of allowing us to be destroyed.'
The Democrats do not believe in the rhetoric about global trade. We have not seen any improvement in the fairness in the global market, and there never will be. We believe that you are chasing after a rainbow, and it is about time that you woke up.
Senator Boswell said that I have got my arm around Pauline Hanson. We will see, come the federal election, where the National Party's preferences go, because I can tell you that the Democrats have already declared we will put her last. I suspect that you will find that there will be a cosy deal done between Pauline Hanson's One Nation and the National Party because they are desperate. They are going to lose a lot of their seats unless they can do that deal with her. We know where their votes are going.
I am glad to hear that labelling legislation is in the pipeline at last because a lot of the farmers organisations really believed, when they heard this promise at the last election, that was actually going to happen fairly soon. It has come very late in the life of this parliament. I might say that we will look very carefully at that legislation because the cur 
 rent legislation in terms of labelling is really quite useless.
Senator Troeth said this government would not interfere with the industry. She really means that we will allow the citrus industry to try and compete with imports from Brazil. I will finish a quote that I was making in my previous contribution to show you just how unfair is the market that we compete in. The Original Juice Company pays Australian orange growers $210 per tonne and the average labour rate is $110 per day. Brazilian orange juice concentrate manufacturers pay their orange growers $30 per tonne and the labour rate is $4 per day. I presume that is what the government wants our workers to be paid.

"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-03-11,"—I want to take the opportunity to speak very briefly on the presentation of this report. I do it particularly for the reason that the chair of this committee is my colleague Senator Barney Cooney from Victoria. Senator Cooney was listed on our side as a speaker on the censure motion that took place here this morning but, when Senator Alston moved in with his gag motion, Senator Cooney and other senators on this side of the chamber were not able to make a contribution to that debate. It is the first time in 17 years that the gag has been moved and carried on a censure motion. 
—Disgraceful.
—It is indeed disgraceful, Senator Conroy. It is worse than disgraceful, but we have got a probity in this place about the type and form of language that we use and I am not going to go further. It is indeed, as you said, disgraceful to move a gag in that fashion. Of course, the censure motion was carried—
—You're not going to gag the native title debate.
—No, we want to speak on native title. Your motion is on the Notice Paper . I think it is next up. Actually, I was prepared to talk on that this morning. It was you running around the chamber that got things moving on that particular motion, not this side of the chamber. We are more than prepared to talk about that motion. But I am not dealing with that now; I am dealing with a very important report which has been presented to the chamber by Senator Conroy on behalf of Senator Cooney. I will explain briefly the circumstances in which I am speaking and the reason why I am speaking.
—You are a hypocrite. You voted to gag native title.
—I am not going to gag native title and I am certainly not a hypocrite. Believe it or not, Senator Campbell, today is 11 March 1998 and I am talking about events of today, not events of the past. But I am very concerned about events of the future, because major precedents have been set in this place today—precedents which will be remembered. I am not talking about the precedent that I suppose I am setting in getting up and speaking to this usually non-controversial report, the Alert Digest  that has been presented. I cannot recall, in the time I have been in this chamber, where a senator has actually got to their feet and spoken on reports such as this. I have been here a few years and I cannot recall it happening.
The precedent I am really concerned about is the gag that was moved and, unfortunately, was supported by the Australian Democrats and was carried. We will be remembering and recalling these precedents, because they always come back to us. That is particularly 
 the case when we talk about due process. We talk about due process when the character of a colleague, a fellow senator, is on the line. The government know they have got the numbers with them and they can close the debate and stop people like Senator Barney Cooney speaking in defence of his colleague. The Australian Democrats sided with the government in order to silence Senator Cooney. It is not all that easy to silence Senator Cooney because he, like the rest of us on this side, has got a long memory. Were it not for the fact that he has got other important business in another part of this building today, he might in fact be in here speaking to his important report. It is a non-controversial report.
Let me address a few comments to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which is so ably chaired by Senator Barney Cooney. I have not had the opportunity to look at the particular content of the report that is before us, but we can look at last week's report. This is actually the second report of this year, which shows you what a hard-working committee it is. Senator Calvert would appreciate that; he always appreciates hard-working committees. Last week this particular committee addressed their minds to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 1997 , the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2], the  Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill 1997 , the  Company Law Review Bill 1997 , the  Criminal Code Amendment Bill 1997 [1998] , the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997, the  Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Law Officers Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Managed Investments Bill 1997 , the  NRS Levy Imposition Bill 1997 , the  Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 , the  Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997 , the  Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment—Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997 , the  Tax 
 ation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1997 , the  Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill 1997 , the  Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , the  Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 , and the  Workplace Relations Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1997 .
—What about my ballast Water levy collection bill?
—Your ballast water bill is coming. I am assured it is on the way. It is probably in this week's report. One of the issues that I did note in last week's report was how it addressed the matter, which was somewhat controversial at the time, of the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997 .
—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. I think that Senator McKiernan has made a most eloquent attempt to filibuster this debate. I think it is an unprecedented debate on a motion to submit the report. We know that, although the Labor Party are trying to force—
—What is the point of order?
—I am coming to the point of order. It is to do with relevance. The Labor Party will do anything to stop us coming to a vote on the cut-off motion on the native title bill. Clearly the left wing senators in this place are determined—
—I object to that.
—I do not look at you, Senator Conroy, when I say that. The left wing senators in this place are determined to overrule Kim Beazley, their leader, on this agreement they have made to exempt the bills from the cut-off. They will do anything to stop the Senate today coming to a vote on the cut-off motion on the native title bill.
—Senator Campbell, please come to the point.
—I am coming to the point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. For a senator to get up and debate a motion to print the bill, a standard motion, is unprecedented—the first time in the history of Australia as far as I can determine—and a clear act of filibustering to stop the Senate coming to a vote on this cut-off legislation so 
 that the people of Australia will know where the Senate is going on the native title legislation. It is, of course, absurd and childish and very unlike Senator McKiernan, who is a good, fellow Western Australian.
—There is no point of order.
—On the point of order, to debate the printing of this week's bill is, of course, in order. But to debate matters out of last week's report by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is entirely irrelevant to this debate to print this week's report, and I would ask you to bring Senator McKiernan to order.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. There is no doubt that this spurious point of order that has been raised is in fact an attempt to waste the time of the Senate to prevent us from discussing this issue.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, will you make a ruling on this point of order?
—I am speaking to the point of order.
—Senator Carr and Senator Campbell, please both resume your seats. I have sought advice; my advice is that there is no point of order. There is no reason for any further discussion on this point.
—Can I take a point of order?
—No. There is no point of order.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Campbell made references to certain people being left wing. I take that seriously. I have never been called that in my life.
—What is your point of order? What standing order?
—I think I have been defamed. It is a reflection on my character.
—There is no point of order.
—The relevance of what I am talking about is the importance of 
 the committee. The point I was just getting to related to the very important and necessary work the committee did in the report on the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997 that was presented to the parliament last week.
There were some difficulties with the bill as first presented to the Senate. The bill went to the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. They picked up this particular matter that was of concern and they, without delaying the Senate and using the very valuable time of the Senate, Senator Campbell, referred the judiciary bill to the Attorney-General's office—
—You hypocrite!
—Order! Senator Campbell, you referred to Senator McKiernan as a hypocrite, and I ask you to withdraw.
—He is! He spent four and a half hours trying to censure Michael Baume less than three years ago.
—Senator Campbell, I ask you to withdraw.
—If you ask me to, of course I will.
—There goes another minute, I think. The point I was trying to make was about the Judiciary Amendment Bill and how the committee saved the valuable time of the Senate by referring the particular clause with the problem to the Attorney-General and getting written advice from him on that matter. Those details are contained in the report that was presented last week. When I get a copy of it, I will address matters that are contained in the report for this week, which has just been presented to the parliament, but, unfortunately, I have not been given a copy of this week's report as yet.
In making my contribution, I have given all of the credit for the work of this committee to Senator Cooney. I know, from my work around the parliament, that it is not only the chair of the committee who makes the contributions on committees such as this. He is ably supported, dare I say, by my other colleague from Western Australia Senator Winston Crane, who is deputy chair of the committee. Senator Cooney talks to me about these 
 matters. He is also supported by Senator Ferris, Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Andrew Murray and my good friend over here Senator John Quirke from South Australia, who is in here making very valuable contributions to the good governance of this nation.

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-11,"—As a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee I should make some comment on the proceedings, and I take this opportunity to indicate to the Senate that I have learnt a great deal in the six months that I have been here as a result of my membership of this committee. Indeed, one of the first things I learnt was how to use an alarm clock because it meets very early of a morning. I think the only committee that meets any earlier is the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, and I want to thank the Senate for discharging me from that committee as of this day, I believe, last week.
I must say that the scrutiny of bills committees and, indeed, the regulations and ordinances committees in many of the smaller parliaments around Australia are amalgamated into one committee that looks at both bills and at delegated legislation. I think the Scrutiny of Bills Committee does an excellent job. It certainly has a very important charter which, I understand, was set up in 1981 and, indeed, one of the most important elements of its charter is to deal with the question of retrospectivity.
I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time this afternoon, except to say that retrospectivity comes in two shapes and forms, as I found out with this particular committee. I thought it was a fairly open and shut case, but that is not so. In fact, there are 
 sometimes unintended consequences of many of the bills that come through this place, and the retrospectivity elements of some of those unintended consequences have drawn the attention of the committee. There are others where there is, in fact, an inadvertent attempt at retrospectivity in the sense that bills have come through and they make determinations which necessarily involve going back some time—in some instances, back to announcements made by the government.
Probably one of the clearest examples of that is the package of bills that has gone through here, which the committee had a very close look at, in respect of the budget, particularly in 1996—the budget in 1996 came down, as I understand it, on 20 August. There is a whole range of tax measures and other items that have gone through the committee in the time I have been there which will, when they go through this place—or those that have already gone through and received royal assent—have an impact from that particular date.
In the meeting this week—and it is not my position, Senator McKiernan, to go into too many of the precise details—we spent over an hour on a number of key elements involving this very vexed question of retrospectivity. The report that will shortly come down as a result of this week's meeting of the committee will deal again with a range of measures, particularly taxation measures. One which is very close to my heart is in respect of the trigger times for when this legislation will operate. I will come to that in just a moment.
For some time there has been a problem with favourable tax deals in South Australia, particularly on the Parafield aerodrome where a much more favourable tax treatment has been used by the owners of the liquor stores there. There have been a couple of owners taking advantage of these favourable deals. In state politics I have managed to close up most of those deals, with the exception of the question of the liquor licensing fees and the liquor licensing taxes. The other state impositions, which eventually we managed to have placed on these premises because they are on Commonwealth land, involved every aspect of gaming machines and opening and closing 
 hours, as I understand it. All of the liquor operations on the Parafield aerodrome—and I presume in the rest of the country—now have to mirror the state legislative provisions.
As a result of a bill which is shortly to come before the Senate and which the committee has had a very close look at there will be a mirror tax treatment now for these particular operators. So, in fact, they will not be at an advantage as compared with the rest of my constituents—the rest of the businesses around there that have to pay their legitimate state taxes. The state government is not getting the tax; the Commonwealth government is getting it but at least it establishes a level playing field.
I want to finish my remarks by saying that I have enjoyed my time on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. It has been a learning curve for me over the last six months. I want to thank the old hands here, like Senator McKiernan and the others, for their encouragement to go on this committee. I think Senator McKiernan was being unduly abused before and Senator Hogg felt abused when he was called `Left'. I have been called `Left' for a good part of my life, Senator, and it is a badge that I have carried—wrongfully, I might say—quite often quite proudly.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: on the Senate red I note that a report from the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is listed for presentation by the chair, Senator O'Chee. It is a paper on the scrutiny of national uniform legislative schemes. I wonder what has happened to that report? Has that been gagged as well, as we saw this morning?
—Senator, the Chair is not cognisant of what has happened. No-one arose to give that report. The next item is variation of committee memberships.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-03-11,"—At the request of Senator Cooney, I present the second report of 1998 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 2 of 1998  dated 11 March 1998.

That the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,21,2,speech
"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-03-11,"—I want to take the opportunity to speak very briefly on the presentation of this report. I do it particularly for the reason that the chair of this committee is my colleague Senator Barney Cooney from Victoria. Senator Cooney was listed on our side as a speaker on the censure motion that took place here this morning but, when Senator Alston moved in with his gag motion, Senator Cooney and other senators on this side of the chamber were not able to make a contribution to that debate. It is the first time in 17 years that the gag has been moved and carried on a censure motion. 
—Disgraceful.
—It is indeed disgraceful, Senator Conroy. It is worse than disgraceful, but we have got a probity in this place about the type and form of language that we use and I am not going to go further. It is indeed, as you said, disgraceful to move a gag in that fashion. Of course, the censure motion was carried—
—You're not going to gag the native title debate.
—No, we want to speak on native title. Your motion is on the Notice Paper . I think it is next up. Actually, I was prepared to talk on that this morning. It was you running around the chamber that got things moving on that particular motion, not this side of the chamber. We are more than prepared to talk about that motion. But I am not dealing with that now; I am dealing with a very important report which has been presented to the chamber by Senator Conroy on behalf of Senator Cooney. I will explain briefly the circumstances in which I am speaking and the reason why I am speaking.
—You are a hypocrite. You voted to gag native title.
—I am not going to gag native title and I am certainly not a hypocrite. Believe it or not, Senator Campbell, today is 11 March 1998 and I am talking about events of today, not events of the past. But I am very concerned about events of the future, because major precedents have been set in this place today—precedents which will be remembered. I am not talking about the precedent that I suppose I am setting in getting up and speaking to this usually non-controversial report, the Alert Digest  that has been presented. I cannot recall, in the time I have been in this chamber, where a senator has actually got to their feet and spoken on reports such as this. I have been here a few years and I cannot recall it happening.
The precedent I am really concerned about is the gag that was moved and, unfortunately, was supported by the Australian Democrats and was carried. We will be remembering and recalling these precedents, because they always come back to us. That is particularly 
 the case when we talk about due process. We talk about due process when the character of a colleague, a fellow senator, is on the line. The government know they have got the numbers with them and they can close the debate and stop people like Senator Barney Cooney speaking in defence of his colleague. The Australian Democrats sided with the government in order to silence Senator Cooney. It is not all that easy to silence Senator Cooney because he, like the rest of us on this side, has got a long memory. Were it not for the fact that he has got other important business in another part of this building today, he might in fact be in here speaking to his important report. It is a non-controversial report.
Let me address a few comments to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which is so ably chaired by Senator Barney Cooney. I have not had the opportunity to look at the particular content of the report that is before us, but we can look at last week's report. This is actually the second report of this year, which shows you what a hard-working committee it is. Senator Calvert would appreciate that; he always appreciates hard-working committees. Last week this particular committee addressed their minds to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 1997 , the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2], the  Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill 1997 , the  Company Law Review Bill 1997 , the  Criminal Code Amendment Bill 1997 [1998] , the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997, the  Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Law Officers Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Managed Investments Bill 1997 , the  NRS Levy Imposition Bill 1997 , the  Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 , the  Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997 , the  Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 1997 , the  Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment—Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997 , the  Tax 
 ation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1997 , the  Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill 1997 , the  Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , the  Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 , and the  Workplace Relations Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1997 .
—What about my ballast Water levy collection bill?
—Your ballast water bill is coming. I am assured it is on the way. It is probably in this week's report. One of the issues that I did note in last week's report was how it addressed the matter, which was somewhat controversial at the time, of the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997 .
—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. I think that Senator McKiernan has made a most eloquent attempt to filibuster this debate. I think it is an unprecedented debate on a motion to submit the report. We know that, although the Labor Party are trying to force—
—What is the point of order?
—I am coming to the point of order. It is to do with relevance. The Labor Party will do anything to stop us coming to a vote on the cut-off motion on the native title bill. Clearly the left wing senators in this place are determined—
—I object to that.
—I do not look at you, Senator Conroy, when I say that. The left wing senators in this place are determined to overrule Kim Beazley, their leader, on this agreement they have made to exempt the bills from the cut-off. They will do anything to stop the Senate today coming to a vote on the cut-off motion on the native title bill.
—Senator Campbell, please come to the point.
—I am coming to the point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. For a senator to get up and debate a motion to print the bill, a standard motion, is unprecedented—the first time in the history of Australia as far as I can determine—and a clear act of filibustering to stop the Senate coming to a vote on this cut-off legislation so 
 that the people of Australia will know where the Senate is going on the native title legislation. It is, of course, absurd and childish and very unlike Senator McKiernan, who is a good, fellow Western Australian.
—There is no point of order.
—On the point of order, to debate the printing of this week's bill is, of course, in order. But to debate matters out of last week's report by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is entirely irrelevant to this debate to print this week's report, and I would ask you to bring Senator McKiernan to order.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. There is no doubt that this spurious point of order that has been raised is in fact an attempt to waste the time of the Senate to prevent us from discussing this issue.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, will you make a ruling on this point of order?
—I am speaking to the point of order.
—Senator Carr and Senator Campbell, please both resume your seats. I have sought advice; my advice is that there is no point of order. There is no reason for any further discussion on this point.
—Can I take a point of order?
—No. There is no point of order.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Campbell made references to certain people being left wing. I take that seriously. I have never been called that in my life.
—What is your point of order? What standing order?
—I think I have been defamed. It is a reflection on my character.
—There is no point of order.
—The relevance of what I am talking about is the importance of 
 the committee. The point I was just getting to related to the very important and necessary work the committee did in the report on the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997 that was presented to the parliament last week.
There were some difficulties with the bill as first presented to the Senate. The bill went to the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. They picked up this particular matter that was of concern and they, without delaying the Senate and using the very valuable time of the Senate, Senator Campbell, referred the judiciary bill to the Attorney-General's office—
—You hypocrite!
—Order! Senator Campbell, you referred to Senator McKiernan as a hypocrite, and I ask you to withdraw.
—He is! He spent four and a half hours trying to censure Michael Baume less than three years ago.
—Senator Campbell, I ask you to withdraw.
—If you ask me to, of course I will.
—There goes another minute, I think. The point I was trying to make was about the Judiciary Amendment Bill and how the committee saved the valuable time of the Senate by referring the particular clause with the problem to the Attorney-General and getting written advice from him on that matter. Those details are contained in the report that was presented last week. When I get a copy of it, I will address matters that are contained in the report for this week, which has just been presented to the parliament, but, unfortunately, I have not been given a copy of this week's report as yet.
In making my contribution, I have given all of the credit for the work of this committee to Senator Cooney. I know, from my work around the parliament, that it is not only the chair of the committee who makes the contributions on committees such as this. He is ably supported, dare I say, by my other colleague from Western Australia Senator Winston Crane, who is deputy chair of the committee. Senator Cooney talks to me about these

—Can we do the committee memberships first? We had moved on to that; you called it.
—Minister, I have called Senator Bishop. There was some confusion.
—You had called committee memberships and I was on my feet.

—I am sorry, Minister. I have called Senator Bishop and if leave is granted we will proceed with his matter.
Leave granted.
—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to make a few remarks concerning the Defence Determination 1998-99. It is tabled by a Mr Nicholas Jefferson Ford, the Director-General, Financial Conditions, Defence Personnel Executive, Department of Defence. He, of course, is acting under a delegation made by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business under the relevant regulation—regulation 72A of the Defence Force regulations made pursuant to a determination under section 58B of the Defence Act 1903. It is all properly in accordance with procedures as required under the relevant act, I point out to the chamber.
The explanatory statement attached to the tabling of Defence Determination 1998-99 is of great interest and relevance to this chamber and to those listening on broadcast because it relates to something that is very close to the interests of many persons employed under 
 industrial awards—enterprise bargaining agreements and certified agreements,  whether made under state legislation or the relevant federal legislation. This Defence Determination 1998-99 authorises a bereavement payment equivalent to four fortnightly pays to provide transitional financial assistance for dependants of Defence Force members who die while rendering continuous full-time service. So that bereavement leave to members of families of Defence personnel who die or are killed in carrying out their duties is of great relevance.
Bereavement leave has a long and chequered history in Australian industrial life. It first emerged as an award condition in the 1950s, when it was the subject of a series of test cases in both relevant state tribunals and what was then the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The first grant was given by a full bench in 1952 or 1953. It awarded a very limited form of bereavement leave to immediate family members of a deceased worker employed under an industrial instrument—an industrial instrument being an industrial award or a federal award of that Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.
Over time it became a routine clause of most industrial awards—indeed, probably of all industrial awards in this country. The first significant expansion of bereavement leave was when it was awarded not only to full-time workers but also to part-time workers. Part-time workers were quite rare in the pre-war days. The dominant form of employment was full-time. Casual work was supplementary labour. Part-time labour came into most industries in the immediate postwar years. In those days a series of test cases had to be run by the trade union movement to extend to part-time workers the benefits that existed under industrial awards and which formerly were awarded only to full-time workers. The extension of that particular benefit to part-time workers occurred in the late 1950s.
Through the sixties and seventies the benefit was extended from being given only to the immediate family members of the affected worker to being given to a wider range of persons who were interested in the welfare of that worker—sisters, brothers, 
 grandparents, nieces and nephews, and the like. In the late 1970s there came a standard benefit of paid leave; prior to that time, bereavement had been unpaid leave. That is, if a worker or employee employed under an industrial award should have died or been killed in the course of his employment, the preparatory time leading up to his or her funeral, when the worker's dependants needed to go through the preparations, was regarded as unpaid leave when they took time away from work. Of course, the worker's family suffered some additional financial disadvantage or harm because of that unpaid leave.
The reason I have given a detailed background on the development of bereavement leave is that it was one of the foundations upon which the ACTU built its family leave test case in the late 1980s, early 1990s. That family leave test case was a most significant milestone for what was then the new type of work force—a work force that was radically different from that which existed prior to then and which had been developing since the war years.
That family leave test case before a full bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ended up being quite successful because it allowed workers employed under all state and federal industrial awards—it was shifted through a number of state tribunals—to access the range of leave that existed—annual leave, sick leave, long service leave and other types of leave—for the purpose of bereavement leave. That was particularly relevant in a mobile society where labour was increasingly shifting from city to city—interstate as well. It meant that, when there was a death in the family and a lot of the necessary funeral and business arrangements had to be taken care of quickly, workers could have access to other forms of leave in the period leading up to and immediately after the funeral of their departed one.
Other industries took a different approach. For instance, industries dominated by female workers chose not to access existing forms of leave as a supplement for bereavement leave. Instead, they chose to go down the path of negotiating additional family leave entitlement clauses of sometimes two, three or four days. 
 Of course, that was a significant benefit and was appreciated greatly in those industries.
With that background to the development of bereavement leave leading into family leave, I turn to the explanatory statement attached to the Defence Determination 1998-99, made under the Defence Act 1903. I note that the new provisions are contained in a new part C, which is inserted into an existing principle determination. That determination goes by the name of Defence Determination No. 12, 1997. It deals with the financial entitlements on the death of a member of the Australian Defence Forces.
Clauses 1 to 8 of this determination set out the formal provisions and make very minor consequential changes to the principle determination arising from the inclusion of the new part. We are told that clause 9 of the explanatory memorandum inserts the new part C, which authorises bereavement payment. The six main effects of the new provision are as follows. Firstly, clause 7 defines a term used in the new part. Secondly, clause 8 establishes a notional pay period for the purpose of assessing the amount of bereavement payment. This corresponds with the last complete fortnight of the member's service.
Thirdly, clause 9 sets out an interpretation of the concept of gross fortnightly pay used in calculating the entitlement. I am sure you would be interested to know that the concept is based upon the deceased member's gross fortnightly pay for the notional pay period. Provision is made for the average amount of gross fortnightly pay during the member's final three months of service to be substituted in cases where the amount for the notional pay period is below the average.
Fourthly, clause 10 in the insertion in the amending document specifies the deceased members to whom the new part applies. Fifthly, clause 11 authorises payment, in accordance with clause 12, of an amount of bereavement payment set at four times the specified amount of gross fortnightly pay. Payment is to be made in equal instalments. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-11,"—The costs associated with the youth allowance measure have been used by the government as their fallback position at every stage of this debate. If the bill is demonstrated to be unfair to young people, the Greens (WA) point out that young people will be worse off under the bill. Senator Newman has invoked her mantra that the bill is a spending measure, not a savings measure. On the other hand, when the Greens propose measures to lower the age of independence or raise the parental means testing threshold to average weekly earnings, Senator Newman would cry poor as her advisers handed her a 
 note saying that the Greens' amendment would cost $X million and could not be afforded.
So just how much faith can we put in Senator Newman's financial figures? When the bill was first introduced, the whole initiative amounted to a cost of $27.78 million for 1998-99 and $2.95 million for 1999-2000. The bill alone amounted to a saving of $9.46 million for 1998-99 and $9.27 million for 1999-2000. When the bill was introduced into the Senate, the minister had a new set of figures in which the costs for the whole initiative had risen to $53.77 million in 1998-99 and $22.52 million in 1999-2000. The bill alone has magically transformed from a savings to a cost of $52.33 million in 1998-99 and $33.52 million in 1999-2000. In the space of six months, the government managed to turn a $9.46 million saving into a $52.33 million cost, without a single change to the legislation. This amounts to an increase of just over 650 per cent in the cost of this bill.
This extra cost has been attributed to recosting based on 1998 dollar values and increased projections of youth allowance numbers in the next two years. Given that the inflation rate is very low, that student numbers are falling and that the rate of unemployment seems static, it is very hard to understand how the government arrived at a 650 per cent increase in the cost of the bill, unless it decided to undertake some creative accounting to justify the attacks on students and on the young unemployed which it has made in the youth allowance measure.
Senator Newman also conveniently fails to mention that the government has already slashed the Austudy budget—by $100 million in 1997-98 and by over $50 million in 1996-97. So that this chamber—together with the many young Australians affected by the changes, and their families—can have faith in the minister's assurances that this bill will be to their financial benefit, I ask her to explain in a clear, understandable fashion how the department arrived at a 650 per cent increase in the cost of the bill.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

 address the requests for amendment in relation to the exemption—and in relation to farm assets in particular—that have been moved by Senator John Woodley from the Australian Democrats.
In 1994, the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs received more than 250 submissions regarding this issue from a range of organisations and individuals over eight months. The conclusion that the committee came to was that the family farm should be exempted from the assets test. Evidence from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy given to that inquiry demonstrated that around 5,400 students from farming families were being denied access to Austudy as a result of the assets test. That is something the Democrats have long considered unfair, regressive and quite discriminatory to those farming families.
Unfortunately, we have stood alone in most of our attempts, certainly in the 1980s, to move the amendments that Senator Woodley is pursuing. I might add that Senator Robert Bell, who was here before Senator Woodley, did not receive any support from the National Party either when it came to moving amendments that would favour and give assistance to farming families. Farming families are often assets rich but income poor and have been penalised as a result of both this government's and the former government's rules regarding Austudy and student financial assistance.
I return to the committee's recommendations and conclusions. It found that the assets test was discriminatory to farming families, a conclusion the Democrats reached long ago. In its conclusion, it said:
The committee considers that the assets test applied to farming families in order to determine eligibility for Austudy is an inappropriate policy instrument that does not take into account the nature of farm assets and their relationship with income. In essence, the current assets test does not acknowledge that some farmers are assets rich but income poor and that farm assets cannot readily be liquidated without diminishing the viability of the farming unit.
Senator Woodley's amendments, which we are dealing with in the committee stage of the Social Security Legislation Amendment 
 (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 , help those farming families who, solely because of their farm assets, are currently excluded from receiving Austudy. City families in similar financial circumstances do receive Austudy.
I concur with the earlier comments of Senator Dee Margetts. The Democrats remain very concerned about the passage of this bill and about the policy thrust of this government in relation to the common youth allowance. As we said on record in this debate this week and last week, we support streamlining and increased flexibility when it comes to benefit payment arrangements but we still have a number of problems with the bill as it stands.
I am disappointed that attempts in the last couple of days to increase the threshold in relation to the parental means test have not been successful in this place. Similarly, the Democrats' attempts to change the age of independence have not succeeded in this chamber. I put on record my concern that the Labor Party did not support Democrat or Greens amendments to reduce the age at which students were considered independent and, therefore, eligible for the independent rate under the common youth allowance proposals. We believe the age of 25 is ridiculous. We believe the ages of independence under this bill and in the common youth allowance are concocted and are shameful ages of independence.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. The matter before the chair is an amendment relating to the assets of farm families. It has nothing to do with the age of independence for a student. I suggest the senator restrict her comments to what is before us, rather than trying to make a few extra points from the other day.
—I am surprised the Labor Party is so sensitive but, as you know, Madam Temporary Chair, the debate often ranges far and wide. What Senator Stott Despoja is saying is relevant to Austudy. Farm families are affected not only by the assets test but also by this age issue.
—Senator Stott Despoja, I encourage you to address your comments to the amendments before the chair.
—Given the time restraints, I will. The point I want to make is that this measure will increase the burden on families, particularly on those people in rural and regional areas, including farming families, who are once again going to fall through the loop. That may be due to travel requirements or to the fact that students are not considered independent until the age of 25 or to the fact that young unemployed in those areas and in those farming families are not considered independent until the age of 21. There are so many gaps in this legislation, and they mean that people, particularly those families already most discriminated against or most disadvantaged, will be adversely affected.
I have made my points on the assets test and I concur with Senator Woodley's comments about the ALP being sensitive about the age of independence. I urge the chamber, especially coalition members—and especially National Party members—to support the assets test changes Senator Woodley has moved. They genuinely will assist farming families. They are backed up by research from the Democrats, from the community, from farming families and also from the Senate committee to which I referred.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-11,"—Under the new youth allowance there is a family assets limit of $407,250. That is indexed on 1 January every year. The assets test does not apply to young people whose parents receive a pension, a benefit or an allowance. It does not apply for payment under the Farm Household Support Act or a full-time educational vocational training allowance, including Austudy.
Farm assets are disregarded for the purposes of the assets test if the person has a drought exceptional circumstances certificate. Self-employed families can already benefit from a very generous 50 per cent discount which is applied to business assets, including farm assets. That allows families with debt-free assets of nearly $800,000 to retain full eligibility for the youth allowance.
Increasing the discount to 75 per cent for all family businesses would have raised the 
 assessable assets to $1,575,000, creating the opportunity for millionaires to receive social security payments, which, I would have thought, would have attracted considerable community criticism and it would have been the first thing to be criticised by the Democrats. Increasing the primary producers' assets discount to 100 per cent would create inequity between farmers and other types of family businesses, and that would be likely to lead to calls for flow-ons to all businesses. Increasing the already generous discount would infringe one of the cardinal principles of means testing, namely that people with substantial assets are expected to use those resources for their self-support and, in this case, for the support of their children before calling on the taxpayer.
This government has reintroduced a range of measures, known as the triple A package, to assist farming families. I do not have time tonight to go into the details of that. There can be no doubt that this government is concerned about the plight of farm families—we very much understand them—but this is not the measure that is appropriate for their needs. It would be laughed out of court around the nation if we were to provide social security for millionaires.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-11,"—I find this one of the most extraordinary amendments that has come before us on this bill. The only thing I can think of is that it arises from some confusion by the Democrats about where their constituency lies. Previously, they were satisfied with coffee shop yuppies and libertarian Christians but now they are extending their influence to the bush, where they think they can pick up a few votes by telling those people on the land that no matter how large or how—
—How dare you take a point of order on me and then come up with this insulting rubbish. Address the amendments, Senator.
—I might say that it gratifies me to get a response. To suggest that property owners, farmers, who already get a 50 per cent discount and who, frankly, come out of this scheme extraordinarily well, should have it extended to 100 per cent—and I think 
 there is a fallback position of 75 per cent—is quite preposterous.
There is probably an argument to say that farmers in particular, because their farm is often their residence as well, should be given some equivalence with the rest of the community—they should be provided with some discount on their asset—but to say that it should be entirely disregarded no matter what the value is quite extraordinary. I do not know what the costing of this is. I am sure that if I sat down the minister and her advisers could tell us. When I weigh these up against the other groups who are very badly off, to see the Democrats putting forward this proposition as some sort of priority is quite extraordinary.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

The minister in explaining her opposition to this amendment said that we do not want to give millionaires an opportunity to get Austudy.

 farming families is actually quite inappropriate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-11,"—I am just wondering whether what the minister was suggesting is that, if there is a one in 5,400 chance that potentially a paper millionaire had got Austudy for their children—and, of course, we would like to think that there are means by which that can be avoided—this is a basis upon which legislative action is taken which might in fact remove Austudy from 5,000 deserving families and young people within that category. I imagine that if you utilised that logic in business legislation—that there might be a one in 5,400 chance in business legislation that somebody might receive an unfair advantage—you would be drummed out of office so quickly your feet would hardly touch the ground. Is the minister suggesting that this enormous amount of common youth allowance which potentially could go to a millionaire farmer—one in 5,400—would be the reason that the government might risk leaving 5,000 or so young people worse off than what they might have been?

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-03-11,"—I move:
(4)	 That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
		 Schedule 2, item 8, page 149 (line 17), omit ""50%"", substitute ""75%"".
This is a backup to the former amendments, which were defeated, and I am very said about that. Let me now move to what really is the coalition's policy, announced at the last election. I will read that so that nobody is at all confused about what that policy was. In the lead-up to the 1996 election, the coalition released its higher education policy, and in this they said:
There are a number of inequities in the current eligibility requirements for Austudy. The coalition will relax the assets test for Austudy so that farmers and other self-employed people are not disadvantaged when the value of business related assets such as the family farm significantly outstrip actually income. As a first step, a coalition government will increase the discount in the assets test for Austudy from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for farm 
 and business assets in businesses in which the parent is substantially engaged.
We are actually giving the coalition an opportunity to fulfil their own policy as announced at the election. Although that is a fall-back position from what the coalition itself said in the report which I was debating before, nevertheless it seems to me that this would be an opportunity for them to fulfil that promise which they made. The amendment will increase the current 50 per cent discount available to farmers and other self-employed people to 75 per cent—no more and no less than the coalition promised.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-03-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I want to make a comment on this report from the Australian Industry Development Corporation. It is a sad report for the following reason: it sets out that the AIDC Ltd has been sold to Babcock and Brown Pty Ltd and the Union Bank of Switzerland.
The purpose of this corporation was, first of all, to facilitate the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industry and, secondly, to increase the participation of Australian residents in those industries. The fact that that is now no longer the task of the AIDC is tragic because I do think that the ownership of Australian industry by Australian citizens is a thing to aim for.
It is said that, in this era of globalisation, it does not really matter where the money comes from or where the control of a particular company is because globalisation has made us all, as it were, of the one place. But that is not accurate because, if an enterprise is located in a country, it is pretty much able to do what it will unless the ownership and control of that company are in the particular nation concerned.
That is illustrated by what is happening in America. We now have the picture of Microsoft being before the American authorities to break it up because it is nearing a monopolistic state. That could not happen to Microsoft in Australia the way it can happen in America, because Microsoft is located in America, its culture comes from America, and its whole ethos is within America. Therefore, the political power that the American government can bring is much greater than the political power that the Australian government could bring if something had to be done about Microsoft in Australia. There has to be a measuring of the economic power of a company by the political power of government. The contrast between the power that the parliaments in Australia have compared with the power that international companies have is getting more and more out of synchronisation. The power that the company has is growing, to the detriment of the political power that government has in Australia.
We have people in this parliament who have been associated with big Australian companies. Senator Parer is a person who comes to mind—a person of high reputation and a person who has had much to do with the mining industry. It is clear that the power that the Australian government has over that industry is greater than the power it has over, say, the vehicle making industry or any other industry where the ultimate control is held overseas.
It is a matter of regret to read the AIDC Australian Industry Development Corporation Annual Report 1997, which announces the taking away from Australia of a vehicle whereby investment could be made in Australian industry and shared amongst Australians, and that that control is going to seep away overseas more than it should. That takes away the political control which Australian parliaments should have over industry—a control which is essential.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-03-11,"—I rise in the adjournment debate this evening to respond to some matters which were raised by Senators Tierney, Ellison and Abetz today, firstly in question time and then in taking note, in relation to a question I asked during question time last Monday. Last Monday I asked questions relating to the government's new employment services contract arrangements. In a supplementary question, I referred to Allhands Hire Pty Ltd which, as I said then, was selected to provide employment services when it had financial problems with unprofitable contracts and was put up for sale only days after DEETYA informed the company of its success in the tender process.
In answer to Senator Tierney's question about this matter today, Senator Ellison said:
The allegation was that that company was going to be sold and that there was some financial difficulty thereby and also casting doubt on the government's Job Network process. Let me tell the Senate that that company is not for sale.
. . .              . . .             . . .
As a result of that, it has lost two clients.
. . .              . . .             . . .
A member of the family who contacted the department today has said that approaches were made to the company for the sale of it and that there was no aspect of it being sold.
Following that, I went back to the primary documents that have been conveyed to me which relate to the very question I asked last Monday. The first was a copy of a letter which has been sent to a business in Queensland. That business has forwarded that document but has removed its name from it. It is a letter from Lloyds Business Brokers dated 16 February 1998 and it is signed by Mr Rudy Weber. The letter has a reference `Re: business for sale' and says:
Thank you for your expression of interest, and for completing our `Confidentiality Agreement'. The business we have been appointed to sell is ALLHANDS HIRE. A copy of the Business Profile is enclosed for your perusal. 

I do not want to attempt in any way to mislead the Senate in this manner. I seek leave for this letter to be incorporated in Hansard .
—Is leave granted?
—No, not at the moment, Madam Acting Deputy President. I have just come on duty and I have not had a chance to look at it.
—We did deal with it and I thought that there was no problem with it. I am happy if it needs to be considered further.
—We will come back to it later.
—Enclosed with that was a copy of the first page of a letter from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs headed `commercial in confidence' and addressed to Mr Lance Allen Long, Allhands Hire Pty Ltd. I will not recite the address. I am also seeking leave to have this document incorporated in Hansard . The purpose of drawing this to the attention of the Senate is to say this: the business was for sale shortly before the minister publicly announced the successful tenders; it was certainly for sale at a time after this particular company became aware that it was a successful tenderer in the government's employment services contracting process.
We rang Mr Rudy Weber, who is the signatory to the letter from Lloyds Business Brokers, who advised that they had been contacted around Christmas time with a view to marketing this company on a selective marketing basis; that is, they would seek particular companies to buy it. I am concerned, firstly,  because Senator Ellison says:
A member of the family who contacted the department today has said that approaches were made to the company for the sale of it . . .
That is clearly not the case according to Mr Weber. He is saying that they received instructions from the company. And, secondly, he said:
.. that there was no aspect of it being sold. 

Clearly, every aspect of it was available for sale on 16 February, and probably later than that.
Further information as to when the business ceased to be for sale, if indeed that is the case, is in the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday, 10 March on page 9 in an article by Michelle Grattan entitled, `Job contracts attract more fire'. The article reports a Mr John Leach as saying that the business was no longer for sale. He also refers to the documents that I have referred to. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of the same date by Tony Wright there is a quote in the third column which I will read:
Mr John Leach, a partner of the company that had offered Allhands for sale last month, Lloyds Business Brokers, told the Herald  yesterday that Allhands had been withdrawn from sale, but would not comment on the suggestion that this had occurred during the past two days.
I will accept from Mr Leach that the company was withdrawn from sale. Whether it was withdrawn from sale on the day I asked the question in the Senate is not clear. It was clearly up for sale shortly before all material times and I think most likely up to the time we asked questions in the Senate.
In relation to the second document, it is clear that this document was forwarded to a prospective buyer of the company on 16 February 1998. That document reveals that Allhands Hire Pty Ltd was a successful tenderer in the process. It was going to get a contract of some substance. Notwithstanding what Mr leach might have said to the media, it is beyond belief that successfully obtaining a $1 million contract from the Commonwealth, someone who is very likely to meet their commitments and pay the bill if you perform the contract, does not add value to the company. That is absolutely beyond belief.
We are suggesting, and indeed I was suggesting in the question, that there is a coincidence between the awarding of the contract to this company and the sale of the company and that that is a matter for concern. I also talked about the financial situation of the company and it is clear from the material which was distributed that at the time the 
 tenders closed this company had problems with part of its operation and was not achieving its business plan. That is contained in other documentation that is in circulation. But in fairness to the company I do not think that that should be put on the public record at this stage. But I reserve my right to include that matter in further debate if this matter is to go further.
I in no way apologise, as was suggested by Minister Ellison, or withdraw any of the aspects of my question or remarks I have made on this matter. I suggest, indeed, that the minister ought to look carefully at this matter and come back into the Senate and make it clear that his comments about the company not being for sale might have related to the particular time he made his statement. But it is not clear that, immediately prior to question time on Monday, this company was not for sale.
—Is leave granted to incorporate the document in Hansard ?
—I do not want to give leave and I would like to explain why. We would refuse the first document, notwithstanding Senator O'Brien's comments, because it is not addressed to anyone. It is just a piece of paper. It is not really a document that means anything that we could allow. The second document is quite clearly from the Commonwealth and marked `commercial in confidence'. For that reason we certainly would not allow that to be incorporated. The matters you raised will be referred to the minister and he may have other views in due course and may countermand my refusal. But at this stage I could not let either of those be tabled.
