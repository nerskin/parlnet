Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (09:32): I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 amends the Customs Act 1901 to implement Australia's obligations under chapter 3 of the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus (PACER Plus).


Australia and the Pacific island countries are longstanding partners, with common interests in economic progress and regional stability. Our partners in the region range from countries richly endowed with people and resources to small atolls with geographically isolated populations.


PACER Plus reflects this diversity, as a comprehensive free trade agreement tailored to help Pacific island countries address their specific development challenges and better participate in global trade.


The Turnbull coalition government has the most ambitious trade agenda in Australia's history. PACER Plus, a unique trade agreement to drive economic prosperity and raise living standards in our region, will complement our trade agreements already in force which are delivering record export growth and creating more local jobs.


Creating more opportunities for Australian businesses in global markets is at the core of this government's economic plan.


PACER Plus has been signed so far by Australia, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. In addition to covering trade in goods and services, investment and movement of natural persons, PACER Plus also has a regional development focus.


As set out in Australia's 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, the stability and economic progress of the Pacific island countries are of fundamental importance to Australia. Pacific island countries face a range of economic challenges which impact upon their development. These challenges include small markets, narrow production bases and high costs of business and trade. PACER Plus will better enable Pacific island countries to meet these challenges.


Implementing PACER Plus will create new trade rules that will mark a significant improvement on the trade rules that have been in place since the 1980s.


This will improve the ability of exporters from the Pacific island countries that are party to the agreement to access both the Australian and New Zealand markets, which will in turn encourage development of export industries and job creation.


Implementing PACER Plus will also create opportunities for Australian businesses in a range of sectors. Over time the benefits of greater openness and transparency are expected to strengthen these opportunities.


The amendments to the Customs Act 1901 contained in this bill will implement the provisions of chapter 3 of PACER Plus. Chapter 3 sets out rules-of-origin criteria and related documentary requirements for claiming preferential tariff entry for goods imported from Pacific island countries that accede to PACER Plus.


Under PACER Plus, preferential tariff treatment is available based on declarations regarding the origin of goods based on information provided by the importer, the exporter, the producer or their authorised representative. This will reduce the amount of red tape for importers of goods originating in Pacific island countries. 


The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, under the chairmanship of the member for Fadden, has finalised its report on the PACER Plus, recommending binding treaty action. 


In recognition of our ongoing commitment to the development of Pacific island countries and the benefits to Australian businesses, we are introducing the implementing legislation at this time.


Debate adjourned.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (09:46):  On behalf of the Assistant Minister for Finance, I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: A9022 LAND 200 Tranche 2 Battlefield Communications Systems Facilities project.


The Department of Defence is proposing to construct and refurbish facilities to support the training requirements for the battle management systems being introduced under the Land 200 Tranche 2 capability which will modernise the command and control of the joint land force. The 2016 Defence white paper identifies the importance of providing defence with enhanced situational awareness and decision-making superiority. This project will ensure that the land force can achieve these functions by providing the soldier, the heart of land force capability, with a leading-edge digital communications capability. This project will enable the land force to achieve an unparalleled level of networking across the battle space.


The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants, contractors and construction workers and provide opportunities for small and medium enterprises through construction trade packages. The estimated cost of the project is $24.3 million, excluding GST. This includes management and design fees, construction costs, information and communications technology, furniture, fittings, equipment, contingencies and a provision for escalation. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2019 and be completed by late 2019. I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Myall Vale New Cotton Breeding Research facilities project.


The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is proposing to build a new cotton processing facility, a laboratory research facility and a plant and equipment workshop at its existing site Myall Vale site in New South Wales. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's work in the cotton industry is world leading, with the organisation responsible for delivering new cotton varieties and researching crop management strategies for delivery to the Australian industry.


The cotton industry is the largest natural fibre industry in Australia, with strong demand from overseas markets. The works proposed will resolve work health and safety issues, increase productivity and allow the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to undertake research to assist the Australian agricultural industry to be sustainable, productive and profitable.


The total estimated cost for the infrastructure project is $18 million, excluding GST. This includes management and design fees; construction costs; furniture, fittings, and equipment; information and communications technology; demolishing existing buildings; associated road infrastructure; contingencies; risk and escalation provisions.


The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants, contractors and construction workers. It will also provide economic opportunities for the local area through construction contracts. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is planned to commence in mid-2019 and to be completed by early 2021. I commend the motion to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (09:52):  I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the frequency of poor drafting of legislation and associated instruments in matters relating to immigration by successive Coalition Governments, and the resulting unintended consequences"".


I rise to speak on the Migration (Validation of Port Appointment) Bill 2018. We're debating this bill in this place today because successive coalition governments have a very poor track record when it comes to drafting immigration matters. Poorly drafted immigration legislation or regulations can create unintended consequences for the safety and security of Australia and Australians alike, with the potential to undermine the integrity of Australia's migration framework. The current Minister for Immigration and Border Protection—although I'm pretty sure he'd prefer just to be called the Minister for Home Affairs—regularly brings into this place broad, poorly drafted and even erroneous legislation that is littered with unintended consequences. This has become a consistent theme of the out-of-touch Turnbull government. I urge them, especially the Minister for Home Affairs, as well as his junior ministers, to take extra-special care in their work. In cleaning up the Turnbull government's mess and the mess of successive coalition governments, Labor will support this bill. 


The Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is located off the north-west coast of Western Australia between Australia and Indonesia. The islands are located in the Indian Ocean. There are a few small islands and some reefs, and they're uninhabited. Under the Migration Act 1958, the minister may, by notice published in the Gazette, appoint ports as proclaimed ports for the purposes of the Migration Act and fix the limits of those ports. Under the powers, the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is considered an excised offshore place for the purpose of the Migration Act after 21 September 2001. Any person who enters Australia by sea at this territory without a valid visa is considered an unauthorised maritime arrival under the act. 


The bill before the House fixes up errors, quite simply typos, made by an immigration minister of a former coalition government in the relevant Gazette. On 23 January 2002, then immigration minister Ruddock published a gazette that erroneously omitted the number '12' before the word 'degree', the letter 's' from the word 'degrees' in the latitude coordinates and the word 'longitude' before 122 degrees 59.0 minutes. The bill will correct these poor-drafting errors by this minister of the former Howard government. The specific quadrant of the earth's surface in which the coordinates occur will be inserted with these amendments by including the words 'south' and 'east' in the description. 


In correcting these errors, the amendments will retrospectively validate the 2002 Gazette notice which authorises the waters surrounding the Ashmore territory and Cartier Islands as a port for the purposes of the Migration Act. These errors could have been avoided in the very first instance, if it wasn't for the poor drafting by the former coalition government. 


In this place we've seen poorly drafted legislation on numerous occasions, including in instruments, by successive coalition governments, including by the current Minister for Home Affairs. The minister is a tick-and-flick minister incapable of managing his department, which is inherently complex and has many challenges and responsibilities. Despite this inability to perform the job ahead of him and expected of him, the minister never seems to miss a trick to misrepresent our position on asylum seeker policy. 


I want to take this opportunity, when we're dealing with legislation that deals with this very topic, to reiterate Labor's policy on asylum seekers. We will never let people smugglers back into business. Every time the Liberals misrepresent our strong position on border protection, they're playing into the hands of people smugglers and criminal syndicates who prey on vulnerable people. We on this side of the chamber believe in strong borders, offshore processing, regional resettlement, and turn-backs when it's safe to do so because it saves lives at sea. 


Every time the current minister undermines Labor's strong position on border protection, it is a walking, talking billboard for people smugglers, and he should be ashamed of himself. When speaking about the threat of people smugglers, the minister has said:


What I would say is that anybody, when they're talking about these matters, needs to be careful and circumspect about what it is that they're saying because it will be interpreted a particular way by people smugglers … People need to be mindful of what they are saying publicly.


The inconsistency of the Minister for Home Affairs is obvious and rank. I suggest to the minister he should be actually doing his job and negotiating other third-country resettlement options for eligible refugees on Manus Island and Nauru. Manus and Nauru were set up as temporary regional processing centres. They've become places of indefinite detention because of this out-of-touch government's failure to negotiate other third-country resettlement options. The minister's failure to negotiate third-country resettlement options has meant genuine refugees have languished in indefinite detention. As they've languished, they've suffered because of the Turnbull government's terrible incompetence in managing Australia's funded offshore regional processing centres. 


On 30 May 2018, the Queensland coroner handed down findings into the 2014 death of an asylum seeker from Manus Island. The coroner found the death was preventable and the result of compounding effects of multiple errors in their health care, including ineffective processes relating to medical transfers. These are serious findings that cannot go unanswered or ignored by the Turnbull government, and Labor will always hold this out-of-touch government to account for failures such as this. 


Ensuring Australia maintains strong borders does not absolve the government of its obligation to provide appropriate health, security and welfare services to people living in Australian funded offshore regional processing centres. If the Minister for Home Affairs is incapable of doing his job, then the Prime Minister should find someone else who's capable or should step in himself. 


Labor has repeatedly called on the Turnbull government to accept New Zealand's offer to resettle eligible refugees from Manus and Nauru. The government should negotiate conditions similar to the US refugee resettlement agreement to prevent people smuggling and the exploitation of vulnerable people. If the government were able to negotiate conditions for the US deal, they should be able to negotiate similar conditions with the government of New Zealand so that genuine refugees are resettled in third countries as soon as possible. 


Labor believes in strong borders which prevent deaths at sea while committing to a more humane and compassionate approach. The poor drafting of immigration legislation and associated instruments should not happen in this place in the first place. However, poor drafting such as this has become a hallmark of successive coalition governments. The unintended consequences that come as a result of poor drafting have the potential to undermine the integrity of Australia's migration framework. Given this, Labor will support this legislation as the government attempts to clean up this mess of its own creation.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-08-16,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:00):  I hope that the press gallery and the public are paying attention to this, because the day after the parliament unites to say, 'We do not want discriminatory migration practices enforced in this country', the day after we have people reaching across the chamber and saying that the parliament stands united against people who want to do things that most people in Australia would find abhorrent—the day after that happens—Labor joins with the Liberals to stop up to 1,600 people having the right to even apply for asylum in this country, people who have committed no sin other than to come and seek from us protection and a better life. Many of these up to 1,600 people have been kept in detention—and, we now find out, without any legal basis.


And what do we do? Labor comes in here and joins with the Liberals and says, 'We will now pass a law to retrospectively justify the unlawful detention of people.' They dress it up as saying, 'We're going to hold the government to account, because we don't like typos'. Well, this wasn't a typo. We are in this situation because the previous government, a Liberal government, took the step of trying to circumvent the rule of law. The previous government said, 'We are going to circumvent the rule of law by pretending that parts of Australia and the waters surrounding them and islands surrounding them aren't Australia.' They said, 'We will find a place around the Ashmore Reef, 600 kilometres away from Broome, and we'll draw a circle around it and we will say that it's no longer part of the migration zone, so if you happen to come there or through there, then don't seek Australia's protection.'


The fiction that they used to justify it at the time was to say: 'We'll call it a port. We know we're doing something dodgy and taking away a basic human right from people'—namely, the right to seek protection—'How will we justify it? We'll call it a port.' Of course, it's not a port. It's a reef. It's a set of small islands. A court held the government to account and said: 'That fiction that you used to circumvent the rule of law and take away basic rights of people and then subsequently detain many of them cannot be upheld. It is an unlawful fiction.' They said that as a result there are people—we estimate up to 1,600—who now have the right to come to Australia and seek asylum. They won't automatically be granted it, but they've now got the basic right to come and seek asylum. As I said, many of these people have been unlawfully detained because the government never had a legal basis to do it. I think we probably owe these people compensation, because it turns out that we have denied them their basic human rights without any legal basis to do so. But even if you don't agree that we owe them compensation, at the very least we now owe them the right to process their claims for asylum, because the court has said, 'You were wrong, Parliament'—Minister Ruddock and Prime Minister Howard—try to circumvent the rule of law.'


So, we've now got an opportunity to stand with people who have been treated not only harshly but in violation of their fundamental human rights and give them the opportunity to make an application for asylum in Australia and have that assessed according to law. Here's an opportunity for Labor, who came in yesterday and moved a good motion in this parliament, to say, 'We do not support discriminatory migration practices in this country. We support human rights.' Here's an opportunity, the day after that, to do something about it. But what do they do? They say, 'We will retrospectively authorise a decision of a former Howard government minister to circumvent the rule of law, even if it means retrospectively detaining people and taking away their basic human rights.'


The best that Labor can muster, as they walk into this chamber, is to move a second reading amendment to say, 'We're going to support the legislation but, jeez, the government are poor drafters.' What is Labor saying? Are Labor saying that, if they were in government, they would manage this system of cruelty more efficiently and get the drafting right? Is Labor's only criticism of the government that they make typos? Labor should join with the Greens and with the Independents who are standing up for human rights and saying, 'When it comes to basic principles of the rule of law, if the government can't get it right, then the benefit should flow to the individual.' If you are taking someone's liberty away and if you are taking their legal rights away, then you've got to get everything right.


You shouldn't be doing it in the first place, but at a minimum the courts have upheld a fundamental principle of Western democracy. The courts, in this decision that the government and Labor are trying to overturn, have said very, very simply: 'If someone has got a right to do something, especially if it affects their fundamental human rights, and the government wants to try and take that right away, including by locking them up and including by taking away their human rights, you'd better get it right.' No, Labor cannot even bring itself to defend one of the basic principles of Western democracy and one of the basic principles of the rule of law.


Labor is showing itself, at the first available opportunity, to be a craven supporter of the policies of torture that have now become a joint Labor-Liberal stain on this nation. We are wrecking people's lives with this horrendous offshore detention system that has now become a bipartisan policy. We are wrecking people's lives. We now have, as we speak, people on Manus and Nauru who are giving up and who are attempting to kill themselves. We have young children who are now switching off. Doctors and support staff are crying out, saying, 'We have not seen this before. We have not seen young children effectively give up on the basics of life.'


We know this because we have had inquiry after inquiry—even though the government, with Labor's support, tries to keep the media out of what is happening in these hellholes where persecution is happening in our name. We know that what we are doing is breaking people. We say, 'Oh, well, it's somehow justified.' Labor has just stood up this morning and said, 'We accept the government's argument and we accept Minister Dutton's argument that somehow we need to break people and torture them in order to stop deaths at sea.' I, for one, think our country is better than that. I do not accept that the only way to stop deaths at sea is by torturing and killing people—by torturing children. I do not accept that false logic. Labor should not accept it either.


There is a better way. Going back 40 years, the government of Malcolm Fraser knew that there was a better way. If we update what was done then and apply it now, we will find that we can remove the incentives for people to get on boats by increasing the number of people we bring to Australia, by having proper processing of their claims and by supporting, in places like Indonesia and Malaysia, the UN and others to process their claims there. Once the message gets through in many of these camps that Australia is taking people again and once we start seeing not a trickle, not dozens, of claims, as we are at the moment, but claims in the thousands being processed in Indonesia and Malaysia and elsewhere, people will understand that there's no point in getting on a boat and risking their life to come to Australia, because they will start to understand again that there is some order being put back in and that, ultimately, if they wait, their claim is going to be assessed and they may well come here. But that doesn't exist at the moment. 


So you've got people languishing in the countries surrounding us and in other countries where they are fleeing war and fleeing persecution. They don't see any way to come into Australia, because we have closed our doors. So when someone comes along to them and says, 'If you give me a bit of money, I'll pop you on a boat and you can come here,' they do, because they see no other way. We're not taking people. We're not processing them. I tell you what, if I were in that situation, if I were stuck in Indonesia where I could only get an appointment with the UN every six months and they told me, 'Nothing has changed,' even though I had been found to be a refugee, I would probably jump on a boat as well if I thought that was the only door that was open to me, if I thought it was the only way of keeping my family safe. If you really are concerned about deaths at sea then invest in processing and start taking more people here. 


The fiction that Labor and Liberal perpetuate is that they've somehow stopped the deaths at sea by turning back boats. Labor have got up this morning and said, 'We love boat turnbacks as well.' When you turn back boats, people can still die; they just die elsewhere. It doesn't happen on our watch and it happens out of the media glare, or it means they have decided not to make the trip to Australia and to go to another country, and they die on that journey. We are seeing people dying on boats as they try to get to Europe from Africa. That's because, out of desperation, they have no other choice. It's happening in our region as well. Just because it is happening out of sight does not mean it is not happening. So, this fiction that somehow the government has stopped the deaths at sea is one that has to be punctured, because deaths are still happening. We just don't see them. And the government has stopped counting them, as if those people don't matter. 


I have come to expect the Liberals to adopt this approach where they are prepared to torture children for the sake of improving their position in the polls. Nothing surprises me about the Liberals anymore. But what is becoming crystal clear is that every time you think, 'There's a little moment where maybe Labor might change their mind'—no, no. When given a choice, a day after we have a debate about what kind of migration system we want in this country, it's back to business as usual. It's back to backing the death camps. It's back to saying it's okay to torture and maim people, even though there are other decent alternatives. 


I must say, I am very, very gutted not to see the member for Batman, who has a good heart, coming in here and speaking against this bill, because this is an opportunity to make life better for roughly 1,600 people who just want to come here and seek our help. It's a concrete opportunity to say to the government, 'You tried to get around the rule of law and you failed, so, bad luck, you have to process their claims.' To the member for Melbourne Ports and the member for Wills, we are going to remind everyone in your electorates that when you had the chance to stand up, concretely, for up to 1,600 asylum seekers, you said no. You failed at the first test. As I said, I do believe that the member for Batman has a good heart in this respect and I believe that she believes what she said, but what matters when you come to this place is your vote. It's no good to say one thing to people to win a seat and then to come up here and shut the door on 1,600 people who are seeking nothing more than the right to put in their claim to seek asylum. 


I suspect that this snap-back return to bipartisan cruelty the day after we saw handshakes across the chamber is going to be repeated in the Senate as well, where the prospect of having an inquiry into the condition of these children who are dying in death camps under our name probably won't even be supported by Labor either. I know that this is something that many people in this country feel very passionately about, and rightly so. And what is becoming crystal clear is that Labor and the Liberals will join together to take away people's human rights, justify torture and even retrospectively justify locking people up without authority if they think it will win them votes. Shame on them.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2018-08-16,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (10:15):  I thank all members for contributing to the debate on the Migration (Validation of Port Appointment) Bill 2018. The bill confirms the validity of the appointment of a proclaimed port in the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands contained in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. GN 3, 23 January 2002. The bill upholds the purpose of the impugned appointment, which was designed to ensure that the unauthorised boat arrivals who entered certain waters of the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, an 'excised offshore place' for the purposes of the Migration Act 1958, would thereby become 'offshore entry persons', now 'unauthorised maritime arrivals' under the act. The appointment was critical to determining the status of persons as unauthorised maritime arrivals under the act who entered Australia via this proclaimed port between 23 January 2002 and 1 June 2013. In addition, those who became unauthorised maritime arrivals by reason of having entered the proclaimed port at Ashmore and Cartier Islands between 13 August 2012 and 1 June 2013 and were not taken to a regional processing country also became fast-track applicants under the act.


Government policy around the management of unauthorised maritime arrivals has been highly effective in responding to the enduring threat of maritime people smuggling. It is unacceptable for individuals to seek to undermine this policy and circumvent Australia's migration laws by challenging minor and inadvertent admissions in the wording of the appointment. A successful challenge to the appointment could potentially nullify affected persons' status as unauthorised maritime arrivals and fast-track applicants who entered Australia via this proclaimed port between 23 June 2002 and 1 June 2013. If these risks are not addressed, the validity of the appointment will continue to be challenged and potentially undermine public confidence in our border protection arrangements. The bill addresses these risks by confirming the validity of the appointment to put beyond doubt that there was a properly proclaimed port at Ashmore and Cartier Islands at all relevant times and by confirming that things done under the act, such as actions taken or decisions made, which rely directly or indirectly on the terms of the appointment are also valid and effective.


The bill reiterates the government's original intention that the appointment is, and has always been, valid. The effect of the bill does not amend or affect the operation of Australia's migration laws but, instead, maintains the status quo for the processing of unauthorised maritime arrivals and, where relevant, fast-track applicants under the act who entered Australia via this proclaimed port between 23 June 2002 and 1 June 2013.


In summary, the bill protects the integrity of Australia's migration framework and deserves the support of all members. I commend the bill to the chamber.

""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the frequency of poor drafting of legislation and associated instruments in matters relating to immigration by successive Coalition Governments, and the resulting unintended consequences"".


I rise to speak on the Migration (Validation of Port Appointment) Bill 2018. We're debating this bill in this place today because successive coalition governments have a very poor track record when it comes to drafting immigration matters. Poorly drafted immigration legislation or regulations can create unintended consequences for the safety and security of Australia and Australians alike, with the potential to undermine the integrity of Australia's migration framework. The current Minister for Immigration and Border Protection—although I'm pretty sure he'd prefer just to be called the Minister for Home Affairs—regularly brings into this place broad, poorly drafted and even erroneous legislation that is littered with unintended consequences. This has become a consistent theme of the out-of-touch Turnbull government. I urge them, especially the Minister for Home Affairs, as well as his junior ministers, to take extra-special care in their work. In cleaning up the Turnbull government's mess and the mess of successive coalition governments, Labor will support this bill. 


The Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is located off the north-west coast of Western Australia between Australia and Indonesia. The islands are located in the Indian Ocean. There are a few small islands and some reefs, and they're uninhabited. Under the Migration Act 1958, the minister may, by notice published in the Gazette, appoint ports as proclaimed ports for the purposes of the Migration Act and fix the limits of those ports. Under the powers, the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is considered an excised offshore place for the purpose of the Migration Act after 21 September 2001. Any person who enters Australia by sea at this territory without a valid visa is considered an unauthorised maritime arrival under the act. 


The bill before the House fixes up errors, quite simply typos, made by an immigration minister of a former coalition government in the relevant Gazette. On 23 January 2002, then immigration minister Ruddock published a gazette that erroneously omitted the number '12' before the word 'degree', the letter 's' from the word 'degrees' in the latitude coordinates and the word 'longitude' before 122 degrees 59.0 minutes. The bill will correct these poor-drafting errors by this minister of the former Howard government. The specific quadrant of the earth's surface in which the coordinates occur will be inserted with these amendments by including the words 'south' and 'east' in the description. 


In correcting these errors, the amendments will retrospectively validate the 2002 Gazette notice which authorises the waters surrounding the Ashmore territory and Cartier Islands as a port for the purposes of the Migration Act. These errors could have been avoided in the very first instance, if it wasn't for the poor drafting by the former coalition government. 


In this place we've seen poorly drafted legislation on numerous occasions, including in instruments, by successive coalition governments, including by the current Minister for Home Affairs. The minister is a tick-and-flick minister incapable of managing his department, which is inherently complex and has many challenges and responsibilities. Despite this inability to perform the job ahead of him and expected of him, the minister never seems to miss a trick to misrepresent our position on asylum seeker policy. 


I want to take this opportunity, when we're dealing with legislation that deals with this very topic, to reiterate Labor's policy on asylum seekers. We will never let people smugglers back into business. Every time the Liberals misrepresent our strong position on border protection, they're playing into the hands of people smugglers and criminal syndicates who prey on vulnerable people. We on this side of the chamber believe in strong borders, offshore processing, regional resettlement, and turn-backs when it's safe to do so because it saves lives at sea. 


Every time the current minister undermines Labor's strong position on border protection, it is a walking, talking billboard for people smugglers, and he should be ashamed of himself. When speaking about the threat of people smugglers, the minister has said:


What I would say is that anybody, when they're talking about these matters, needs to be careful and circumspect about what it is that they're saying because it will be interpreted a particular way by people smugglers … People need to be mindful of what they are saying publicly.


The inconsistency of the Minister for Home Affairs is obvious and rank. I suggest to the minister he should be actually doing his job and negotiating other third-country resettlement options for eligible refugees on Manus Island and Nauru. Manus and Nauru were set up as temporary regional processing centres. They've become places of indefinite detention because of this out-of-touch government's failure to negotiate other third-country resettlement options. The minister's failure to negotiate third-country resettlement options has meant genuine refugees have languished in indefinite detention. As they've languished, they've suffered because of the Turnbull government's terrible incompetence in managing Australia's funded offshore regional processing centres. 


On 30 May 2018, the Queensland coroner handed down findings into the 2014 death of an asylum seeker from Manus Island. The coroner found the death was preventable and the result of compounding effects of multiple errors in their health care, including ineffective processes relating to medical transfers. These are serious findings that cannot go unanswered or ignored by the Turnbull government, and Labor will always hold this out-of-touch government to account for failures such as this. 


Ensuring Australia maintains strong borders does not absolve the government of its obligation to provide appropriate health, security and welfare services to people living in Australian funded offshore regional processing centres. If the Minister for Home Affairs is incapable of doing his job, then the Prime Minister should find someone else who's capable or should step in himself. 


Labor has repeatedly called on the Turnbull government to accept New Zealand's offer to resettle eligible refugees from Manus and Nauru. The government should negotiate conditions similar to the US refugee resettlement agreement to prevent people smuggling and the exploitation of vulnerable people. If the government were able to negotiate conditions for the US deal, they should be able to negotiate similar conditions with the government of New Zealand so that genuine refugees are resettled in third countries as soon as possible. 


Labor believes in strong borders which prevent deaths at sea while committing to a more humane and compassionate approach. The poor drafting of immigration legislation and associated instruments should not happen in this place in the first place. However, poor drafting such as this has become a hallmark of successive coalition governments. The unintended consequences that come as a result of poor drafting have the potential to undermine the integrity of Australia's migration framework. Given this, Labor will support this legislation as the government attempts to clean up this mess of its own creation.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-08-16,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:00):  I hope that the press gallery and the public are paying attention to this, because the day after the parliament unites to say, 'We do not want discriminatory migration practices enforced in this country', the day after we have people reaching across the chamber and saying that the parliament stands united against people who want to do things that most people in Australia would find abhorrent—the day after that happens—Labor joins with the Liberals to stop up to 1,600 people having the right to even apply for asylum in this country, people who have committed no sin other than to come and seek from us protection and a better life. Many of these up to 1,600 people have been kept in detention—and, we now find out, without any legal basis.


And what do we do? Labor comes in here and joins with the Liberals and says, 'We will now pass a law to retrospectively justify the unlawful detention of people.' They dress it up as saying, 'We're going to hold the government to account, because we don't like typos'. Well, this wasn't a typo. We are in this situation because the previous government, a Liberal government, took the step of trying to circumvent the rule of law. The previous government said, 'We are going to circumvent the rule of law by pretending that parts of Australia and the waters surrounding them and islands surrounding them aren't Australia.' They said, 'We will find a place around the Ashmore Reef, 600 kilometres away from Broome, and we'll draw a circle around it and we will say that it's no longer part of the migration zone, so if you happen to come there or through there, then don't seek Australia's protection.'


The fiction that they used to justify it at the time was to say: 'We'll call it a port. We know we're doing something dodgy and taking away a basic human right from people'—namely, the right to seek protection—'How will we justify it? We'll call it a port.' Of course, it's not a port. It's a reef. It's a set of small islands. A court held the government to account and said: 'That fiction that you used to circumvent the rule of law and take away basic rights of people and then subsequently detain many of them cannot be upheld. It is an unlawful fiction.' They said that as a result there are people—we estimate up to 1,600—who now have the right to come to Australia and seek asylum. They won't automatically be granted it, but they've now got the basic right to come and seek asylum. As I said, many of these people have been unlawfully detained because the government never had a legal basis to do it. I think we probably owe these people compensation, because it turns out that we have denied them their basic human rights without any legal basis to do so. But even if you don't agree that we owe them compensation, at the very least we now owe them the right to process their claims for asylum, because the court has said, 'You were wrong, Parliament'—Minister Ruddock and Prime Minister Howard—try to circumvent the rule of law.'


So, we've now got an opportunity to stand with people who have been treated not only harshly but in violation of their fundamental human rights and give them the opportunity to make an application for asylum in Australia and have that assessed according to law. Here's an opportunity for Labor, who came in yesterday and moved a good motion in this parliament, to say, 'We do not support discriminatory migration practices in this country. We support human rights.' Here's an opportunity, the day after that, to do something about it. But what do they do? They say, 'We will retrospectively authorise a decision of a former Howard government minister to circumvent the rule of law, even if it means retrospectively detaining people and taking away their basic human rights.'


The best that Labor can muster, as they walk into this chamber, is to move a second reading amendment to say, 'We're going to support the legislation but, jeez, the government are poor drafters.' What is Labor saying? Are Labor saying that, if they were in government, they would manage this system of cruelty more efficiently and get the drafting right? Is Labor's only criticism of the government that they make typos? Labor should join with the Greens and with the Independents who are standing up for human rights and saying, 'When it comes to basic principles of the rule of law, if the government can't get it right, then the benefit should flow to the individual.' If you are taking someone's liberty away and if you are taking their legal rights away, then you've got to get everything right.


You shouldn't be doing it in the first place, but at a minimum the courts have upheld a fundamental principle of Western democracy. The courts, in this decision that the government and Labor are trying to overturn, have said very, very simply: 'If someone has got a right to do something, especially if it affects their fundamental human rights, and the government wants to try and take that right away, including by locking them up and including by taking away their human rights, you'd better get it right.' No, Labor cannot even bring itself to defend one of the basic principles of Western democracy and one of the basic principles of the rule of law.


Labor is showing itself, at the first available opportunity, to be a craven supporter of the policies of torture that have now become a joint Labor-Liberal stain on this nation. We are wrecking people's lives with this horrendous offshore detention system that has now become a bipartisan policy. We are wrecking people's lives. We now have, as we speak, people on Manus and Nauru who are giving up and who are attempting to kill themselves. We have young children who are now switching off. Doctors and support staff are crying out, saying, 'We have not seen this before. We have not seen young children effectively give up on the basics of life.'


We know this because we have had inquiry after inquiry—even though the government, with Labor's support, tries to keep the media out of what is happening in these hellholes where persecution is happening in our name. We know that what we are doing is breaking people. We say, 'Oh, well, it's somehow justified.' Labor has just stood up this morning and said, 'We accept the government's argument and we accept Minister Dutton's argument that somehow we need to break people and torture them in order to stop deaths at sea.' I, for one, think our country is better than that. I do not accept that the only way to stop deaths at sea is by torturing and killing people—by torturing children. I do not accept that false logic. Labor should not accept it either.


There is a better way. Going back 40 years, the government of Malcolm Fraser knew that there was a better way. If we update what was done then and apply it now, we will find that we can remove the incentives for people to get on boats by increasing the number of people we bring to Australia, by having proper processing of their claims and by supporting, in places like Indonesia and Malaysia, the UN and others to process their claims there. Once the message gets through in many of these camps that Australia is taking people again and once we start seeing not a trickle, not dozens, of claims, as we are at the moment, but claims in the thousands being processed in Indonesia and Malaysia and elsewhere, people will understand that there's no point in getting on a boat and risking their life to come to Australia, because they will start to understand again that there is some order being put back in and that, ultimately, if they wait, their claim is going to be assessed and they may well come here. But that doesn't exist at the moment. 


So you've got people languishing in the countries surrounding us and in other countries where they are fleeing war and fleeing persecution. They don't see any way to come into Australia, because we have closed our doors. So when someone comes along to them and says, 'If you give me a bit of money, I'll pop you on a boat and you can come here,' they do, because they see no other way. We're not taking people. We're not processing them. I tell you what, if I were in that situation, if I were stuck in Indonesia where I could only get an appointment with the UN every six months and they told me, 'Nothing has changed,' even though I had been found to be a refugee, I would probably jump on a boat as well if I thought that was the only door that was open to me, if I thought it was the only way of keeping my family safe. If you really are concerned about deaths at sea then invest in processing and start taking more people here. 


The fiction that Labor and Liberal perpetuate is that they've somehow stopped the deaths at sea by turning back boats. Labor have got up this morning and said, 'We love boat turnbacks as well.' When you turn back boats, people can still die; they just die elsewhere. It doesn't happen on our watch and it happens out of the media glare, or it means they have decided not to make the trip to Australia and to go to another country, and they die on that journey. We are seeing people dying on boats as they try to get to Europe from Africa. That's because, out of desperation, they have no other choice. It's happening in our region as well. Just because it is happening out of sight does not mean it is not happening. So, this fiction that somehow the government has stopped the deaths at sea is one that has to be punctured, because deaths are still happening. We just don't see them. And the government has stopped counting them, as if those people don't matter. 


I have come to expect the Liberals to adopt this approach where they are prepared to torture children for the sake of improving their position in the polls. Nothing surprises me about the Liberals anymore. But what is becoming crystal clear is that every time you think, 'There's a little moment where maybe Labor might change their mind'—no, no. When given a choice, a day after we have a debate about what kind of migration system we want in this country, it's back to business as usual. It's back to backing the death camps. It's back to saying it's okay to torture and maim people, even though there are other decent alternatives. 


I must say, I am very, very gutted not to see the member for Batman, who has a good heart, coming in here and speaking against this bill, because this is an opportunity to make life better for roughly 1,600 people who just want to come here and seek our help. It's a concrete opportunity to say to the government, 'You tried to get around the rule of law and you failed, so, bad luck, you have to process their claims.' To the member for Melbourne Ports and the member for Wills, we are going to remind everyone in your electorates that when you had the chance to stand up, concretely, for up to 1,600 asylum seekers, you said no. You failed at the first test. As I said, I do believe that the member for Batman has a good heart in this respect and I believe that she believes what she said, but what matters when you come to this place is your vote. It's no good to say one thing to people to win a seat and then to come up here and shut the door on 1,600 people who are seeking nothing more than the right to put in their claim to seek asylum. 


I suspect that this snap-back return to bipartisan cruelty the day after we saw handshakes across the chamber is going to be repeated in the Senate as well, where the prospect of having an inquiry into the condition of these children who are dying in death camps under our name probably won't even be supported by Labor either. I know that this is something that many people in this country feel very passionately about, and rightly so. And what is becoming crystal clear is that Labor and the Liberals will join together to take away people's human rights, justify torture and even retrospectively justify locking people up without authority if they think it will win them votes. Shame on them.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2018-08-16,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (10:15):  I thank all members for contributing to the debate on the Migration (Validation of Port Appointment) Bill 2018. The bill confirms the validity of the appointment of a proclaimed port in the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands contained in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. GN 3, 23 January 2002. The bill upholds the purpose of the impugned appointment, which was designed to ensure that the unauthorised boat arrivals who entered certain waters of the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, an 'excised offshore place' for the purposes of the Migration Act 1958, would thereby become 'offshore entry persons', now 'unauthorised maritime arrivals' under the act. The appointment was critical to determining the status of persons as unauthorised maritime arrivals under the act who entered Australia via this proclaimed port between 23 January 2002 and 1 June 2013. In addition, those who became unauthorised maritime arrivals by reason of having entered the proclaimed port at Ashmore and Cartier Islands between 13 August 2012 and 1 June 2013 and were not taken to a regional processing country also became fast-track applicants under the act.


Government policy around the management of unauthorised maritime arrivals has been highly effective in responding to the enduring threat of maritime people smuggling. It is unacceptable for individuals to seek to undermine this policy and circumvent Australia's migration laws by challenging minor and inadvertent admissions in the wording of the appointment. A successful challenge to the appointment could potentially nullify affected persons' status as unauthorised maritime arrivals and fast-track applicants who entered Australia via this proclaimed port between 23 June 2002 and 1 June 2013. If these risks are not addressed, the validity of the appointment will continue to be challenged and potentially undermine public confidence in our border protection arrangements. The bill addresses these risks by confirming the validity of the appointment to put beyond doubt that there was a properly proclaimed port at Ashmore and Cartier Islands at all relevant times and by confirming that things done under the act, such as actions taken or decisions made, which rely directly or indirectly on the terms of the appointment are also valid and effective.


The bill reiterates the government's original intention that the appointment is, and has always been, valid. The effect of the bill does not amend or affect the operation of Australia's migration laws but, instead, maintains the status quo for the processing of unauthorised maritime arrivals and, where relevant, fast-track applicants under the act who entered Australia via this proclaimed port between 23 June 2002 and 1 June 2013.


In summary, the bill protects the integrity of Australia's migration framework and deserves the support of all members. I commend the bill to the chamber.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (13:09):  I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2018. The bill before the House contains a number of small amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, and from the outset I will say that Labor will support this bill. These amendments are consistent with the Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2018 tabled in parliament on 7 February 2018 and the Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2018 tabled in parliament on 31 May 2018. The bill also makes a technical amendment to schedule 12 of the Customs Tariff Act. These changes will support business, including Australia's agricultural industry, ensure ongoing relations with Indonesia and clarify the framework relating to tariffs. 


Whilst Labor welcomes these amendments, I note that it has taken this out-of-touch Turnbull government a long time to implement these changes—much longer than was expected by industry. Some of these commitments were first announced by the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic of Indonesia on 26 February 2017. Then, on 20 September 2017, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, and his Indonesian counterpart, had what Fairfax described as a 'groundhog day' moment, announcing these commitments again, the same commitments announced some seven months earlier by the Prime Minister. Matthew Busch, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute, described the announcement in The Interpreter:


Somewhat incredibly, these were essentially the same items the leaders announced in February. That it took seven months to draw up the rules makes one wonder if they were hastily thrown together at the end of a visit otherwise devoid of concrete economic progress.


The Turnbull government stated they were going to have a free trade agreement with Indonesia, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership, finalised by the end of 2017, but I note they failed to achieve that, continually shifting the goalposts as negotiations with Indonesia continued. We would expect that any free trade agreement would be in the best interests of Australian businesses, consumers and local workers and urge the government to do it with utmost diligence and competency. 


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill implements an earlier outcome of the Indonesia-Australia closer economic partnership agreement. The bill repeals certain items in schedule 8, bringing forward the removal of customs duties for several herbicides and pesticides. These measures are outlined in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2018. By repealing those items, duties on certain imports are removed, including rodenticides, fungicides, antisprouting products and plant growth regulators, disinfectants containing a certain range of active substances, and all insecticides and herbicides imported from Indonesia. Previously the duty for these items was set at five per cent, reducing to 'free' from January 2020. By bringing the removal of these items forward, Indonesian pesticides and herbicides used by Australian farmers will be more competitive in the Australian market, offering greater choice to consumers. 


I note the application of these duties is retrospective to 20 September 2017—and I might call that the date of groundhog day announced by the minister for trade. I urge the government to monitor any impacts of the removal of the duty on these items, including ensuring illegal and counterfeit pesticides do not enter Australia. In return for these measures, Indonesia will reduce customs duties on Australian sugar exports from Australia into their country, which I will detail the benefits of shortly. 


The bill creates a new schedule to provide a 'free' rate of customs duty for placebos imported for certain clinical trials and clinical trial kits containing either or both medicaments and placebos. Currently, these are classified to separate parts of the Customs Tariff Act and must be separately identified and quantified under reporting requirements. These changes simplify import reporting requirements for these items imported for use in clinical trials, with the aim of promoting Australia as a destination for international clinical trials. 


As mentioned, this bill makes a technical amendment to schedule 12 of the Customs Tariff Act. Section 12 of the Customs Tariff Act relates to originating goods for which there is or was a customs duty other than 'free' at the time that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement entered into force. Table item 135 is now redundant. The amendments before the House remove the table of preferential customs duty rates. The removal of table item 135 aligns schedule 12 and schedule 3. I note that the financial impacts of the bill before the House are very minimal—a total of $3 million over the forward estimates—with zero financial impact from 2020-21 and financial years onwards.


Following Australia's commitments that I detailed earlier, the Indonesian government has agreed to reduce the customs duty on Australian sugar exports in return. I'm pleased that the Indonesian agreement has been welcomed by Australian sugarcane growers. In 2015 the Indonesian government reduced the tariff on sugar exports from Thailand to Indonesia to a rate of five per cent. By comparison, the tariff rate for Australian sugar exports remained at eight per cent. Whilst these percentages may mean little to the average Australian or layperson, the three per cent rate means that Thai sugar was around $30 per tonne cheaper to import into Indonesia than Australian sugar. In early 2017 canegrowers said that the result of this was that Australian sugar exports to Indonesia fell from one million tonnes per annum to 200,000 tonnes per annum. This loss of sales into Indonesia between 2015 and 2017 alone meant a financial burden on Australian sugarcane growers, with exporters forced to look to other countries to export to.


Australia is the second-largest raw sugar exporter in the world, with countries in Asia, such as South Korea, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia, being some of our most important markets. Throughout regional and rural Queensland, my home state, and northern New South Wales there are 4,000 farmers, who grow 35 million tonnes of sugarcane each year. As a proud Queenslander I can say that 95 per cent of Australian sugarcane is grown in Queensland, and it's vital for country towns such as Bundaberg, Mackay, Ayr and Gordonvale. Sugarcane production is worth $2.5 billion to the Australian economy, and hopefully these tariff changes—and Indonesia has also committed to allow further exports—will mean growth and revenue for an industry that's vital to the Australian economy and vital to my home state's economy. Whilst it may take some time for the economic benefits of Indonesia's tariff reduction to flow through, we on this side of the chamber welcome Indonesia's commitments, because they mean opportunities for Queensland and Australian sugarcane growers.


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2018 makes some very small albeit very important amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Labor will always hold the Turnbull government to account, even in matters such as tariff proposals. to ensure that our complex and important tariff framework is clear and functional. I would urge the Turnbull government to continue its work with its Indonesian counterparts to ensure the best possible trading environment for Australian business and consumers alike, particularly for sugarcane growers in my home state of Queensland. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (13:17):  The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2018 contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act that will assist Australian businesses and consumers. The first set of amendments in the bill implement an early outcome of the Indonesia-Australia Closer Economic Partnership Agreement by providing a free rate of duty for certain herbicides and pesticides imported from Indonesia. These amendments are consistent with Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2018. The second set of amendments in the bill create a concessional item for eligible blinded clinical trial kits and placebos used in clinical trials. This will make the importation of these goods into Australia cheaper through the removal of customs duty while also simplifying the import process and reducing red tape. These amendments are consistent with Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2018. The final amendment made by the bill realigns schedule 12 with the other schedules of the act by removing a redundant item. I therefore commend the bill to the House.

The Turnbull government stated they were going to have a free trade agreement with Indonesia, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership, finalised by the end of 2017, but I note they failed to achieve that, continually shifting the goalposts as negotiations with Indonesia continued. We would expect that any free trade agreement would be in the best interests of Australian businesses, consumers and local workers and urge the government to do it with utmost diligence and competency. 


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill implements an earlier outcome of the Indonesia-Australia closer economic partnership agreement. The bill repeals certain items in schedule 8, bringing forward the removal of customs duties for several herbicides and pesticides. These measures are outlined in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2018. By repealing those items, duties on certain imports are removed, including rodenticides, fungicides, antisprouting products and plant growth regulators, disinfectants containing a certain range of active substances, and all insecticides and herbicides imported from Indonesia. Previously the duty for these items was set at five per cent, reducing to 'free' from January 2020. By bringing the removal of these items forward, Indonesian pesticides and herbicides used by Australian farmers will be more competitive in the Australian market, offering greater choice to consumers. 


I note the application of these duties is retrospective to 20 September 2017—and I might call that the date of groundhog day announced by the minister for trade. I urge the government to monitor any impacts of the removal of the duty on these items, including ensuring illegal and counterfeit pesticides do not enter Australia. In return for these measures, Indonesia will reduce customs duties on Australian sugar exports from Australia into their country, which I will detail the benefits of shortly. 


The bill creates a new schedule to provide a 'free' rate of customs duty for placebos imported for certain clinical trials and clinical trial kits containing either or both medicaments and placebos. Currently, these are classified to separate parts of the Customs Tariff Act and must be separately identified and quantified under reporting requirements. These changes simplify import reporting requirements for these items imported for use in clinical trials, with the aim of promoting Australia as a destination for international clinical trials. 


As mentioned, this bill makes a technical amendment to schedule 12 of the Customs Tariff Act. Section 12 of the Customs Tariff Act relates to originating goods for which there is or was a customs duty other than 'free' at the time that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement entered into force. Table item 135 is now redundant. The amendments before the House remove the table of preferential customs duty rates. The removal of table item 135 aligns schedule 12 and schedule 3. I note that the financial impacts of the bill before the House are very minimal—a total of $3 million over the forward estimates—with zero financial impact from 2020-21 and financial years onwards.


Following Australia's commitments that I detailed earlier, the Indonesian government has agreed to reduce the customs duty on Australian sugar exports in return. I'm pleased that the Indonesian agreement has been welcomed by Australian sugarcane growers. In 2015 the Indonesian government reduced the tariff on sugar exports from Thailand to Indonesia to a rate of five per cent. By comparison, the tariff rate for Australian sugar exports remained at eight per cent. Whilst these percentages may mean little to the average Australian or layperson, the three per cent rate means that Thai sugar was around $30 per tonne cheaper to import into Indonesia than Australian sugar. In early 2017 canegrowers said that the result of this was that Australian sugar exports to Indonesia fell from one million tonnes per annum to 200,000 tonnes per annum. This loss of sales into Indonesia between 2015 and 2017 alone meant a financial burden on Australian sugarcane growers, with exporters forced to look to other countries to export to.


Australia is the second-largest raw sugar exporter in the world, with countries in Asia, such as South Korea, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia, being some of our most important markets. Throughout regional and rural Queensland, my home state, and northern New South Wales there are 4,000 farmers, who grow 35 million tonnes of sugarcane each year. As a proud Queenslander I can say that 95 per cent of Australian sugarcane is grown in Queensland, and it's vital for country towns such as Bundaberg, Mackay, Ayr and Gordonvale. Sugarcane production is worth $2.5 billion to the Australian economy, and hopefully these tariff changes—and Indonesia has also committed to allow further exports—will mean growth and revenue for an industry that's vital to the Australian economy and vital to my home state's economy. Whilst it may take some time for the economic benefits of Indonesia's tariff reduction to flow through, we on this side of the chamber welcome Indonesia's commitments, because they mean opportunities for Queensland and Australian sugarcane growers.


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2018 makes some very small albeit very important amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Labor will always hold the Turnbull government to account, even in matters such as tariff proposals. to ensure that our complex and important tariff framework is clear and functional. I would urge the Turnbull government to continue its work with its Indonesian counterparts to ensure the best possible trading environment for Australian business and consumers alike, particularly for sugarcane growers in my home state of Queensland. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (13:17):  The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2018 contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act that will assist Australian businesses and consumers. The first set of amendments in the bill implement an early outcome of the Indonesia-Australia Closer Economic Partnership Agreement by providing a free rate of duty for certain herbicides and pesticides imported from Indonesia. These amendments are consistent with Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2018. The second set of amendments in the bill create a concessional item for eligible blinded clinical trial kits and placebos used in clinical trials. This will make the importation of these goods into Australia cheaper through the removal of customs duty while also simplifying the import process and reducing red tape. These amendments are consistent with Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2018. The final amendment made by the bill realigns schedule 12 with the other schedules of the act by removing a redundant item. I therefore commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (13:30):  The Liberals are waging the biggest war on the ABC in a generation. Despite promising no cuts to the ABC, they've cut $282 million from the ABC since 2014, with 800 jobs cut. This year, they cut another $84 million from the ABC. At the Liberal Party's Federal Council recently, not a single person stood up to oppose the sell-off of the ABC. Australians love and trust our public broadcaster. From Bananas in Pyjamas to the Hottest 100 to getting critical warning messages about local floods and fires, the ABC is part of who we are. We on this side will not stand for the ABC being attacked just so the Liberals can fund their big tax cuts to the top end of town. Labor in government will reverse the Liberals' latest cut of $84 million. We'll keep fighting against the Liberals' war on our public broadcaster right through to the next election.


I'm glad to say that Labor has preselected Kate Thwaites to be the Labor candidate to replace me in Jagajaga. She's a former ABC News journalist. She understands we love the ABC and will fight to keep it safe.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2018-08-16,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I thank the honourable member for his question. He's raised the matter of energy, and he has the opportunity to stand up for lower electricity prices. He has the opportunity to support the National Energy Guarantee, which will contribute to a $550 reduction in the electricity bill of the average family in the National Electricity Market. So he knows that every single leading industry group, consumer groups, and even unions and experts are all supporting the National Energy Guarantee, because they know it will reduce energy prices. But there's a difference. On this side of the House, we want electricity prices to be lower than they are today, and they're starting to come down already. We've taken decisive action that has resulted in them coming down. Already, we've seen reductions in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, but there's more to be done.


However, on the Labor side, we know what they think. They want energy prices to be higher, and, of course, that's the natural consequence of a 50 per cent renewables target, but they're proud of it. The Labor Environment Action Network said, just a few days ago: 'Higher prices are not a market failure. They're proof of the market working well.' That's what Labor wants. I'm reminded, on the subject of the Labor Environment Action Network, of what Senator Keneally said in her first speech. She said that, 15 years ago, she and Jenny McAllister started the Labor Environment Action Network. She said—



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will resume his seat—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The Minister for the Environment and Energy will cease interjecting. The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.




Mr Burke:
  It's on direct relevance. The question is about the member for Hinkler, and the Prime Minister is studiously not referring to him.



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister is referring to energy policy, which was also part of the question. The Prime Minister has the call.




Mr TURNBULL:
  Senator Keneally went on to say LEAN, the Labor Environment Action Network, had successfully campaigned within the party for a 50 per cent renewable energy target. Scott Morrison once described LEAN as an infiltration of radical activists within the Labor Party.



Mr Morrison interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The Treasurer confirms that that's exactly what he said, and he was right. 'A solar cell, if you will,' said Senator Keneally, and then, turning to her comrade Senator McAllister, she said, 'Now that we are both here, I guess the infiltration is complete.' It'll be complete if Labor could ever get a 50 per cent target and have the sign of high prices, because that, according to Labor, is a proof of the market working well.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (15:15):  It's very difficult to talk about a matter that concerns rural and regional Australia without mentioning the circumstances of drought-stricken communities. This morning I was reminded of the impact that it's having in the Illawarra and on the South Coast. I spoke to Labor's candidate for the seat of Gilmore about the circumstances facing the dairy industry on the South Coast. Fiona Phillips, Labor's candidate for the seat of Gilmore, comes from four generations of dairy farmers on the South Coast. Her family is still involved in the dairy industry. She reminded me that the drought is affecting the industry on the South Coast enormously. She told me a story of one farmer who was taking 80 cattle to the abattoir every week. There are very real concerns that on the South Coast over 50 per cent of the family-owned dairy farms will not be in operation by Christmas. So we know that this is having a devastating impact on families, on communities and on businesses in rural and regional Australia.


Against that background, we have to consider what the obligation of government is. We know that governments cannot make it rain, but we are quite certain that governments have an obligation to ensure that we do not make life harder for communities and businesses and farmers in rural and regional Australia. We need to ensure that our response is adequate to the challenges at hand. And I have to say: while the response from the government, announced during the midwinter break, was welcome, it was not adequate. The response has been criticised, quite rightly, by farming communities as overly bureaucratic, slow and inadequate to the challenges that farming communities are meeting.


Communities from regional Australia, whether they send a National Party MP, a Liberal Party MP or an Independent or a Labor Party MP to this place, expect us to stand up for the needs of rural and regional Australia—not just in crisis but in normal times as well. We know that rain will come. And we know that, as every day goes past, we are one day closer to the drought breaking. That is why we need to set our minds to the task of what needs to be put in place to sustain those communities through the drought, and to set rural and regional Australia up for the future.


That is why we, on the Labor side of the House, were so concerned when we had confirmed last night that a plan was afoot between the NBN and the government to slug rural and regional consumers of NBN products up to $20 extra a month for accessing wireless internet services from the NBN. We had it confirmed, late last night at an NBN committee, that there was a plan afoot to slug the 240,000 premises throughout the country who access their broadband internet services through a fixed wireless NBN service up to $240 extra a year. This is for a substandard service. This is for a service that we now know, as each week goes by, is suffering more and more congestion. And we know that the NBN is putting in place plans to, in their own words, try to groom or throttle the access to those internet services, to ensure that the demand matches the bandwidth that is available. Charging those consumers is not the right answer.


If anybody doubts that this plan was afoot, they need look no further than the words of the NBN and the government spokespersons themselves. At 8 am today on ABC radio in Hobart the presenter asked an NBN spokesperson:


Is it fair that customers why just, by I guess where they live, have to pay more for a service that's available in the city?


The answer from the NBN spokesperson was:


Well this is one of the realities of the internet.


The answer from this government at eight o'clock this morning was: 'That's just the reality of the internet. You just have to get over it.'


By 11 o'clock this morning the backflip was in full swing. I have to pay credit to the member for Lyons, who was instrumental in putting a spotlight on this plan in the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network in this place last night. It was not a member of the National Party—because no member of the National Party even turned up to the committee to put pressure on the NBN and to put a spotlight on the plans that we knew were afoot from the NBN and the government. It wasn't a member of the National Party. It was not even one of the regional Liberal representatives who are members of that committee. It was the member for Lyons who exposed the plan. It was the member for Lyons, representing a regional community in Tasmania, who exposed the plan that was afoot. By 12 o'clock today the minister was shamed and embarrassed into withdrawing the position. But what is absolutely clear is that, had it not been for the pressure applied by the member for Lyons and the Labor Party, regional and rural consumers would have been paying $20 a month more from Monday—not from next year—for accessing exactly the same services as people in the cities.


The minister cannot pretend, as he has attempted to do today, that he knew nothing about it. Members opposite who pretend to represent rural and regional communities cannot pretend to have known nothing about it, because members opposite would have had available to them—as I have had available to me and as all members for rural and regional communities have had available to them—submissions that have been made by every telecommunications company in the country to the regional and rural telecommunications review. Every telecommunications company has put a submission into that review saying that the government has a plan for differential pricing for NBN services accessed over the wireless internet platform and that this is going to have an iniquitous impact on rural and regional communities. They cannot claim to have had no knowledge. It was in the written submissions.


I am sure the telecommunications companies were raising the same objections with the Minister for Regional Communications, who is not interested in anything unless it has got a hockey stick strapped to it. She is supposed to be the Minister for Regional Communications, but she has been completely missing in action on this issue. 


Members opposite have been caught out. They were but days away from implementing a new plan that would have had regional consumers slugged a minimum additional $240 per annum on their internet bills. These guys talk about the costs of living. Here is a cost-of-living impact that they have a direct responsibility for. 


This whole episode makes it clear that you cannot trust the National Party and you cannot trust the Liberal Party—in fact, you cannot trust anyone on that side of the House—when it comes to providing internet services, broadband services and telecommunications services for regional and rural communities. You cannot trust them. They are either ignorant of the facts or asleep at the wheel and doing nothing about it. Labor has a plan and Labor will ensure that these communities get the internet services they deserve. It was Labor that conceived of the National Broadband Network after a decade of inaction from those on the other side of the House—a decade of inaction. It was Labor that conceived of the NBN. It was Labor that had a plan to ensure that they would get a fibre-optic cable connection to every premises in those large towns, villages and cities throughout regional Australia. It was the National Party and it was the Liberal Party who sold them out. Not only have they sold them out on the plan and on the rollout, they have not had the strength, they've not had the attention to the subject matter, to ensure that the plan is thoroughly rolled out in their regional and rural communities so that they get the services they deserve. 


When you talk about prices and the cost of living, this is something which is directly within your control, and you have been found wanting. Once again, not one National Party member and not one Liberal Party member has done their job and stood up to the government— (Time expired)

"McVeigh, John, MP",LP,2018-08-16,"



Dr McVEIGH
 (Groom—Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government) (15:25):  Here's Labor again. They hate it when someone from regional Australia stands at this dispatch box, representing the whole country, such as the National Party and the Liberal Parties do. We have heard from Labor today, once again leading by the chin, once again misleading the public on the NBN. They claim that NBN intends to charge more for fixed wireless services compared to the fixed line services. This is not the case. It will not occur.


We've heard from the member for Whitlam. What a display! Here he is wanting to mislead Australians about the challenges, the fortunes and the opportunities in regional Australia and getting on and helping them do it for the future. He's grandstanding once again. Whereas the coalition—the Liberal Party and the National Party—are getting on with the job. We're 100 per cent focused on delivering more secure jobs and a stronger economy for all of those who call regional Australia home. We're focused on supporting nearly eight million people who live outside of our capital cities. From Busselton to Boulia, the coalition has a plan and we are focused on getting it done. 


Building up regional Australia is all about what the coalition plan is focused upon—not tearing it down as those opposite would do. They're more focused on destroying jobs, pouring on more tax and destroying confidence throughout regional Australia. We're backing regional Australia with more jobs. More than one million jobs have been created since the coalition government was elected. That's up to one million more families spending more and investing more. We're building communities up, not tearing them down. We're providing tax relief to families and businesses right across Australia. 


It would be interesting to consider what the contribution would be from the member for Whitlam and those opposite, because they continue to miss the facts. They continue to ignore the fact that 61,000 locals in the electorate of Whitlam, for example, are benefitting from the very tax relief, thanks to the coalition, that I refer to, or the more than 12,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in that electorate who are already spending more and investing more, thanks to that tax relief. We're building them up, not tearing them down.


A key part of our plan for regional Australia is the Building Better Regions Fund—local infrastructure, vibrant communities, more jobs. Last month, I travelled right across Australia, as I do quite regularly, and saw some of the 240-plus projects supported, thanks to the $212 million fund that we've invested in the second round of this vital program. Hundreds of local communities have benefited over the years due to this program under coalition leadership, and they do not feel let down. They feel that we are building them up. For example, there are the projects in Baradine, in the member for Parkes electorate; Mercy Aged Care in Rockhampton; or delivering support for the transformational Middleton Beach Foreshore project in Albany, in the member for O'Connor's electorate. That is the coalition developing and delivering on this plan for regional Australia. Of course, all regional electorates are not missing out. We're building them up; we're not tearing them down. We are generating jobs—more opportunities in a stronger economy. The Regional Jobs and Investment Packages have done exactly the same thing in 10 key regions across our great nation—10 key regions that are benefitting from those projects.


Let's think about those opposite just for a moment. Let's think about the six years of Labor shamble in government. Unlike Labor, we are getting it done on the NBN. About 96 per cent of all homes and businesses outside major urban areas either can order NBN based services or have new network construction under way. We're getting it done on the Mobile Black Spot Program. There have been three rounds of this program, investing over $680 million to deliver 867 mobile base stations. Nearly 600 of those have already been turned on and are changing and saving lives. When those opposite were in power for six years they did not spend one single dollar on improving mobile phone coverage—zero, zip. They had six years in government and there was not one mobile phone tower. That's tearing down regional communities, yet again.


The member opposite referred to the drought. Let's talk about the drought. Let's talk about the fact that when we came to power the drought cupboard left to us by the former government was bare. It took the member for New England to lead the charge and respond properly to drought circumstances right across the country, just as our government is stepping up to do again in the conditions now enveloping much of western New South Wales and western Queensland and into Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. As well, we're getting feedback on Blackall, Boulia, Charleville, Trangie, Dubbo, Moree, Narromine. The list goes on. From the farm household allowance and, of course, the Drought Communities Program that I administer through to local governments in order that they might support their local communities, we have invested more than $1.3 billion in support for farmers in need since 2013. Farmers are resilient. The National Party and the Liberal Party know farmers. Many of us are farmers. We know that we will be there simply to give them a hand up when they need it, unlike those opposite. The history books have shown that Australian farmers can do that, and have done it time and time again.


Let's think of Labor's debacle with the live cattle export industry, which is still being felt right across the east coast of Australia and through cattle markets right across the nation. In contrast to that, let's think of our efforts to open up new markets in China, Korea, Japan and Peru—free trade deals that those opposite have either ignored or not supported. In fact, they've argued against them in the past. They want to attack regional economies. They continue to plan to let them down.


We have a very significant decentralisation agenda on behalf of this government. Those opposite don't support it. They don't think that the opportunities for public servants in Sydney's CBD, Melbourne's CBD and here in Canberra should be shared across regional Australia. They don't understand that opportunity. Let's think of the $75 billion infrastructure program, the pipeline that this government is leading for the benefit of regional Australia, be it billions for the Bruce Highway or for the Pacific Highway—the roads of strategic importance. Let's think of stepping into individual regional economies: the $7 million Rockhampton riverfront redevelopment; $5.3 million for Ronald Macdonald House, for example, in South Brisbane—



Opposition members interjecting—




Dr McVEIGH:
  You know what? Because it supports regional families in need of support when they come to get health care in our cities such as that one. There is $2.8 million—why does the opposition hate these sort of projects in regional communities—for Kingston Park community hub in the electorate of the member for Franklin. For the Moss Vale Enterprise Corridor in the electorate of the member for Whitlam there is $4.6 million. Those opposite are not interested in regional Australia.


If the Labor Party got back into power, can you picture them in regional Australia? You'd have the Leader of the Opposition there, jumping in the front seat of the ute. He'd be wondering how to get a regional economy going. He'd turn to his colleagues and say, 'How do we get it going? Why won't it go?' He'd say, 'We must have the brake on.' Regional Australia knows that is the potential under a Labor government in the future, should that dreaded outcome happen. They talk a big game but, when the rubber hits the road, the contrast is stark. The shoddy, shambolic Leader of the Opposition may be able to hoodwink his party room. He might be able to take a two-faced approach, saying different things in Melbourne's CBD to what he may say in regional Queensland in relation to the infrastructure and resources industries, the very industries providing jobs and opportunities for the regional families of the future. How dare the opposition talk about regional Australia? They have no idea. The coalition, the National and Liberal parties, which represent the bulk of regional Australians—that's right: the bulk of regional Australia—will continue to support them going forward, because they are the future of our country. The opposition do not get that. Regional Australia dreads the opposition. They have shown their shortcomings in the past so many times.

Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (15:36):  The Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government is letting regional Australia down. Come to my electorate and speak to the 18.6 per cent of young people who are looking for work while TAFE has been gutted. Talk to them and then represent regional Australia. The government is letting down regional and rural Australians and this is certainly the case in my electorate of Dobell on the New South Wales Central Coast. It's letting down regional Australians in health care, education and employment. On the Central Coast, one in five of us is aged over 65 and one in five of us is aged under 15. These are the regional Australians who you're supposed to represent, who need your help. The very young and the very old are the people who most use and need health care and yet Medicare rebates are not keeping pace and people are paying higher gap fees to access the healthcare services they need, after the New South Wales government tried to sell off our local hospital in Wyong.


Our oldest are waiting too long for home care packages and too long for their pensions to come through. Some have been waiting since last December. Our youngest, especially those from vulnerable families, risk missing out on important early childhood education because of the harsh changes that this government has made to childcare subsidies. On the coast, our population is hollowed out in the middle, as people of working age are forced to travel to work or study outside of our region—to Sydney, Newcastle or further. Young people are forced to travel away for TAFE to Sydney or Newcastle. Under this government, Central Coast TAFE has been gutted. Our schools have lost $33 million. Yes, $33 million to Central Coast schools has been cut. And our university, the University of Newcastle, has lost $69 million that would have supported regional Australians to get a better education, a better start and a better job.


There is no doubt this government is letting down rural and regional Australians and it's not fair. We're not wealthy on the coast. We're decent people, we work hard and we support one another. Young people, in particular, are struggling to find work. We have stubbornly high youth unemployment, sitting at 18.6 per cent, and yet this government is doing nothing. It's sitting on its hands, doing nothing to help them get a job, nothing to help them acquire skills or education and nothing to help them get apprenticeships.


Only Labor is interested in young people and in education, skills and apprenticeships for young people. Labor will commit $100 million to rebuilding TAFE with our Future Fund to reverse the decline in TAFE and rebuild campuses across regional Australia. Labor will ensure two-thirds of funding for vocational education goes to TAFE and will scrap up-front fees for 100,000 students. Labor will provide pre-apprenticeship programs and advanced adult apprenticeship programs, and Labor will ensure one in 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects are filled by apprentices. In regional areas like mine on the Central Coast of New South Wales, the chance to gain skills through an apprenticeship is a trusted pathway to a secure career.


Behind health care, manufacturing is our second biggest value-add sector on the Central Coast, worth nearly $1 billion and employing nearly 10,000 people. What is the government doing to support manufacturing in regional and rural Australia? Nothing. The manufacturing sector is crying out for support to grow, expand and employ more people, and the government is doing nothing. The manufacturing industry needs skilled workers and willing apprentices and the government is cutting them off at the knees.


Our regions even more than our cities need TAFE, and Labor will work to rebuild TAFE. We will rebuild education and we will rebuild health care. What could be more important to anyone, whether they live in the city or in the regional and rural areas of Australia, than access to quality health care, a good local education and a secure job? This is what is necessary for anybody in our country.


Before I finish, I want to turn to something that this ideologically driven government is fixated on: trickle-down economics. It has let down the people of regional and rural Australia. It has let them down badly. I want to talk to you about Enid and Warren. Enid is 94 and vision impaired. Warren is 97 and living with dementia. Last April they were assessed for a level 3 home care package. They are still waiting. When my office contacted My Aged Care, we were told that they'd look at another assessment, to hopefully move them from a medium priority to a high priority. It is just outrageous that someone who is 94, is vision impaired and is the carer for her husband, who is 97 and living with dementia, has to struggle. Do you know what they said? 'Don't bother, Emma. We'll be dead before this gets fixed.' That is how this government is supporting struggling regional Australians who are suffering. It must do better. This is not fair.

It's always amusing to listen to the member for Whitlam talking about regional Australia. I know he has a great knowledge of regional Australia—he drives through it on his way from Canberra to Wollongong every couple of weeks and has a clear understanding of what's going on! He comes in here without a real issue but with a made-up issue, about telecommunications. I've been here for a while. I sat on that side of the House while his party removed the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund and gave people $900 cash flashes to put through the poker machines and buy things from Kmart—all gone; not one mobile phone tower. But the people at Yellow Mountain, west of Condobolin—a vast area that had been neglected by the opposition—are now getting telecommunications services thanks to the Mobile Black Spot Program.


The member for Whitlam mentioned drought. I've got to know a bit about drought. I was a farmer for 33 years before I came here, and I've been through a few. This is as bad as it's been. I've seen as bad as this, but it's as bad as it's been. I can tell you farmers are handling this a lot better because of the policies put in by the member for New England when he was the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources.



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  I can point you, Member for Hunter, to grain storages, water systems and farms that have been properly fenced because of the tax incentives that were put in place for that white paper. You've got to be able to speak about regional Australia because you understand regional Australia, and we don't see any of that from the other side. I sat in this place—I think it was in 2008—when the member for Watson as agriculture minister said, 'We're not going to use the word 'drought' anymore.' Remember that? He said, 'We're going to change 'drought' for 'dryness'. We've just got dryness now. We'll put in a bit of a $60,000 scheme.' Remember the scheme in Western Australia, where they were going to do trials about farmers managing dryness? That was it. That was their drought policy.


This is not a place for negative speeches. I want to talk about the positives in regional Australia. The member for Dobell might want to send her young people to the electorate of Parkes, where youth unemployment is in single figures. The unemployment level of Dubbo is 2.2 per cent. Last year 58 Indigenous kids did the HSC at Dubbo College Senior Campus and have gone into employment or education because of the funding of things like Clontarf, Girls Academy, Sista Speak—all these things that the federal government is funding for young people in regional Australia. She might want to go across the road a bit, to the campus of Dubbo Base Hospital, and have a look at the construction of the cancer centre—thanks to the help of the member for New England once again. That cancer centre is going to serve the people of western New South Wales. Go a little bit further round, to the medical school, where country kids can do their full training—from students right through to specialisation—in the bush. It is training doctors for the bush.


There is the Inland Rail. We heard a lot of talk about the Inland Rail. I can actually take you out there now and show you where the tracks have been laid out, where the earth's been dug up, for that corridor of commerce that's going to link Melbourne with Brisbane, right through—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The assistant minister will take his seat for a second. The member for New England on a point of order.




Mr Joyce:
  It's absolutely disorderly to interject from outside your seat, and I would remind the member for Hunter that he might want to sit on the very back of the backbench because he's such a hopeless minister he should get in front of it.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I take the member for New England's point. I do warn the member for Hunter. He has been warned. He is outside of his seat and he will be removed if he does that again. I give the call to the assistant minister.




Mr COULTON:
  Inland rail is going to boost the economy of the entire country, but particularly of regional Australia.


Regional Australia is a land of opportunity. One thing that I know unites the people of regional Australia is they're absolutely terrified of this group sitting opposite. They can remember the shemozzle that was the government when those opposite were in. They can remember the raiding of the money that was set aside for telecommunications infrastructure and changing—




Mr Stephen Jones:
  And building infrastructure.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (15:46):  Here we are, yet again, talking about how the National Party has abandoned rural and regional Australia. I always find it interesting—



Mr Coulton interjecting—




Mrs ELLIOT:
  I'll get to coal seam gas and how you're pushing full steam ahead with that, don't you worry about that. But I always find it interesting that the National Party members can come here and yell at us, but they can't walk down the hall and yell at the Prime Minister in defence of regional Australia. They're too scared! They'll come in here and carry on about us, but they've done nothing to help the people of the regions. Why don't they tell the Prime Minister what they need in regional and rural Australia? They don't do it, because they've abandoned the country. Time and time again they've done that. 


This government continues to fail people from the regions. It was long ago that the National Party abandoned them. But people are onto you; people are onto the National Party. They know what you've done, and they also know what you haven't done. As we know and as we say in this House quite often, government is all about choices and priorities. The Turnbull government has chosen to give the banks that $17 billion tax handout. That's what the government has chosen and that's what the National Party have chosen too. When we say that National Party choices hurt; they really do hurt! They really do hurt when they choose to give the big tax handout to the banks instead of funding vital services in the bush. That's why people have had it with you. That's why people know you've abandoned them. 


Let's run through of some those harsh National Party cuts, shall we? Cuts to hospitals and healthcare, cuts to aged care, cuts to pensions, cuts to education, cuts to the ABC, cuts to penalty rates as well, and of course, the government's NBN debacle. We haven't heard any of their speakers talk about the NBN, have we? Because it's a complete disaster! Let's have a look at some of those education cuts and cuts to families. We've got increases in childcare fees, cuts to school funding, cuts to apprenticeships and TAFE, and also cuts to university funding. It's interesting when we look at those cuts to schools. What is that figure again? They have cut $17 billion from schools whilst they're giving $17 billion to the banks. The National Party aren't talking about that too much out in their seats, are they? No. 


Those harsh cuts to universities really hurt people in the regions. If you live in a regional or rural area, it's already hard enough to get to university, with all the added costs of transport. The government's cuts to universities and the increase in fees make it extra hard for kids from the country to actually get to universities. Look at my area in northern New South Wales. For Southern Cross University, the cuts from the academic years 2018 to 2021 are $25 million. How hard does it make it for kids then from the regions to actually get to uni? 


Let's get back to the NBN. Let's see if any other speakers following us today are actually going to mention those words, because it is a total debacle. People in the country have a right to access good reliable broadband. They don't have that. The government's NBN has been a disaster—$20 billion over budget and four years behind schedule. We need to have the NBN in the regions. We need an effective NBN for our students at universities, for our small businesses to connect to the world, for our flourishing creative industries, and for our health and hospital services as well. We've already heard from some of the speakers today about the debacle over the government's increase for fees in the regions. Goodness me! They certainly were caught out, weren't they? They did a big backflip with that. It just shows that you cannot trust the National Party and you cannot trust them with their NBN as they try to slug those extra charges. I will just point out what it would have meant for my electorate in Richmond: nearly 12,000 homes would have been slugged $240 extra a year with their secret plan to increase the NBN in the regions.




Mr Coulton:
  You're making it up!




Mrs ELLIOT:
  Don't worry—we're onto you! We're onto you! We also see these members across here constantly attacking penalty rates. That's what's hurting families in the regions: your constant war against penalty rates for people in the regions who rely on them. We have here a National Party that supports cuts to penalty rates. Time and time again, we hear them supporting it.


Let's never forget that every single National Party member in this House has had eight opportunities in this parliament to protect penalty rates. And what have they done each time? They've voted against them. Every single time, they've abandoned the people of the regions. Eight times they had that opportunity and they chose not to protect penalty rates, each and every single time.


It's very clear that there's only one way to protect penalty rates, and that's to elect a Shorten Labor government. As I said, governments are all about choices and priorities. The Turnbull government has abandoned Australia and the regions by choosing to give the banks that big handout. But it's the National Party that has really abandoned those people in the regions. It's only Labor that will stand up for the country—only Labor.

"Landry, Michelle, MP",Nats,2018-08-16,"



Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia—Chief Nationals Whip) (15:51):  Today may very well be known in the future as the day the opposition finally went mad. All week, we've seen them argue about serious funding that this coalition government has delivered to help secure a strong future for the Great Barrier Reef. We've also seen them sit on the fence when it comes to setting up an energy system that actually works and that provides affordable, reliable energy for everyday Australians and employees alike. Energy prices are of vital importance to people in the bush, but this opposition just does not care.


And then, today, we have this. The very idea that a motion such as this could come from the Australian Labor Party—the very same party that's done everything within their power, in living memory, to ruin and demonise those who live and work in the bush—is entirely confusing. Labor has never shown any interest in the needs of the people in the bush, nor do they now. They simply find an excuse to talk about themselves.


It was the Labor Party which halted the live cattle export to Indonesia overnight, on a whim. Graziers and communities across the Top End are still reeling from this stupid decision made in haste by people who had no idea about the industry they were in charge of. If you combine this with the radical hatred those opposite have adopted when it comes to coalmining then there is very little remaining for regional and rural Australians to rely on in getting a good job under a Labor-Greens regime.


On the matter of the cruel, crippling drought grasping much of Queensland and almost all of New South Wales, I'm confident that the government, while unable to perform miracles—although we sometimes may like to—is delivering what is needed for farming families in desperate situations. There is a range of assistance out there for farmers and graziers, from financial to therapeutic. We need people to reach out and take advantage of what is being offered, though, and I hope that more take up those opportunities in the near future.


What is more important and appropriate for a government to get stuck into, though, is to continue to develop the infrastructure that our regional and rural communities and businesses need to thrive. There is no good in fighting to get through a drought and then not have the infrastructure you need to bounce back and thrive. That's why I have led such a crusade for two vital forms of infrastructure: water and roads.


There is not a Central Queenslander who has not heard of Rookwood Weir, the state's No. 1 water infrastructure priority. Rookwood has been a passion of mine since I entered parliament back in 2013. And when we know what it will do for CQ, we can understand why. There will be 200 to 400 jobs through construction, 2,100 ongoing jobs, a $1 billion boost to the economy and opportunities for all sorts of agriculture development—feedlots, tree crops, timber plantations, small crops, vegetables and agriculture. The sky is, indeed, the limit.


Clearly, what this project can do for the region is immense, and it is only the coalition who are serious about making it happen. It is only the coalition that has invested real money into feasibility studies across the country for new dams and weirs. It is the coalition that has led the process all the way with Rookwood Weir. It was us who delivered the original $130 million to get Rookwood built, as well as $2 million for the state government to complete a business case. We waited over 600 days until the Queensland government finally dragged themselves up to the table, and eventually all of the $352 million needed has been placed on the table. We are ready to go, but for some reason nothing is happening. It's clear the state government continues to drag its feet, and I for one have had enough.


Foot dragging is not confined to the Rookwood Weir project either, with a range of infrastructure projects on the go-slow across the region. We have serious issues with sections of the Fitzroy Development Road, a remote highway responsible for carrying heavy loads for the mining and grazing sectors—utterly ignored by the state government that owns it. Motorists and their properties are in real peril. Meanwhile, major upgrades to the Capricorn Highway are sitting on the books, once again waiting for action by the state government. We're doing what we can to improve local infrastructure, while the state colleagues of those opposite simply don't care. Today's MPI suggests the government is letting down rural and regional Australians, but I can only see one government doing that: the Queensland Labor state government.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2018-08-16,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (15:55):  To have lessons about rural and regional Australia from the National Party, the party that's abandoned the regions, is just beyond the pale. This is a party that has voted multiple times against a banking royal commission, against investigations into banks that are hurting farmers and hurting regional communities. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming, after the work done by this side of the House, into getting a banking royal commission up and running. Look at what that banking royal commission has uncovered: crime after crime after crime. Yet they sat over there with their Liberal counterparts and did nothing for years. You should be ashamed. The same party voted against action on penalty rates. I'll tell you what: young people in my community who work in hospitality, retail and other services across the regions need penalty rates not just as pocket money but to survive, to pay the rent and to put food on the table.


So don't sit there, National Party, and lecture us about rural and regional Australia. You haven't been doing your job, and that's why people are voting more and more to elect Labor MPs into regional seats. Shortland, Richmond, Hunter, Paterson, Bass, Braddon, Lyons, Newcastle, Whitlam, Herbert, Solomon, Lingiari, Dobell—and I'm sure there are more. We are on the march for rural and regional Australia, and we're coming for you.


I will just say this about the drought in New South Wales and Queensland: I'm proud to say that Tasmanians have really delivered the goods here. Dairy farmer Michael Perkins, his mate Robbie Edwards, dairy farmer Paul Lambert, Glenn Phillips in Smithton, and Ruby Daly from Marion Bay potatoes in my electorate are all doing their bit to help the farmers and regional communities who are doing it very tough out there in New South Wales and Queensland—in some respect repaying the debt to mainlanders from when Tasmania suffered a drought and also floods in recent years. This is what rural and regional Australians do. They act together . They work together for the common good.


I've got a long speech here, which I have completely blown, on the myriad failures of this government on rural and regional Australia, and I'll try to get to some of it. But I tell you what: I'll come to the NBN, because those opposite have been saying about the NBN that we're not telling the truth. Well, let me say this. This is the recorded Hansard of my question to the NBN yesterday:


I … want to confirm what you were saying … I represent a country electorate. A lot of my people are on fixed wireless. I want to be crystal clear: are you saying that, if somebody who lives in the centre of Hobart and is on a 50-meg bundled service and paying $45 wholesale moves out to my electorate and gets a fixed wireless tower, under the new bundled service you are talking about they would be paying $65 wholesale? Is that the essence of what you're saying?


Mr Stephen Rue of NBN Co said:


If the RSP chooses to purchase a 50-20 bundled product from us, that would be $65, yes.


So there it is in Hansard: a big difference between what NBN Co is going to charge people on fixed wireless, $65 wholesale, and what they're charging people in the city on a fixed line, which is $45 wholesale. That was last night. Then today we've had the press release from the minister: 'Oh, no, nothing to see here. We're not really doing that. That was just sort of a plan—maybe something we were thinking about.' I truly hope that the government and NBN Co have changed their minds and have backflipped on this, because that means that, thanks to Labor questions at the committee last night, Labor have saved country people $240 a year on their NBN—240 bucks a year, a Turnbull tax, a tax from Malcolm Turnbull because of his rank incompetence in delivering a workable NBN. Labor has saved country people $240 a year that they otherwise would have had to pay. I'm sure The Nationals will be thanking us for that—certainly, there were none of them there.


Health, schools, universities, penalty rates—wherever you look, in every single instance the National and Liberal parties are failing rural and regional Australians. From tomorrow, one in four families will be worse off under the Liberals' unfair childcare system, which will disproportionately affect women and families in rural Australia.

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2018-08-16,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England) (16:00):  It has never been so much of a joy to talk about regional Australia and the National Party as it is today. You'll see in the Hansard how many times the Labor Party have mentioned the National Party—because they obviously acknowledge the work we do and are fearful of the work we do. I commend the new National Party senator for Tasmania, Senator Martin, for the hard work he is doing.


Let us start. Who banned the live cattle trade? The Labor Party. Who's going to ban the live sheep trade? The Labor Party. Who fought against us on the decentralisation of things, such as the APVMA to Armidale? The Labor Party. Who's taking money out of our portfolio for building dams and driving investment? The Labor Party. Who had no money on the table for the Inland Rail in their last budget? The Labor Party. The member for Hunter, who stood up and proposed this MPI, was sitting down the back and has now left the chamber. He's not even here anymore; he doesn't believe in it. Where is the Labor Party's drought policy? I haven't seen it; it doesn't exist. What about mobile phones? How much did the Labor Party spend on mobile phones in their term? Nothing. They are absolutely hopeless. They will do nothing. Who's going to get rid of the Regional Investment Corporation we set up? The Labor Party. 


The Labor Party have the temerity to come in here and say that they represent regional areas. When you listen to them closely, you don't hear one thing about regional Australia, just a grab bag of issues. Who decided to set up one of their regions as Parramatta? The Labor Party. Aren't they remarkable? Today they had the chance to come in here and say that the National Party did a great job on decentralisation. They should support it. They should say, 'We like the way the National Party is building dams, and we support them.' God knows how long we had to wait for them to come to the party on Rookwood Weir! They should support us on the Inland Rail and say where in their budget the money to build it is. They should support us on rolling out mobile phone towers, but they never do. They have no vision for regional Australia.


Now we have the drought. I would have thought that, in a time of drought, you would have had myriad questions about the premier issue in regional Australia. I would have thought you'd have the dignity and the decency, during question time, to be firing question after question to us about the drought—not one. This is all theatre. They don't have it. They don't care. Even whilst this MPI is going, the member for Hunter has gone. Even he doesn't think he belongs here. He doesn't even support you. Your own shadow minister for agriculture is not here. He doesn't even care. He has left. He's the most hopeless shadow agriculture minister we've ever had. He is a complete and utter joke. He can never get a question up in question time, and leaves during the MPI—and you stand there and say that you're representing regional Australia? It is a total absurdity.


I'll reflect on the drought. I hope that there is a bipartisan view on the drought. Fires, floods and cyclones are bipartisan issues, and so should drought be too. I commend the minister for his incredibly important changes to the farm household allowance. I want to make a couple of suggestions about things we could do, if we worked in a bipartisan way. The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder has a huge resource in water, and we have a crisis—a national crisis. There should be the capacity for the Commonwealth Environmental Water holder to put water into irrigating fodder. If you want to be serious, you could actually work towards that. You could lobby for that. I'm absolutely stating: that is something that should be put on the agenda now, so we can start growing the lucerne that is needed. We need a huge amount of feed, and it is literally running out. 


We have got to be able to make sure that we move the infrastructure projects forward that are required so that towns that are in the epicentre of the drought at least get the commercial benefit from the infrastructure projects, such as road projects, which would have to be done in any case. They could be moved forward and dealt with now. 


I commend the Leader of the Opposition on something he suggested the other day, when he talked about the use of agronomists for the sowing down of country that is, in some instances, virtually sterilised. I'll close with this: guess what the rainfall for Tamworth has been this year? A bit over four inches. Guess what the rainfall has been for Riyadh in Saudi Arabia? Four inches.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-08-16,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (16:06):  That was a very entertaining speech from the member for New England. If you want to talk about water, Member for New England, you might want to ask your government where the money is for the second stage of water security for Townsville. We are currently having to pay $34,000 a day to pump water into our city. Seventy per cent of Queensland is drought declared. 


If we want to talk about the LNP, which we believe are letting down rural and regional Australians, let me tell you, it's not a matter of letting us down; it's a matter of totally destroying us. This government is cutting our health funding, cutting our education funding and cutting remote Indigenous housing, which is a major issue for me as Palm Island is in my electorate. 


The only thing this LNP government has increased in my community is unemployment figures. Unemployment in Townsville has almost doubled under the LNP government. Townsville has the seventh highest unemployment rate in Australia. We have experienced the highest unemployment figures in our recorded history, thanks to the Abbott and Turnbull government. But we weren't always this way. No, we were not. Under a federal Labor government, Townsville thrived. Townsville's unemployment rate, when Labor left office in 2013, was lower than both the state and national averages. Now Townsville's unemployment rate is higher than the state average and almost double the national average. 


However, the picture only gets worse. Since the LNP came to power, Townsville has lost 3,000 manufacturing jobs. We have lost 149 Australian tax office jobs. We have lost 50 Defence staff jobs, 40 aviation jobs, 19 CSIRO jobs and 30 regional Customs jobs. We've lost 442 construction businesses and 153 retail businesses. We are now the insolvency capital of Queensland, and I haven't even finished painting the nightmare picture that consecutive LNP governments have caused in my home town. 


Let's not forget how this government hates to fund health and education in regional Australia. If you live in Townsville and you don't have a job let's hope that you or your family do not get sick under this government, because this government is cutting funding to our hospitals and making it harder for families to visit a bulk-billing GP. The Turnbull government is cutting $9 million to the Townsville Hospital and Health Service. These cuts mean the loss of four beds, 12 doctors and 25 nurses—more job losses for Townsville, the home of the only tertiary health service outside the south-east corner. 


Then there's the Medicare freeze, which we now know is impacting on regional Australians more than any other citizens. The people in Townsville are paying double to see their GP, according to the national health report released today. And, with the increases in fees, guess what that leads to? The front page of today's TownvilleBulletin reads, 'Minor health concerns flood hospital.' Because, at our hospital, we are treating 55 people a day for minor ailments—ailments that people would normally take to their GP. But now they are flooding to the emergency department, because they cannot afford to go to a GP. Around 26 per cent of patients—that is, 6,475 people—just over the last six months presented to the Townsville hospital with minor ailments like coughs. This is ridiculous, and it is putting absurd pressure on a hospital that this government is already taking an axe to. 


Then there are our schools. This out-of-touch Turnbull government is cutting $17 billion from our schools whilst giving the big banks a $17 billion handout. This government puts banks before children. This cut is the equivalent of losing almost one in three teaching positions. The picture is one of job cut after job cut under this government. In Herbert we will lose $14.8 million from our schools. 


Let me get to the universities. James Cook University will experience a cut of $36 million and Central Queensland University a cut of $38 million. This attack on JCU, a genuine regional university, has resulted in the axing of the only on-campus arts degree in a university in North Queensland. As well, 14 people are losing their job at James Cook University because of this government. 


The picture for regional Australia isn't pretty under the Turnbull government. And the Turnbull government has done absolutely nothing for the NBN in Townsville. That will require a Labor government. Without a Labor government, the picture for Townsville becomes bleaker and bleaker, as the picture is one of job cuts and funding losses under the LNP. There is absolutely no good news for regional Queensland in the seat of Herbert under this government.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (16:11):  It's no wonder that Australians are so disheartened by the state of Australian politics at the moment, when they hear the sort of contribution that we've just heard from the member for Herbert. Regrettably, what the Labor Party does is make a whole lot of claims—I would have to say very untruthful claims—about cuts to schools, cuts to health. It goes on and on and on. We just heard the member for Herbert say that we're imposing the Medicare rebate freeze. Let me say very clearly to the member for Herbert that it was the Labor Party which imposed a freeze on the indexation of the Medicare rebate. We are lifting that freeze. So that is an absolutely unmitigated untruth from the member for Herbert, and that is the standard and calibre of the contribution we have from the Labor Party. 


We've heard very little from the Labor Party today about how it would stand up for regional Australia. As we know, Labor's plan is all about imposing more than $200 billion of taxes over 10 years on nearly every aspect of the economy—and we saw the Leader of the Opposition on television the other day looking for a handbrake. The only handbrake he would be looking for is a handbrake on the Australian economy, because that's what would happen if Labor were elected. We know that because we can see that Labor is planning to impose considerable taxes on electricity. Capital gains tax would go up. There would be increased taxes on family trusts, on housing, and of course on our retirees and pensioners—on self-funded retirees, with the shocking retiree tax, which is the single biggest tax that would be imposed on Australians. 


We've heard very little about infrastructure from the Labor Party today in this MPI. If I look at and consider what's going on in my electorate of Corangamite, we are rolling out massive investments, not just in regional roads but also in rail. That's happening across the nation under a $75 billion infrastructure plan. I say shame on the Labor Party for the way in which it is failing to fund rail in the Corangamite electorate. We have actually announced and committed $254 million to upgrade local rail, and we have received a very small proportion of funding from the state Labor government—only $20 million. It took two years to create a business plan. There is no plan, no construction—it is an absolute joke. The member for New England rightly called out the member for Hunter, who was in the chamber before, for slinking out of the chamber. When the member for Hunter was in charge back in 2008, along with the member for Corio, he presided over one of the worst economic decisions for our region, which was to stop Avalon Airport building an international terminal. That was an absolutely disgraceful decision for our region. Proudly, we are now building, with $20 million announced in this year's budget, an international terminal, creating Victoria's second international airport at Avalon. 


Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, we're rolling out a program with $245 million to combat mobile black spots around the country, including 18 in Corangamite, and I'm fighting for more mobile base stations for Teesdale, Armstrong Creek and Moggs Creek. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms HENDERSON:
  As we hear from the interjections opposite, what an embarrassment they are. What an embarrassment the Labor Party are. When they were in government there was not one single dollar for mobile base stations. We know how critical this infrastructure is for regional Australia. Farmers, families and regional communities cannot get on and do their business—cannot run a business and go to school—without mobile communications. If anyone wants to know how poorly Labor stands up for regional communities just look at what they committed to mobile base stations when they were in government: a big fat zero. It is a disgrace.


In Corangamite, 94 per cent of homes now have the NBN available to them. We are rolling out the NBN. It was an absolute shambles under the Labor Party. In Corangamite and across regional Australia there has been massive investment for jobs in manufacturing and in wonderful regional businesses. We're putting millions and millions of dollars through the Building Better Regions Fund. They are really important projects. As I say, look at Labor's record on mobile base stations, such important infrastructure for regional Australia, and that tells you everything you want to know about this disgraceful Labor Party.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:16):  For the benefit of anyone who has just tuned in and is listening, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2018 Measures No. 1) Bill 2018 is legislation which provides for mandatory reporting of medicines that might be in short supply or be discontinued. It's a measure that has been brought in because the current way of dealing with matters, which is basically a voluntary reporting system, has proved to be unsatisfactory.


The new mandatory scheme will apply to both medicine shortages and any decisions to permanently discontinue supply of a currently available medicine. The bill does include civil penalties for non-compliance with the scheme; however, I understand the intent is more so to educate suppliers in doing the right thing. If there are to be any penalties applied, the focus will be on those suppliers who have a history of non-compliance. Again, I think the intent here is not necessarily to go out there and make things difficult for the suppliers but rather for them to take the responsible action and provide information to the health department where a medicine is going to be discontinued or where it's likely to be in short supply.


The new scheme will mainly apply to prescription medicines; however, there is the capacity for the Minister for Health to include other medicines that are registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods if the minister is satisfied that their inclusion would be in the interests of public health. In either case, it will be a reportable medicine, for which the sponsor would be required to notify the secretary of any shortage or permanent discontinuation of their product. For a shortage of critical impact, the intent is that as soon as possible, but no later than two working days after the supplier knows about the possible shortage, they have to provide advice to the department. For any other shortage, it's within 10 working days after they know or ought to have reasonably known of the shortage. For a discontinuation of critical impact, it's at least 12 months before the discontinuation would occur or, if this is not possible, as soon as practicable after the sponsor's decision. For any other discontinuation, it's at least six months before the discontinuation would occur or, if this is not possible, again, as soon as practicable after the decision to discontinue.


A medicine is considered to be in shortage if its supply in Australia will not or will not likely meet the demand for it at any time in the next six months for all the patients in Australia who will take it or who may need to take it. A shortage only applies at a national level, so instances of unavailability or short supply that occur at a particular location within Australia would not necessarily be considered shortages under the bill. In relation to the reporting of shortages within the stated time frames, the requirement to do so would only apply after the sponsor has considered all of the information that it needs to take into account for the purpose of identifying if its medicine will or will likely be in shortage.


A shortage or a decision to permanently discontinue a reportable medicine would be of critical impact, meaning that the shorter notification time frame would apply where either the reportable medicine is included in the medicines watch list—a legislative instrument that is prepared, signalling that the minister is satisfied that a shortage or permanent discontinuation of that product could cause significant morbidity or death for patients in Australia—or there are no other registered medicines that could reasonably be used as a substitute for the medicine, or, if there are, it is not likely that there would be enough of such substitutes to meet the demand for them as a result of the reportable medicines shortage or discontinuation.


The bill also makes a number of unrelated miscellaneous amendments to the act, mainly aimed at reducing inefficiencies in the regulation of therapeutic goods for industry and the Therapeutic Goods Administration. These include allowing standards to adopt other documents as enforced from time to time. Standards for therapeutic goods sometimes rely on Australian or international standards, which are specified in documents issued by the standards organisation. The bill provides the capacity to use the current version of the standard instead of the present situation whereby only a specific version of the document is specified, which may later be superseded.


The Special Access Scheme is also a matter that is covered by those amendments, and the intent is to streamline health practitioner notifications under the Special Access Scheme. This scheme follows a pathway for patients to access therapeutic goods that are not on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and aren't exempt from being on the register. The bill will allow notification, as required by the TGA, to be submitted by another health practitioner on behalf of the treating practitioner rather than the current situation in which the notice can be submitted only by the treating practitioner. That will make the system much more flexible—and, quite frankly, it's a commonsense change to the regulations.


With respect to variations to the medicines register through notification, again, a medicine on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods can have its entry changed at the request of the sponsor in certain circumstances without the need for preapproval. Some of these variations are very minor but would nonetheless result in the creation of a separate entry on the register. Creation of that new entry would also require a new application for marketing approval. The bill allows these types of variations to be made, avoiding the need for additional marketing approval applications—another commonsense provision, because presently if a minor amendment or a minor change is made to a medicine that is listed then it may warrant a full application process, which, quite frankly, in most cases is simply unjustified. Again, for the suppliers, that's going to streamline the process and make the medicine available much more quickly, and it will obviously cut back on some red tape and costs.


Finally, the bill will also remove the requirement for a particular type of application relating to therapeutic goods advertisements to be signed and allows these applications to be submitted online again, which is common practice across most areas of government these days, where online applications and the use of online systems is slowly taking over the use of hard copies. In closing, Labor believes that the need for a mandatory reporting scheme for medicine shortages is in the public interest, and Labor will be supporting this legislation.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (16:23):  I rise to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2018 Measures No. 1) Bill 2018. From the outset, I want to say that I'll be supporting this legislation. This bill enacts measures that will introduce a mandatory reporting scheme, as has already been discussed, for instances when there are medicine shortages in Australia, and it allows application for several penalties for noncompliance.


Shortages in medicines have become more and more of a problem in clinical practice in recent years. Such shortages can arise for a number of reasons and can be very difficult to deal with on a clinical basis. Up until fairly recently, in spite of there being some legislation involving medicine shortages, it's been very difficult to deal with. As an example, as a practitioner, I'm not infrequently required to ring the PBS Authority's hotline to request a phone approval for the use of a medication. The classic one has been methylphenidate, or Ritalin, and its derivatives, for use in children with ADD. I've been required to ring the hotline to get an authority number. You often have to wait on the phone a considerable period of time, sometimes 15 to 20 minutes, to get that authority number. So I've done that and got the authority number for the patient that I'm seeing, only for the patient to come back 20 or 30 minutes later to say that the medication has not been available from the pharmacy, and we would then have to go through the procedure again to get an alternative medication which, as you can imagine, is extraordinarily frustrating and time wasting for myself, the patient and the pharmacist.


This has happened time and time again. In particular, there were shortages of the long-acting form of Ritalin from time to time during the last couple of years. We're usually given very little notice by the pharmaceutical companies that this is the case. In fact, sometimes, the first time that we know that there's a shortage of medication is when the patient returns from the pharmacist or the pharmacist rings and says, 'I've not been able to get this medication anywhere.' This legislation will require better notification of medication shortages, and it will also enact significant penalties for the pharmaceutical companies themselves for not informing the government and, secondarily, medical practitioners and pharmacies about the medication shortages.


In my time in practice, these medication shortages in Australia have become more and more frequent. Part of the problem has been the virtual absence of pharmaceutical manufacturing in Australia for many of the major medications. Many of the bigger companies—Faulding's, for example, is one that I remember was an Australian manufacturing pharmaceutical company—have gone out of business or been taken over by multinational corporations. The multinational pharmaceutical corporations themselves have amalgamated. There were about 30 major international or multinational pharmaceutical companies when I started in practice. There are now about half a dozen. So the number of manufacturers has reduced, manufacturing in Australia has virtually disappeared, and we're reliant on a whole lot of supply chain difficulties before we do get medications in Australia.


The other thing that's happened is, with many of the older medications that are off patent, particularly if they're not used very frequently, there's very little incentive for the generic manufacturers to produce these medications. So they very often stop manufacturing, or the supply is so small that it's not worth importing them into Australia. Australia is really only about one to two per cent of the world pharmaceutical consumption, so there's not a huge incentive to develop really good supply chains for pharmaceuticals in Australia, particularly for the rarer drugs, so this has become a major problem. In fact, yesterday, my office was contacted by a local pharmacist in Macarthur saying that there was an Australia-wide shortage of one of the older diuretics called amiloride, which is often used these days and is mainly reserved for use in people with renal failure. He didn't know what he was going to do to get supplies for this patient who'd had a renal failure and then had had a renal transplant with very poor renal function.


It's increasingly a problem, and this legislation will go a small way to alleviate it. But it's something that needs further thought, I think, and further exploration because, in Australia, we are really struggling at the moment with some of these drug shortages. Some of the other common drugs that have been in Australia-wide short supply in the last 12 months include an antibiotic called vancomycin, which is used for very severe staphylococcal infections that are resistant to some of the common intravenous antibiotics used in hospital. The shortage of vancomycin is a major problem. Another is metronidazole, or Flagyl, which is used for some of the organisms that can be involved in wound infections that are treated in hospital and for some of the parasitic infections. Another antibiotic called norfloxacin, again, is used for multidrug-resistant staphylococcal infections—

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:16):  For the benefit of anyone who has just tuned in and is listening, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2018 Measures No. 1) Bill 2018 is legislation which provides for mandatory reporting of medicines that might be in short supply or be discontinued. It's a measure that has been brought in because the current way of dealing with matters, which is basically a voluntary reporting system, has proved to be unsatisfactory.

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (16:30):  Tasmania is gripped by a housing availability and affordability crisis. Hobart is the second most unaffordable Australian city in which to rent. It has gone up by 15 per cent in 12 months. Relative to wages, it costs more to rent in Hobart than it does in Melbourne or Brisbane, and that's if you can find somewhere to rent. We've had lines of people desperate to secure a rental, offering over and above the odds. It's not just in the capital city. Things are tight in the regions too. In recent weeks, I've been dealing with a constituent in Westbury who faces being homeless in a week. 


Mel lives in a Meander Valley town, in Westbury, with her elderly mother and their ponies. They've rented their home for 4½ years. They've always paid the rent on time and they've never had an issue. But a couple of months ago, Mel mentioned to the council that their sewerage wasn't working properly. The council inspected and said the septic system was noncompliant and ordered the landlord to fix it. Mel and her mother were then given a notice to vacate on the basis that major works had to be done. Mel said the septic works shouldn't need her to leave her home, and that she and her mother were prepared to put up with the inconvenience. But the landlord, through the property manager, insisted that he wanted them out. Mel has learned that he intends to relet the property and that she need not bother applying. Mel believes the landlord is annoyed at having to pay for a new septic system and that he blames her for the cost. Mel, her elderly mother and their ponies have to be off the property by next Friday. They have sought help from the courts, but the courts have sided with the landlord, who is within his legal rights. 


Mel and her elderly mother have been searching desperately for somewhere to rent in Northern Tasmania but have had no luck. They are both pensioners and currently pay $320 a week in rent, in a regional town. They have found a new place nearby, where rent is $360 a week, which they are adamant they will be able to manage, as they live relatively frugally. They just need assistance with the bond. Anglicare had initially said yes, but now they believe the rent is too high for them and that it puts them well over the line of rental stress—and they're probably right. They will be in rental stress. But what is the alternative? Shooting the ponies? Living under a bridge? This couple, this elderly mother and daughter, will have nowhere to live in a week, unless they are given assistance. Mel can manage the two-weeks rent in advance, and one week's bond, but without Anglicare helping with the three-weeks bond, which she gets back at the end of the lease, she is afraid she will lose this new house. 


Anglicare's management is having an emergency meeting, and I can only hope, with fingers crossed, that it approves the bond payment. I know that they're doing the right thing and that they've got policies to put in place to keep people out of rental stress, but I implore Anglicare to help this couple, who have been trying so hard to find a new place. I have tried in vain to speak to the landlord. When you have stable, long-term tenants who look after a place and cause no trouble, I think it's pretty rank to turf them out, especially when one of them is elderly, if it's your intention to simply let the place out to someone else. But I do accept it's his legal right. 


This one case underscores the depth of the housing availability and affordability crisis sweeping Tasmania, and the federal government has not helped. It has abolished affordability assistance schemes, slashed funding for homelessness and failed to appoint a minister with specific responsibility for housing. The state government in Tasmania is, frankly, floundering. A 20-week wait for public housing has blown out to 72 weeks, after just four years of Liberals in power. Waitlists have grown from 2,400 to 3,500—and that's just for public housing. More than 150,000 Tasmanians are in housing stress, with their rent or mortgage costing more than 30 per cent of their income. It has become the new normal. 


We need to build more houses. We need to focus more on the welfare and health of buyers and renters, and less on investors. Labor has a suite of measures that we plan to introduce if elected to government, and I look forward to seeing them enacted, so we that can get on top this terrible crisis. 


In the few seconds left, I'd just like to add my two cents to the parliament's united response to the disgraceful speech by Senator Anning. That speech may well turn out to be one of the great own goals of politics: in seeking to divide Australians, Senator Anning has forged us closer together. Thank you.

Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (10:00):  The absence of connectivity has a profound effect on social and economic inclusion, and in many parts of the country—indeed, many parts of my electorate—it could literally be a matter of life and death. Across the country, the NBN rollout has been embarrassing. People were told they were going to be connected to this fantastic network by the end of 2016. Now we're hearing that many people won't be connected for years yet. In the electorate of Burt the rollout of the NBN has been pitiful. Residents have been told for the last five years that their NBN is two years away. Now many residents won't be connected until 2021. Given this government's record on NBN, who would know if that connection will be worth the copper it's connected to?


My office received a call last week from a family whose NBN connection has been connected and, like so many through fibre to the node, is highly unreliable. The household is located, like much of my electorate, in a mobile black spot zone. The house is also located in a bushfire-prone area. In the case of a bushfire, these homeowners wouldn't have any method to communicate with the outside world—no home phone, no mobile phone and no internet connection if the power goes out.


In my electorate, the Haynes, Hilbert, Kelmscott, Thornlie and Canning Vale areas all have mobile black spots. With the NBN rollout, we can see that a vast majority of the properties in these areas—indeed, across my entire electorate—are using fibre-to-the-node technology or the service is yet to commence at all. This means that, in the time of a blackout or perhaps a storm, given that these nodes seem to be so prone to filling with water, these residents will have no communication with the outside world at all. These homes will not have the same opportunity as those with medical alarms in times of a power outage, as they can't connect to the mobile phone network, which was intended to act, for most people, as a backup. 


If the NBN rollout had been conducted in accordance with Labor's proposal for fibre-to-the-premises technology, then each household could have been provided with a five-hour buffer in the form of battery backup at the home and, of course, power back at the exchange. Now if the power goes out it affects not only the home but, of course, the node that they are connected to, and it robs them of connectivity. If the Mobile Black Spot Program had been rolled out on a needs basis rather than a 'which Liberal member needs to be re-elected?' basis, then we would possibly have a backup option available to these households. Instead, in times of blackout these families are being left in the dark, left in silence, left isolated from their friends, workplaces and families, and, worse, left in real danger.


The real shame of it is that not only is the Turnbull government delivering an inferior broadband source but, by the time of the next election, most of the people will have already had this inferior service foisted upon them, locking them into services where blackouts will rob them of essential connectivity. The job of addressing mobile black spots is clearly not complete. Work remains to be done here to make sure that these people are protected.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-08-16,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (11:08):  Today, I want to call attention to the crisis unfolding in one of Australia's largest Commonwealth government departments, Centrelink. Centrelink is responsible for delivering some of the most critical services right across the social spectrum. It touches so many lives every week, and, without it, millions of Australians would find themselves destitute.


But over the last few years we have seen deliberate and systematic slashing and gutting of staff and resources to this critical organisation. Calls are going unanswered, applications aren't getting processed and people are waiting for payments to be processed for month after month after month. Then, when people try to sort things out, many of them get turned away from offices, only to be forced to wait indefinitely on hold in call queues and never getting answered. And let's not forget the robo-debt debacle, where 20,000 people were issued with false or incorrect notices.


This is not how we should treat any Australian, let alone vulnerable people facing personal and financial challenges. In electorate offices like mine across the country, we are seeing the fallout from this policy of negligence. Each and every day my staff take calls from desperate constituents trying to do their very best to navigate a system that seems rigged to demoralise and delay. Some say this is evidence of the government's neglect. I would suggest that we're looking at the mark of something far more malignant: a cynical and punitive campaign of a government hell-bent on punishing people who find themselves out of work, caring for somebody with a disability, collecting some family payments or simply ageing—part of the natural process—but wanting to seek an age pension. How else would you explain the Liberals, who have cut about 2,500 permanent jobs from Centrelink in the past two years alone, doubling down in the face of this chronic and worsening underperformance by slashing a further 1,200 Centrelink jobs in the most recent budget. Some members of the government seem to be under the utterly ridiculous delusion that unemployment is a lifestyle choice, that Australians are somehow rorting the system for the pleasure of eking out a poverty-stricken existence of some $40 a day. Indeed, the government seems so intent on creating and responding to its dole bludger myth narrative that it has dispensed with basic humanity.


The government will argue that this is simply a matter of responsible budget savings. I say to Mr Turnbull: how is it that your government can find $80 billion for big business, multinationals and the banks but refuses to allocate adequate resources to do your core responsibilities and instead leave these agencies to fall into decay? That's exactly what's happening. In 2016-17, there were 55 million unanswered calls to Centrelink. That is more than double the 22 million in the previous 12 months. People are waiting six months or longer to have their applications approved and for their living payments to start.


I had a shocking case in my electorate. A 72-year-old woman from Georgetown applied for the age pension back in April. Three months later she contacted my office at her absolute wit's end. She'd heard absolutely nothing about her application; she couldn't get any information. While I was able to escalate her case—and it was eventually approved this month, in August—it shouldn't have to come to this. People should not be reduced to having to contact their federal member of parliament to access basic citizenship entitlements. That's the problem.


A Shorten Labor government, I'm proud to say, will be doing our best to restore the damage being done. We will invest $196 million and add 1,200 new permanent and full-time DHS jobs around this country. Labor will also abolish the Liberals' arbitrary staff cap, strengthening capacity and capability within the Australian Public Service. Labor is working on how it will fix the damage done by this cruel government, which lacks imagination, to deliver basic citizenship entitlements. (Time expired)

The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(1) (a) On average, 2.8 calendar days.


(1) (b) Within 2 working days.


(1) (c) On average, 189 calendar days for an unscheduled review (s48) and 209 calendar days for a review of a reviewable decision (s100).


(2) The NDIA has received a higher than expected volume of requests for plan reviews and internal decision reviews, which has resulted in delays for some participants. 


(3) The NDIA Scheme Actuary does not hold data to this level of granularity, or by electoral division. The NDIA has established a dedicated team to clear any outstanding requests and improve the NDIA business system to streamline the processing of these requests.


(4) If a participant has concerns about their final plan, they can contact their Local Area Coordinator, Early Childhood Early Intervention partner or support coordinator for help understanding what supports have been included and how they can use funding flexibly to meet their needs. If a participant is still not happy with their plan or disagrees with a decision, they can request an internal review of their plan without fear of being penalised.
