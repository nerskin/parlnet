"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report entitled The Second Chamber: enhancing the Main Committee, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. 
Ordered that the report be printed. 
—The report I have just tabled may be seen as the third leg of a trilogy which started with the About time report of the Procedure Committee presented in October 1993. Dr Neal Blewett chaired the inquiry, on which I, too, served, which led to proposals for reform in handling legislation, parliamentary questions and the structure of the sitting program. That report recommended the establishment of the Main Committee to ease pressure on the legislative timetable by allowing largely uncontroversial and unopposed legislation to be debated elsewhere whilst this chamber dealt with the remainder. The House adopted the recommendation in early 1994, although it did not enjoy the support of all members. The Main Committee first met on 8 June of that year.
The second leg of the trilogy was the Time for review report tabled in June 1995, a year after the Main Committee met for the first time. It had demonstrably eased the chamber's legislative burden and had expanded opportunities for debate on other matters, such as papers and committee and delegation reports. This report—The Second Chamber: enhancing the Main Committee—is the third leg of the trilogy. Members will not be surprised or shocked to learn that the Main Committee continues to be a success. 
This report focuses on areas for potential improvement and development. In general, the recommendations relate to recognition of the Main Committee, its operation and the range of business it deals with. The first recommendation is to change the name. The name was chosen to signify that it is a committee of the whole House and, further, in the expectation that it would meet in the place known as the Main Committee room on the first floor. However, the Senate was unusually less accommodating than anticipated, with the outcome that a House of Representatives committee room had to be utilised. There is now confusion between the room where the Main Committee meets and the original Main Committee room. 
During this inquiry members stated a preference for what has become the alternative name, and the committee accordingly recommends that the term `Second Chamber' be formally adopted. The existing location of the Main Committee presents two problems: firstly, public access is inhibited because it is an enclave, isolated from other areas open to the public; and, secondly, its remoteness from this chamber exacerbates the effect of divisions on Main Committee proceedings.
The second recommendation is to examine the feasibility of relocating the Second Chamber to a position nearer the chamber and more accessible to the public on the ground floor adjacent to the House. One of the most striking features of the Main Committee is the way in which it has grown from modest beginnings. As a parallel legislative stream, it has successively and successfully taken on a bigger role in the work of the House and increasingly exhibits a character of its own. Many members who participate in the Main Committee approve of its different atmosphere and relative informality, which is no doubt facilitated by its smaller size.
The Procedure Committee believes that the culture of the Second Chamber can be enhanced in a number of ways: firstly, by making debate in the Second Chamber more interactive; and, secondly, by increasing flexibility in the scheduling and conducting of Second Chamber proceedings. The whips should be allowed greater freedom to tailor the periods for statements and adjournment debate to meet varying demands on the time available. Thirdly, the culture can be enhanced to give private members a greater stake in the Second Chamber by allocating, unless the demands of government business are overriding at any one time, a set period each sitting week for the consideration of private members business. I have a vested interest in the new provision for debating time for private members' bills. 
A set speech seems rather stilted in the intimate confines of the Main Committee. This chamber is a good venue for members to develop the skill of speaking extempore. There is a strong case that can be made for greater interaction between members who are in the Main Committee. The practice followed in the British House of Commons allows members to intervene, if the member speaking is willing to give way, and ask brief questions seeking elucidation of points not adequately argued or fully understood. The result can be authentic debate—an outcome not always achieved in this place. The committee therefore recommends that interventions be allowed in the Second Chamber for a trial period. The success of the trial would depend on the goodwill of members and the procedure, if not abused, could be considered for wider adoption. 
I wish to thank our chairman, the member for Sturt, who is unable to be with us today, for his leadership and good humour. I wish to acknowledge the members of the committee for their ideas, participation, forbearance and tolerance. Last but not least, thanks go to the hardworking committee secretariat comprising Robyn Webber, John Craig and Anna Gadzinski. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2000-08-14,"—It is my pleasure to follow the member for Chifley and to endorse the totality of his remarks. The three significant recommendations of the report involve the change of name to the Second Chamber but also, more particularly—moving away from the cosmetic recommendations—the idea of the introduction of interventions in a spirit of experimentation. The report recommends that the Main Committee ought to be a centre of experimentation in procedure and that it provide us with an opportunity to trial, test and innovate with a degree of freedom which we may not feel here in this chamber.
Certainly, a longstanding concern of mine and, I know, of many members is the extent to which Westminster can become a very heavily stage-managed series of fora. Coming into this place at times, it seems that the actual architecture, the geography of the chamber, is not necessarily conducive to really spirited debate and exchange of ideas. The word `parliament' itself comes from the French `parler', but the idea of speaking and of a discussion or dialogue taking place often does not materialise in practice—even down to the technology of the place and the fact that one of the recommendations of the report is that we ought to be able to sit wherever we like in the Second Chamber. One of my frustrations is that each time I walk in the door I am required by the technology, in order for you to be able to recognise me and for me to be heard on this microphone, to sit behind the nameplate `R. Cameron'—when it may be that on a particular measure or bill I would rather sit with the opposition but the assumption of the rigidities of the technology requires me to sit with the government on every occasion. I am, 99 times out of 100, delighted to sit with the government and almost invariably prefer to be here than on the other side but, as a matter of principle, I object to the idea that it is a rigid assumption of the place that I must sit in my place on every occasion. I think it adds to the rigidity and to the calcification of debate.
It is interesting that this cavernous chamber, which is beautifully capacious and accommodating, is in contradistinction to Churchill's recommendation after the House of Commons was bombed during the Second World War. He gave a speech setting out the principles upon which the chamber should be rebuilt, and one of the things he recommended was that it ought to be too small for the number of members it had to accommodate. His point was that, for a sense of atmosphere, you wanted to cram the members in so that there would be this exchange of ideas and of argument—whereas more often than not we wander into this place and find just a vast empty cavern. One can give speech after speech after speech and wonder whether the words completely disappear into the ether without recognition by anyone. So it is pleasing that the little band of absolutely dedicated parliamentary news network listeners out there occasionally ring up and give one a response to a speech: it is quite encouraging. 
But we have to remember that the parliament is in competition with, in particular, the media on the question of who will set the public policy agenda in this country. There is competition which takes place, and we constantly have to demonstrate our relevance to ordinary Australians. They have to look at what we are doing and feel some identification with it. So, when it comes to this question of should we experiment or not, my view is that we do not have a choice: we have to rehabilitate politics, rehabilitate the parliament and inject it with freshness, vitality, spontaneity and genuine debate and dialogue. On that basis I heartily commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Gerick, Jane, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I am pleased to join with my colleagues in recommending our report to the House. It is a good report, named The Second Chamber: enhancing the Main Committee. As a relatively new member, I felt that it was great to find a place that is slightly less intimidating than this. As my colleague has just said, quite often this House is quite empty when you speak and you do get a feeling that perhaps you chat to yourself at times; and so in the Main Committee there is a better environment and a more friendly and encouraging one.
The recommendations which we have made will increase the number of opportunities given to members to speak and also increase the status of the Main Committee, something which has been an issue for some members. On the whole I believe that, if the recommendations made by our committee are implemented by the government, they will enhance the level of debate in the Main Committee and will improve the efficiency of the whole House.
With regard to the individual recommendations, I would like to endorse the first recommendation that the Main Committee be renamed the Second Chamber. I believe that this title would better reflect the nature and importance of the work of the Main Committee. I also support the second recommendation, which would place the Main Committee adjacent to this chamber and make it accessible to the public. I think that this move would further reinforce and confirm the significant role that the committee plays in the work of the parliament.
I would like to strongly endorse the principles behind recommendation No. 3, which would give members the opportunity to ask a member who is speaking to give way, an initiative that has worked well in the House of Commons. There can be no doubt that the Standing Committee on Procedure is correct in its view that the tendency for members to give set-piece speeches inhibits interaction—it in fact stifles it. The implementation of this recommendation would not, of course, prevent members giving set-piece speeches if they wished to do so. However, the knowledge that their speech might be interrupted with a question would encourage members to ensure that their speeches were of the highest quality. Implementation of this recommendation would also encourage members to listen more carefully to the arguments being put forward by the member speaking, because they would be looking forward to an opportunity to question or challenge those views. I am not concerned that speakers will have the right to refuse to give way. I am sure that most members would not want the reputation of being someone who refused to give way, and so they would do so whenever it was appropriate. Overall, I believe that the implementation of recommendation No. 3 will provide an opportunity to greatly improve the quality of debate in the Main Committee.
I endorse recommendation No. 4. This introduces the capacity for flexibility in the management of the work of the committee that would improve both the quality and efficiency of our work. We all know that we live in a world where change seems to be the only thing that is constant. Implementation of recommendation No. 4 would facilitate a move from the more formal, rigid structures currently in place to structures based on convention and agreement. It is essential that the structures that we develop to enable us to carry out our work are structures which enable us to respond quickly to the changes that take place both inside and outside parliament. In order to achieve this, these structures must be as simple as possible and as flexible as possible. The changes proposed in recommendation No. 4 would simplify the structures governing the work of the Main Committee and make them more flexible. This flexibility would improve the committee's capacity to respond effectively to the changes that affect our work both now and into the future. 
The move towards giving the chair more freedom to manage proceedings in the committee should ensure that the focus of the committee's work is determined by the importance of the issues to be debated and the needs of the committee rather than by standing orders. This move should therefore enhance both the speed at which the committee processes its work and the effectiveness resulting from it doing so.
I believe that the acceptance and implementation of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Procedure will significantly improve the work and effectiveness of the Main Committee. It is inevitable that such an improvement will result in enhancing the efficiency with which this House conducts its business, and its good name. I would like to thank the secretariat staff and recognise the great work they do in assisting and progressing the work of the committee. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2000-08-14,"—I will try to add something a little different in speaking to the report entitled The Second Chamber: enhancing the Main Committee. When I was first elected to parliament, I found this thing called the Main Committee. On inquiring about its form and function, I was told, `Oh, that's where all the boring or non-controversial stuff goes.' When I first went to find it, I learned the difference between the Main Committee and the Main Committee room—and trying to find out the difference was a lot of fun. Hence, there is a very valid reason for the first recommendation—that is, that the Main Committee be known as the Second Chamber. Hopefully that will now eliminate the confusion that still exists in the minds of visitors and members like me.
Having found the Main Committee's location, and as one who seems to speak regularly both there and in the chamber, I soon learned about the value of the Whip's staff in keeping things going while I sprinted from one chamber to the other—hence, the second recommendation that the two chambers be more closely located. The second function of the co-location would be to allow the public to also see that we are being quite efficient in the way we deal with the enormous loads of bills that pass through the House. This would also grant more places for the public to get in and actually see the workings of parliament—and I hope that we can encourage more school students to sit in the audience as well.
There has been a culture in the Main Committee, perhaps because of its smaller size or its seeming invisibility, of interactivity in debate. Because of its special nature, it may be that intervention and spontaneity in debate could be encouraged as an experiment in the Main Committee prior to trialling it in the House. Whilst this would not be looked on as an opportunity to denigrate into public point scoring and disruption of the Main Committee's work, it might provide a good opportunity for obtaining clarification and resolution of issues far more quickly than appears to be the case now.
Recommendation No. 4 of this report is designed to ensure flexibility of operation of the Main Committee and to provide that the Whips' staff continue to have the primary role in organising the business of the Main Committee—and so they should. Should any sudden disorder occur in the Main Committee, our report suggests that the chair should have the ability, with or without a motion or notice, to be able to suspend or adjourn sitting and report that fact back to the House. Having been privileged to be part of the Speaker's Panel in chairing that Main Committee, I do not think it will ever be necessary, but it would be nice to know that we can do it.
The sixth recommendation looks at the convention of government members sitting to the right of the chair and others elsewhere. To ease the formality and to promote participation and interactivity, we recommend that members be encouraged to sit where and with whom they choose—something, Mr Speaker, you know that I have been very fond of trying to trial even in the main chamber here. I believe that we could have more dignity and perhaps a little bit more respect for each other if, before opening our mouths, we looked at who we were sitting next to and then perhaps we would think better of it. 
The seventh recommendation looks at improving the facilities of the Main Committee. Some are for the benefit of public viewing, such as improved camera angles, glass panelling and the like. The others are for the provision of better facilities for the ancillary staff. The final recommendation is to allow for more time to be given for private members business. Although the main work of the Main Committee is still to be government business, there could also be room for more consideration of reports by the Main Committee.
I too would like to thank the chairman, the member for Sturt, and the secretariat and my fellow colleagues. We have had a lot of humour in the committee, but we have also had a lot of very serious discussion, and I think the recommendations prove that. Therefore, I commend the report to the House.

That this House acknowledges the dangers of the marketisation of education in Australia and its potential to normalise inequality for families in rural Australia, for families with disabled children, for families with children with behavioural difficulties and for families of children in depressed socio-economic areas.
Despite personal experience, very few people—parents, politicians, professionals or academics—are particularly well informed about education and, in the context of the Australian education debate, it shows. Far too often in the last 25 years education in Australia has been diminished by the implementation of past well-intended but foolish recommendations as well as the current malevolence of the Howard government in its deliberate creation of a single market in education. Until the 1960s both public and private schools functioned very well alongside each other in this country. At that time private schools operated without government funds, although there was tax deductibility for private schools in the mid-1950s.  
A strong private school campaign in the 1960s resulted in the allocation of money to private and public schools for libraries and science blocks. This expenditure, which improved facilities in private schools, did not damage the public system; but, more importantly, the existing diversity within and between each system was preserved. Since the mid-1970s, Australia developed an education system where publicly funded private schools coexisted with public schools. However, central to that understanding was that public education was a public good and there existed a clear divide between public and private education. But the undervalued diversity of the public system was about to be broken down. 
During the mid-1970s, a watershed educational report called the Karmel report was published. In general terms it was very well accepted as making a positive contribution to the education debate. Although well intended, the report had two major failings which have yet to be rectified. One was the failure to recognise the importance of resources to primary schools—hence the current unsatisfactory debate on literacy and numeracy. However, the more relevant one as far as this debate is concerned was the elimination of diversity that existed in the structures of public secondary education and which was strongly supported by parents. 
The diversity of public secondary schools, which was a strength—for example, high schools, technical schools, girls schools, boys schools, area schools, agricultural high schools, specialist schools and so on—was essentially abolished in favour of the single comprehensive secondary school. Big mistake. Many parents rejected the sameness, the conformity and the weakness of having but one type of secondary school. Why would anyone be surprised? Diversity was replaced with sameness. The strength of several varieties of schools was replaced with the weakness of one kind of school. Innovation from diversity was replaced with the maintenance of the status quo of sameness. Far too many public secondary schools went to sleep, and parents made their choices accordingly. The creation of essentially a single market in public secondary education did not work. That this fact is still not recognised by government, academics and education bureaucrats beggars belief. But that elimination of diversity is expanding with the blurring now of the public-private divide. This government believes in blurring the distinction between public and private schools. Its central strategy has been the establishment of an education quasi-market, according to Associate Professor Alan Reid. This government believes that one of the impediments to the operation of an education market is the existence of both public and so-called private education systems. 
What is overlooked is that in the past there was very limited competition within the private school system and very little or no competition within the public system. That type of historical division—diversity, more accurately—has served this country very well indeed. But the current government policy is to create a single market, a single system where all schools, public or private, compete for custom. That means that any consolidated education system, public or private, is in danger. To help the move to a single market the government sought to facilitate movement away from the public system to the so-called private system with a strategy of enrolment benchmark adjustment. Kim Beazley will thankfully abolish that iniquitous scheme. Some people respond to the proposition of a single market by saying, `So what? Won't competition in the education market make for greater efficiency?' But schooling is not a simply described product that can be crudely measured. It is not a tube of toothpaste, a cake of soap, a loaf of bread, an automobile or the latest fashion accessory. If the logic of marketisation of this government was followed, all government schools would be abolished, as a dollar spent in a private school could be argued as being more cost-effective. 
The language of the single market is just plain wrong. Devolution may well help successful schools; it does absolutely nothing for unsuccessful schools. Choice in its raw form means segregation, not freedom. Choice means according to the ability of parents to pay. That is the only choice. It has nothing to do with freedom. Schools do not operate under similar circumstances. Private schools select students. Public schools cannot. Schools that cater for location, socioeconomic disadvantage and intellectual, physical and behavioural disabilities require affirmative action, not a single market. A single market in education means the abandonment of rural children, and people in the country know it. It means the abandonment of children in financial disadvantage, and the people know it. And it means the abandonment of non-mainstream disabled children, and their parents know it.
A single market in education is anti-democratic. The supporters of a single market argue for the freedom of maximum choice. But what is meant by the freedom of maximum choice? It means setting citizens and their children into competition with each other so that there are winners and there are losers. That is what it means. And we know who the losers are meant to be: the poor, the rural and the disabled. Freedom of maximum choice means the normalisation of inequality. I would have thought that the dangerous ramifications of this policy to a democratic state like Australia would be obvious. But apparently not to this government. The marketisation of education values education only in financial terms. The intrinsic values of education—love of literature and the arts, love of mathematics and science, understanding of the environment, participation in the expressive arts for their own sake, respect for law and order and respect for the rights of others; things which enrich our lives—are simply ignored.
This government does not appear to understand that encouraging competition between inadequately resourced schools will simply result in alienation, resentment and anger. While markets have an obvious important role in our economic system, the rules of the market are simply insufficient for the government of a society. This is a government which preaches that it is for Australians but practises something quite different. Education is supposedly being marketised to increase efficiency, management expertise and freedom of choice. What is actually happening is a deliberate reduction in education expenditure and the devolution of responsibility to the schools themselves, to reduce political fallout on politicians. That some narrow-minded and narrow-sighted professional people within the education departments and the schools themselves support marketisation and devolution certainly muddies the water, but it does not make it right. These are essentially the same people who support the dismantling of policies to rectify social and locational disadvantage as well. These are the very same people in educational administration who are not averse to refusing to make available information which might be used by political critics. These are the very same people who support the gagging of public comment from principals and teachers. Welcome to the modern Australian democracy!
That private schools get assistance from the federal government is not argued. That exclusive private schools—those who charge twice the public cost of tuition—receive assistance is simply criminal. To argue that these parents pay taxes too is the height of financial arrogance. They pay taxes for lots of things, public transport to name one. Do they expect subsidies for private transport and chauffeur driven vehicles? If private single market purposes are allowed to be determinants of education, democratic purposes in this country will seriously be compromised and cannot be delivered. In an environment where marketisation dominates, the following questions should be asked. Who will undertake the full educational task? Who will accept the social commitment to ensure good quality education is available to all, regardless of capacity, status, ability or where they live? Who will refuse to accept the normalisation of inequality? Three questions, three answers: Labor, Labor, Labor. How this government could support the weakening of national cohesion and do it deliberately, is, quite frankly, beyond my comprehension. (Time expired)

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2000-08-14,"—The comments from the member for Port Adelaide would not be out of place in a first-year political science essay assignment from a Young Labor member. In this debate here today we are talking about the future of the education system in Australia. We heard some sloganeering from the member opposite on the marketisation of education. He attacked those who support marketisation and devolution. They are two different things. As for marketisation, it is a slogan that he himself appears to have developed. He spoke about people who have a love of literature, a love of the arts, a love of mathematics and a love of science, and yet he is a member of a party which, when it was in government, managed to come up with a school system in which one-third of school students could not read or write properly. He should come back down from the planet Mars. He needs to speak about the provision of basic education, and he needs to be fair dinkum about that. It is pointless speaking in the rarefied atmosphere of some junior university debate, where your navel is about as far as you look, when there are real problems out there in the education system which need to be addressed.
—Address them, then! Why don't you address them?
—I do not think that the member opposite addressed it at all when they had one-third of Australian school students unable to read and write properly. At the same time as we had that devastating statistic, what was the opposition doing? In fact, the Leader of the Opposition was, at that time, education minister. What was he doing with those Australian Council for Educational Research reports that were telling him about the serious state of literacy and numeracy in Australia at that time? He was sitting on them. He did not release them to the public. He did not let parents know about the serious state of the education system or the incredible degradation that he had brought about in the education system.
The member for Port Adelaide is defending that ridiculous state of affairs. He is coming up with all of this hot air and saying, `Oh, if only we had some kind of reduction in marketisation—blah, blah—then the whole situation would be better.' Get a grip on yourself. There is a heck of a lot more that can be done—look at apprenticeships, look at university statistics, look at statistics in TAFE, look at statistics in education spending, look at the impact on the working class. Look at these things and you see a much better circumstance in education today than when the party of the member opposite was in power. As for what we have seen from the opposition lately in terms of an education policy, that only threatens to drag us back down to those horrible depths in literacy and all of those other sorts of problems.
I have spoken about literacy many times. Let me flesh that out a little bit. When Labor was in government we had a difficult problem. Since the coalition came to power we have seen the introduction of a national literacy plan. It is an appropriate plan, and there is a commitment to literacy standards, which we did not see from Labor when they were in government.
We have heard many times from the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs about how the Labor Party is shackled to the education unions—and they have an agenda, and we hear it again and again from them. It was the thinking that was back there in the eighties, when people in those education unions were really trying to convince people that if you actually tested people, if you actually assessed to see whether they were actually doing any good in schooling—whether they had literacy standards, whether they could add up, whether they could do the tasks that had been set of them—that would be a waste of time, we need not do that, what we could do is just put the money in and we could be assured that the standards would result. Well, parents and the community in general across Australia know now the fallacy of that argument. They strongly support the notion of testing, and the government remains strongly committed to the notion of testing, because it is the only way to be absolutely sure that standards do not fall apart. 
I have to say that just recently I attended a public forum in the town of Gatton, in the electorate of Blair. It was very well organised by the Blair women's council of the Liberal Party. They organised it, and they invited everyone from the local community to come and have a say about the future of education and various other related issues. One of the things—and this is another indictment of the Labor Party—is the number of teenagers out there who are suffering the consequences of that incredible literacy void that the Labor Party thrust upon them. Illiteracy, unfortunately, is the start of a very vicious cycle that can lead young people into disrupting school classes, into being expelled, into turning to drugs and into turning to crime. What you wind up with is not a productive member of society but basically a young thug, a criminal, whose only fault in the first place was that they fell short in literacy, probably way back in primary school. But they were carried on in the Labor Party conveyor belt, through the education system, until they got pushed off the end. This is a pathetic state of affairs, one that the education minister at the time—the now Leader of the Opposition—preferred to shut his eyes to, preferred to take the reports that were warning him of that disaster and stuff them somewhere in the bottom drawer of his desk.
Let us look at a few other issues that are out there. Since this government got in we have addressed some of the basic and most difficult problems in literacy. Let us take the scaffolding program that was introduced. Anyone who has had any contact at all with indigenous communities would know the incredibly bad state of affairs when it comes to literacy and numeracy in those communities. The opposition did not do anything about it. In fact, they did not address one of the other basic problems—that of attendance—that you have in indigenous communities. You have got pathetic attendance figures. I visited a school in the Northern Territory that was set up to cater for 300 students, and there were 300 students of school age in that community. How many were attending school every day? Thirty. And it was a different 30 every day. That was back in the early nineties—an incredibly frustrating and unacceptable situation.
The coalition introduced the scaffolding program. It has gone in. It is in one school. It may be extended into more, but I take the example of one class. This is a year 6-7 class. With the intensive work that is provided under that program this class was taken from a basic preschool level of reading to a year 4-5 reading level in one year. That is only one example, but that just shows you how much hard work has got to go into the problem of literacy in some of these communities; and this government is the one that is prepared to address that. Given the example of the member for Port Adelaide, who spoke just before me, what the opposition over there want to talk about is a whole lot of bumph, a whole lot of teenage wailing, about big long words that I really do not think they understand.
I go to the question of universities. Under the Labor Party thousands were in effect locked out of universities, because the Labor Party would not fund above their set targets. Overseas students under the Labor Party were given access to places that were denied to Australians. The fact is that today university enrolments are now at the highest level ever. There are 42,000 more people in university thanks to this government. The same sorts of things were occurring in TAFE. Under the Labor Party 100,000 young people were basically locked out of TAFE. The fact is that 70 per cent of young people do not go on to university. They do not spend their time thinking about words like `marketisation' and `devolution'; they spend their time thinking about a vocational opportunity for them—a future, a career, a way of life.
Under the Labor Party—in fact, in 1995—there were only 26,500 secondary students getting any vocational training in school. Today, under the coalition, 167,000 are involved in vocational training. That includes the introduction of school based apprenticeships, an innovation that came from this government. It is incredibly rich for the member for Port Adelaide to stand up and represent problems in education in the fallacious way that he did. There are tremendous difficulties in education, but it does not come down to some kind of sloganeering about whether or not there is marketisation. 
In my closing remarks I would like to address this business about spending on education. Labor has claimed that there is a drop in the proportion of GDP being spent on education. That is not true. Austudy was transferred out of the education portfolio in 1998-99, and as a result there is a constant funding of education by this government in terms of GDP and a real increase in real terms. That is what is important. (Time expired)

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I have received a letter from the General Manager of the Smithfield RSL, Mr Gordon Stevens, objecting on behalf of the club's 13,000 members to the increase in beer prices following the introduction of the GST. The Howard government has completely misled the community about the price impact of the new tax system on draught beer. We all remember the election campaign in 1998, when the Prime Minister promised that there would be only a small rise of around 1.9 per cent in the price of draught beer. The Prime Minister told only half the truth, because this was obviously another non-core promise. Why has a middy of beer increased in price between seven and nine per cent? Why is draught beer different to cans or stubbies? Why has this Prime Minister placed an extra tax burden on Australians who enjoy a glass of beer? This is the question that the 13,000 members of Smithfield RSL want answered by Prime Minister Howard. Once again the government has been found to be hypocritical in promising one thing and doing another. Smithfield RSL is one of many clubs in my electorate of Prospect and, believe me, the members of these clubs all feel indignant about the blatant increase in the price of draught beer. This government needs to remember that these people are all voters who will remember this broken promise at the next election. They will have their say on election day.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that, in the Cubillo-Gunner decision delivered in the Federal Court last Friday, Justice O'Loughlin found:
At common law anything said or done in the House of Representatives is protected by absolute privilege ... and that prohibits the raising in a court of anything done or said in the Commonwealth Parliament. 
In light of this reaffirmation that there has never been a credible legal impediment to a proper apology from this parliament to the stolen generations for the hurt and trauma they have suffered, will the Prime Minister now allow this parliament to join the state parliaments in discharging its duty to offer such an apology? ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Aboriginals: Stolen Generations</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2000-08-14,"—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. It is true that the judgment of the Federal Court delivered by Justice O'Loughlin last Friday was a very important judgment and it is one that repays very careful study. I do not dispute that contained in that judgment was the excerpt read by the Leader of the Opposition. I accept on this occasion that he has quoted it accurately. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the principal basis on which I have argued a formal national apology in the terms constantly sought by the Leader of the Opposition is not appropriate is that it is not appropriate in my view and it is a view shared throughout the government that current generations should apologise for the deeds of earlier generations over which they had no control and which were in fact sanctioned by the law prevailing at the time.
It is important as we try to analyse in a sensitive fashion the judgment made by the court. I followed the case carefully. Although it was clearly the verdict of the court that in the case of Mr Gunner he was removed with the consent of his mother and in the case of Mrs Cubillo there was no evidence that she had been removed in circumstances that breached the statutory duty of the relevant government official, I think there is a clear acceptance by everybody that they are practices that current generations would never embrace and current generations would be critical of. It remains the view of the government that the most appropriate thing now to do is to focus on the future and to focus on bringing those members of the indigenous community of Australia who were subject to these practices back in contact with their families. That is why the government has strongly supported the $63 million program, recommended by the Wilson committee, that is designed to provide a link between the affected people and their families and is designed to do a number of other things. 
While we are on the subject of what was contained in the court judgment, I might remind the Leader of the Opposition—I think it is relevant to the debate that has gone on—of an excerpt from His Honour's judgment that has not been covered in any of the media reports thus far. Amongst the other things that His Honour found was this statement:
The court found that the applicants failed to produce evidence that would substantiate a finding that there was a sweeping general policy of removal and detention. 
He goes on to say:
There was no widespread practice of forcibly removing part Aboriginal children from their mothers. The court was satisfied that the number of part Aboriginal children living in the Territory far exceeded the capacity of the institutions to receive them and the patrol officers to remove them.
It remains the case that the government is sensitive to the ongoing trauma felt. That ongoing trauma was specifically acknowledged in the resolution of regret which passed through this parliament last year. It is my view and the government's view that that resolution of regret, fully supported by the Labor Party, was an appropriate expression of the current generation and the current parliament's views about those past practices. It is overwhelmingly the government's view that we should help these people get on with their lives in the future. The most effective way of doing that is to implement the recommendations that are embraced in that $63 million program.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I move: 
That a Standing Committee on Legal Affairs and Ethics be appointed to inquire into whether to permit human surrogacy in Australia and, if so:
(1)	under what terms and conditions surrogacy should be legalised; and
(2)	the legal, ethical, moral and religious framework by which legal agreements could be drawn up to allow human surrogacy to take place giving maximum legal safeguards to all people involved.
I thank other members of the House for participating in this debate. I have moved for the establishment of a committee to inquire into human surrogacy because I believe it is an issue that needs to be debated. It is an issue about the technological advances of the 21st century. It is also an issue about the sensitive, emotive and humanitarian issue of parenthood.  
I am sure there are many people who have an opinion about surrogacy. I am not sure those opinions are always based on accurate information or on a full consideration of all the legal, ethical, moral and religious issues involved. But I do know that there are many devoted young couples who would make ideal parents and who cannot have their own children. They fall outside the IVF guidelines, so are outside our current legislation. It is for the sake of those young couples, perhaps only a very small number in our society, that I wish to see this issue explored. 
I do not think anyone disagrees with the view that, in an ideal society, a family should be composed of mother, father and children. I want to talk about a young couple who have those natural aspirations of becoming parents. Philippa and Peter Hudson are in the chamber today. They are a vibrant, happy and devoted couple, married for six years and have just moved into a new home in Dungog, New South Wales. Philippa is an outstanding person. She was school captain at Dungog High School and an involved sports person in horse sports, water sports and a representative netball player. She trained as a teacher and she loves her work. She continues to work as a tutor. 
But three weeks before she and Peter were to be married, a tragic accident meant that she will spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair, paralysed from the chest down. But being the brave and devoted couple they are, Peter and Philippa married 12 months later. Peter or Tiger—I had better call him Tiger; otherwise the people back in Dungog will not know who I am talking about—is Philippa's carer, her soul mate and her life partner. All they want is what any young couple their age wants—they want to have their own family, and those children would come into a loving, secure home environment. Philippa and Tiger can provide the genetic material for their own child, but Philippa cannot bear that child. So they began investigating the possibility of surrogacy. No doubt they could find a willing and generous partner for their family planning, but they do not want to enter a potential legal minefield of extended court procedures and the possibility of losing that child that they consider theirs. 
Are members of this House aware that at common law the mother of a child is the woman who bears the child and her husband the legal father? In all Australian jurisdictions there is legislation that states that, where donor gametes—that is ova and sperm—are used to create a pregnancy, the donors are not the legal parents. In New South Wales where Peter and Philippa live, the Status of Children Act 1986 states that there is an irrefutable presumption that the husband of the birth mother and not the semen donor is the father of the child, provided the husband consents to his wife being artificially inseminated. 
Of course, Peter and Philippa could go to other countries, enter a legal agreement with a surrogate mother and return to Australia with their child. The child's birth certificate would show them as the parents of the child and Australia would accept it. But this is expensive and would take them away from their home, where they would be getting ready for a new baby, from their loved ones and from their family. Those of us who have children know all the procedures that we go through at that stage of our lives. As Philippa said to me, `I would want to be in close contact with the surrogate mother as the foetus developed, experiencing the growth, the changes and the birth, because that is part of parenthood.'
I know this is not an easy issue for parliament to debate. All too often we avoid the controversial and complex issues. And this is complex. The May 2000 update of obstetrics and gynaecology summarises the laws of each state with respect to surrogacy, and let me quote from it:
Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory have actively legislated to ban surrogacy contracts.
In Victoria, the Infertility Treatment Act 1995 contains a broad definition of `surrogacy arrangement' but the act makes surrogacy arrangements `void and unenforceable'. In Queensland, the Surrogate Parenthood Act of 1988 makes it `an offence for a person to publish an advertisement or a document' and further down, it says: 
All surrogacy arrangements made in Queensland are void and cannot be enforced by a court.
Go to South Australia and we have a similar pattern; go to Tasmania and there is a similar pattern. Even in the Australian Capital Territory, where I understand there is a clinic that will support surrogacy, surrogacy agreements are void, pursuant to provisions in the Substitute Parent Agreements Act 1994.
This is the legal minefield that I spoke of. This is the problem that confronts any young couple such as Peter and Philippa, who want to be parents, who had always the natural expectation to be parents, who are biologically capable of being parents but who, through a sad twist of fate, cannot be parents while the legal framework in place in Australia continues to exist. I mentioned that Peter and Philippa could go overseas. Are members aware that Californian clinics advertise their services in Australia and that for a fee of between $50,000 and $100,000 Australian couples can legally have their child in the United States?
We have the usual disagreements between states and territories and the federal law, too. I have already mentioned the common law recognition of parenthood. Are members of this parliament prepared to support the point of view that Peter and Philippa should enter into a surrogacy arrangement that is not enforceable? They could do that in any state in Australia where it would not be enforceable and then, at the end of the 40-week gestation period, they could be dragged into court and lose their child. I cannot think of anything more devastating. Sensibly, they will not enter into any agreement unless the legislation clears the way so that they are confident of the outcome of the pregnancy that they would be involved in with another person. I was talking with an IVF practitioner who advised me that, although the clinic where he operates have the technology to participate in surrogacy, they will not. They will not do it because they are severely afraid that, at the end of a pregnancy, they could be in conflict and could be involved in a very expensive legal procedure, and it is not worth their while. They certainly do not have the insurance to cover themselves for that.
All I am asking is that the issue of human surrogacy be fully investigated by a committee of this parliament and that it determine the conditions under which it should be permitted. Australia should have a policy that comes to terms with the ethical and legal questions raised by the technology of the 21st century. Young couples like Philippa and Peter Hudson who are currently denied parenthood want to take advantage of this technology but, more importantly, they want us as the legislators of the country to listen to their needs.

"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,2000-08-14,"—I was going to make some comments about other issues today, particularly in relation to the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act and the attitude of the Labor Party in relation to a conscience vote. But, to be duly considerate to my friend and colleague's constituents who are here today, I am not going to pursue that course.
There are a couple of issues that I would take up with the honourable member for Paterson in relation to this matter. The first is that, were this parliament to look at this issue—and I will in due course be pleading the case that it is inappropriate to do so—I would think that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee would be the appropriate vehicle for that. Our parliamentary colleagues the member for Menzies and the member for Gellibrand would, as the chair and deputy chair, in my view appropriately deal with such a matter and therefore there would not be any need to take it off to another committee. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs would in my view be the appropriate committee to take this matter up—if indeed it were appropriate for them to so do.
I do not believe it is a matter that this parliament can legitimately take up. I believe that there is no constitutional power for us to deal with these surrogacy matters. That view has been endorsed elsewhere. I quote from Helen Szoke's paper `Regulation of Assisted Reproductive Technology—the State of Play in Australia' in a book entitled Controversies in Health Law edited by Freckleton and Petersen: 
Even in the ACT where altruistic surrogacy is enabled, there is no legislative provision to allow the child to become the legal child of the commissioning parents, except through the adoption process. In the case of a surrogacy arrangement that is not organised within a family, the adoption process becomes more difficult and complicated. The Commonwealth government lacks clear constitutional power to legislate on the issue of surrogacy.
Indeed, that was acknowledged some time ago, I believe, by the fact that the states and the state health ministers and social welfare ministers met in 1991 in relation to this matter and acted on the advice of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council's National Reproductive Technology Working Group, which was established in 1990 and is, I understand, still going. There was a meeting in Adelaide in 1991 where the state ministers agreed to set up some uniform state laws in relation to surrogacy. Basically, the outcome of that meeting with the state ministers was that surrogacy arrangements should be made illegal and void and that commercial surrogacy and advertising in connection with surrogacy should be prohibited, along with professional and technical services in relation to surrogacy. So the underlying legislation in the states that have introduced legislation to adopt what was a desire for uniform laws has been very clearly to oppose the question of legitimising surrogacy.
The other difficulty that the member for Paterson has in relation to this whole question is the Family Court's view. In the case of Re Evelyn, the court very clearly said that it was going to be bound by the principle that underlines the Family Law Act—that is, that the welfare of the children is of paramount concern. So, indeed, the Family Court has looked at some of the legislative requirements in some of the states and what they have meant. But ultimately it has decided that, as far as the Family Court is concerned—and this was endorsed by the full court, which endorsed the trial judge's approach—the paramount consideration remains the best interests of the child. So, indeed, that court overrode some of those matters that were contained in some of those pieces of state legislation.
The difficulty I think is that you have state legislation that is not uniform. Indeed, the honourable member's state is one of those that have not implemented uniform legislation. I would encourage and urge New South Wales to do so in line with that 1991 agreement. I would accept the principle that there are difficulties surrounding the fact that there is not uniform state legislation. Indeed, I would have thought that the reproductive technology working group should be meeting to investigate the matter further and either decide that there should be uniform legislation amongst all the states and territories in line with the decision in 1991 or, if they want to review it, to do so. But the difficulty that we have is that, because these are health matters, I do not think the Commonwealth has any constitutional power to become involved with them. I think that was acknowledged back in 1991 where it was the state and territory ministers who adopted the attitude that they would need to implement some uniform legislation. So in that respect, I think the member for Paterson's case fails, unfairly or otherwise, because of the lack of that power and it needs to be taken up in another domain.
Western Australia, New South Wales and the Northern Territory are the states and territories that have not implemented legislation. I acknowledge that those states that have implemented legislation seek to outlaw the commercial aspects of surrogacy. There is the basic principle that underpins those states with their legislation, but there are some differences as to whether immediate parties to a commercial surrogacy arrangement should be penalised and there are also differences in relation to the treatment of non-commercial or what are called `altruistic arrangements'. My understanding is—and I will take the lead from the honourable member for Paterson with his head movements as to whether or not I am right—that, indeed, altruistic surrogacy is specifically allowed under the ACT legislation— 
—It is not enforceable.
—I have the appropriate nod—but in the other jurisdictions it is not. Obviously these are very difficult issues. My wife Kate and I—and I am sure she would not mind me saying this—were one of those fortunate couples who had no difficulty in starting a family. We were very fortunate in having that occur on three occasions. But I absolutely and emphatically accept that the constituents that the member for Paterson represents and who are here today, and indeed friends of ours, have not had the ease that Kate and I had.
But the question of surrogacy—and I think the member for Paterson said it himself—is a potential legal minefield. In some respects, even if you had the uniformity of laws that the state and territory ministers wanted to implement in 1991, you still have the overriding view of the Family Court, where most of these matters will ultimately end up, that, irrespective of the legal arrangements that have been put in place, the Family Court has an overarching view that the child or children are the paramount concern of the court, which will indeed determine what happens in relation to the question of custody. I can imagine a situation where you might have the tightest surrogacy laws in the world but ultimately, as was the case with the Re Evelyn case in the Family Court both with the trial judge at the first hearing and then with the full bench at the second, the court will determine what is in the best interests of the children.
So I do not support this motion. I do very much accept the issues raised on a personal basis by the member for Paterson on behalf of his constituents. But I think this is a matter that needs to go back to the reproductive technology working group for some consideration. That group can either endorse the views of the state and territory ministers in relation to matters that are fundamentally their responsibility—and not a Commonwealth responsibility for constitutional reasons—and implement uniform legislation or, if that working group wants to review the 1991 decision and come back to the state and territory ministers, that would be an appropriate course as well.",REPS,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Proposed Standing Committee on Legal Affairs and Ethics</title>,Business,6,1,speech
"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I just want to take the opportunity to speak on this motion because I think it is important that we do not close our eyes to these complex issues. Unfortunately, the previous speaker seems to want to rely on a small segment of our community to make decisions for all of us. In these very complex areas, I think it is important that the whole community have a say, that we have a full debate and that everyone have a chance to make a contribution. It is all very well to refer it back to working groups. Most of the deliberations of those groups are not made public and are not known by the wider community. I think it is also important to put it in the context of the fact that, when the question has been broadly asked, over 50 per cent of the community have indicated that they are not opposed to surrogacy. They clearly want to see certain constraints placed on it, but they are not opposed to the sorts of aspirations that Peter and Phillippa have. Nonetheless, I recognise that we would need to have a much more wide-ranging debate. 
I also acknowledge that these are matters that in the past have been the province of state governments. I was the Premier of Western Australia in 1991 when the proposal that there be uniform legislation was put forward. But if we are capable of getting that uniform legislation in areas, for instance, like the quality of products that are sold in the community and regulations surrounding trade, then surely we are capable of getting it about these very important issues. In our society, infertility is seen as a problem which merits treatment and assistance; it is not something that governments turn their back on. For some, surrogate motherhood is the only hope they have of raising a child that is genetically related to at least one of the potential parents—and in the case we have heard about, probably both of them.
As I am sure members would be aware, surrogacy occurs when a woman agrees to become pregnant and bear a child for another person or persons to whom custody will be transferred after birth. Demand often comes from women and their partners when the woman is physically incapable of pregnancy for a number of reasons. As we have heard in the present case, it could be as a result of an accident, or it could be because of a hysterectomy, a history of spontaneous abortions or a dangerous medical condition, such as kidney disease. 
Surrogacy is rare. We are not talking here about wholesale involvement of the community, but just a very few instances. There is, however, likely to be some small increase in demand for two reasons: one, rising infertility in our community, and that is another problem altogether; and, two, a decline in the number of children who are available for adoption. Many families I am sure would be happy to take on other children but do not have the opportunity to do so. It has been estimated in one study that, between 1977 and 1987, about 40 surrogate births occurred. We simply do not know how many arrangements are being entered into at the moment.
It might seem unnecessary to have another inquiry, but I think it is time for a full, open debate on this. There have been 10 committees of inquiry in Australia into surrogacy and related reproductive technologies. All but one, I think it is fair to say, expressed grave reservations about the practice or recommended that it be prohibited or curtailed. 
The legislation that does exist, but not in all jurisdictions, contains certain similar features. For instance, all of them prevent advertising, something I am sure we would all recommend. They by and large render surrogate arrangements unenforceable; in other words, the surrogate mother cannot be required to relinquish. They apply when a woman is already pregnant and an agreement is entered into. Most importantly, they distinguish between altruistic and commercial surrogacy, and I am sure that is the one element we would all want to see retained, no matter the outcome of any deliberations. But not all states have the legislation, the definitions are confusing—for instance, what is commercial surrogacy?—and the degree of prohibition varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. I think there is a need for uniformity. All Australians should be treated in the same way.
However, like many, I would call for caution, and an inquiry can apply that. We need to recognise the pain of infertility at the beginning, we need to understand the possible psychological consequences for the surrogate mother and for the child as well, and we need to recognise the severe ethical dilemmas that surround these decisions. Some would argue that surrogacy is something that should be prohibited altogether. Others say there are certain circumstances in which it should be allowed. Others worry about the fact that it is commercialised effectively, compartmentalising the mother. We do not know how these arrangements would affect the child. Nonetheless, I think we are a mature enough society to debate these issues openly and to come to a set of conclusions which mean that all Australians are treated equally so that people who might aspire to surrogacy well understand the position they are in, instead of the confusing uncertainty they face at the moment. Peter and Philippa are very brave to have put their case before the Australian people, and I hope the government will listen to them and consider it carefully.

"Forrest, John, MP",NP,2000-08-14,"—This is a very significant debate we are having here and I appreciate the opportunity to make a contribution. My heart goes out to Peter and Philippa, and I pass those remarks on to them through the member for Paterson. As a matter of fact, I look on the member for Paterson in a new light because of his foresight in bringing such an important debate into the chamber. He is right: this debate is fraught with complex legal, ethical, moral and religious complexities. 
My only concern is that society in general has not kept up with the new pace of technological advance that modern medicine has provided. There is nothing new about surrogacy. It has been around since biblical times. Anyone who is a scholar of the good book, the Bible, would know that. My observation from reading biblical history is that, when such arrangements were entered into, they usually ended in some form of historical disaster as people made challenges for legal rights. I think that is where this issue is so sensitive, as the member for Paterson has quite rightly pointed out. There have been so many inquiries in regard to this matter—not just within Australia but in Great Britain and the United States—that I really wonder what a new inquiry would achieve. 
The reason the debate is fraught with such complex issues is that we are dealing with some very fundamental human nature issues. The emotional contact between parents and children is a rich bond that is formed. The reason my heart goes out to Peter and Philippa is that, like the member for Ballarat, I am fortunate to be a parent myself. I believe we need a proper, ordered and well-mannered society, and I have the old-fashioned view that a stable family centred on good parenting is the most significant contribution any of us can make to that peaceful society. We could debate whether or not that is happening when we look around our community today. There are some parents, like Philippa and Peter, who are anxious to make sure that they can have an opportunity to participate in that way.
There has been a lot of debate about the ethics of surrogacy, particularly the arrangements which introduce a commercial nature. I think given the inherent conservatism of the Australian community, this is the issue that bothers us the most. Sadly, people use the disadvantage of others for their own commercial gain, but that is the nature of the world we are in. 
There are concerns about the effects such arrangements have on birth mothers themselves. Those long nine months of gestation and the resulting emotional attachments can create a difficulty for her when releasing the child on to the non-fertile mother. As well as that, there is the trauma of labour and the bonds that are created with that first contact. I was fortunate to be at the birth of my second child. It all happened so fast the first time that I was not there for that, but it is a very special moment in a person's emotional position, especially in regard to the bond with children. This is why it is so complex. Notwithstanding the heartfelt desire of Peter and Philippa, I think it is important that the community does not go too fast too quick on this issue. We should hasten slowly and not make the mistakes that I have seen occur in the United States. 
I read a very interesting article on the matter by Tony James in the Australian Doctor of 30 April last year. He said that the practice of surrogacy remains rare in Australia because of social, legal, and ethical concerns. It is not the technical barriers—Australia leads the world now in in-vitro fertilisation—but the conservative nature of the Australian community that is holding us back. I do not see the need for a referral to a committee on this matter.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I rise today to speak about the circumstances of one of my constituents, Mr Joze Kosorok, who received lifesaving heart surgery at Liverpool Hospital earlier this year. It was a rewarding pleasure to assist Mr Kosorok in his quest to receive the adequate and quality care that he deserves through the public hospital system. However, his story is not without its major obstacles. Mr Kosorok's story is just one of the many stories of frustration and anguish that many people are now experiencing when dealing with the current public health system, which this government has allowed to fall into disarray.
Mr Kosorok of 15 Shannon Avenue, Merrylands, came to Australia in 1951. He is a skilled migrant, who worked full time until he was 65 as a shopfitter and carpenter. During his working life he paid health insurance. This was until the Whitlam Labor government introduced Medibank, which later became Medicare under the Hawke government. Mr Kosorok believed a levy out of his wages would provide quality and universal health care, as Medicare was designed to provide and did provide for many years because of proper management and nurturing by the Hawke-Keating Labor governments. However, Medicare and the whole idea of a quality public health care system in Australia had one main enemy: the Liberal Party of Australia. Mr Kosorok's story proves that after four years of a coalition government led by Prime Minister Howard—a man who has made it his ambition to destroy Medicare—public health care in Australia has now turned into a farce. Now the Prime Minister's life ambition of destroying Medicare is almost complete.
Mr Kosorok wrote to me on 8 June 2000 informing me that he was suffering from coronary heart disease and that he would have to undergo surgery. He had undergone heart surgery previously in 1988 and since then had been on medication for his heart. He expected the treatment to be as smooth and hassle free as the last time he went to hospital for surgery in 1988 at Westmead, when Australia at that stage had a quality public health system and, needless to say, a Labor government.
His story reads as follows—and I relate it with his permission. On 27 February 2000 he was admitted to Fairfield Hospital with severe chest pain and was told that he needed surgery. He was given an admission date to Liverpool Hospital of 15 May 2000. While he was aware of the risks of the operation not succeeding, he had confidence in the public health system. This confidence came from past experiences that he had with that health system. Mr Kosorok was told in pre-admission clinic on 11 May 2000 that his heart operation was postponed because there were no beds in intensive care available until 7 June 2000. This really means that there were no beds available to those people who rely on public health. 
Although surprised and very unhappy with this decision, Mr Kosorok accepted the hospital's decision without too much fuss and was given medication. He soldiered on but to no avail. Mr Kosorok, feeling dizzier by the day and short of breath and weak, collapsed in church due to heart problems and was immediately admitted to Emergency in Liverpool Hospital on 28 May. He was now in serious need of medical assistance. Here was a pensioner with a history of heart problems who had recently been told that he would need urgent surgery, was on medication, had had his initial surgery postponed and had now collapsed. Surely this man has a right to at least the basics of a reliable public health system.
But this was only the beginning of his problems. Still in hospital, on 31 May 2000 he was told to go to pre-admission clinic for tests and instructions in preparation for his open-heart surgery. Now thinking that he was on the road to his health being somewhat restored, Mr Kosorok went to pre-admission only to be told that he was not expected and that the operation would not be held until later in the year. At this news Mr Kosorok was understandably distressed and agitated at not receiving the proper treatment that he thought he was entitled to, while it was obvious that those who could afford private health insurance could easily receive the same operation without any complications. Mr Kosorok was discharged from hospital later that day, even though the hospital knew he had collapsed the last time that he had to wait for surgery. He was now told he was due for his surgery on 7 June 2000.
D-day, 7 June, arrived and Mr Kosorok was driven to Liverpool Hospital by his family and admitted. Finally he thought his operation would be completed and his pain would soon ease. After being admitted to the hospital, he was showered and shaven. He was in the waiting room when a nurse appeared with his file and said, excitedly, `Mr Kosorok, you are going home!' Mr Kosorok, still not having received surgery, could not share her excitement. `There are no beds in intensive care because three people have been shot this morning,' she said. This came as a very bitter disappointment to Mr Kosorok, who needed a bed in intensive care for his operation. Once again he was discharged, given medication and told that he needed surgery at a later date.
Feeling very dejected and depressed at this stage and in fear of another collapse and indeed his life, Mr Kosorok then contacted me on 8 June seeking my help. I immediately got in contact with Ian Southwell, CEO of the South Western Sydney Area Health Service at Liverpool, for an explanation. Mr Kosorok received a phone call then from Dr French to come to Liverpool Hospital for admission on 14 June. Mr Kosorok was eventually operated on on 14 June and has now fully recovered, I am pleased to say. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Dr French, who performed the operation, for his professionalism and understanding of Mr Kosorok's situation. This is just one person's story of dealing with the public health system under the Howard government. It reads like a hard luck story of the American health system, but it is an everyday reality for many people, especially low income earners and pensioners. This government has smashed our public health care system into relative oblivion. Now it resembles only a skeleton of its former self.
Upon coming to office the Howard government cut over $800 million from the public hospital system, then increased patient charges under the PBS by $500 million and abolished the Commonwealth Dental Scheme—a scheme which provided quality and affordable dental care for pensioners and low income earners. The Howard government has completely removed access to dental care and has forced many pensioners and lower income earners to stretch their incomes to the absolute maximum in order to take out private health insurance. 
I believe that every Australian should have a basic right to a high quality, universal, well-managed and well-administered public health system which does not discriminate between those who are wealthy and those who are poor. We in the Labor Party are not against private health insurance, unlike the government members who are completely and ideologically opposed to any notion of public health. We believe in a fair balance between the two. People should not be excluded or given the run around in our public hospitals because they have not taken out health insurance. Private health insurance should always be an optional extra for those who can afford it—that is the Australian way of health care. Under the Howard government private health insurance is becoming a necessity while the public health system is deliberately being starved of funds. Many people are having experiences similar to that of Mr Kosorok. I say that there is an alternative and that there is an easier and fairer way. 
Medicare is being deliberately starved of funds by this government. It is plain for all to see that this coalition government has run away from its responsibilities to provide a quality and accessible health care system. The Labor Party is proud of establishing a public health care system. A Labor government will unashamedly make it a priority to rebuild and strengthen the Medicare system. I condemn this government for neglecting its responsibility to provide and maintain a quality public health system. 
Again, I commend and congratulate the people with whom I got in contact. They very sympathetically understood and appreciated the problems my constituent was having. More importantly, he has now recovered from his operation and has the peace of mind of knowing that he has a few years left free of pain and is able to enjoy life, get around and walk freely without collapsing and shortness of breath. 
Circumstances like the one I have recounted should not occur in Australia; we should have the facilities—our wonderful medical staff certainly have the expertise—to attend to everyone that comes through the clinics for that type of service. People should not be told: `We haven't got intensive care beds. You need an intensive care bed for a day or two; therefore we cannot put this operation on.' 
To have a man of this age being sent home a number of times I believe is a disgrace. More importantly, it is a disgrace that other people around Australia will suffer because of the lack of facilities to administer a proper health care system—brought about by the lack of funding by the Commonwealth to the states. Surely, the Commonwealth government understands and appreciates the concerns being expressed by so many people in so many different cases. It should take more positive action and ensure that the money goes to the states so that a proper health system can be administered fairly and made available—not to those who have the money to purchase it but to those who have the need for care. Again, I condemn the government for its actions of slashing and burning and taking money from what should be every Australian's right—a good health care system in this nation.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Health: Public System</title>,Grievance Debate,7,1,speech
"Sercombe, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, on the draft Financial Services Reform Bill.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—This report that the committee has tabled today is a result of its inquiry into the draft Financial Services Reform Bill. This particular bill is the sixth stage in the implementation of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program. The bill seeks to legislate a number of recommendations of the financial services inquiry, perhaps better known to members of the House as the Wallis report. The draft bill proposes a new regulatory framework for financial services. The bill covers a wide range of financial products, including securities, derivatives, general and life insurance, superannuation deposit accounts and non-cash payment. The regime will apply to the activities of existing financial intermediaries such as insurance agents and brokers, securities advisers and dealers and futures brokers, as well as any other person carrying on financial services business.
The report that has just been tabled includes a majority report, substantially supported by government members of the committee, and a minority report prepared by the Labor members of the committee. There is some difference of emphasis in the conclusions that the members of the committee reached. The government members have concluded that there is general support for the broad thrust of the draft bill and they go on, having identified a number of significant points or comments that have been made in the very extensive submissions the committee received, to make the point that Treasury has assured the committee that all of these concerns will be taken into account in the final bill and would include drafting changes to ensure that the bill as it comes before parliament expresses the policy intent.
The opposition report has a slightly different emphasis. It indicates general support for the principles encapsulated in the bill; however, the opposition view is that there can be no recommendation with respect to the bill and the final form in which it should be passed until that final form is in fact known. The government members seem to have a charming and delightful confidence in Treasury's capacity to adequately encapsulate the very basic comments that have been made about a number of aspects of the bill that are causing concern in a wide variety of areas. 
Because of the limitations on time, I do not propose to go into any detail at all on those matters, except just to illustrate the fairly fundamental nature of some of the concerns that have been raised—concerns about adverse effects of the draft bill on financial services in rural and regional areas; concerns about the impact of the bill on e-commerce and the information economy in Australia; concerns about Australia's capacity to grow as an international financial centre; concerns about impacts on financial services for small business; concerns about the adequacy of regulation for professional bodies, such as accountants and solicitors; and, of course, concerns about the adequacy of consumer protection. These are no small matters. As I said, I suspect the extent of those concerns in a practical sense and the adequacy of possible amendments that will come forward to address them will add considerable weight to the opposition view that, really, we ought to be waiting for the final form of the bill to come before the House prior to recommending, as the majority does, the acceptance of this bill as the basis for proceeding.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Securities Committee</title>,Committees,12,1,speech

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I will continue my speech on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 with some interesting facts that emerge when we study higher education funding under this government. I have learned through examining a number of Bills Digests that in the year 2001 the real level of the Commonwealth's contribution to operating grants will be about the same as it was in 1983; in terms of operating grants for planned equivalent full-time student units the Commonwealth contribution will have declined by 37 per cent between 1983 and the year 2001; and Commonwealth grants, net of HECS, should drop below 50 per cent of university revenue in the current triennium. This will be similar to the proportion that existed before the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for the funding of tertiary education in 1974. We would agree, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, that this is a massive step backwards. The Prime Minister, as we all know, wants us to return to the golden era and live in the 1950s. Dr Kemp it seems is a little more modern; he only wants us to live in the 1970s. Unfortunately, we have to live in the 21st century and this slash and burn attitude to education funding is not, and cannot be, the way to go.
Last year the government moved to an accrual system of accounting for its budget. This change allowed the department and the minister to do some very dodgy things with the education budget. Do you realise that there is now no differentiation in the budget between higher and vocational education? We cannot tell from the budget how much is being spent on each. As a result of this combination of higher and vocational education into one output group the budget no longer contains any useful data on the sector as a whole. 
There are many problems with our tertiary education system. Student to staff ratios have increased by 33 per cent over the last 10 years. The dropout rate has increased, and the issues of equity and access have never been fully addressed. What is the minister's answer to all of this? His answer seems to be to cut funding and make the students pay. This, of course, will have no chance of addressing the problems and will in fact create more.
Another concern about the changes to the funding arrangements of higher education institutions is the roll-in of capital grants into operating grants. There is now no delineation between the two; they have been lumped in together. Universities, faced with increased running costs and trying to provide for the students' needs, are increasingly using that capital grant component as general operating funding. It has been stated in previous Bills Digests that recurrent funding pressures have resulted in some infrastructure neglect. This would be an understatement. Universities are letting their infrastructure responsibilities slide as a direct result of this government's policies.
I would like to speak about another problem within the system that directly affects the funding issue, and that is the issue known as `credentialism'. Once upon a time you could get a job with only a primary school education. Then you needed to at least have finished third year at high school, your intermediate certificate. Of course, you know as well as I do that should somebody front up for a job interview with just the school certificate there is little chance that they would get a position. The higher school certificate, year 12, used to be enough. Not any more. Now, sadly, just a degree is increasingly becoming worth less and less. Postgraduate work of some kind is becoming necessary for those seeking a professional career. Postgraduate work, of course, attracts higher fees for students and less government funding. Society is changing rapidly and credentialism—the need for more and more bits of paper to prove you can do the job—is becoming a major concern, particularly for those from lower socioeconomic areas who cannot afford the increased costs of obtaining the required certificates and diplomas.
The minister proudly points to increased revenue streams from outside sources to fund the tertiary system. By 2002, HECS receipts will have increased by 113 per cent since the government came to power in 1996; that is, from $500 million in 1996 to an estimated $1.135 million in 2002. This increase has given the government the excuse to cut its own contribution, the publicly funded component, by some 12 per cent; that is, from $5,218 million in 1996 to $4,589 million in 2002—a paltry amount by comparison. No skiting about alternative revenue streams on behalf of the minister can hide the fact that the government has cut its own contribution. More and more we are moving to the bad old days where you can get a look in only if you have the cash to do so. If this situation continues and the minister has his way, universities will once again be a place for only the privileged few. The minister is abrogating his responsibility for one of the basic tenets of our democracy; that is, a properly funded public education system.
Universities are crying out for funding. They are struggling to maintain services. Indeed many services are being cut as a result of this change in funding arrangements, while departments are disappearing from some campuses. Clearly the increased revenue streams are not leading to a stronger system, as the minister would have us believe. Why? Because, as the government find another revenue stream—usually by upping the fees paid by students—they are correspondingly cutting their own contribution. Think how strong the system would be if the Commonwealth maintained its share of the funding alongside other increases in revenue. Since the Liberals came to government in 1996, every single university has suffered cuts in Commonwealth funding. None of the 38 universities in Australia has escaped the knife.
In my own region of Western Sydney the University of Western Sydney has lost $39 million in grants from the Commonwealth. This is the sixth highest cut of all the universities in Australia. As you would know, the University of Western Sydney is a relatively new institution. It does not boast the long history or tradition of the sandstone universities, such as the universities of Sydney and Melbourne. I am sure that one day it will boast a long and proud tradition, but at present it is fairly new. Because it is new, it is suffering from these cuts more than most. The university does not have the investments or the bank balances that the older sandstone universities can claim. It does not have the reserves that could be drawn upon in times of reduced funding that the sandstone universities have and therefore suffers more than these universities when the cuts are made. 
What cannot continue in this sector is the increasing reliance on the student to foot the bill for higher education. University fees and charges will have almost doubled to $2 billion in the period between 1996, when this government came to power, and 2002—an amazing increase where the students have to find the money to support themselves. At the same time the Commonwealth will decrease the amount spent on students from $10,204 per student in 1996 to a mere $8,949 in 2002. This represents a fall of 12.4 per cent. When the Labor Party came to power in the early seventies Australia had barely 270,000 students in tertiary education and spent 1.4 per cent of GDP. Under John Howard and Dr Kemp there are now almost 800,000 students in tertiary study, yet the percentage of GDP has dropped to less than 0.8 per cent. As Simon Marginson of the Australian stated on 9 May this year:
Undergraduate classes are at record levels. Library acquisitions are frozen. The efficiency drivers are so strong there is a serious danger of dumbing down through competitive price cutting. Education quality is in crisis.
There are more students, all paying more money. However, couple that with government cuts and you have not a stronger system but a weaker one where the quality is suffering, where subjects and whole departments are disappearing and where class sizes are becoming unmanageable. It is simply not good enough.
For the first time in the history of this country, investment in research and development has fallen. This has happened both at a Commonwealth level—falling from 0.77 per cent of GDP when this administration took the treasury bench to a paltry 0.64 per cent of GDP last year—and in the private sector with the reduction of the tax concession. This government is simply not investing in our future. It is trying to make the short-term dollar on the stock market merry-go-round without any apparent thought for the decades to come. That is why the Labor Party and the shadow minister, Michael Lee, will be putting in place a number of initiatives to boost the investment the Commonwealth makes in this vital area.
When we come to power after the next election Labor will be doubling the number of research fellowships available to Australian academics. We will be creating a new system of elite fellowships to slow the brain drain overseas and even, hopefully, to attract some of our scientists back to the country. Labor will also be introducing a new system of education priority zones where funding can be better targeted to disadvantaged areas. We will be abolishing the despicable enrolment benchmark adjustment scheme that has cost our government schools enormous amounts of money.
In short, Labor will be doing their best to reverse the losses this sector has suffered since the Howard government came to office. We must reverse the losses or face irreparable damage to our education system and our nation's future. The government—in fact all governments—have a responsibility to provide a decent and strong public education system from primary school through to tertiary level. This government's attitude of forcing students to pay higher and higher fees while at the same time cutting their own contribution is a clear demonstration of their total lack of respect for the Australian people and their institutions.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2000-08-14,"—The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 amends the Higher Education Funding Act. This act, of course, is for funding Australian universities. The intention of this amendment is to vary the maximum funding levels for 1999, 2000 and 2001, taking into account, as alluded to in the concluding remarks from the member for Greenway, the revised Higher Education Contribution Scheme estimates, supplementation for price movements and the reallocation of unspent funds.  
The member for Greenway is a very decent man. He has my admiration because he is out of what I call the traditional mould of a representative of the Australian Labor Party. But the paradox which is contained in what the member for Greenway actually said is that, when we came to government in 1996, only 10 per cent of university students came from the bottom 25 per cent of income earning households in Australia. In contrast, 40 per cent came from the top 25 per cent of income earning households, with an average income at that time of just over $81,000 a year. In other words, the taxes of everyday working men and women in Australia were funding the education of people who actually came from much more affluent backgrounds and funding the universities that working men and women would never see the inside of, or at least that their children would never see. It is worth teasing out some of the issues and actually having a look at who is the beneficiary of the education for which people pay with their higher education contribution, introduced, of course, by a Labor government.
This bill will also give effect to some measures announced in the 2000-01 budget, and what I want to focus on are the 100 new medical places a year for students on bonded scholarships as part of the government's country health package. The funding will provide an additional 100 new medical places each year, beginning in 2001, for students who hold these bonded scholarships. The scholarships commit the student to practising for at least six years in rural Australia after the completion of postgraduate training. After five years, an additional 500 medical students, who will eventually practise in rural areas, will be studying in Australian universities. This is part of a broader component of the $770 million committed in the budget over four years to increasing access to health and aged care services in rural and regional Australia. It will also include increasing by 50—from 400 to 450—the number of places that are available in postgraduate training for those medical graduates who want to be family doctors or general practitioners. 
Within two years of the budget this year, over half of those who are undertaking training to be general practitioners will do their training in rural areas, and that has got to be in everybody's interest. The scholarships which this bill gives effect to—there will be some complementary legislation that will deal with this in the health sector—are worth $20,000 a year and will be offered to new medical students each year in return for a commitment to practise in rural and regional areas for at least six years after completing postgraduate training. The number of medical school places will be increased cumulatively by 100, and the initiative is worth $32.4 million over four years. The students who accept these scholarships will be issued with a restricted Medicare provider number—a number which doctors need in order to practise and attract a Medicare benefit for their services—for the six-year period. They will only be eligible to charge for and receive a rebate for medical services in urban areas after they have met their obligations.
One of the other points that ought to be made is that the budget also introduced a capacity for medical graduates to spend time practising in a rural area and defray their HECS repayment. I often said to the previous government, and I have said to my colleagues in this government: `People go down and work in coalmines for all kinds of reasons and people go to work in Middle Eastern countries to practise medicine because, if the incentives are strong enough, people will do whatever needs to be done—alternatively, if there are penalties attached to it.' One of the important measures introduced in the budget this year was to give medical students, having graduated, the opportunity to work off their HECS, so to speak, by working in a rural area, with about 20 per cent of that HECS to be defrayed for each year of service. That is something I have long supported.
I noticed in Australian Doctor—a news magazine for medical practitioners—of 2 June that GP registrars have vowed to campaign in high schools and universities against the Commonwealth bonded rural scholarship scheme due to concerns over its use of geographic Medicare provider numbers. That refers to the fact that you can practise medicine, but within a defined area. The GP Registrars Association has described the scheme as `horrific' because doctors enrolled in it who fail to fulfil their commitments will be denied another unrestricted Medicare provider number for 12 years. That really does reflect a degree of petulance which is out of step with community expectation. The fact is that, if there are students or prospective students in medicine who can subsequently give a lifetime of commitment to the community, providing medical services, especially where they are needed, then they should be able to take up a bonded scholarship. A scholarship that bonds them in return for giving them money whilst they are doing their training and which ties them to a particular area—by definition, an area of need—has surely got to be in the community's interest, apart from anything else. 
In the course of talking about rural doctors and the bonded scholarship program, I would like to give the House and those people who are perhaps listening to this debate an insight into what it is like to be a rural doctor. Over the years, I have done some locum relief for doctors working in rural areas. I have found myself up and out of bed at about 6 o'clock in the morning, doing home visits from about 7 a.m. and practising all day. If you do have a lunch break you spend it at the hospital seeing patients. You get home at 9 o'clock at night and as soon as you get home the phone is ringing and people are banging on the door wanting to see you. You finally get to bed at about 11.30. Every second night you are out of bed at least once, generally looking for a red letterbox or something on the side of the road some 50 kilometres from where you are actually living. These were my experiences. I even had to get out of bed at one stage to put a drip in a cow which had hypocalcaemia. I said to the farmer as I was doing this, `Is this what Dr Chow'—the fellow for whom I was doing the locum—`would normally do?' He said, `Oh yes' And I said, `Isn't this the sort of thing a vet ought to be doing?' and he said, `It's much cheaper to get the doctor.' Sadly, there is truth in that.
There is a remarkable woman and medical practitioner called Dr Leanne Rowe who now runs Clockwork in Geelong. That is a very innovative program to give access to medical services to adolescents who are on the margins. In an earlier life, she and her husband, Peter, were medical practitioners at Bannockburn in rural Victoria. She wrote to me when she was leaving Bannockburn to tell me her story. She said, `If you can ever share this with other people, could you please do so.' This is from Dr Leanne Rowe:
My experience of rural Victoria as a medical student, was overshadowed by a heated argument between the GP and his wife. She was “sacrificing her life in this hole of a place” and she stormed out to visit her children at boarding school in Melbourne. I was also relieved to return to Melbourne to see my friends who told more stories of loneliness and the horrors of the country. One of the students was sickened when she visited a farm, where she witnessed the castration of lambs—made much worse by the fact that the farmers used their teeth! We both ended up in practices in rural areas, not because of our experiences as medical students—in spite of them.
As a member of the Victorian Health Minister's Committee on the Medical Workforce, a female doctor, a doctor's spouse, and having lived in the country for the last thirteen years, I would like to discuss the realities of current strategies for overcoming the maldistribution of general practitioners, and possible solutions.
The problems have been discussed many times, and include professional isolation, continuing education, the availability of locum services, and male and female spouse issues. There are many issues deterring female GPs from staying in the country, and this is important as over 50% of medical graduates are female. The current strategies to help overcome the shortage of rural GPs include medical student recruitment from the country, extra points for FMP rotations in the country, rural health training, rural incentives and locum programs ... and better practice grants (rewarding rural GPs better).
These strategies have done much to improve the status of rural GPs, and although they may not have had time to work, there is a feeling that more needs to be done to address the shortage of doctors in the country.
In the real world, many GPs do not trust the short term government initiatives and incentives, which have been implemented at the same time as cut-backs and closures of country hospitals. FMP trainees are not guaranteed for all terms, a rural locum program is difficult to access for a well planned medical course, let alone for an emergency illness ...
The things that are really difficult about staying in the country are your enmeshment within the community, the professional and moral obligation to be on call all the time, the burn-out and the isolation. It's having to keep your composure when you feel cold and nauseated, and you are called at midnight for someone who has had a headache all week (and you know you will have an argument about Pethidine). It's being ignored in the street by someone you have reported for child abuse. It's remaining professional when your own child is victimised at school by one of your patients. It's being called out to a cardiac arrest in the middle of a lunch with friends who you haven't seen for a year. It's being reminded at the kindergarten that your husband missed a mother's delivery because you had the gall to take one weekend off. It's answering a knock at your door at 2am to a tearful teenage boy who requests the morning-after pill for his girlfriend, as the condom broke twenty minutes ago (“and her father will kill him”). It's listening to your own baby screaming for a breastfeed while you are resuscitating a choking child who has been rushed to your home by his parents. It's having your supermarket shopping prolonged by a patient who asks for your advice about his haemorrhoids. It's taking your children on a long awaited outing and stopping at a motor car accident, where instead they are entertained by fire engines, police, ambulances and a helicopter, unsupervised in the back of your car. It's unbandaging your neighbour's hand at your kitchen table at 11pm, and finding that he amputated his finger when he fell off the haystack that morning (“Well, who else was going to milk the cows?”). It's having a well known teenage boy die in your arms in front of his mother, due to an accident on the mainstreet, and having to counsel a community's grief when you feel you can't contain your own. 
It takes time to be accepted in a rural community. It is worse if you are female or from a non English speaking background. Narrow attitudes are perhaps not more common in the country, but much closer to the surface—you hear about them. Enmeshment in the community can be stifling—the impact of making a mistake has both personal and professional ramifications. Female doctors with children will know that in the country “good mothers don't work” and child care is not only unavailable, but socially unacceptable. Being away from your extended family is difficult, particularly when they answer your requests for help with “well, you chose to go to the country.”
It may be that we will never find the solution to the problems for female doctors, doctor spouses and those associated with children's education. Perhaps replenishment rather than retention of GPs is the answer to the crisis in the country. However, there are some other solutions to consider ...
The move by the government to introduce bonded scholarships for medical students who go on to train to be doctors is long overdue and ought to be welcomed not only by all members of the parliament but by more thoughtful and informed members of the medical community. That small insight into what it means to be a rural doctor, as provided by Dr Leanne Rowe, provides some understanding of why it is so important not just to get doctors into country areas but to see that embedded in their own culture as they go through medical training is the understanding that they will be practising in a rural area, that they are spending 12 years training to be in that rural area, that the community and society recognise the importance of that by providing a bonded scholarship and that ultimately that scholarship will be repaid in terms of years of service.
In the remaining time, I will turn back to the broader issues of education. I could not help but notice that the Leader of the Opposition has indicated that an essential part of the federal Labor Party's campaign and re-election strategy is to develop a knowledge nation—something which I am sure would be supported by all members of the House. I could also not help but notice that the first step taken towards building a knowledge nation was to see that Mr Barry Jones stepped down as President of the Labor Party, which seemed inconsistent. Mr Jones, apart from his many strong and endearing qualities, has to be one of the most knowledgable and educated Australians I think any of us have ever had the pleasure of meeting. One would have thought that the Labor Party would have enjoyed seeing him continue in that role.
The second thing I noticed was that the shadow minister for education, the member for Dobell, has not been included on the committee which opposition members have put together to develop the knowledge nation. I think it was Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States of America and co-author of the Declaration of Independence, who described education as the defence of the nation. I would have thought that having your prospective education minister on the knowledge nation policy formulation committee would have been important. 
The third observation I made after having heard this announcement of a knowledge nation was that the Australian Education Union called on teachers last week to boycott literacy benchmark testing in Western Australian primary schools. Yet at the federal Australian Labor Party conference in Hobart it was said that literacy and numeracy were critical for the knowledge nation. In other words, the early indications of the Australian Labor Party building a knowledge nation are, shall we say, not encouraging.
A number of claims were made by the Leader of the Opposition at the Labor Party conference. I noticed he said, `The Labor Party has always understood the challenge of education in this society.' The current Leader of the Opposition was at one stage the education minister and he appears to have had limited success in that regard. When there was a change of government in 1996, 30 per cent of Australian children were not able to read or write. Worse still, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for education he gave in to pressure from the unions to continue to suppress the results of the longitudinal youth surveys which revealed the huge literacy problems among 14-year-olds in year 9 and their close link to, among other things, youth unemployment.
One other thing I would like to draw the attention of the House to is the Leader of the Opposition's attempt to evoke some societal divisions by describing trade unionists as people who `don't spend their Saturday mornings reading the weekend Financial Review over a caffelatte on the cafe strip'. Instead, according to the Leader of the Opposition, they are out organising little athletics and t-ball games. The implication is that those who are caffelatte drinkers or who drink a bit of coffee are those who do not engage themselves in children's sport—as if these sorts of things, as the Sydney Morning Herald said, are mutually exclusive and in many ways are the heart and soul of the nation.
The Leader of the Opposition in trying to build a knowledge nation dismisses Barry Jones as President of the Labor Party, does not lift a finger to support literacy and numeracy benchmark testing and then goes on to describe with derision people who pursue intellectual pursuits. How can you build a knowledge nation on that basis? It is also a criticism of everything he says he so passionately supports. How can you deride on the one hand learning, knowledge and education and then on the other say you are going to build an education nation and you are going to be an education Prime Minister?
I have said this so many times, but I have to say it again. The other thing Labor members need to realise is they cannot have it both ways. You cannot have fully funded public education, health, social services and a whole range of things on the one hand and then deny and obstruct everything that goes on in this parliament brought on by the government to improve efficiency, productivity and generally support wealth creation which ultimately finances it. That includes, amongst other things, the tax reforms which commenced on 1 July.
Sitting suspended from 6.27 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—As has been noted by other speakers in this debate, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 and the second reading amendment moved by the member for Dobell deal broadly with the question of education funding. Specifically, the bill does the following: it indexes all aspects of higher education funding; it includes for the first time funding in the forward estimates for the year 2002; it makes a number of technical changes in the Higher Education Contribution Scheme; it implements the budget announcement to introduce a system of bonded medical scholarships; and it provides $4 million per annum for the Research Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities Scheme. In doing so, it implements the budget changes to higher education. As detailed in the second reading amendment moved by the member for Dobell and in his speech on the second reading, assessing this bill cannot be divorced from assessing the performance of this government as a whole in the area of education, and particularly higher education.
In making that assessment I want to concentrate on two key questions: specifically, the question of access to higher education and the question of equity. It is an important day on which to be considering the question of access to higher education. As members would recall from question time today and hopefully from reading the newspapers this morning, the Sydney Morning Herald contained a report dealing with the question of universities lowering their entry standards—as the headline put it—`for cashed-up students'. It is important that the details of what is happening in our universities actually go on the record in this place. The article records the following: 
Students with the money to pay fees in advance will be able to gain entry to a wide range of NSW university courses next year, including elite degrees, with significantly lower marks than other students.
Some of the courses will allow them to have a universities admission index (UAI) five points lower than those of other students. 
The institutions with full-fee courses—the University of NSW, University of Sydney, Australian Catholic University and Charles Sturt University at Bathurst—will offer 211 [such places] next year, an increase of 23 per cent. The fees range from $7,000 to $36,000.
A student beginning a bachelor of commerce degree at the UNSW would need a UAI of 94.35 next year, but someone paying the $11,000 annual fee would need a UAI of only 89.40. 
At the University of Sydney, a student doing—
the much sought-after combination of arts-law—
a combined arts/law degree would need a 99.05 UAI, but this drops to 94.05 for a full fee-paying student spending $16,000 a year.
On two occasions today the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs was questioned about this matter. It should be noted that even this minister—who is not known for his judgment given his demotion to his current job and the Prime Minister's eagerness to bury his higher education agenda when it was leaked to the media—understands that you cannot justify to the Australian community fee paying students taking away places from non-fee paying, more meritorious students; that is, students with a higher academic entry mark. 
Even he realised that proposition was completely unarguable, so he did everything he could to avoid arguing it in question time today. First we saw him attempting to justify this situation on the basis that this government has increased access to higher education and so there were more places for everyone. That was the proposition that he put in question time today. But, as we all know from the statistics that we have in this area, it is not true to say that there are sufficient places in our universities for everyone. It is not true to say that growth under this government is occurring anywhere near fast enough. 
In particular, this minister often boasts that there are 40,000 more students on Australian campuses now than when this government came to office. That fails to take into account two very real factors: firstly, this minister is on the record in this House boasting about the number of higher education places for this year in the Australian higher education sector, and the boast that he makes is actually for a figure that is less than last year's figure. So on the minister's own admissions in this House, we are actually not seeing growth between last year and this year; indeed, we are seeing a reduction in places. 
That needs to be viewed in a context where the growth rate for places in our higher education sector over five years of this government has fallen way behind the growth rate for higher education places which was taking place under the Labor government. Indeed, the growth rate figures are down at less than half. So it is simply not true, as this minister would try to contend and as he tried to contend today, that somehow this arrangement where people with lower academic scores can access full fee paying places, possibly excluding someone with a better academic mark, does not matter because there are places in the higher education system for all. That is simply not true.
The second justification the minister endeavoured to put today—it is not one that worked either—was that this system was comparable with the fee paying system for overseas students. What we know about the fee paying system for overseas students is that overseas students come here and pay fees each and every year throughout the life of their course. That is done to generate revenue and profits for our higher education sector, which hopefully then uses that revenue and profits and directs them into useful activities such as the funding of other student places, research activities or what have you. 
On two occasions today, the minister was given the opportunity to say, `These places will be like that; that is, each and every year these fee paying students present to universities, they will be required to pay fees again.' On two occasions, given that opportunity, he refused to say that. So let us be clear about it: this minister is clearly countenancing a situation that does not happen with overseas students now. He is countenancing a situation where a fee paying student could present at university with a lesser academic entry score than has somebody who cannot afford to pay, could secure themselves a first year place by paying for it and then, in the latter years of their course, move to a fully funded government place and complete the course in a fully funded government place. Clearly, if that is what the minister is countenancing—and you would have to say from his performance in question time today that that is clearly what he is doing—then in the latter years of that course there are government places being taken by people who originally secured their entry to higher education because they could pay the fee, even though they presented with a lesser academic standard. That is the system that is being countenanced here.
If the government is going to promote that system, it needs to be clear to all the battling Australian families—and I have large numbers of them in my electorate who have a dream, an aspiration that their kids will get access to higher education and the opportunity for a better career and a better life—that the system this government is contemplating for higher education will be one where that whole picture can be distorted by the ability to pay. That is what we heard in question time today; and I hope the government has the honesty to clearly put that position and campaign on it, if that is what it intends to do. What we saw today was not an honest assessment of that position. We saw the minister trying to duck and weave and hide behind access figures and, when that did not work for him, trying to hide behind some comparison with overseas student places and, when that did not work for him, going back to the stock standard response we hear every time this minister gets up—which is that, when in doubt and you do not know the answers and you cannot explain the system, you criticise the Labor Party and the unions and everybody else in the higher education system, because you are not in a position to explain your lack of vision.
Moving from access questions to equity questions, as the member for Dobell noted in his speech on this bill, there is a Howard government inspired education deficit of $3 billion, an enormous black hole—of wasted lives and wasted opportunities—created by this government since 1996. Just to recap the calculation of that $3 billion, this government has cut almost $1 billion from universities. There have been cuts of $240 million in funding for vocational education and training. There have been higher HECS charges, which strip away from students almost $1 billion. The enrolment benchmark adjustment has so far cut about $60 million from federal funding to public schools right across the country. Finally, there have been cuts to student assistance of more than $500 million.
We need to note—and this bill confirms it—that, against that huge $3 billion deficit in education funding, what this government delivered on budget night was a bit of tinkering, the adding of $17 million extra for new education initiatives in the financial year that we are currently in. But anybody with sense would look at those figures and say that that $17 million simply cannot repair the damage that has been done to our education system and it cannot fix the clear inequities that are in our education system and that continue to exist.
I note that the minister in question time today criticised the Labor initiative which was announced at our recent national conference of committing to education priority zones. I would say in respect of that criticism that it ill behoves this minister to criticise that policy, when this government is doing absolutely nothing to address the increasingly spatial nature of inequity and inequality in our education system. I refer in that regard to what I think are very important statistics to note, because they are the kind of statistics around which the government ought to be shaping its education policies—and, given the increasingly spatial nature of disadvantage, those policies ought to include something like the priority zones which have been advocated by the Labor Party. 
I take the House to some of the research that is detailed in what is referred to as the Kirby report, which is the Ministerial Review of Post Compulsory Education and Training Pathways in Victoria, a report that has been procured by the new Labor government and by the incoming minister Lynne Kosky. There are some very important statistics in this report about the spatial nature of disadvantage, which continues to go unaddressed by this government. The report reads as follows:
Dropping out of school is influenced by socioeconomic level. In regions of Melbourne where there are many tertiary educated families, fewer than 1 in 10 young people leave school early. In regions of mixed socioeconomic status, dropping out increases to around 20 per cent of girls and 30 per cent of boys. Lower socioeconomic status areas record the highest rates of early leaving, from as high as 30 per cent of girls to more than 40 per cent of boys. In country regions, early leaving is also at these high levels.
What is difficult to describe to the House is that the report then provides a spatial map of Victoria, a country map and a city map, and shows through the shading the relative disadvantage in the sense of early school leaving. It records, for example, in relation to my electorate—which would be in the outer western region of Melbourne, as this is displayed—that early leaving from school among girls in my electorate is in the region of 11 to 20 per cent and, among boys, in the region of 21 to 30 per cent.
Those figures, I would have to say, are not the worst—because there are some country and outer suburban city regions where early leaving among girls reaches 21 to 30 per cent and early leaving amongst boys reaches 36 per cent and over. What is clear when you look at the coloured-in map is the very spatial nature of disadvantage. We are able now to quite clearly point to suburbs and localities which are characterised by early school leaving and lost opportunity and to suburbs and localities that have higher retention rates, not only through the completion of secondary school but into higher education.
Interestingly the report goes on to note that within Melbourne, where my electorate is located:
... the regions where early leaving is generally high are also in general those in which student achievement is also relatively weak. For example, in the outer-western, north-western and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, students are much more likely to receive low grades in VCE English than in suburbs of middle to high socioeconomic status, and in the north-west and south-east of the city they also drop out of school more frequently.
It is interesting to note that in relation to country regions there is not that correlation between low achievement and early leaving. The report goes on to say:
In contrast to regions where both low achievement and early leaving are found, there are regions in Victoria in which early leaving is not associated with low levels of scholastic achievement. This is the case in much of country Victoria and in some areas, on the outer-urban fringe of Melbourne, which have large rural segments, notably the outer-eastern suburbs and Mornington Peninsula.
I think what that says to us really is that the data is saying to us that there is this spatial nature of disadvantage. But we would not want to move from that data to saying that there is a simple explanation as to why people leave school early and that that explanation is uniform across all of the areas that experience high rates of early school leaving. The data, in fact, is telling us that there are different factors at work in different locations. That would tend to suggest that we need different and specifically tailored responses in different locations if we are to address that kind of disadvantage.
It is clear that this government is just not dealing with these questions at all. It has no response to these very chronic and worrying questions of educational disadvantage. In terms of quantifying how chronic and worrying these questions of disadvantage are, I would point to some important work that has been done by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum where it quotes a study undertaken by Anthony King of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra. This study tries to quantify, in dollar terms, the personal loss and the society-wide loss of early school leaving. The model, referred to as NATSEM, estimates that about 35,000 students `do not complete their secondary schooling and will not participate in further formal education or training'. Then it takes into account what that will cost the individuals involved. It arrives at an average figure, an average cost to each early school leaver of close to $15,000—that is in net present value terms. It goes on to state: 
What this means, is that when someone leaves school early they are effectively forgoing a cheque for $15,000 which they could have invested to enjoy the rewards over a lifetime.
It then goes on to estimate the society-wide costs of early school leaving, taking into account a number of factors including decreased social cohesion, higher costs associated with the provision of health care, higher costs associated with crime prevention and protection, higher administrative costs attached to providing social welfare programs. It comes to the conclusion that, if you aggregate the costs overall to our society of early school leaving, those costs once aggregated represent a total of $2.6 billion per year.
That is a staggering figure. But it seems to me that it is in looking at arguments like that and in addressing the kind of disadvantage that those arguments lay bare for us that the future for education policy lies. These are the sorts of issues that we on this side of the House are making a realistic and concerted attempt to grapple with. What is worrying is that from the other side we see nothing but criticisms of these attempts, dismissive waves about these attempts to deal with education policy—while at the same time this government is out of an agenda for education. When it came into office, it had an agenda for literacy and numeracy. It has implemented that agenda. It is out of an agenda for higher education. That agenda was thrown out the window once it was leaked from cabinet. Now all we have is $17 million worth of tinkering from the last budget, notwithstanding that we are dealing with a $3 billion deficit in this area.
In relation to this bill and the education area generally, all I can say is that we would prefer to see coming from the other side—rather than tinkering and simplistic lines of abuse—some real thinking about educational disadvantage and some real thinking about what can be done to address it at a Commonwealth level. We will be very pleased if we see some of that.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2000-08-14,"—It is a pleasure to address this issue in the House tonight because higher education and the promotion of it is something that I think we all strongly support, although of course from time to time we differ about how to go about it. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 does have various parts to it. But, before I get into that, I think I might just go back and look at the way in which the HECS scheme originated.
HECS originated with the Wran committee in December 1987. When that committee reported, it recommended in April 1988 that there should be a contribution scheme whereby higher education students would pay an additional two per cent of taxable income until they met 20 per cent of the cost of their higher education. Under that proposal from the Wran committee, the requirement to pay would arise only when the student's personal taxable income exceeded the average earnings of all working Australians. The committee also recommended that there be three levels of contribution: $1,500, $2,500 and $3,000 per annum—whichever would apply would depend on the cost of the course involved. The report also canvassed the possibility of allowing institutions to vary these charges by 15 per cent above and below the standard.
They are some of the elements that the Wran committee reported. It did also say that there could be a discount applied to up-front payments and that the discount would need to be around 40 per cent to be attractive in financial terms to students. In August 1988, the then Labor government announced that it had accepted most of the Wran committee's recommendations and it introduced the HECS on 1 January 1989. However, the scheme as introduced only had one rate of contribution, which was $1,800, and an up-front discount of only 15 per cent. That is the nature of the introduction and the policy development that led to the introduction of HECS. 
Since then, reports on how HECS has flourished have been basically supportive. In fact, research provided by the Parliamentary Library on the matter stated:
The shift in cost to students also appears to have been accomplished without any significant adverse impact on participation. The number of commencing undergraduates, excluding overseas students, has increased by at least 25 per cent since 1988, and a recent study concluded that HECS is a very minor factor in the low participation in higher education by people of low socioeconomic status.
That is the background to HECS. It has become a fixture in the Australian way of life, but tonight we are looking at a bill which amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. This bill also gives effect to measures in the 2000-01 budget. In particular, this will enable us to commit to maintaining funding levels for higher education. This year, universities will receive over $5.7 billion from the Commonwealth, including HECS. This support, combined with reforms that have allowed universities to diversify and expand their income sources, means that university revenues this year will reach an estimated amount of $9 billion. 
In the budget, there was a commitment to provide an additional $62.8 million for the Strategic Partnerships with Industry Research and Training Scheme over three years from 2002. That is included in this bill. The government gave a commitment to funding levels for higher education, and it also gave a commitment to provide $562 million in the budget for a country health package. That is the largest ever effort by an Australian government to redress the historical imbalance between rural and city health, and that is delivered in this bill.
The bill also gives effect to a budget commitment under which additional funding of $16.3 million was to be allocated to the Research Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities Scheme over four years. Once again, that is included in this bill. The government has an excellent record in financial management. It has delivered the benefits of good financial management and careful budgetary stewardship and provided it in a way that assists in areas such as higher education and other important government services.
Something that we should bear in mind is that the government has, as a result of its efforts, increased the number of undergraduate students by 35,000 and the total number of students by 42,000—that is, in equivalent full-time student units—since 1996, which is a very commendable achievement on behalf of the government. University revenues, at $9 billion, are now at an all-time high and are $900 million higher than they were in 1995. We have heard rhetoric from those across the wayabout cuts to higher education funding. They say you can make statistics go any way you want, and I think the members opposite are guilty of sheep dogging their statistics in the directions they would like to see them go. However, we on this side are cognisant of the fact that university operating grants, including marginal funding, increased slightly, by nearly one per cent in real terms, between 1996 and 1999 and are to increase further over the period 1999 to 2002. Funding per EFTSU has also increased since 1996. There has been a significant increase in targeted research and research training funding, from $405.9 million in 1996 to $446.5 million in 2000 in real terms.
The higher education system we have in Australia today is not only a product of HECS and those funding arrangements but also of the unified national system of higher education, as it was called when it was introduced by the former Labor government under the then education minister John Dawkins. The unified national system had a very rocky road on its introduction, and no doubt the system we have today still bears some consequences of that. For example, in my electorate of Blair, I have two recognised campuses of the University of Queensland. The Gatton College, which is now known as the Gatton campus of the University of Queensland, has had a few difficulties under the control of the University of Queensland. Prior to the introduction of the unified national system, it was a completely stand-alone training institution and it dealt with the highest levels of learning in relation to agricultural pursuits. Since the introduction of the unified national system, it has become part of the University of Queensland. While that does reflect very well on its credibility, its standing and the extent to which the degrees it produces have clout, there has also been a downside to that. It has meant that, at the same time it has picked up on the roundabout, it has lost on the swings because some of those opportunities in higher agricultural learning have moved away from Gatton and have tended to be spirited off to the head campus at St Lucia. 
I do not think that has always been a good thing, but I must compliment the University of Queensland because, in recent times, they have announced their full commitment to the Gatton campus, and it is good to see them building up a head of steam there. I understand that very shortly plans for a major new development on the site there are going to be revealed, and that is very good to see. One of the offshoots of the unified national system—which is an offshoot, I think, missing out of the system—is that there is no set procedure for institutions that may not have university status today to grow and become universities tomorrow. We see that with the development of practically every new university facility that comes along. The member for Fisher, who is sitting at the table, has witnessed the development of the Sunshine Coast University—
—It is an outstanding institution.
—It is. One of the difficulties that has been involved with that is the need to get credibility in those degrees and the need to follow a formalised process to establish that university. I know that, for example, if Gatton College were ever to establish itself as a separate university, separate from the University of Queensland, it would face the same sorts of difficulties in establishing its name and its place within the system.
There are also other facilities in other places. For example, at Kingaroy the march to the unified national system did not leave any established route where the local branch of the Queensland Institute of Technology may in time grow to provide local university courses. The only way they can set about doing that is by making one-off approaches to universities around the place and asking them, begging them, to come around and perhaps provide some of their higher learning opportunities on site at Kingaroy. I think we really need to focus on a way to formalise that process and regular reviews of the provision of higher education services, particularly in communities that are growing and where there is a need to provide that local level of service. Communities that do not have access to university courses on site suffer.
When the unified national system came in, one of its big omissions in terms of university status was the Northern Territory University. At the time that the unified national system was brought in, there was no recognition within that for what was then the Darwin Institute of Technology as a university. The only way that Darwin eventually got itself a university was, basically, by the Territory government setting up a university of their own. They called it a university. There was a heck of a fight between John Dawkins and the then Territory government about the establishment of the Northern Territory University. That meant that initially, at this completely separate institution, questions were raised by opponents and by people in Canberra and other places about whether or not that facility really had credible degrees. There was a heck of a stoush between those two levels of government—the Commonwealth and the Territory—before eventually recognition was given to the Northern Territory University and it amalgamated with the Darwin Institute of Technology to form itself into a credible institution, and to go on to become one of the fastest growing and most exciting institutions around the place today.
That brings to light the fact that we need to formalise that process because, for example in the Darwin community at that time, if people had youngsters growing up and wanted them to have a higher education degree, they had to leave the Territory altogether. That was artificially stunting the whole community's growth. Even in Kingaroy, in my electorate, people are leaving the community. They are going away and taking their whole family because, when their children reach year 12, they want a higher education opportunity for them, and they cannot find it locally. We should be reassuring those sorts of communities that we are not going to insist in the long term with them being cut off. 
There are other ways in which it can be done. It is not a matter of going along to the Queensland Institute of Technology in Kingaroy and announcing that tomorrow it will offer university courses. That is not really something that most people would see as an option. But, for example, the University of Southern Queensland offers very good distance education courses. These kinds of opportunities for people in remote areas of our state should be promoted and should be advanced.
Once again—I spoke earlier today on education matters—I would like to take this opportunity to talk on some of the developments that we have heard recently from members opposite in their pursuit of what they have dubbed the `knowledge nation'. I said something this morning about the lack of literacy standards under former Labor governments, and I think they have a long way to go before they convince people that they really are not going to slip back on to that slippery slope and allow students' literacy standards to decline once again. I notice that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has dubbed a lot of what the Labor Party have been talking about in recent times two things—one is `headless chookery' and the other one is `windbaggery'—
—He is right on both counts.
—I think he is right on both counts, but let us have a look at some of the issues that they have discussed. We definitely need from members opposite a serious commitment to those basic literacy standards. When I heard the member for Lalor, who spoke ahead of me, make comments about the `spatial nature of disadvantage'—
—She was off the planet!
—In a spatial sense that is probably true. There is nothing spatial at all if you do not have basic literacy and numeracy skills. These are not people who are struggling to get to university. These are people who are struggling to make it through year 9 and year 10. Yet our system is moving more and more towards a system where a year 12 education is the base standard, and of course we are now going way beyond that into all sorts of vocational and higher learning opportunities.
To deny people basic literacy is, I think, a terrible offence against the Australian community, and that was what members opposite were guilty of. When they were in government 30 per cent of school students were unable to read or write properly. We cannot afford that in this day and age, and young people who are today out on the streets suffering because of that kind of policy making really should be given an undertaking that in the years ahead we will maintain a commitment to literacy standards—maintain a commitment to those basic standards of reading and writing. And whether the Labor Party comes to office or whether this government remains in office, this federal parliament should stand for those basics and should insist that those basics be met.
Members opposite have again and again urged us to throw money at the problems of education, and while that is something they have done in the past—obviously without great success—this government has continued to maintain a responsible attitude towards funding education. In the time we have been looking after the education system GDP in our country has been growing rapidly. So when we talk about maintaining a constant share of GDP for education we are talking about a share of something that is growing rapidly, and that is something all Australians should be proud of on two counts: one, that increasing amounts of money are going to higher education and, two, that our country is growing rapidly, in an economic sense, to begin with. 
Because GDP has been growing rapidly, the increase in education spending in real terms is 17 per cent. That is the real increase in Commonwealth spending on education. That is the extent of public school funding increasing in this country since 1996. An extra $1.4 billion will be allocated over the next four years compared to the last four years. We have $402 million more being spent on government schools this year than was spent in Labor's last year—that is an increase of 26 per cent. Commonwealth spending on government schools is growing faster in Labor states than spending by those Labor state governments themselves. For example, in my state of Queensland, total school spending by the state government is up 3.7 per cent and the Commonwealth spending in that state is up 7.5 per cent. In Tasmania, state government spending has increased by 2.9 per cent and Commonwealth spending by 4.3 per cent. In Victoria, state spending is up 4.5 per cent versus 6.6 per cent.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I, too, would like to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000  which is before the House tonight. The bill itself has provided indexed funding arrangements for all areas of higher education. It sets the maximum grants available up until the year 2002 and also makes some minor changes to HECS. Basically this bill legislates the changes announced in the 2000-01 budget. The bill is an attempt to fill the funding deficit in higher education that was created by four years of Howard government cuts to universities, to TAFE colleges and to student support schemes. Tonight though I would like to comment on the downward direction education is headed under this government.
Since 1996 the Howard government have continually attacked higher education, as they have also attacked Medicare and workplace relations. These are the three areas which the coalition have wanted to dismantle for the whole 13 years they were in opposition. They could not stand seeing government money going into the public school system or being invested in universities and increasing research grants. Since March 1996, following the election of the Howard government, almost $1 billion has been cut from universities and vocational training schemes have been cut by $240 million. This is the government which introduced higher HECS charges, effectively increasing the cost of studying for students by $1 billion across Australia. They have also cut student assistance to the tune of $500 million. However, the part which I find the most damaging to Australia's future is the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which has now cut $60 million from federal funding to our public schools across the country.
The logic behind this EBA—and government members will be the first to tell you this—is that by giving less funding to public education and more funding to private schools private school fees are eventually reduced. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, would say that people are then given greater `choice' in the education of their children. However, the government is missing the fundamental point—that is, education is the government's responsibility. In a democracy the government of the day has an obligation to provide a quality, equitable and accessible public education system, not to create a private and exclusive education system. This choice, which the government refers to, is still only a choice for a small group of people. For many people in my electorate of Prospect I can assure you that the luxury of a private school education will never be an option for them. 
I believe this government is neglecting its responsibilities to public education. Public schools are schools funded and maintained by the government which provide equal access for all students regardless of what they can afford. I fail to see any element of fairness in the EBA. This government treats education like a business, applying business theories to their survival. However, free market theories cannot be applied to education because the main goal with education is the attainment of knowledge rather than a profit at the end of the day's trading. The EBA is blatantly unfair and has caused unnecessary division in the Australian community. If it continues, the public education system will continue to be run down and deprived of funds. Its pupils will then have less prosperous job opportunities.
That is why the Labor Party upon winning government will abolish it. Over the past three years the EBA has taken, I repeat, more than $60 million from government schools around Australia while, at the same time, those schools have enrolled an extra 26,000 students. The Commonwealth and the public education system must work hand in hand, not against each other like they currently do under Dr Kemp's divisive and backward looking regime. Recently the Labor Party announced the Learning Gateway, an initiative which will serve as an information site on the Internet for teachers, students and parents. This is the direction education will have to take if Australia is to survive and be competitive in the new economy.  
The Learning Gateway will move the Commonwealth's focus on education from merely announcing three-yearly funding arrangements to becoming an active learning partner with individuals across Australia. This is an area where that $60 million which has been taken out of public school funding would be far better spent. Not only would the Learning Gateway provide education, information resources and tools to students, parents and teachers but it would play a leading role in developing a multimedia content and delivering on-line content relevant to vocational education and training. Under this government education standards have deteriorated. The education sector now has a $3 billion deficit hanging over its head, primarily because of this government's cuts to our universities across Australia and to our TAFE colleges. However, there is a real crisis in the area of research. We are the only advanced Western nation where private business research and development is not only falling in real terms but also falling in nominal terms. This means that, under the Howard government, spending on research and development—investment in the future of this country—has fallen three years in a row as a percentage of national output. There is a flashing warning light out there which indicates that there is serious work to be done in this area but this government seems to be too complacent to want to do anything about it.
The bill itself enacts initiatives laid down in the budget with respect to education. In this budget only $17 million extra was allocated to new education incentives. This $17 million is expected to cover all areas from university right down to TAFE, high school, primary school and early childhood. This is an appalling amount of funding when one considers the urgent need for more investment in the education field. Even the Howard government's first budget—that slash and burn budget in 1996—had more spending on new education than this measly $17 million that the 2000-01 budget produced. These budget figures raise a very important point with respect to how much money should be available for spending on education. The budget estimates for this year claimed that an $11 billion surplus would be delivered. But come budget night there was no $11 billion. In fact, the $11 billion would have been a good deposit to spend on education initiatives or on research and development. But where has this $11 billion surplus gone? The 2000-01 budget was delivered with a phoney surplus propped up by the sale of mobile phone spectrum. It was a budget which had the lowest amount of money allocated for new education initiatives since this government won office. It has been squandered on the coalition's obsession with taxation reform. The effect of these four years of government cuts is really starting to take effect out there. Now that the universities have been starved of funds and are cash strapped, thanks to the Howard government, they are willing to lower their entrance mark for full fee paying students. This is chequebook education.
The Sydney Morning Herald today reported that the universities which offer full fee paying courses—the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney, the Australian Catholic University and the Charles Sturt University—will lower their admission index five points for those who are willing to pay up-front fees. Does this now mean that, for a student doing a combined arts-law degree at the University of Sydney, for example, who would normally need a UAI of 99.05, this year if they or their families can afford to pay the $16,000 a year for the course, the UAI will drop five points to 94.05? They will then study law while students who got the same UAI  and cannot afford the $16,000 will be forced to miss out. That once in a lifetime opportunity of getting a good education, the opportunity to study at university level, is now at serious risk. This old-fashioned, old hat style of higher education is a direct result of this government cutting funding to our universities. We are now seeing the ramifications of funding cuts to universities and the consequences of applying free market theories to the education system; that is, now that the universities have been starved of funds they are now looking for funds from anywhere they can find them. However, what suffers in all this is the principle of equal access to university and higher education. University education is now becoming a luxury afforded only to those from privileged backgrounds. 
However, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs does not see the problem with education in this country. He has, I believe, a very blinkered vision of education. Even today in question time—twice he was asked—he said he could not rule out the situation of people who had better UAIs missing out on places to richer students. He stood up here in this chamber today and used the same old tired, shoddy rhetoric to argue that all Australian students should have to pay fees to go to university. This is the typical user-pays education spiel that we have become so used to from this minister. We know that the user certainly does pay, and pay extensively. We all remember that leaked cabinet submission paper that admitted that students would be paying up to $100,000 for a degree. This reminds me of the American style of education: their universities and colleges are so expensive that large college funds are needed to pay for a university degree or higher education. This style of chequebook education will not be tolerated by a Labor opposition or by Labor in government. It is affirmative action for the rich. It is totally and completely unfair for those Australians who simply cannot afford to buy their university degrees. We must not have a bar of it. It is not in the interest of quality education or fairness to have a standard of entry for battling Australians and a lower standard for those who can swap a cheque for a degree.
Many students in Australia rely on the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, HECS, which defers their payment of university fees until they enter the work force. However, under this government people who use HECS simply because they cannot afford up-front fees are being shafted down the queue to make way for students who are able to afford up-front fees but are in fact less qualified. The Australian dream of a local kid going to the local high school, studying hard, getting good marks and going on to complete university study is becoming more and more distant. 
This year more than 80,000 students around Australia will sit for their HSC. This is a most difficult time for all those students. The pressure of study now is combined with having to work out what university or TAFE course they wish to enrol in after school or what career path they want to undertake. Every year we hear the success stories of our brilliant students who get their first choice of university degrees through hard work and study. These students are great achievers and they should be congratulated for their hard work and for their dedication. We also repeatedly hear the heartbreaking stories of students who have studied hard all year and only narrowly missed out on the university course of their choice. Along with all the pressures of the HSC, these students will now have an added worry; that is, even though they may have scored just under the required UAI for their first choice university course, someone who missed out also but is able to pay their way into the degree, regardless of who got the lower mark, will have the jump on them. The minister today would not rule out the situation of these students who paid up-front for their first year entry then taking a government funded position in second or third year through HECS. I ask him: why not?
Consider this situation where two students apply for the same degree with a cut-off UAI of 90. One student—we will call him Dave—gets 89.50 and narrowly misses out, while the other student, Campbell, gets 86 but buys his way into the university course. The next year Dave applies again and is refused, while Campbell gets offered a government funded HECS plan for the remainder of his studies. This plan could have been given to Dave, who originally beat Campbell in the HSC. I wonder how many of the 80,000 school students who are preparing for the HSC this year will miss out on their first choice of university course. I also wonder how many of these students will have their place at university taken by someone who scored a few marks less but had a few more zeros in their family bank account. This will be a new heartbreaking reality for HSC students, and this is something else they will have to worry about. 
I also want to remind the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs that many of these HSC students will be first-time voters at the next election. I can guarantee you that these voters will remember which government made studying for the HSC that much harder, which government cut university funding by $1 billion over four years. They will remember which government increased HECS fees, which government in the 2000-01 budget gave the lowest funding in four years to new education initiatives. But, most of all, these students will remember which government through spending cuts sacrificed their university place to a richer but less qualified student. After a few more years of the Howard government I can see quality education becoming only more and more unaffordable for the thousands of people in my electorate who rely on a fully funded education system. Within this system each person should have access to fair and equal education. It is time for this government to wake up and realise where they are sending this country in terms of education.
The minister sits there quite happily knowing that there is a $3 billion educational deficit because of government cuts. Students are now paying $1 billion more across Australia because of increased HECS; $60 million taken from public schools through the EBA; cuts to student assistance of more than $500 million; and universities are now lowering their entrance marks for rich students. The minister will not be sitting there for too much longer. Australians are now surely realising what the government is doing and the damage it has done to education.
This government by these rules is holding this country back and slowly creating a divisive education system in which a select few will continue to prosper while other Australians will continue to be denied access to our universities and to a quality higher education system. This is not the education system I want, and most Australians do not want an education system like this. The voters in Australia are not fools. They can see what the coalition is all about, and they can see what this government's education policy is all about. It is simply not good enough, and the people will not wear it.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I wish to support the views which are being expressed by my colleague the member for Prospect, and I want in my contribution on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 to pay particular attention to the attitude of this government to higher education and its impact on regional and remote areas. From my point of view what has happened here has been an absolute dereliction of duty by this government in relation to regional universities.
In 1998, or thereabouts, an initial bout of funding was received by the Northern Territory University, based in Darwin. It was seen as providing an opportunity for the residents of the Northern Territory to achieve a reasonable higher education degree from a university which had hitherto run courses as an agent of the University of Queensland. It was seen that having the ability to be able to run your own arts degree or your own economics degree, develop a business school and have your own law degree was a way of attracting students from the Northern Territory to that university. I well recall the arguments and the views which were put by the then Northern Territory government about the way in which the then Labor government—from memory the Minister for Employment, Education and Training then was John Dawkins—had been tardy in providing these resources.
It is of interest that in the 12 years that have passed we have seen effectively the rise and decline of the Northern Territory University. I worked at the precursor to the Northern Territory University, lecturing and tutoring in a number of subjects, one of which was politics. At that point it was possible at that university to do a major in politics and a major in Australian history. Under the regime of Dr Kemp it is no longer possible at the Northern Territory University to do English as part of an arts degree. You can no longer do an English major. You can no longer do a major, or even a minor, in political science. You can no longer do a major or a minor in physics. You can no longer do a major or a minor in maths. You can no longer do a major—but you can do a minor—in anthropology. There is no major or minor in archaeology. And you cannot do a minor or a major in Australian history, ancient history or modern history. I am a humanities graduate. My interest at university was history and politics. I did a double major in history and a major in politics. I could not have achieved that outcome at the Northern Territory University. If you want to be a specialist maths teacher in the Northern Territory you cannot do the maths degree in the Northern Territory. 
Let us say that you want to be one of those teachers of which we know there is a shortage in Australian high schools—a specialist maths and physics teacher. You cannot do that degree at the Northern Territory University. You can do an education degree, but you cannot do a degree in arts specialising in physics and maths—or indeed in history or English—so that you can go out and teach the children of the Northern Territory so that they can then get access to the university by studying English, maths, physics and, dare I say, history. It seems to me that a funny sort of priority is being attached to education if at this university you cannot get these degrees which would be, I suggest, the mainstay of a general degree in most other universities. Of course this has happened because of the way in which Dr Kemp, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, has dealt with higher education in this country.
My view is that the federal government's ignorance of the facts of life as they impact upon regional Australia has meant that higher education policies are really kicking people in the bush in the guts. Instead of a university that was growing—growing with the expectations of the Northern Territory community—we now have one that is shrinking and one that, if I think the minister had his way, would possibly disappear altogether. When this university was first created there was an expectation that we would see it grow with the Territory, but instead we are seeing it diminish day by day as a direct result of the policies of the Howard government. As I said, you can study education at the Northern Territory University but, if you want to be a specialist teacher in English, history, maths or physics, don't bother turning up to enrol.
If you live in the bush, you have made the wrong lifestyle choice as far as this government is concerned because it seems that you no longer have the right to adequate remote area or distance education. That is the other implication of the way in which funds have been cut from the Northern Territory University's budget. A combination of Dr Kemp's policies, his party's abysmal ignorance of the way we live in the Northern Territory and in the bush generally and the supine CLP administration in Darwin have all but killed off any hope that we could have of a tertiary institution serving the real educational needs of the people of the Territory. The funding cuts that Dr Kemp announced after the last election ignored the fact that, if you want a small university to remain viable, you do not start a process of amputation. You back it to the hilt to show that you have confidence in regional Australia. The Northern Territory University has severe problems right now. It is almost at crisis point, if it is not there already. The responsibility for this rot rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of Dr Kemp. Its fate puts a lie to Mr Howard's claim about caring for regional Australia and makes a joke of the Country Liberal Party's claim to represent the interests of Territorians.
Indeed, if I could go into the archives and bring out the speeches and expose the press releases that were made at the time of the discussion about the Northern Territory being funded by the Commonwealth, you would see a drastic difference between the language which was used about the then Labor government with John Dawkins as the education minister and the language which is currently used—that is, the supine way in which the CLP have bent over to accommodate the interests of the Howard government and Dr Kemp at the expense of the Northern Territory community. Let there be no doubt about it: if you were to compare and contrast the way in which they approached the then Hawke government in the first instance and the way in which they approach the current Howard government over the question of higher education in the Northern Territory, you would expose the contradictions in their position and you would demonstrate very clearly that they have not been acting as advocates on behalf of the Northern Territory community. They have given in to the demands of the Howard government. 
We know that regional universities have been disproportionately affected by the cuts from this government, particularly those with distance education programs and regionalised campuses for which the cuts have been so destructive. I mentioned the Northern Territory University but also included of course as being affected are the University of New England, Deakin University, University of Wollongong, University of Southern Queensland, Central Queensland University and Charles Sturt University, and the list goes on. People in regional and remote Australia apparently now have no rights to access higher education, at least not the rights that you and I would expect. The Howard government not only is guilty of cutting our services but now apparently views people in remote and regional Australia as having made a lifestyle choice, as some people wishing to access IVF have found. This is code for, `You have no rights at all if we don't want you to have them.' I think that is true in relation to this government.
As I have explained, once the funding cuts were announced the staff cuts began at the Northern Territory University. Courses went out the door and amalgamations proliferated. Indigenous studies were to be subsumed with foundation studies, for instance, and distance education, a significant and highly necessary support service for the people of remote Northern Australia, was gutted. These management decisions and the resulting erosion of services have precipitated a crisis of staff morale at the Northern Territory University.
I am acquainted with a number of universities in Australia and I know a large number of academics. I know how, by and large, they are prepared to go the extra yard for their students and for the institutions in which they work; well beyond, I might say, the call of duty. But I have to say that it is wearing very thin, and I do not believe it will continue. Certainly, in the case of the Northern Territory, I know that they have had enough. It seems to me that when voters come to make a choice at the next federal election—certainly in the Northern Territory—they will mark down this government as a result of the way in which they have dealt with higher education in Northern Australia.
We know about the enterprise bargaining agreement which is currently being debated in the universities. Certainly in the case of the Northern Territory University it is very clear that it does not have the resources it requires to meet the legitimate demands of its staff. Of course, what we will get as a result of this discussion is another cycle of staff cuts, rationalisation of courses, disappointed students and disappointed parents, and the morale around the university will again sink to new depths. I know of students who have turned up at this university on the expectation that they would be able to finish a course at the university only to discover part of the way through that a course had been axed in the third or second year. The contract they had with the university has been unable to be fulfilled because of decisions taken by the university as a direct result of the funding cuts by this government. I do not think that is fair to young Australians, and I think it is particularly unfair to those people who live in Northern Australia for whom the choices are so limited. Yet we get no apology from this government. All we get is excuses. We heard the tirade today from the minister in relation to the question of the purchase of courses by students who could not otherwise meet the entry requirements of the universities.
I will come to that in a moment, but I want to make another point. We all know that this government has cut the number of postgraduate research positions. In the case of the Northern Territory University they have been cut by over 60 per cent. We have heard the arguments about why we need to be and should be a knowledge nation. Certainly from this side of politics we have a deadset commitment towards that. We have heard the arguments about why it is important for industry development purposes to have gifted Australians doing research at our universities at home in Australia and not fleeing overseas because of the abysmal way they are currently treated by the higher education system as a result of this government's policies. We know all the arguments about why it is important to have postgraduate research at our universities. Yet in the case of the Northern Territory University—a small university—they have all but eradicated postgraduate research places. 
I fear the day is rapidly approaching when the Northern Territory University will be unable to sustain many of the other courses it currently runs, aside from those it has already taken out of its curriculum—the ones I have already mentioned. Already it runs courses in tandem with the Open University. How long will it be before it once again becomes an agent for the University of Queensland or the University of Melbourne or Flinders University or the University of Sydney or the University of Canberra or the Australian National University, running their courses because it does not have the infrastructure to support its own courses in its own right? I fear the day is rapidly approaching when far fewer courses will be developed at the university, at least in the core areas, far fewer than those which were around in the late 1980s.
Today in this House we had the sight of the minister defending lower entry standards for cashed-up students. Frankly, I think it is insulting. I understand the argument about purchasing student places and why the government believes it is appropriate to have students pay who can afford to pay. I do not accept the argument but I understand it. But I cannot understand the argument that, where in two households—one next door to the other—two people fail to have a TER of 90 for a BA Honours degree—both have 85.25 per cent—because one neighbour is rich enough to buy their way in, that person can go to university and the next-door neighbour cannot. Is that fair? I understood that the question of entry scores to universities was not only about limiting the numbers but also actually about quality. This is about getting the best students into universities. What we are seeing, as has been pointed out by the shadow minister for education, is an affirmative action program for the rich at the expense of other Australians who, because of their circumstances, are not able to bribe their way into universities. They are not able to attend these universities because the costs have increased dramatically—we already know the figures. HECS as a proportion of the funding to universities will increase by 113 per cent from 1996 to 2002 because of the cuts in government funding. So HECS has already increased, increasing the burden on the normal, everyday student who happens to get through the TER scheme and is able to get into university competitively.
The government have reduced the funding in universities generally, and now they are saying to the rich kids on the block, `Don't worry about the scores, fellows. You guys and you ladies should just come up with the money and we will get you in.' But if you happen to be the son or daughter of a working class family or of a single parent family, bad luck. They are saying that you should just hop on the tram and find another job because you are not going to be allowed into university. They are saying, `If you come from an area of regional disadvantage, we will not give you easy access, but we will give you easy access if you have money in your pocket.' I think that is abhorrent, and it shows dramatically where this government is coming from in relation to higher education. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I rise to participate in this important debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 and to support the amendment moved by my colleague the member for Dobell. I commence by acknowledging that an appropriately targeted and funded education policy is the best investment a nation can make in its own future—a view which is obviously not shared by the current government. The Bills Digest states that the purpose of this bill is to:
adjust grants for funding year 2001 for price movements;
set the maximum grants available for funding year 2002;
vary the maxima for operating grants for 1999-2001 to reflect revised estimates for the Higher Education Contribution Scheme; and
provide additional funding for measures announced in the 2000-01 Budget concerning research programs and university places for students on bonded medical scholarships. 
This so-called initiative must be viewed with total cynicism, because the Howard government, especially with Dr Kemp as minister, has been relentless in its obsession to reduce education spending to the disgraceful levels we experience today. Indeed, we could be forgiven for believing that this government and this minister have set about deliberately dumbing down this nation to almost Third World standards. I use the term `dumbing down' advisedly, because Dr Kemp will undoubtedly be regarded by history as the Don Quixote of Australian politics. His total paranoia regarding education unions would provide a major challenge for even the most gifted psychiatrist. In fact, it is rumoured that there is enough material for a full-blown, 500-participant psychiatrist convention inside the minister's head every day. The mind boggles at the thought of this minister seeking to dumb our educational standards down to his distorted level.
The member for Dobell, our spokesman on higher education, has estimated that there is now a $3 billion education deficit because of the cuts that the Howard government has made since 1996. Almost $1 billion has been cut from universities. There have been cuts in funding for vocational education and training of $240 million. There have been HECS charges which have stripped away almost $1 billion from students. The enrolment benchmark adjustment has so far cut about $60 million from federal funding to public schools right across the country, and that continues to grow. There have also been cuts to student assistance of more than $500 million. Universities in regional areas have lost almost $171 million from their budgets. It is these universities that are the real drivers of development in regional communities. Regional universities give local kids and mature age students their best opportunity to study for a degree and to get the skills they need to gain the high quality jobs of the future. The Howard-Kemp cuts of $171 million from our regional universities will deny students in regional communities the chance to study for a degree. This massive reduction in funding will deny regional communities opportunities for economic development and new jobs.
La Trobe University in Bendigo has felt the impact of the Howard-Kemp cuts most severely. La Trobe Bendigo's budget from the Commonwealth government has been reduced by almost $2 million over the past four years. This faculty—and I emphasise the word `faculty'—had a total income in 1999 of $35.6 million: $26.7 million came from Commonwealth grants and the balance came from other areas generated by La Trobe Bendigo's initiatives, including fees of $2.4 million from full fee paying, predominantly international, students, which is an increase of almost $350,000 over the previous year. Other locally generated income has increased by $800,000 since last year.
La Trobe University Bendigo is responsible for $18.1 million being placed in Bendigo's economy each year in salaries and wages, and a further $8.9 million comes from maintenance and repairs, materials and equipment, and other administrative overheads. This is a total of $27 million injected directly into Bendigo's economy. In addition to these factors, there are various business operations associated with the faculty. Together with the multiplier effect of the personal consumption of 3,600 students and 432 staff—which makes it one of the region's largest employers—La Trobe University Bendigo estimates that it makes a financial impact on the economy of the Bendigo region of approximately $130 million per year.
The Howard-Kemp cuts to universities have cost central Victoria almost $3.5 million. Bendigo's problems are worsened by internal transfers of dollars—and control—to La Trobe University's Bundoora campus. The reason for this is obvious: La Trobe University Bundoora is attempting to alleviate the budget problems caused by the Howard-Kemp cuts by extracting almost $3 million per year from La Trobe Bendigo's budget. The effect of this is severely hampering La Trobe Bendigo's ability to continue to provide its excellent service. This loss of over $3 million each year limits the Bendigo faculty's ability to provide its excellent range of courses and services and results in a deskilling of administrative support and a substantial stripping of much needed and valuable assets. This is all a direct result of the Howard-Kemp plan for education. 
La Trobe University Bendigo has recently appointed a Regional Advisory Committee consisting of prominent Bendigo community representatives and successful business leaders. Mr Gordon McKern is the group's chairman. I know that Mr McKern and indeed all of the other committee members have La Trobe Bendigo's interest at heart and indeed the wider Bendigo region's interest at heart. They commence their task at a crucial stage of the university's development. I know that this move will lead to improved communications, which is a matter of much concern to the faculty staff and student body. I wish the new committee well in their deliberations.
At a time when the concerns of regional Australia are at the forefront, the university must take the opportunities available through the strong regional presence that La Trobe Bendigo has enjoyed for many years to better serve the region and its own long-term interests. The Bendigo faculty should not be regarded as an asset to be raided and bled to resolve short-term problems at other La Trobe University campuses. I call on Professor Osborne, the Vice-Chancellor, to outline his strategy for the positive development of the Bendigo faculty. I know the Bendigo community is watching with great interest the developments at the Bendigo university.
Education is always a priority for Labor but, as these figures show, it is certainly no priority for the Howard government. Labor's plan for Australia to become a knowledge nation is vital if we are to keep pace with other countries. This can take place only in a country which is lifting its national investment in education, training and research. Australia will never be the knowledge nation whilst Dr Kemp continues to preside over our fund-starved institutions and continues to blame the education unions for his own shortcomings. Shortly I will highlight some of the Labor Party's policy commitments that will offer a better deal for university and school education. I will highlight some of the commitments the opposition leader, Mr Beazley, has announced as part of Labor's strategy of developing Australia as a knowledge nation. But first I want to draw the attention of the House to the effects the GST has on tertiary students, present and past. The GST punishes tertiary students, especially country tertiary students. Bendigo is a university city. As I have said, the university is vital to the region's economy and education. However, the GST makes education dearer for all. The GST especially punishes regional tertiary students.
The federal education department has confirmed that there will be an increase of 5.4 per cent in HECS repayments in the financial year 2000-01. This is thanks to inflation and especially the inflation explosion caused by the introduction of the GST on 1 July. Nearly one million Australian students past and present have HECS debts and they will be worse off because of this. The government will rake off an extra $323 million this financial year because of this. The National Union of Students has estimated that the GST will increase the HECS debt in 2001 of an arts student by $433, of an architecture student by $616 and of a law student by $720. University graduates who find employment after graduating will be paying not only the HECS repayment but the extra burden of the GST on top of it. This GST burden will eat heavily into the tax cuts that the government boasts will offset the effects of the GST. The government claimed education would be GST free, but this is not true. And there was no mention of this GST burden on students during the 1998 election campaign.
The GST is discriminatory. It affects HECS repayments. It is not paid on up-front fees. It penalises students who are not well-off enough to pay up-front fees and who must defer fee repayments under HECS. As honourable members would know, students paying up-front fees are eligible for a 25 per cent discount on their fees. This GST burden targets country students. They are less well-off than their city counterparts and they are more likely to have to defer payments and use HECS. I wish to refer to the case of La Trobe University and its city and country campuses. Sixty-six per cent of its city students who are subject to tertiary fees defer their payments, but 76 per cent of its country students, including those at Bendigo, find it necessary to defer payment. So the GST burden fails on more country students than on city students. It hits students from the Bendigo district more than it hits city students. 
I turn now to the exciting commitments that the Labor Party has announced to date as part of its strategy to develop Australia as a knowledge nation. Honourable members are aware that the opposition leader, Kim Beazley, outlined Labor's direction in education policy at the ALP national conference held recently in Hobart. He set out that Labor in office would substantially increase public investment in our tertiary institutions, school education, and research and development. I believe this all adds up to bringing in new energy in education policy making so that our universities, research institutions and schools can play a vital role to help Australia meet the challenge of the third millennium and the IT revolution.
Let us start with the research commitments. When in government Labor will double the number of research fellowships available to Australian researchers. This means the number of Commonwealth funded fellowships available at our universities and cooperative research centres will increase from the current 390 to 780 over the next three to five years. Labor will double the number of early career researchers supported at any one time from 165 to 330 by the end of three years. The number of mid-career researchers supported at any one time will double from 150 to 300 by the end of five years. The number of outstanding researchers—people with established reputations and unusually high research ability—funded at any one time will increase from 75 to 150 by the end of five years.
Labor will also create a prestigious new fellowship to attract expatriate researchers back to Australia and to stop our best and brightest leaving our shores. We will create a substantial number of these new fellowships worth $200,000 per year for five years, including salary and research costs. These fellowships will recognise that our future as a knowledge nation will depend on keeping our best minds in Australia to create the industries, the economy and the society of the future. As the opposition leader said in Hobart, Labor believe that, while it is beneficial to Australia for our best brains to spend time overseas and to bring back their knowledge and experience, too many are having to go overseas simply because of the lack of opportunities in Australia.
So far I have been referring to the peak of what has become the education pyramid. The base of the pyramid is the schools. It is essential that the nation's education system has a firm foundation. That is why I want to refer in particular to the importance of the concept of education priority zones announced by Labor in Hobart. Country youths suffer serious disadvantages in comparison with city kids. Fewer of them finish their secondary education and fewer of them go on to tertiary education. The inequity of opportunity between country and city, like the inequity between the poor and the wealthy, has to be tackled. We need to see more country kids finish their secondary education and we need to see more country kids taking on tertiary education. The two are linked.
Labor's program of establishing education priority zones will make the Commonwealth an active partner with schools and local communities in dealing with problems holding back young Australians, particularly those in country and regional Australia. This program means setting up priority zones in areas of social and economic need and getting funds and resources to areas where they can make a difference. In each zone, which is to be selected in partnership with state and territory governments, the Commonwealth will work with local communities to develop a local plan. This will include looking at the literacy and numeracy needs of students, at how many complete their schooling, at how performance can be improved and of how the improvements can be documented. 
There will be specific Commonwealth initiatives to help meet the local needs. These may include employing specialist remedial literacy and numeracy teachers, providing mentors and work experience, and funding extra professional development for teachers. What a contrast there is between this positive approach of Labor and the negative anti-state education mentality of the federal education minister. In 1996, Dr Kemp brought in the enrolment benchmark adjustment or EBA scheme, which takes money from the state schools when the proportion of private enrolments increases, even when the public system is growing. The scheme is discriminatory. Labor will abolish it and will channel those funds back into public schools.  
Over the past three years the EBA has taken more than $60 million from government schools around Australia, while those same schools have enrolled more than 26,000 extra students. The EBA is inequitable and unjust and has aroused unnecessary divisions between state and private schools. Even many private schools, which are the supposed beneficiaries of the Howard government's EBA policy, privately oppose it on the grounds that it has provoked resentment towards private schools from the community. 
Everybody knows about Dr Kemp's obsession with the extremes of economic rationalism and his dislike for the public education system. When Liberal politicians like Dr Kemp think of education, they think only of the elite grammar schools. The state schools, the Catholic and non-Catholic parish schools barely exist as far as the would-be blue blood Liberals such as the education minister are concerned. But it is the state schools and the parish schools that make up the real world—the world of most Australian kids—not the world that the conservatives like to think of, inhabited by only the rich. 
Australia needs a national education policy that is not just a shield for the privileged but a pathway along which the nation can advance together towards a common goal. That goal is not only prosperity but also fairness in the IT age, ensuring that the community as a whole and not just the lucky few shares in the fruits of technological advance in the third millennium. We need a Commonwealth government that will raise the standards of our schools and the opportunities of youth across the board. Labor's pledge to abolish the EBA is part of our plan to make the knowledge nation a fairer nation. 
Labor wants to help raise the standards in all our schools. That is why it is important that Labor is committed in government to establishing the concept of the learning gateway. This is an information site on the Internet that teachers, parents and students can use for professional development and curriculum content as well as links to overseas and domestic education information. Parents will be able to use this gateway to obtain access to a wide range of information on their child's performance. This will include what is in their child's curriculum as well as information on assessment criteria and sample tests. 
Teachers will have access through the web site to professional development advice, information on interesting new teaching ideas, curriculum resources and other material. Students will be able to use the learning gateway to gain access to information for use at home and at school to assist them with essay writing and problem solving and to complete self tests. The gateway will also provide after-hours access online for teachers' advice on a variety of subjects. The learning gateway will also provide high-quality online content relevant to vocational education and training courses, adult and community education, and tertiary education. It will help adult education students find the right course and make it easier to enrol and complete their studies with distinction. 
In addition to these education measures announced recently, Labor will also implement two new programs designed to improve the quality of teaching in our schools. As previously outlined by our education spokesperson, Michael Lee, a Beazley Labor government will establish two programs to improve the quality of teaching. Firstly, Labor's teacher development contracts will be a partnership between the federal government and teachers who share a commitment to improving student results by lifting teacher quality. Teachers forced to teach outside their areas of expertise will be the first to be offered the new contracts. In some states, through no fault of their own, almost 25 per cent of people teaching maths and science are simply not qualified to do so. The shortages are most obvious in country towns. 
Secondly, a federal Labor government will also offer teacher excellence scholarships to high achieving school leavers to study education with a focus on areas of undersupply—currently maths, science and IT. Labor will strive to ensure that, by 2010, nine out of 10 young people leave their teens with a year 12 qualification or its equivalent and to ensure that all Australians achieve some kind of formal education or training qualification. As more youths complete their secondary education, more will take on the challenges of higher education. It is only a Labor government that will provide an equality of education for all.  ",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Theophanous, Dr Andrew, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—It is my pleasure to be speaking on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. In the context of the debate we are having, it is a good thing that, in Australia at the moment, both sides of politics are starting to focus on the importance of education—indeed, Independents and other groups are also interested in this issue. But what we need is a constructive and positive approach to the issues. I am afraid that I have been very disappointed with the performance of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in this matter, especially in question time. The minister knows a lot about higher education because he is a former academic. He also knows that there is a difference between a valid argument on the issues and abuse of your opponent. When the minister comes into the House and talks about education issues, in general we have seen him talk a very small amount about what he is trying to do or what his perspective is and deliver a great deal of talk attacking the Labor Party or indeed anybody else who disagrees with him. 
It is one thing to argue against someone on the basis of valid arguments on the policies, the philosophy or the approach; it is entirely a different matter to abuse other people simply because they have a different view. The example that the minister actually sets is a very poor example for people who are entering higher education, because it ties in with the general point that I want to make. What is the essential element of higher education as distinct from education at school? The point about higher education, university education in particular, is that we try to educate people not merely to learn facts and figures but to actually put forward a case and to argue, on the basis of the facts and figures and on the basis of theories and philosophies, the point of view which they want to put forward.
The minister, in his approach to this House on education issues, does not actually give a very good example to students in higher education, because he does not argue the point but tends to abuse his opponents. I would appeal to the minister—because I know he is capable of much better—that in this House, when discussing education issues, we should focus on the constructive debate about the issues and not on the abuse of one's opponents. Having said that, I repeat again that it is good that we are going to have a debate on education issues, and maybe it will be an important topic coming up to the general election.
But higher education, as I said, differs from school education in this respect: what are we trying to do in universities and colleges; what is the ideal that we are trying to put forward through these institutions? Are these ideals being met at the moment? I suspect that they are not—because there are many people graduating with university degrees who are not taught to think, argue or present a point of view and are not taught, in other words, the value of the pursuit of knowledge: they do not have a thirst or a hunger for knowledge. They graduate from universities, and colleges very often, with a degree behind them, with some knowledge of computers or the IT revolution but with very little in the way of clear thinking, logical thinking and an understanding of theories and facts or the ability to put things together to present a coherent argument. It is rather sad when people graduate not from high school but even from university and do not have those capacities.
One of the reasons that this has happened is that, in many ways, the universities have become like production lines in factories. They have become like production lines in factories to push out graduates in all sorts of fields, because the more numbers they put out, the more rewarded they are, one way or the other—either by the students, by the government or by the community. But what about the question of standards? What about the question of values in education?
The minister is very proud of focusing on literacy and numeracy in primary schools. That is as it should be; that is an important thing. But education does not end with literacy and numeracy in primary schools. Education involves more than this: other values, especially when you get to university. What is the minister doing to promote those values—for example, the value of research? Look at what is happening with research. The government put out a paper on research in 1999 called `Knowledge and innovation: a policy statement on research and research training'. It trumpeted the idea that it was going to do a hell of a lot of things for research. Unfortunately for the government, the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee felt that the paper was totally inadequate. The reason was that they felt that, in fact, the amount of money being spent on research and the amount committed to research was totally insufficient for the goals which that paper presented. 
The Parliamentary Library has done some research in this matter, and in the Bills Digest there are a couple of excellent tables, and I refer in particular to table 3, on higher education research programs, 1996 to 2002. I want to make a couple of comments about those. I wonder whether, with the permission of the minister, we could include this table in Hansard.
Leave granted.

(a)	These programs are not funded under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, but from annual appropriations on a financial year basis.
—If you look at the actual figures for funding for total research, these are rounded to year 2000 figures and you will see something very interesting. They go up, even in the first couple of years of the Howard government; but then we start to see a slowdown and, by the year 2002, we see that the figure is $433.7 million, which is in fact the lowest figure since 1996. So we have had an increase, as it should have been, for education in terms of research. But, if you look at the figures, the amount is $411.9 in 1996; $435.7 in 1997; $461.1 in 1998; $448.7 in 1999—it is going down now; $452.4 in 2000, a slight increase; $453.2 in 2001; and a whopping drop to $433.7 in 2002. So we are actually going to have a reduction in research funding.
How can the minister talk about his commitment to education and research, including higher education research, when we have this drop? Why did the minister allow this to happen in the budget? Is the minister going to answer these questions in parliament or is he simply going to get up and abuse people because they raise these issues? What does the minister have to say about this table from the Parliamentary Library in relation to the research? Does he have an analysis of this? I hope the minister will come and actually respond to this bill and give us some account of what is happening in the area of research.
As I said before, I am very happy to see a debate in relation to education. The government made a commitment in this knowledge and innovation paper to the principle of research. Let us see some dollars, let us see some commitment to these principles—or does he expect PhD students, post-doctoral students and others, when trying to teach in universities with increased class sizes, to do research without there being sufficient funding for it? Is this what he is saying? I hope not because you really do need to back your vision with resources when it comes to research in a whole range of areas.
Speaking about tertiary education, especially university education, we have a situation where the minister has taken a significant amount out of the system in terms of total investment. The minister keeps denying this, but the figures cannot be denied. This has actually happened. I will tell you what else has happened as a result of this. The minister thinks that he can maintain a certain level of university positions while taking out this $1 billion from higher education. But if this is going to happen, what will happen? What will happen is that class sizes will get bigger and bigger. In some subjects, in some universities, you cannot even get inside the doors of the lecture theatres. There are so many students enrolled in the lectures that, if they all turn up, they do not fit. This is true. I know this because I have a daughter at university and I know what is happening there.
What else is happening? Let us contemplate the tutorial system. Tutorials used to be where you had a group of students numbering 12 to 15, 17 at the absolute most. The tutor used to know the students, used to interact with the students, used to ask them questions and used to encourage debate. What happens now? Tutorials get to 22, 23, 24 people, more in some cases, and half of the students do not even bother to turn up because nobody pays much attention to them. They are discouraged. The interest is not there.
What is happening to our universities? I have raised this matter with the minister privately. His attitude is, `Oh well, it'll be all right.' But it will not be all right; it will not be all right without action. The vice-chancellors have made the point that there cannot be even a marginal increase in the salaries of academics—and, after all, academics have to have some increase in their salaries just like everyone else to keep up with things. The universities are told, `Well, you have to fund this increase in salaries from your own resources. You cannot actually get another grant from the government. Oh no, never mind that.' So what happens? As I said, fewer tutors are employed, tutorials get larger, the number of lectures is cut so the number of people going to the lectures has to increase and the actual quality of both lectures and tutorials in universities goes down.
We do not want this. This is not the quality that we need in higher education. This is not just a factory production process. We need our students in universities to be able to get into the pursuit of knowledge. We need them to be able to get into debate with some understanding. They cannot do this if there is a situation in which universities are too crowded in terms of room and teachers available. Why don't we do something about this? In this matter the minister cannot say, `Well, you know, budget resources are just too limited.' The situation is that the federal government has been able to find money in the budget for all sorts of wild schemes, but somehow it cannot find enough money to fund what is one of the most important sectors in our nation: higher and university education.
I referred before to research. What is happening with research—this has been pointed out by a number of people in this debate—means that many of our best researchers, many of our best professors, many of our best lecturers are simply leaving the country; they are going overseas. They are doing this not only because the salaries offered are better but also because the conditions offered are better. You cannot expect a person to do double the number of lectures and tutorials they would do in other comparative countries and then also the research on top. It is just not possible, and people give up. They say, `Oh well, here's an offer from America, here's an offer from Britain, here's an offer from Europe, here's an offer from an Asian country'—offers for reasonable conditions at universities and for reasonable research provisions, including research assistance for these professors and these people doing key research. 
I am talking about across the board, not just research in the sciences but research in the humanities as well—and that, by the way, is being increasingly drastically cut by the policies of this government. I am surprised that Professor Kemp has allowed this: after all, where did he get his training? It was in political science; it was in the humanities. More than anyone else, the minister ought to know the importance of a rounded education. That means that the humanities departments in our universities ought to be properly funded as well as the science, medical and computer faculties.
I am not saying that we can go back to the Oxford tradition, but at least we should require that every student get a general education in some humanities subjects so they know something about the general nature of philosophy, history, politics or these other subjects. Very often people graduate from universities and know nothing about the general humanities approach, and that is a pity. As Dr Kemp knows, this kind of rounded education is very important. What about a vision for that, Dr Kemp? What about a vision for that in your tertiary education or higher education policy, instead of, as I said before, mere verbal abuse of those who disagree with you or want to raise other issues?
I am very concerned that the value of higher education in terms of its contribution not only to the cultural and social development of a society but also to the economic development of a society is not sufficiently appreciated by the minister and the government. A report was recently released by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, one of the most reputable organisations in Australia in this kind of research. What did they say? In the report which is entitled Returns to Investment in Higher Education, they said that in fact higher education provides a very rich reward for society for every person who goes through and achieves a degree in higher education, especially a good degree. The average rate of return is the equivalent of 15 per cent per graduate per year. This is a great investment by this country. Leaving aside the cultural arguments, the social arguments and the arguments about the improvement of society and the individual, education of this kind is a great investment in economic terms. When the Treasurer and the minister frame next year's budget, they ought to look at reversing these trends in research and general funding to universities and give a lot more resources—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I would like to congratulate the member for Calwell for his comments on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 and members on this side for their contributions to this important discussion. I rise to support the second reading amendment to this bill moved by the member for Dobell on 29 June 2000 in this House.
Before the 1999 and 2000 budgets were brought down, the Treasurer commented that both budgets would emphasise education. So it was with interest that I set out to see the emphasis on education in the budgets, but the story that I found was very different from the sentiments of an alleged emphasis on education. Since 1996, almost $1 billion has been cut from universities, almost $240 million has been cut from vocational education and training, HECS charges have increased—as you well know, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio—and differentials have increased between courses. Almost $1 billion has been taken from students, plus there have been cuts to students of more than half a billion dollars. The EBA has cut some $60 million from federal funding of public schools. Indeed, the proportion of federal funding going to public schools has dropped between 1996 and 2003 from 41.5 per cent to 32.2 per cent. It has been estimated that there is a deficit in education of some $3 billion because of the Howard-Kemp cuts. 
What of research and development, which was so ably discussed by the previous speaker? The evidence is quite clear: Australia is the only advanced Western country where private business research and development is falling both in real and nominal forms. Public research is declining because of the butchery of this government and its cuts to higher education. There is a common call from prominent persons in Australia involved in research and development for Australia to lift its investment in research and development.
Earlier in the debate, my colleague the shadow minister, Michael Lee, pointed out the size of cuts to regional universities totalling $171 million. For instance, at James Cook University, there are cuts of $16 million; Newcastle, $27 million; Charles Sturt, $21 million; Wollongong, $18 million; Southern Cross, $11 million; Deakin, $25 million; New England, $18 million; Ballarat, $4 million; Central Queensland, $13 million; the University of Southern Queensland, $16 million; and our own Australian Maritime College in Tasmania, $2 million. So far since 1996 we have had massive cuts in funding to public schools, TAFE and universities in both operating grants and research and development. There have been increased costs to students for HECS, a reduction in student assistance and on top of that a new tax.
On top of the new tax again, we have a minister with a blueprint to totally deregulate universities and undermine public education from primary to tertiary levels. When we turned to the budget in the light of the Treasurer's prediction that it would be a health and education budget, like we did in 1999, what did we find? Eleven lines in the Treasurer's speech devoted to education. What of the substance of the commitment in the budget? We had only an extra $17 million—that is, $17 million across the whole area of education for new education initiatives in 2000-01. Forward estimates from 2000 to 2004 contain only $62.1 million, which averages out to 86c per person per year.
There is no grand plan for education and the nation here—11 bland lines in the Treasurer's speech and a few to no initiatives in either spending or programs. You have to look elsewhere for that, and fortunately that belongs with this side of the House in the blueprint of the Knowledge Nation. This practical, responsible plan is premised on the essential importance of education and training to the social, economic and personal needs of Australians.
What is this government's view? Take for example the issue raised earlier by the member for Dobell concerning current HECS debts to graduates. More than one million students who are still paying off their HECS debts are going to be hit by an unfair retrospective slug because of the GST inflation spike—a spike we are already beginning to feel. HECS debts are increased by the CPI which means that in this year HECS debts will be indexed by the full inflation spike. On current estimates, that will cost the average student $700 because this government has not discounted the CPI increase by the GST inflation spike. In all, nearly $200 million will be ripped off students with HECS debts because of the unfair retrospective tax slug of this government. It is a spike in every sense of the word, I would suggest.
Minister Kemp, of course, tried to deny all this. He threw figures about claiming that students with HECS debts of $20,000 were better off because of low inflation—forgetting that until 1997 it was impossible to have a debt as high as $20,000 in the first place—or claiming that a graduate on $28,000 would be some $762 better off because of the new tax cuts. He was forgetting as usual to point out that until 1997 such a student would be making no repayments whatsoever—that is until the coalition reduced the payment threshold. What is the result of Minister Kemp's obsession with the user-pays principle? This year's graduates have to cope with a doubling of HECS charges every year, much earlier repayments of that debt, an increase of the HECS debt of up to $700 because of the GST inflation spike being included in the CPI this year, and GST increases on a range of goods and of course services. A Kemp $762 tax cut will quickly disappear in the light of much higher debt repayments and higher costs of goods and services because of the GST. 
I mentioned earlier the fact that, given the PM's promise of an education budget in 1999, and the Treasurer's promise of a health and education budget this time around, one could be excused for being puzzled—puzzled because there is absolutely no proof in this pudding that education receives much priority at all under this government. What we tend to have is a minister at odds with nearly every educational institution and professional body going, a minister increasingly isolated within educational communities that he is there to work with, a minister high on expectation and standards but low on practice and delivery. He is quick to blame but slow to take responsibility himself. If it is not the AEU causing problems, it is the National Union of Students, the National Tertiary Education Union or even the Vice-Chancellors Committee.
In October 1999, Minister Kemp acknowledged a crisis in higher education. It was there in black and white in his cabinet submission, and indeed you might remember this. Let me refresh our memories on this because it is directly relevant to this bill. In his own submission, Dr Kemp admits, `Universities are currently in a difficult financial position.' He said, `Already eight institutions appear to be operating at deficit and some regional campuses are at risk.' He also said, `There are higher student-staff ratios and less frequent lecture and tutorial contact.' Again, he said, `Universities have outdated technology and, as a result, universities are progressively less capable of delivering what governments want, industry needs and the community expects.' There is, in Minister Kemp's words, `a perception of declining quality'. This is not our side saying this; this is the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. This is in light of this government starving universities of funds since the savage $840 million cuts in 1996 and all the additional slices and cuts ever since.
What is this minister's response to his own claims about higher education? What is his blueprint contained in this budget? Nothing. A few titbits of programs but nothing of substance. Why? In his own submission to cabinet, Minister Kemp claimed:
Demand for higher education in Qld, NSW, WA and Vic is unlikely to be met.
The minister also submitted:
There is no capacity to reduce huge regional disparities in participation, and that people from “affluent capital city suburbs are 5 times more likely to go to University” than people from the least affluent areas.
He goes on to say:
Universities are currently in a difficult financial position.
So where is the plan to tackle this situation? Where is the funding to at least restore pre-1996-97 Commonwealth funding of higher education? There is a plan but it is not given any effect in this budget except through omission. The minister has a plan—it is in black and white and it is in the Kemp submission to cabinet. What he seeks to do after creating a crisis is to exploit that crisis—the solution is deregulation of fees. He has a voucher system with no guaranteed minimum amount of funding for institutions and the introduction of a student loan scheme with a real rate of interest.
Kim Beazley and Michael Lee offer the knowledge nationas a comprehensive blueprint for the future. The government has no stated plan except for the Kemp submission. This budget suggests that it is still on the cards because it does nothing to address the serious deficiencies outlined by the minister in his cabinet submission. I assume that this is still the case, unless these deficiencies have been magically overcome. The Kemp anti-higher education plan does come to light however, particularly in the machinations of the Kemp-Reith two per cent funding stick—or carrot as it is sometimes referred to—forcing universities to implement workplace reforms. The two per cent represents in essence nothing more than $259 million in conditional funding for university salaries. 
I do not think this minister can really appreciate what is happening in regional Australia concerning higher education. His obsession with deregulation and cutting funds to public education has had a dramatic effect in my electorate in particular and in Tasmania as a whole. You see, our university is a state university. It stands alone and is definitely not a sandstone university. It tries to offer access to higher education throughout the state with campuses in Hobart, Launceston and Burnie. It has long grappled with cost cutting in the face of an urgent need to lift retention rates into higher education. There is a need—and the University of Tasmania has attempted to meet this in an environment of dwindling Commonwealth support, particularly since 1996. 
I understand from Professor Don McNicol, the Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of Tasmania, that after the university's annual education profiles discussion with the Commonwealth and on the university's own analysis and the Commonwealth's projections of the university's financial position, the following points can be made: there will be no net growth in student places over the period and income from the Commonwealth will be static. Expenditure is also projected to be static, dependent on the outcome of the current enterprise bargaining round, which may mean that the university will need to absorb the level of salary increases in excess of the level of indexation in its grant and which will make current staffing levels unsustainable. Related to this, the university is uncertain whether, after the next enterprise bargaining round is complete, it would be eligible for the two per cent available from the Commonwealth for compliance with Minister Kemp's requirements for industrial outcomes. Participation rates in higher education remain a critical issue for the state and it will be difficult, as Professor McNicol points out, to achieve significant outcomes in a no growth funding environment.
In the time remaining I would like to offer some lessons to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs on Tasmania and higher education issues. Low participation rates correlate closely to socioeconomic factors. That is a fact. Participation is unlikely to be increased under present government policy with subsidised student places capped and opportunities for expansion through fees only. These mechanisms assume excess demand. The Tasmanian problem is to create demand for higher education with the purpose of improving economic and social conditions. A prerequisite is an adequate supply of government subsidised places. From 1990 to 1996, funded places at the University of Tasmania increased from 7,745 to 9,205 and the state participation increased from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent. The growth was achieved despite relatively low student demand measured by the number of applicants. In other words—and it is very important that this lesson be learned—the improvement in participation rates was supply led rather than market led. 
Higher education participation rates in Tasmania remain significantly below the national averages for all ages—in Tasmania, 2.5 per cent, yet for Australia, 3.2 per cent; for younger people between 15 and 19 years, 7.9 per cent in Tasmania and 10.7 per cent for the nation; and for 20 to 24 years, 13.9 per cent in Tasmania and 15 per cent for the nation. The pattern is similar for vocational education and training. An additional 3,300 places would bring the Tasmania higher participation rate to the national average, including 1,690 places to bridge the gap for 15- to 29-year-olds. 
North West Tasmania in my electorate of Braddon is especially disadvantaged with a participation rate approximately half that for the northern and southern regions. There are opportunities to strengthen demand from the following key groups of potential students: able school leavers in the north and north-west of the state who do not seek to continue with further education or training and people aged 25 years and over including those with VET qualifications. One of the major problems we have is that it is not easy to leave home to study, particularly on the north-west coast. After doing one year at the study centre at Burnie, students are required to move away from home. As I have mentioned in this place many times before, that could mean up to an additional $10,000 per student per year on top of the normal costs for university education. Where is the support for those students?
In terms of research and development, the precise impact of the government's white paper is far from clear, but the university's estimate is that `18 per cent of the Commonwealth operating grant is at stake'. These funds will depend on the university maintaining its relative research performance. Changes to the research performance index will most advantage those universities able to increase industry support. Clearly location will be a factor and in Tasmania access to industry funds is limited. Government policy is understandably to increase industry support for research, but the particular mechanisms chosen may disadvantage regionally based institutions such as the University of Tasmania. The university is concentrating its research efforts into four main themes. The university is well placed to develop further research that will stimulate the state economy, particularly in the theme areas, and aspects of the emerging information economy. The university's contribution occurs through staff expertise, research training, infrastructure and research management skills. These elements have been built up over many years and provide Tasmania with important social capital. They need to be supported, not threatened through cuts.  
In terms of staffing, from 1996 to 1999 a combination of Commonwealth operating grant cuts and cost increases forced staff numbers at the University of Tasmania down by 145.6 full-time positions or 9.6 per cent. The reduction of academic staff numbers was 96.5 FTE positions or 13.6 per cent. These figures exclude casual staff numbers, which increased by 29 FTE positions or 14.8 per cent over the same period. There is consequentially very real pressure on courses. Smaller courses are under threat and in larger courses student staff ratios are frequently above 25 to one and in some instances are up to 33 to one. The distribution of staff resources is a management issue but complicated by multiple operating campuses. Further loss of staff positions will be very difficult to manage. Job losses are simply inevitable unless salary increases are tied to increased revenue, provided through performance contracts or grant supplication. There is little or no light in this bill to brighten the way of the University of Tasmania.
Finally, I would like to commend the provision of extra funding of $1.446 million in 2001 and $2.891 million in 2002 for 100 new places a year for medical students on bonded scholarships. It was a Labor initiative in 1998—it was criticised by Minister Kemp as unconstitutional—and contained in this budget under `education' because of the advocacy of the health minister, not the education minister. But this should not surprise us, should it?",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—In the time remaining to me in this debate before the adjournment tonight, I would just like to make a few comments on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 that we are now debating. There cannot be a more critical issue for Australia than the issue of educating our work force for the challenges of this century. We know that the cutting edge for economies in this new millennium will be their capacity to innovate, to adopt new technologies, their capacity to change their production cultures, and the capacity of the work force to acquire new skills. Of course, that depends very much on having an educational infrastructure which is world class. Sadly, in the last decade here in Australia, and particularly over the last five years, we have seen some very ominous signs emerging in the funding of that educational infrastructure. Coincidentally, that has occurred at the times that we have seen conservative governments come to power in my home state of Victoria and Liberal and National Party governments come to power at the national level. Under the guise of reducing budget deficits, they have issued an ideological agenda which has seen their nation sold short and quite unprepared for the challenges of this new millennium: the economic challenges, the social challenges, the environmental challenges and, for people in rural and regional Australia, the challenge of coming to terms with some very deep-seated problems that beset those communities.
I can recall when I was elected as the member for Corio in 1993 that the Geelong community was very proud of its educational assets. It was a community that, over a long period of time, had heavily invested in public and private education, to the point where we had an educational infrastructure second to none as far as regional and urban communities in Australia were concerned. Then we saw the beginnings of a development that has seen education in Geelong suffer considerably. First it was an assault on the primary and secondary educational infrastructures by the Kennett government. Then came the assault on the TAFE and tertiary educational infrastructure by the Howard coalition government. But it was not only that: the cutbacks that were sponsored by the state Liberal government and the federal Liberal government cut deeply into early childhood development and into every learning situation. And so we have now a particular record as far as the education and the training of its community is concerned of which Australia cannot be proud. 
We have seen over those years cuts to education across the board—I refer here to TAFE, to universities and to secondary schools—from Commonwealth sources in the region of $3 billion. Those cuts in the tertiary sector have been in the order of $1 billion. The universities that have borne a considerable burden in this regard have been the regional universities of Australia—those very good universities that have served the needs of rural and regional Australia over the past 20 years. In many instances, it is those regional universities that provide a very essential research link between the local economic base and the tertiary education base. These regional universities have suffered cuts in the order of $171 million. I think we would all argue that any government coming to power can quite legitimately pursue its own educational agenda. But, when that educational agenda enters the ideological zone and operates against the national interest, that is the time when the Australian community has a great cause for concern.
In my own locality we have a university—Deakin University—of world renown. This particular regional university has, on a couple of occasions, won the University of the Year award. It took the challenge that was put to it by Labor in government. It has restructured its financial affairs and its curriculum and it is now a world leader in distance education, a world leader in research in many areas and a world leader in integrating university programs into workplaces not only in its own community, not only in Australia, but throughout the world.
The Geelong community is very proud of the efforts of the academics at Deakin University, and it is proud of the achievements of many of its students. But the community is concerned about the future of its university, and it is a concern that has been echoed in rural and regional Australia, as many communities view with dismay the curtailing of many of the courses that are being offered by their regional campuses and the declining numbers of students attending those courses. The university administrators have had to make some very difficult choices with regard to what sorts of courses they keep and what sorts of courses they offer. Invariably when those choices are made it is the communities in rural and regional Australia that have suffered the most from the cutbacks by the Liberal and National parties. The Labor Party appreciates quite deeply that the future of this nation will come off the back of its research and development effort, its capacity to innovate and the adaptability of its work force.
I was at a function on Saturday night. I did not see the honourable member for Corangamite there. I see he is in the chamber tonight. I usually run into him at some of these functions. The function was the Vietnam veterans' annual dinner. And, of course, we all know the problems that the Vietnam veterans community has experienced down through the years. I was interested to speak to the wife of the president of the Geelong Vietnam Veterans Association about her return to education. I do not think she would mind me saying this. In her working career she had occupied many jobs in support of her family but had decided to go back to the Gordon TAFE to do her VCE. She spoke of how she was enjoying that experience, and she was musing about where this would lead her. She was full of hope and expectation about where it might take her in personal terms and in terms of supporting the education of her own children. Here she was extending her own educational opportunity with the objective in mind of further supporting her own children's education. She could see—as many working people see—that the key to their future economic opportunity lies in education and training, the very areas that have been slashed and burned by this very conservative and short-sighted government. 
—That's rubbish, and you know it.
—It is not rubbish. The honourable members opposite always arc up when the truth is told. It is an extraordinary situation where the honourable members opposite can come in here on the back of an ideological obsession, justify emasculating the education and training effort of our higher educational institutions and then claim in some paltry way that this is looking after the future of Australia. It is tortured logic. If you want to mount that argument you will be the lonely ones in that intellectual castle because, as you know—and the honourable member for Corangamite knows this, because he is on the board of a very good educational institution in our region—the cutting-edge for the rural sector over the next 15 to 20 years is going to be the capacity of farmers to adapt to change, the capacity to upskill and the capacity of the sector to engage in meaningful research and development, and these are the very areas that you have driven the boot into. That is strange logic. Then again, I accept the tortured logic by which the coalition comes to some of these decisions. I accept it, but the Australian people do not. The Australian people want opportunity, and they want a future for their country. They will not cop the sorts of short-sighted cuts that we have had to education on the basis of some ideological obsession that is trotted out by a leader who has no perception of where this country should be heading in the new millennium. Mr Deputy Speaker, I did happen to go to—
—Mr Speaker.
—Oh, it is Mr Speaker.
—I understand. The member for Corio will continue his speech in the time that remains.
—Mr Speaker, I am under intense provocation from the member for Corangamite, who I am surprised can come into this House to justify a cut of $25 million to Deakin University, a cut of $171 million to regional universities, a cut of $1 billion to higher education throughout this country and then have the gall to sit on the board of an educational institution and claim that he has the education and training of the rural sector at heart. I find that a little bit hard to cop.
I did attend recently the opening of the Autogen gene chip microarray laboratory at Deakin University. This is a joint venture between the private sector and a company owned by Joseph Gutnick. I know the honourable member for Corangamite barracks for Geelong and Melbourne, so he is obviously a good friend of the president of the Melbourne Football Club. I am very pleased that Joe Gutnick and his company have invested with Deakin University in this state-of-the-art exciting new gene technology. It is an indication of the great potential that this university has in developing these new technologies. But the university cannot do it with an obstructive government. It cannot do it with a short-sighted government. It cannot do it with a government that is hell-bent on foisting its own ideological obsessions on the Australian people and denying them the real educational opportunities they so much desire.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-08-14,"—I rise to bring to the attention of the parliament an issue that has a direct and daily impact on every Australian family. I am referring to the fact that the fuel efficiency of the Australian vehicle fleet is at the bottom of the list for OECD countries. According to recent figures, Australia's national average fuel consumption for new passenger vehicles is 8.9 litres per 100 kilometres. By comparison the Italian NAFC figure was 6.8 litres per 100 kilometres, the UK figure was 7.4 litres per 100 kilometres and the New Zealand figure was 8.5 litres per 100 kilometres. There is no doubt that these figures reflect the lifestyles of these different countries and the ages of their cars, but the fact that Australia is at the bottom of the list presents a serious challenge to our manufacturers and governments.
According to the NRMA in a submission made to a recent government inquiry, virtually no improvement in vehicle fuel efficiency has occurred over the past seven years. In fact, according to recent reports, the original FJ Holden had a better fuel consumption than present models. It is clear from the statements of the federal government that there is a complete lack of understanding of the seriousness of this matter, just as there is a profound lack of understanding of what needs to be done to change the situation. The effect of this unacceptable wastefulness, compounded by the GST, is that Australian families are now forced to spend a record proportion of their incomes on transport. For example, according to a recent Sydney Morning Herald story, the average Sydney household spent $6,127 on transport in 1998-99, up $1,300 from the previous year, with the growth mainly caused by increasing petrol prices. 
Simply blaming rising oil prices for these increases, as the government has done, without considering the impact of poor vehicle fuel economy ignores a large part of the problem. The miserable fuel economy of Australia's transport sector has a synergistic effect on numerous economic and environmental problems. Poor fuel economy adds to our growing balance of payments deficit because we are forced to import increasing amounts of oil. At current prices, we are importing more than $2 billion of oil annually. Poor fuel economy increases urban air pollution because inefficient vehicles consume more fuel and release larger volumes of air pollutants. Poor fuel economy adds to Australia's already excessive emissions of greenhouse gases because of the high fuel consumption of inefficient vehicle engines.
Senator Hill recently tried to explain the increase of 16.5 per cent in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 1998 as being the result of economic growth. This is despite Australia's Kyoto commitment to cutting emissions to eight per cent above 1990 levels by 2008 or, at the latest, by 2012. Apparently most of the increase has come from transport—that is, cars and trucks—and yet the Minister for the Environment and Heritage has made no statement about the measures the government intends to take to reduce these emissions. All he is reported as saying is, `It's a reminder that the challenge is a difficult challenge.'
We already know that, Minister, and we also know that there is a significant opportunity for improvement. As Professor Ian Lowe, one of the government's more trenchant critics, has repeatedly warned, Australian industry lags the rest of the developed world by about 25 per cent in energy efficiency. Is the minister aware that the United States government's Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles scheme requires that American automobile manufacturers develop and have ready for market mid-size cars that get 34 kilometre per litre or 80 miles per gallon by 2004? Such a vehicle would be about four times as efficient as today's comparable Australian made cars.
While Sydney commuters struggle with a saturated public transport system and the NSW Labor government spends millions trying to deal with ever growing demand, not one cent of federal funding has been made available by this government for improving rail based public transport. The federal government's motivation for this policy appears to be the belief that all transport should be privately owned and road based. Apparently government should withdraw from the provision of public transport. Under this policy, building roads with taxpayers' money for the uncharged use of road freight operators does not seem to be a misuse of public funds, just as handing out billions in diesel fuel cash grants is seen as a fair way to spend other road users' fuel excise. It is extraordinary that in 2000 we have a government that is so short-sighted and so deaf to the warning of experts who say that the world is on the verge of long-term fuel shortages. Instead of squandering billions on fuel rebate handouts the government should be investing in the research and development needed to produce the new generation of vehicles that will make significantly more efficient use of available fuel supplies.

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2000-08-14," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 12 April 2000:
(1) Further to the answer to question No. 1071 (Hansard, 17 February 2000, page 13751), did the 16 redundancies at the Wynnum office occur at the same time.
(2) What distinction is made between the 7 bona fide and 9 non-bona fide redundancies.
(3) Who made the decision to offer either bona fide or non-bona fide redundancies.
(4) On what basis were the 9 employees offered the non-bona fide redundancy.
(5) Has the Wynnum office recruited new staff since May 1999; if so, have any of those new staff been employed to perform the same duties as those 9 non-bona fide redundant employees.
(6) Was a decision made to make the 9 non-bona fide employees bona fide redundancies.
(7) Was any ruling or advice sought from the Australian Taxation Office in relation to the manner in which the 9 non-bona fide redundancies were to be treated; if so, what was that ruling/advice.
(8) When were the 9 non-bona fide redundancy employees advised that their redundancies would be treated as non-bona fide.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Centrelink Offices: Queensland</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,16,1,question
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2000-08-14,"—The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
	(1) No. The voluntary redundancies took place over the period May 1998 to July 1999.
	(2) Redundancies in Centrelink are determined in accordance with the 1999-2002 Centrelink Development Agreement (page 88). Fourteen of the 16 were offered voluntary redundancies in accordance with the criteria: “The services of the employee cannot be effectively used because of technological or other changes in the work methods of Centrelink or changes in the nature, extent or organisation of the functions of Centrelink” (point 2, section 36). This criteria defines a `non-bona fide' redundancy. A bona fide redundancy is where the officer's position is excess to requirements or the officer's position has been moved to another locality and the officer is unwilling to move. In the case of the Wynnum CSC, only two of the 16 redundancies met the latter criteria. The remainder were offered as non-bona fide redundancies.   
	In preparing this further advice, investigations at the area level have indicated that there was an error in the original breakdown in the classification of bona and non-bona fide redundancies at Wynnum as advised in my response to question no 1071. However, all staff were provided with a correct written estimate of their final payments, including taxation liability, prior to their accepting the redundancy.      
	(3) The Area Manager, Brisbane.    
	(4) See answer to question 2.    
	(5) Yes. In the period from 1 January 1998, 22 staff have been recruited to the Wynnum/Capalaba CSC, seven of these since May 1999. These staff are performing the work of those staff who accepted non-bona fide redundancies as well as of other staff who exited Centrelink during this period for other reasons.
	(6) It was the intention that the 14 redundancies offered to officers be non-bona fide redundancies and no decision was made to change them.
	(7) Advice was sought from the Australian Taxation Office which in part stated “In the situation covered by paragraph (b), the job is still there and the employee will be replaced by another employee to do the work. The situation therefore does not meet the criteria to qualify as a bona fide redundancy”.
	(8) All CSO's were advised by the CSC Manager or Assistant Manager that the basis of the redundancy offer was paragraph (b) `not adapting well to change' and therefore non-bona fide. In all cases these discussions took place before the officers accepted redundancy offers.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Centrelink Offices: Queensland</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,16,1,answer
