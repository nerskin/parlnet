Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:32):  I rise to speak on Supply Bill (No. 1) 2016-17, Supply Bill (No. 2) 2016-17 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2016-17. At the outset I make clear that the opposition will be supporting these bills; Labor will not block supply. But let us remember that the only reason these bills are necessary is the chaos and dysfunction of the Turnbull government—a government without a plan and without a clue, a government that had the Governor-General prorogue this parliament between elections for the first time in 40 years in order to bring us back here two weeks ago to fulfil its desire to create a trigger for a simultaneous dissolution. Yet instead of using that time to make progress on a range of legislation the government had us sit here for just two days, and now we find ourselves back here having to deal with a large number of bills that the government could easily have brought on two weeks ago. The truth is that when it comes to handling parliamentary business this government is at sea and adrift, and this has been their position in the Senate for the past two years.


But, of all the bills coming into the Senate this week, these supply bills are the greatest sign of a government in panic and a government that has hit the emergency button—not because it is running out of money but because the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, is running out of credibility with the Australian people. An election cannot come soon enough for Mr Turnbull. But to have an election before August this year he has to call a double dissolution. Well, we know he has the trigger he needs—and thanks to the support of the Australian Greens for his Senate voting changes he has the keys in the ignition. However, the timing set down in the Constitution stipulates that the writs cannot be issued less than six months before the expiry of the House, and, as such, as we all know, there is a deadline for Mr Turnbull of Wednesday 11 May.


There was, of course, one big problem: the budget was scheduled to be presented on Tuesday 10 May. Now, of course it is the government that sets the date of the budget. They propose the timing for the parliamentary sittings, and the chambers concur. That is what happened this year. But the unfortunate collision of dates, which has been known for 2½ years, is something that was apparently overlooked when the government proposed a sitting pattern in October of last year. Anyone who thinks this is part of a grand strategy: think again. This parliament would not have passed the appropriation bills in under a day, so here we are, faced with temporary supply bills to ensure the essential functions of government can continue. This package of bills is required to ensure the ordinary functions of government continue in the context of a double dissolution election, and funding is being provided to see the ordinary functions of government through to November, by which time, I hope, we will see a federal Labor government.


At the same time as the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, announced that he would be asking the Governor-General to prorogue parliament, he also announced he would be bringing the date of the budget forward one week from Tuesday, 10 May to Tuesday, 3 May. He made this announcement on Monday, 21 March 2016. We know this because the answer to my question on notice No. 3319 said this was the same day that the Secretary to the Treasury was informed that the budget would be delivered on 3 May; the same day he was told that the budget would be delivered a week earlier. I have been through a budget process a number of times and I know that the Secretary to the Treasury is a pretty integral person to the budget process, so I was most surprised to learn that the Secretary to the Treasury found out on the same day that the Prime Minister announced publicly that the budget would be brought forward a week from 10 May to 3 May 2016.


However, I was even more surprised when I read the second part of the response of the Minister representing the Treasurer to my question on notice. I asked:


(1) On what date, and at what time, was the Secretary to the Treasury first informed that the Budget would be delivered on 3 May 2016 and not 10 May 2016 as originally planned?


(2) Who advised the Secretary to the Treasury?


In response to the second question—that is, who advised the Secretary?—the answer was:


(3) The Secretary was advised through the Prime Minister's public statement on 21 March 2016.


The secretary was advised through the Prime Minister's public statement on 21 March 2016. It is one thing to be out of the loop, as the Treasurer himself was when he went on radio the morning of the announcement and confirmed, contrary to what the Prime Minister said later in the day, that the budget would be delivered on 10 May. He confirmed that just a few minutes before Mr Turnbull walked into the Prime Minister's courtyard and announced it would in fact be a week earlier. What the answer to my question on notice also suggests is that the Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Fraser, was not even in the loop; there was not a loop to be in. We were told—the media was backgrounded—that this elaborate strategy had been in train for months; that the decision to prorogue parliament and bring the budget forward was a master stroke of Mr Turnbull's genius. But this answer tells us all we need to know: the budget timing was cooked up in the Prime Minister's office when Mr Turnbull, desperate to change the narrative away from his flailing government, made the desperate move to set up a double dissolution trigger that included shifting the budget, without even telling the Treasurer or the Secretary to the Treasury.


I will now return to the contents of the bill. As I mentioned, the continuation of supply in these bills is being provided to see the ordinary functions of government through to November. They provide five-twelfths of the year's appropriation, approximately, for government entities, a standard equation based on the 12 months of the fiscal year. The exceptions to this are the Australian Electoral Commission and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They have to conduct, obviously, the federal election and the census respectively.


It is important to note that the appropriations in these bills do not contain any 2016-17 budget measures, and I thank the Minister for Finance for that fact and for communicating this to us. As these bills presume the rolling forward of the budget bottom line from this financial year to the next, they also assume the budget bottom line as it currently stands at the 2015-16 MYEFO. The MYEFO includes the impacts of measures which have not passed the parliament but still remain on the books. These include cutting $30 billion from schools, a plan to increase the cost of medicine for everybody by increasing the co-payments as part of the PBS, a plan to have the world's oldest pension age by increasing the pension age to 70, calling parents rorters and double-dippers through changes to the PPL scheme, cutting bulk-billing incentives for diagnostic imaging and pathology services, making young jobseekers wait four weeks before receiving income support, cutting the pension to 190,000 pensioners through the plan to limit overseas travel for pensioners—something that will hit migrant pensioners the hardest—and to not mention the fact that, under this government and under this government alone, the deficit doubled between the 2014 and 2015 budgets and increased again in the 2015-16 Midyear Economic and Fiscal Outlook.


Next financial year, net debt is estimated to be $100 billion higher than it was at the 2013 federal election. Net debt increased from $217.3 billion in the 2013 pre-election fiscal outlook, prepared by Finance and Treasury, to $316.5 billion in the Midyear Economic and Fiscal Outlook presented in 2015-16 for the 2016-17 financial year. Spending today is at the levels it was during the GFC and, under the Minister for Finance, who we must remember has held the portfolio since day 1 of the Abbott government, spending has hit 25.9 per cent of GDP and spending as a percentage of GDP is, on average, higher under the Abbott-Turnbull government than it was under Labor. I will say that again: spending as a percentage of GDP, on average, is higher under this government, the Abbott-Turnbull government, than it was under the Labor government. So, when the government seeks to lecture the Senate about fiscal responsibility, bear in mind that they have presided over a doubling of the deficit, higher spending on average than Labor in government and higher levels of net debt.


The scrutiny of the nation will not be on these bills today. That is because today is budget day, with the appropriation bills to be presented to the parliament later tonight. We already know that this budget will look after high-income earners and big business while costing Australian families more with cuts to schools and hospitals. Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison have choice in this budget, and we know they will always choose the top end of town over Australian families. Rather than consider Labor's sensible policies, Mr Turnbull is giving a double tax cut to people who earn the most whilst cutting services to every family who relies on schools and hospitals. The Prime Minister would rather provide tax support for property speculators buying their 10th investment property than backing reforms to make housing more affordable. The difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party could not be starker. We will put people first. The Liberals will look after high-income earners and the big end of town.


We are dealing with the supply bills to enable essential government services to continue whilst Australians go to the polls. Make no mistake: this election will be a contest between the Labor Party, which puts people first, and the Liberal Party, which will always look to vested interests. The Liberal government has and will increase the cost of everything with its cuts to family payments, cuts to Medicare and cuts to penalty rates. Labor will be supporting the bills because we will not block supply, but the Australian people know that, when it comes to the election, it is only Labor which will stand up for middle- and working-class families and it is only Labor which will put people first.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-05-03,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:44):  I would like to indicate today that the Greens will also be supporting these bills because we will not block supply, but it is extraordinary that we are in this Senate chamber debating supply bills before we have even seen the budget. That may be tabled later this evening, but it will no doubt immediately follow the Treasurer's budget speech, which we will also have no time to consider. Let us talk about what an extraordinary time in Australian politics this is. It is extraordinary because we are about to go into a double dissolution in the week that a budget has been delivered. We are doing that because of the political ambitions of Mr Malcolm Turnbull, our Prime Minister. He is forcing this country to go to an early election, taking the extraordinary measure of dissolving both houses of the parliament, to save his own political skin. He is not doing this for the Australian people; he is doing this for the Liberal Party and his leadership. The Australian people are not stupid—they are going to see through this. They know this has been a pantomime for weeks, including the very expensive proroguing and recalling of the parliament so we can come back here while this pantomime plays out. They will judge the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party on election day. I certainly hope that they vote for a change of government.


In recent days we have heard that today's budget will be about 'substantial reform'. Those two words are very important. What we have heard about in the media so far is not substantial reform. Raising the thresholds of tax brackets to provide a very small amount of money in the hip pockets of some Australians is not substantial tax reform. I must say, Mr President, while you are in the chair, that very few Tasmanians will benefit from that; nearly 82 per cent of Tasmanians earn less than $80,000 and only 12 per cent of Tasmanian women who work earn $80,000 or more. That is quite a remarkable statistic. Multinational tax avoidance measures, while welcome in principle, are baby steps towards what we need to do to eradicate tax dodging by big companies. While welcomed, I would not classify that as substantial tax reform. Spending $50 million for a study into infrastructure and how we can generate more revenue for bankers when we could have an infrastructure revolution around this country is not substantial reform. 


Let me tell you what substantial reform is. Substantial reform is reducing inequality in Australia and making this country fairer. Budgets are not just about raising revenue or reining in spending to meet some arbitrary figures—it is about making our country fairer for all Australians. We have the chance to pull levers in budgets to make Australia a better place to live—a more prosperous place for all Australians. Substantial tax reform is removing perverse incentives like negative gearing and some capital gains tax provisions. It is the wealthiest in this country who benefit from those incentives, and they have been in place for too long. We need to look at making housing more affordable for Australians. We need superannuation tax concessions so that wealthy Australians can no longer use superannuation as a rort to reduce their tax. We are looking for leadership in this budget, and so far no detail has been provided on that. Substantial tax reform is putting in place hard policies to stop the wealthy dodging tax; putting in a Buffett rule, a floor on wealthy income earners, so that they pay 30 per cent guaranteed in tax over $300,000 income. That is substantial tax reform. That not only helps makes our tax system more progressive and fairer; it would also raise $7 billion in revenue. Removing subsidies for dirty polluters—the diesel fuel rebate for the big miners—would raise another $4 billion. Taking action on climate change—putting a price on carbon that actually will have an impact on emissions—is substantial tax reform.


The Greens have led on all these issues for years and we are confident that we have the courage and the vision as a political party that the Australian people want to see this election. That is what they want for their leaders—they want courage and they want vision. Because we are having a budget the same week as we are having a double dissolution, I challenge the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party, when they release their budget documents today, to show us what their courage and their vision is for this country's future. Do not just play a small target, a low-risk strategy. You are about to force the Australian people to an early election and you are dissolving both houses of parliament—an extraordinary step on the back of an ideological piece of legislation, the ABCC. We have actually passed some good legislation in the Senate in the last three years but we are being forced to go to an early election because of the leadership ambitions of our Prime Minister, because he rules over a divided party. That is why we are going to an early election. Tonight is your chance to show your vision and leadership for the Australian people. If substantial tax reform is what you have said it is going to be then we look forward to seeing the details of how you are actually going to reduce inequality and make Australia a fairer place.


There are little memories for me in this place. During the reply speech to the Governor-General when Prime Minister Tony Abbott first started, I was sitting next to Kevin Rudd, because everybody had to come into the chamber and there were not many seats. He sat there throughout the reply speech and he kept muttering to me: 'This man has no vision. He has no ideas.' We know what ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott's ideas were: they were to rip up the carbon price and the mining tax and to stop the boats. That clean energy package showed courage and vision in tackling a problem that is now on everyone's radar screen. Everyone in my home state of Tasmania has seen this summer. They have seen the dams dry up. They have seen fires in places we have never seen them before. They have seen the fish dying because water temperatures are 4½ degrees above the average, nearly 30 per cent above the long-term average—salmon farms with fish dying, the oyster industry devastated by viruses because of warming waters and yesterday the abalone industry ringing the bell on the damage that they have received from dangerous runaway climate change and global warming. These things are happening every day around us now. In Greenland there is a massive spike in the ice melting and of course we have heard in recent days from my colleagues the deep and profound sadness of going to the Great Barrier Reef last week and seeing that nearly 70 per cent of the reef now suffers from massive coral bleaching. If the penny has not dropped for Australians and for parliamentarians I really do not know when it will. The budget that is to be delivered tonight must address global warming and take every possible avenue we can to impact on this problem. This is about intergenerational equity. We have to take the strongest possible actions and measure and manage these risks.


The cuts to the CSIRO, which the committee I have been chairing has spent so much time scrutinising, are totally unacceptable. We should be investing more funds and research into climate change and into how we are going to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Never has there been a more important time to invest in the science that helps us better understand global warming and how we are going to deal with it. Never has there been a more important time. I hope that in tonight's budget we see some real action from this government on what I think will be the most important issue at this federal election in the next couple of months: action on climate change. I have no doubt after listening to the Tasmanians I have spoken to—and my colleagues are providing similar feedback from farmers and people all around the country—that they have never seen a summer like this. The science and the data tell us exactly the same thing: we have never seen a warmer year. We have never seen bigger storms in the northern or southern hemispheres than those we have seen in the last 12 months. We have never seen a bleaching episode like this on the Great Barrier Reef. We have just signed COP21, the Paris agreement to reduce emissions, yet we continue to play the politics of whether we have met our 2020 targets or how we are going to achieve them. It is not enough. It is not making a difference. Tonight is a chance for the government to show leadership and courage.


So, while we are standing here today debating supply bills before we have even seen the budget, at this extraordinary time in Australian politics I say to the Prime Minister on behalf of the Australian Greens: tonight is your chance to show some courage and leadership on the issues that actually matter to the Australian people—on reducing inequality in this country and tackling the biggest threat that we currently face, which is global warming.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Special Minister of State) (12:55):  I thank senators for their contributions to this debate on the supply bills. In particular I thank Senator Wong, in her position, and Senator Whish-Wilson and the Greens for their support for the bills. These bills seek appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for proposed expenditure for the first part of 2016-17, broadly until about the end of November. The provisions in these bills are generally based on five months of the estimated 2016-17 annual appropriations, with special provision where necessary for entities with a disproportionately high level of expenditure early in the financial year—for example, the Australian Electoral Commission. 


These bills seek provision only for appropriate money to fund government expenditure on an interim basis until the appropriation bills have passed. They do not include budget measures from the 2016-17 budget. These arrangements allow for the budget appropriation bills to be passed in 2016-17 by the next parliament. The total of the appropriations being sought through these three supply bills is just over $41 billion. These supply bills must be passed in this session to ensure funding is available to all entities from 1 July 2016, thereby ensuring the continuity of program and service delivery and of the operations of the parliament. I commend these bills to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

Spending $50 million for a study into infrastructure and how we can generate more revenue for bankers when we could have an infrastructure revolution around this country is not substantial reform. 


Let me tell you what substantial reform is. Substantial reform is reducing inequality in Australia and making this country fairer. Budgets are not just about raising revenue or reining in spending to meet some arbitrary figures—it is about making our country fairer for all Australians. We have the chance to pull levers in budgets to make Australia a better place to live—a more prosperous place for all Australians. Substantial tax reform is removing perverse incentives like negative gearing and some capital gains tax provisions. It is the wealthiest in this country who benefit from those incentives, and they have been in place for too long. We need to look at making housing more affordable for Australians. We need superannuation tax concessions so that wealthy Australians can no longer use superannuation as a rort to reduce their tax. We are looking for leadership in this budget, and so far no detail has been provided on that. Substantial tax reform is putting in place hard policies to stop the wealthy dodging tax; putting in a Buffett rule, a floor on wealthy income earners, so that they pay 30 per cent guaranteed in tax over $300,000 income. That is substantial tax reform. That not only helps makes our tax system more progressive and fairer; it would also raise $7 billion in revenue. Removing subsidies for dirty polluters—the diesel fuel rebate for the big miners—would raise another $4 billion. Taking action on climate change—putting a price on carbon that actually will have an impact on emissions—is substantial tax reform.


The Greens have led on all these issues for years and we are confident that we have the courage and the vision as a political party that the Australian people want to see this election. That is what they want for their leaders—they want courage and they want vision. Because we are having a budget the same week as we are having a double dissolution, I challenge the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party, when they release their budget documents today, to show us what their courage and their vision is for this country's future. Do not just play a small target, a low-risk strategy. You are about to force the Australian people to an early election and you are dissolving both houses of parliament—an extraordinary step on the back of an ideological piece of legislation, the ABCC. We have actually passed some good legislation in the Senate in the last three years but we are being forced to go to an early election because of the leadership ambitions of our Prime Minister, because he rules over a divided party. That is why we are going to an early election. Tonight is your chance to show your vision and leadership for the Australian people. If substantial tax reform is what you have said it is going to be then we look forward to seeing the details of how you are actually going to reduce inequality and make Australia a fairer place.


There are little memories for me in this place. During the reply speech to the Governor-General when Prime Minister Tony Abbott first started, I was sitting next to Kevin Rudd, because everybody had to come into the chamber and there were not many seats. He sat there throughout the reply speech and he kept muttering to me: 'This man has no vision. He has no ideas.' We know what ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott's ideas were: they were to rip up the carbon price and the mining tax and to stop the boats. That clean energy package showed courage and vision in tackling a problem that is now on everyone's radar screen. Everyone in my home state of Tasmania has seen this summer. They have seen the dams dry up. They have seen fires in places we have never seen them before. They have seen the fish dying because water temperatures are 4½ degrees above the average, nearly 30 per cent above the long-term average—salmon farms with fish dying, the oyster industry devastated by viruses because of warming waters and yesterday the abalone industry ringing the bell on the damage that they have received from dangerous runaway climate change and global warming. These things are happening every day around us now. In Greenland there is a massive spike in the ice melting and of course we have heard in recent days from my colleagues the deep and profound sadness of going to the Great Barrier Reef last week and seeing that nearly 70 per cent of the reef now suffers from massive coral bleaching. If the penny has not dropped for Australians and for parliamentarians I really do not know when it will. The budget that is to be delivered tonight must address global warming and take every possible avenue we can to impact on this problem. This is about intergenerational equity. We have to take the strongest possible actions and measure and manage these risks.


The cuts to the CSIRO, which the committee I have been chairing has spent so much time scrutinising, are totally unacceptable. We should be investing more funds and research into climate change and into how we are going to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Never has there been a more important time to invest in the science that helps us better understand global warming and how we are going to deal with it. Never has there been a more important time. I hope that in tonight's budget we see some real action from this government on what I think will be the most important issue at this federal election in the next couple of months: action on climate change. I have no doubt after listening to the Tasmanians I have spoken to—and my colleagues are providing similar feedback from farmers and people all around the country—that they have never seen a summer like this. The science and the data tell us exactly the same thing: we have never seen a warmer year. We have never seen bigger storms in the northern or southern hemispheres than those we have seen in the last 12 months. We have never seen a bleaching episode like this on the Great Barrier Reef. We have just signed COP21, the Paris agreement to reduce emissions, yet we continue to play the politics of whether we have met our 2020 targets or how we are going to achieve them. It is not enough. It is not making a difference. Tonight is a chance for the government to show leadership and courage.


So, while we are standing here today debating supply bills before we have even seen the budget, at this extraordinary time in Australian politics I say to the Prime Minister on behalf of the Australian Greens: tonight is your chance to show some courage and leadership on the issues that actually matter to the Australian people—on reducing inequality in this country and tackling the biggest threat that we currently face, which is global warming.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Special Minister of State) (12:55):  I thank senators for their contributions to this debate on the supply bills. In particular I thank Senator Wong, in her position, and Senator Whish-Wilson and the Greens for their support for the bills. These bills seek appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for proposed expenditure for the first part of 2016-17, broadly until about the end of November. The provisions in these bills are generally based on five months of the estimated 2016-17 annual appropriations, with special provision where necessary for entities with a disproportionately high level of expenditure early in the financial year—for example, the Australian Electoral Commission. 


These bills seek provision only for appropriate money to fund government expenditure on an interim basis until the appropriation bills have passed. They do not include budget measures from the 2016-17 budget. These arrangements allow for the budget appropriation bills to be passed in 2016-17 by the next parliament. The total of the appropriations being sought through these three supply bills is just over $41 billion. These supply bills must be passed in this session to ensure funding is available to all entities from 1 July 2016, thereby ensuring the continuity of program and service delivery and of the operations of the parliament. I commend these bills to the Senate.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney‑General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Dodson today relating to higher education policy. 


Today we saw a new gyration from the government around their policies on higher education. No matter what gyrations we see, and no doubt we will hear a great deal more on this in the forthcoming period, no matter what high trapeze act we see being performed, no matter what fiddling we see, the fundamentals remain the same. Senator Dodson's question was direct: what is the government's policy? What is the government's policy in relation to deregulation of university fees and cuts to universities? Of course, the answer has to be based on what the government said today and what we know is on the public record in regard to the underlying position that we see within the government's budgetary statements.


The government's goal remains: deregulation of university fees and a $20 billion cut to public universities over the next 10 years—a goal that will see the $100,000 degree and the prospect of lifetime debt embedded into the higher education system of this country. We know that the unlegislated measures outlined by this government cut $20 billion from the university system and that the bulk of that will go into the private sector. We know that this is the real face of deregulation. 


This is a government that walks away from its responsibilities to properly fund education in this country. This is a government that oversees the transfer of billions and billions of dollars from taxpayers to private operators—$17.8 billion under this government's measures, embedded within the budget arrangements under the unlegislated measures, will be transferred from the various operations and predominantly directed to private colleges. All of that is underwritten by a blowout in the public loan scheme—a measure which we saw in 2015, in the last MYEFO and in the estimates processes.


All of this now has been reinforced by the inspired leaks of recent weeks that of course confirm the government's agenda of a commitment to the $100,000 degree, to the deregulation of fees, and now proposals to introduce a new superprofits tax for universities. Under the scheme the government is proposing, which was identified first under Minister Pyne, there will be attempts made to impose further levies on universities, particularly the Group of Eight universities, should they charge more than the government expects. We know that to be the case because of the statements that have been made by this minister and the various inspired leaks we have seen, particularly to TheAustralian Financial Review.


We know the history of this policy. This has been road-tested in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom this very policy was pursued and of course ultimately rejected by a conservative government because of the impact that it had on increasing university fees to students. Of course we all know that the fundamentals are not about to change under this government. We know what a dog of a policy this is. It was a dog of a policy when it was first announced under Christopher Pyne. It was a dog of a policy through its various versions and it remains a dog of a policy today.


This is a government that has relentlessly pursued its plan to cut $20 billion from public universities. This is a government that has sought to strip money from our world-class university system, transfer that money to the private sector and blow-out the cost of the loan scheme. Of course we have now seen a model that will be pursued through the vocational education system. This government has allowed the waste and extravagance to go beyond all possible imagination.


What we have is a government that believes it is simple: 'If you have got the money, if you have got the power and if you have got the privilege you could embed that.' We should not have an education system that actually opens the doors of economic opportunity. The fundamental principle that has been the hallmark of the Australian education system is: if you have ability and work hard you should have the opportunity to succeed. Under this government's policies we know that there will be a major shake-up in the education system if it ever gets the chance to implement them. It will see the price of going to university skyrocket, a massive blow-out in public debt and an undermining of the fundamental principle of equality in our education system. (Time expired)

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2016-05-03,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:10):  It is always wonderful to follow Senator Carr and to add my comments to this debate. 




Senator Conroy:
  We used to think you were the most right-wing senator. With the next speaker you are going to have to lift your game.




Senator SESELJA:
  I look forward to the very honourable Senator Paterson coming after me and doing an outstanding job. Labor are going to find as they pursue these lines—be it on higher education, education, health or other policies—that they fundamentally have no credibility. If we want an example of why they have no credibility and why they cannot be trusted on money, we saw it yesterday with the unravelling of the fundamentals of their campaign, with the $19 billion hole in their costings. This is no ordinary hole in costings. We have seen holes in costings from the Labor Party before. This is no ordinary hole because this $19 billion hole is fundamental to their entire campaign, which is about $100 billion of new taxes, extra taxes, and tax increases so they can apparently spend money in health, education and various areas. Those are the fundamentals of their campaign and last night we saw that campaign blown out of the water. 


Margaret Thatcher famously said that the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money. Never have we seen before an opposition leader who has run out of other people's money before coming into office. That is what we saw yesterday. The Labor Party has already run out of money. We knew it was pie in the sky. We had these claims.




Senator Conroy:
  You have adopted $70 billion of our policies.




Senator SESELJA:
  This is a really important point. Whilst I do enjoy Senator Conroy's interjections, I need to make this important point. I will do it so that Senator Conroy can listen.




Senator Conroy:
  You have forgotten what you were going to say.




Senator SESELJA:
  No. I really want you to listen to this point. We have seen in the debate in recent times the Labor Party making these extravagant claims about $80 billion. They say there is $80 billion in cuts. That was always a lie. It was a lie because they never had the money. The Labor Party never put the money in the budget. They did not have the money. The only way they could ever get the money was to borrow the money or to increase taxes. That has become apparent during this campaign as they have said they are going to have $100 billion in extra taxes. 


This $19 billion so-called rounding error, in the words of the Labor Party, this $19 billion hole, is so important now because it confirms every concern the Australian people have about the Labor Party. The fundamental concern that the Australian people have about the Labor Party is that they cannot be trusted with money. Even if you ask Labor Party supporters—even those who vote for the Labor Party because they want more spending and they are not that worried about fiscal responsibility—who they want to look after the budget, who they want to fix the budget, they will say in a heartbeat, 'The coalition.' 


If anyone wanted evidence or to be reminded—perhaps some Australian people were starting to give the Labor Party a chance—why the Labor Party should never come back on this side of the chamber it happened yesterday. The Australian people do not trust Labor with money. Why don't they trust them? Because Labor inherited no government debt—$70 billion in the bank—and they left us a legacy of hundreds of billions of dollars of debt. 


Now they say, 'If we come back in we are going to spend even more than we did last time'—$80 billion extra apparently on health and education. Well you do not have the money. The Australian people are not fools. Every time during this campaign—this is going to follow Bill Shorten like a bad smell during this campaign—Bill Shorten and his team promise something people will be saying, 'Where is the money coming from?' He will say, 'We have got our new taxes.' Well he does not. It has been shown to be a farce. It has been shown to be an absolute lie. This is what this campaign will be about. Labor cannot be trusted with your money. (Time expired)

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2016-05-03,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:15):  The desperation of this government is now quite palpable. At a time when this government should be looking to focus on its own plans for this country's future we now see that this government is desperate to try to shift blame and to get the eyes of the nation to look elsewhere by concocting a hole in Labor's costings. This is a very, very desperate measure.


Senator Dodson's very worthwhile question during question time touched on higher education. In my opinion, higher education is one of those matters which should be above party politics. It is a question that goes to the future of our country. An extract from the report by Cadence Economics says:


The ability of our nation to expand the knowledge and skills of our workforce to drive productivity growth is vital if Australia is to raise living standards into the future.


When it comes to higher education, we should all be advocating for better education policies. But, unfortunately, we have a government—the Turnbull government—whose planned cuts to higher education are ruthless. As Senator Carr indicated, under their current plan there are $20 billion in cuts from Australian universities set to take place into the future.


But it is not just the cuts; it is also the debt collection. We have heard that the Prime Minister, alongside Minister Birmingham, are conspiring to collect HECS debts from those who have passed away, all the while planning to increase the overall cost to universities. This is an atrociously bad idea—an idea so bad and so shameless it does not warrant any scrutiny; it just demands ridicule. The fundamental idea of HECS is that students borrow money to study in their field of choice and only have to pay it back once they earn reasonable money.


The coalition's plan to deregulate universities is an appalling measure to address the rising cost of higher education. We saw the report from the Parliamentary Budget Office some time ago which talked about the fact that the government's proposal to deregulate would drive up the annual cost to government from the current $1.7 billion of the HECS-HELP student loan system to $11.1 billion a year by 2025-26. This is bad not only for students but also for the budget bottom line and for our country.


In my own home state of Queensland we, sadly, have some of the lowest rates of graduates from university, particularly from regional Queensland. So one has to ask the question: what are the government doing to address those types of issues? Unfortunately, the answer is nothing. In fact, they are making it worse. In deregulating the higher education system they are attempting to charge up to $100,000 for a degree and, worst of all, they are creating a disincentive for people to study. They are crippling the future of our country. I know from talking to Queenslander's about the government's policy that people are worried about the prospect of the cost of higher education increasing. Working-class families find it difficult to commit to providing the support for their sons and daughters to attend university, and the prospect of a ballooning in the cost of education is a total disincentive. I think this is a disgraceful policy approach.


Labor believes that what you need to get into university is hard work and deep thinking, not deep pockets or your parent's bank balance. We believe universities have a responsibility to help students succeed, especially disadvantaged students. I call on the coalition and on education minister Senator Birmingham to stop using university funding as a punching bag, to rule out any further cuts to higher education and to dump the Liberal's frightening plan for $100,000 degrees.


The World Economic Forum Human Capital Index was developed in recognition of the fact that an educated population is a key investment driver of economic growth and the development of advanced industries and advanced countries. Australia currently sits in 13th place in the index, behind New Zealand, Belgium, Austria and Ireland. We cannot afford to slip any further. Australia needs its skilled graduates to power our future. Our university students deserve the best start in life, and only Labor can guarantee that start.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2016-05-03,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:20):  Today is the day that the federal budget will be delivered. I must admit that I am new to this place, but I would have thought that, on the day that the federal budget is due to be delivered, it might have merited the attention of opposition senators in question time. Yet the questions that they chose to ask today in Senate question time were on the following topics: firstly, the Indigenous Land Corporation's annual report—something that has been asked about previously and about which nothing new was learnt from; secondly, their conspiracy theories about higher education reform; thirdly, submarines; fourthly, the Cabinet Secretary—again an issue well ventilated in Senate question time in which nothing new was gained; and, finally, mental health funding. There was not one question on the budget, not one question on tax, not one question on the deficit and not one question on debt.


While I am shocked and surprised on one level that no attention was devoted to economic matters by the opposition senators today, on the other hand I do understand that it is a little bit of an embarrassing topic for those opposite. I do understand that, on the day that the shadow Treasurer called a $19½ billion black hole in his costings a 'rounding error', Labor senators might not want to draw attention to budget matters. I understand, given their record in government, where they inherited $29 billion of net assets and in six years turned that into $153 billion of net debt, and with deficits as far as the eye could see for the forward estimates, that they might not want to talk about the budget and about economic management. I understand, given their plans for this election to increase taxes by more than $100 billion, that they may not wish to talk about the budget and matters of economic management.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Paterson, just resume your seat.




Senator Urquhart:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on the question of relevance. I understand that the question that we are taking note of is in relation to higher education. I have not heard one mention at all of higher education from the senator in his address so far.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Urquhart. You are correct, but I am sure Senator Paterson is—Senator Conroy, you have a point of order?




Senator Conroy:
  On the point of order: it is a very correct point of order you have taken, but I would ask the chair to be lenient to the new senator. It is his first budget. It is a budget which he has criticised in the past, over the last few years. He does not want to talk about it. But I would ask you to be lenient on our new Senate colleague.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It was my intention to be lenient, in any case, with all senators. But I was just about to say that I am sure Senator Paterson is coming to the question before the chair.




Senator PATERSON:
  I thank senators for their helpful advice and assistance in this matter. I have to say that I am very glad that the topic of higher education has been raised. I am looking forward to discussing it today, particularly in the context of the opposition's capacity to estimate expenses and revenue in the future. We know that the errors that we have exposed today in their budget for the upcoming election of $19½ billion is not the only area in which they have made predictions which have not turned out to be correct. For example, opposition leader, Bill Shorten, says that he has a plan to provide free education for 100,000 STEM graduates. On the day that policy was announced, he initially stated that the cost would be $45 million over the estimates—a laughable costing, which he himself had to quickly correct. He subsequently stated that it might be $350 million, but the Department of Education and Training estimated the costing to be $2.25 billion.


Those opposite cannot be trusted on higher education, in the same way that they cannot be trusted with the budget. You cannot deliver a world-class, high quality higher education system if you cannot deliver the funding that is necessary to make it work. Only the coalition has demonstrated that it has the capacity to manage the economy and the budget in a way which ensures that all of the important activities of government, including funding the higher education system, can be comfortably done. We cannot rely on people who predict that their revenue from cigarette taxes will be $37 billion when in fact it will be $19½ billion less to deliver anything for the higher education sector, to deliver anything for universities. It was, in fact, their changes—their incomplete reforms when in government—which uncapped the number of places that universities were allowed to admit in each course, which has caused a skyrocketing and a massive increase in costs for universities.


I am a relatively recent product of the university education system, and I am very grateful for the time I spent at university. I think it is appropriate that whilst I was there I was required to make a financial contribution to my education, because I am the primary beneficiary of the education that I received. Andrew Norton, the pre-eminent higher education policy expert in Australia, who is at the Grattan Institute, has estimated that students who attend university are, on average, $1 million better off over their lifetimes than students who do not. It is entirely appropriate that we contribute to the cost of that education.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:26):  I rise also to take note of the answers to the question asked by Senator Dodson. I also congratulate Senator Dodson on his arrival here in the chamber. I, too, think he will make a wonderful contribution. But the answer was less than enlightening. Just like so many other things and ideas that come from the Prime Minister, it seems that the ideas boom was just another thought bubble and there really is nothing behind the idea of innovation and creativity that so far has propelled so much soaring rhetoric from the Prime Minister. We have heard very little detail about how this ideas boom is to be accomplished. An ideas boom, we should note, is actually more than just going to cocktail parties run by start-up incubators and meeting with tech entrepreneurs who come out from the United States.


Growing Australian ideas in Australia will, in fact, mean investing in our people and our institutions. It probably means that we will need to invest money in higher education. But that is not the answer we heard today, when the government were asked about how they intended to proceed with higher education policy. The Prime Minister remains completely committed to the former Prime Minister's plans to gut higher education. The government's goal, quite obviously, remains deregulation, and a $20 billion cut to university funding over 10 years. It seems the government's goal in this budget is the lowering of the repayment threshold for HECS, which will mean that people on very modest incomes start to stare down the impact of that $100,000 debt they have incurred simply by seeking to educate themselves. The government has not walked away from the unlegislated budget measures that outline this plan: taking $20 billion out of the public university system and transferring a very large proportion of that money to the private sector. This is not the kind of higher education policy we would have expected to hear from a government that speaks so often about innovation and the importance of innovation and education in driving the economy of Australia forward. So this government really ought to be investing in students. I do not really know who the Prime Minister thinks will come up with the innovative plans and ideas, but he seems to be prepared to write off the majority of Australians who cannot afford $100,000 degrees. I do not know where the Prime Minister expects this new generation of entrepreneurs to learn, but he seems prepared to slash funds from the very institutions that are best placed to teach students the STEM skills they need to craft world-breaking concepts.


Having an educated and highly skilled workforce benefits everyone. The way to greater profitability for Australian firms is for them to be more productive. You do not achieve that by cutting penalty rates, and you do not achieve that by slashing conditions. You do that by having a smart, educated workforce that works out better ways to do business.


In his question, Senator Dodson made reference to a report from Universities Australia that demonstrates that having an educated workforce does not just benefit those who receive the education, it benefits everyone. In 2014-15 the economic boost from new graduates entering Australia's workforce created 25,000 new jobs for Australians without university degrees. For every 1,000 new graduates entering the workforce, 120 new jobs are created for people without a degree. The impact of new graduates joining Australia's workforce lifted wages for workers without a university degree by $12.60 a week, or $655 a year. And without the entry of new university graduates into the Australian economy, the growth rate in jobs for people without a university degree would have been zero over the last eight years.



In the face of this evidence and in the face of this analysis, it is a nonsense to describe, as government members so frequently do, the provision of higher education as a benefit for the individual without acknowledging its social benefit. There is a reason that public institutions are funded by governments to deliver a high-quality workforce—because it benefits all Australians. It is to the government's very great shame that this will not be recognised in this evening's budget. (Time expired)

  The Australia government expressed its deep concern about the killing of Xulhaz Mannan and other recent murders in Bangladesh in a statement released by the Australia High Commission in Bangladesh on 27 April. The government called for the murders to be investigated swiftly and for those responsible to be brought to justice. We noted that the victims were respected citizens and we offered condolences to the families, friends and communities of the victims. Australia stands with Bangladesh in opposing the intolerance and violence espoused by terrorist and other extremist groups.

The Minister for Rural Health convened an urgent round table following the murder and is continuing to work with remote health workforce stakeholders. The government has provided direct support to Nganampa Health Council clinic and is working with the Aboriginal community controlled health sector to assist with improving security arrangements. One of the central tenets of Aboriginal medical services is self-determination and we do not intend to walk away from that principle. We appreciate the senator's advocacy on this important issue and we will work with him and with the remote communities to address ongoing safety concerns.

  I thank the chamber. Following a 120-day community consultation period that concluded in March, the government has shortlisted the voluntarily nominated site in Barndioota, South Australia, as a possible site for a national radioactive waste management facility. Barndioota displayed a broad level of community support for moving to the project's next phase. Importantly, Barndioota's shortlisting does not represent a final decision to locate the facility but rather presents an opportunity to continue consultation and concept development with the community to ensure accurate information is provided and any outstanding questions are answered. The government is fully committed to preserving Indigenous heritage. A key part of this next phase will be an independent Indigenous heritage assessment that will be undertaken in consultation with traditional owners to identify the full extent of heritage at the site and ensure it is protected. The government has consistently said that this facility will only be established at a site that has broad community support and meets Australia's strict environmental and radiation protection regulatory requirements. The government intends to make a decision on the final location for establishing this facility within a year to allow for the next round of thorough consultation and assessment to take place.

Senator LUDLAM:
  I thank the chamber. Despite everything that Senator Ryan has said, the Adnyamathanha mob—the traditional owners of that area—and the community more broadly are not interested in further conversation. They are not interested in being consulted at. They are not interested in the box-ticking exercise that appears to be unfolding here. There is a very serious challenge before the minister now if he is to be taken at his word that this would not be a non-consent proposal. The views of the community, particularly those who have been custodians of that country for tens of thousands of years, must be listened to on this issue. They are not interested. They have months and months of so-called accurate information from the Commonwealth government. Their right to say no must be respected and upheld, and there is no reason at all for this nomination to proceed any further. I hope that I have the support of the chamber in this important vote.

"PRESIDENT, The",,2016-05-03,"



The PRESIDENT
 (16:06):  I wish to read a statement to the Senate. By letter dated 2 May, Senator McAllister has raised as a matter of privilege the failure of Senator Sinodinos to comply with an order of the Senate of 19 April 2016 to appear before the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for the purposes of its inquiry into Commonwealth legislative provisions relating to oversight of associated political entities.


In determining whether to give precedence to a motion to refer a matter to the Privileges Committee I am required to have regard only to the criteria listed in Privilege Resolution 4—that is, the criteria to be taken into account by the President in determining whether a motion arising from a matter of privilege should be given precedence of other business. These are as follows:


(a) the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and


(b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.


The purpose of these criteria is to ensure that a matter which meets them is given an appropriate opportunity to be dealt with as an item of business so that the Senate may then make a decision on the merits of the case. The decision by the President to grant precedence is not a recommendation that the matter should be referred to the Privileges Committee for inquiry, simply that the Senate should be given the earliest opportunity to make that decision for itself.


In this case, the Senate ordered Senator Sinodinos to appear before a committee using the power expressed in standing order 177(3). Senator Sinodinos declined to appear, citing unavailability on the proposed hearing dates and indicating that he did not intend to comply with the order of the Senate.


In relation to criterion (a), the Senate has expressed the view in Privilege Resolution 6(8) that disobedience of a lawful order of the Senate without reasonable excuse may be dealt with as a contempt.


Privilege Resolution 6(8) provides that:


A person shall not, without reasonable excuse, disobey a lawful order of the Senate or of a committee.


The Senate has declared non-compliance with an order to be a contempt and it is therefore difficult for me to conclude that criterion (a) is not satisfied. However, it is a matter for the Senate to judge whether the facts in this case warrant such a remedy.


In relation to criterion (b), only the Senate has the authority to deal with non-compliance with its orders through the contempt jurisdiction. I note, however, that it also has access to other types of remedies, including such political and procedural penalties as those listed in the interim report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on this matter. What, if any, remedy to apply in this case is solely a matter for the Senate and to this extent, criterion (b) is satisfied.


In order that the Senate may resolve this matter without delay, I have determined that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should be given precedence over other business for the day on which it is given.


I table the correspondence and invite Senator McAllister to give notice of a motion.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2016-05-03,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:11):  What a mess Mr Turnbull and his government have made of school funding, along with their complete dishonesty to the Australian public and, frankly, incompetence. Remember their commitments, their promises—the unity ticket, the lock-step on Gonski and the dollar-for-dollar matching of Labor's funding—which were on display at polling booths across the nation. That is the commitment they gave, and yet they continue to renege on it. Was it all just a hoax unfortunately foisted on Australian school students who need a better deal, who need a better funding model? Was the government's unity ticket, their step-for-step, their dollar-for-dollar a great big dishonest trick played on Australian voters by Mr Abbott, then by Mr Turnbull, then by former education minister Christopher Pyne and now by Senator Birmingham?


The $30 billion cut the Liberals made to school funding is the biggest single cut to education in Australia's history. Just a few weeks ago Prime Minister Turnbull had a completely crazy thought bubble when he proposed the ridiculous idea of withdrawing all federal funding for our public education system. The Prime Minster followed up this crazy proposal with another crazy proposal—that states could levy their own taxes to pay for the massive shortfall in the funds that withdrawing federal funding for education would create. That would create in our history an absolute disparity between states on something we should have a unity ticket on and something which should be national—that is, school funding. Why should one state, which may have been able to levy higher taxes, have a better system than other states? That is the American system, and their system is a mess; in some states taxes are not levied at all and parents are just left with a very poor school system.


That is what the Turnbull government was proposing. I do not know what the Prime Minister was thinking with this crazy, crazy idea, but every single state and territory rejected the idea—except my state of Western Australia. Why? Because we have a foolish premier in Mr Colin Barnett. Frankly, he has no credibility. He has squandered the mining boom and turned our economy, the great powerhouse of Western Australia, into a cot case. He has slashed and burnt education in Western Australia, to the point that everyone is speaking about what a poor job he is doing. And there he is bailing out a crazy idea put by the Turnbull government.


This week the Turnbull government changed their tune again, making an announcement that a tiny share—just $1 billion—of the $30 billion that they ripped out of education would be restored. Clearly the jokers are in charge when it comes to the Turnbull government—to call this a funding increase! To add insult to injury, today in the Senate it was called 'yet another increase'. The Liberals said at the polling booths that they would match our funding, dollar for dollar. That turned out to be completely incorrect, a lie—a dishonesty that Australian voters had every right to believe in. But when it comes to school education, the Turnbull government, whoever the minister of the day is, clearly cannot be trusted.


What have the states said about this latest thought bubble? In Victoria they said:


It doesn't matter which way Malcolm Turnbull tries to spin it, this is another Liberal broken promise and a bitter pill to swallow for Victorian students and their families.


What did South Australia have to say? They said: 


We don't need more commonwealth testing, we need commonwealth funding.


What did Queensland say? They said:


If the Government really cared about literacy and numeracy and prep and year one, then they would put their money into additional teacher aids in the classroom that make a real difference to students' learning.


And the great Liberal state of New South Wales? They have been in lock step with Labor's plan. They want Gonski. I was at the public meeting when the New South Wales Liberal minister announced, 'We want Gonski.' That is what he said.




Senator Birmingham:
  He's not a Liberal. He's a National.




Senator LINES:
  He is in the Liberal government. It does not matter. Suddenly they make a distinction: 'Oh, he's a National; he's not part of us.' Well, he is part of you. He is the Minister for Education in the New South Wales government, and he has outlived the succession of education ministers we have had in the Abbott-Turnbull government. He has been the minister for quite some time, and he is in lock step with Labor. What did this minister in the New South Wales Liberal-National Party government, the biggest Liberal-National Party government of all the states, say? He said:


… NSW will continue to advocate for the full Gonski funding in its agreement with the Commonwealth government.


He has said that over and over again, so he is certainly in lock step with Labor, because he trusts Labor on education. He certainly does not trust the Turnbull government's thought bubbles and endless commitments or promises to be broken. As soon as the election is over, those promises will disappear—mark my words.


Meanwhile, Labor has had a detailed policy in the public realm for months, a policy Labor developed with those who know it best: teachers, parents and education experts. Labor will reverse the Turnbull government's cuts to education and we will implement the Gonski reforms on time and in full. Certainly the Liberal-National Party government in New South Wales believe us when we say that, and they back us in on that. Labor's investment will mean more classroom support for students, early intervention programs in schools, additional literacy and numeracy programs and teachers having the tools to better track student achievement.


Earlier this year I chaired the Senate inquiry into children with disability in our education system. I was really shocked at what poor treatment children with disability have in our education system. What has the Turnbull government done about their education? Nothing. The government system and the non-government system told us absolutely, in clear terms: CPI matched funding is not enough for them. The Catholic education system said that their schools for kids with disability would close. We met with parents who had to fight to even get their kids enrolled. We owe it to children with disability to make sure that they get the education they are entitled to—not the crumbs off the table, not to attend for half a day at a time, not for pressure to be put onto parents to buy the aids necessary to support their education—and that they are treated as learners in our system. That is what Labor will do.


Labor wants all students to achieve their full potential. Our plan is about students, not postcodes. The Gonski review clearly established that our current school funding system, the one the Turnbull government is clinging to, defines school outcomes according to postcode, not student ability. This is wrong, and Labor's education plan will change that. Labor is the only party you can trust on the education commitments we make. Fair education funding is in our DNA, and we will fight for it year in, year out.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2016-05-03,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (16:21):  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter of public importance in the Senate today. I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight, because we hear many mistruths spoken in relation to school funding. We hear many Labor lies in relation to school funding, and we heard a few just then from Senator Lines. We hear this talk that only the Labor Party is committed to school funding and we hear suggestions endlessly from Senator Lines, from Ms Ellis, from Mr Shorten and from others who all suggest that there are somehow cuts and reductions in relation to school funding.


I welcome the opportunity to put on the record, from the first full year of the coalition government to the last year of the budget that will be handed down tonight, exactly how much money is available for schools, which demonstrates that it goes up each and every year. For the record, in 2014 the Commonwealth provided $13.7 billion in school funding. In 2015 we provided $14.9 billion. In 2016 we are providing $16 billion. In 2017 we will provide $17.4 billion. In 2018 we will provide $18.2 billion. In 2019 we will provide $19.1 billion. In 2020 we will provide $20.1 billion. You do not need a particularly high level of numeracy understanding or mathematics to look at those figures and understand they go up each and every year.


Senator Lines finished by saying, 'It's a question of trust'. Well based on Labor's claims that school funding is somehow going backwards, you clearly cannot trust the Labor Party. The facts speak for themselves. The figures that have been paid to schools, that are being paid to schools and that are locked into the budget forward estimates demonstrate that funding goes up each and every year into the future. The funding equation is quite clear. Is the Labor Party promising that it will spend more into the future? Yes. I do not deny that. I also acknowledge that the Labor Party is proposing around $100 billion in new taxes into the future as well. The Labor Party's policy is clear. They can talk about their policy, but they should not mislead about the coalition's policy, which does ensure funding growth and growth that is well in excess of inflation.


Much ofSenator Lines's contribution was based on arguments of what the states say. Well, surprise, surprise: state and territory governments ask for more money. As sure as night follows day, through the history of the federation, state and territory governments have always asked for more money; as sure as night follows day, through the history of federation and into the future, state and territory governments will always ask for more money. What we see is that those opposite are apparently a pushover when it comes to simply handing over more money. They will hand over more money on a whim, regardless of the fact that it requires higher taxes and/or increased debt from them. In fact, what we see is that the Labor Party have found one magic formula. It is the magic formula of having higher taxes and increased debt, because they promise to increase taxes by a lot, then they realise that those tax rises do not raise as much as they promised, and, oops, suddenly debt and deficit levels have gone through the roof. We have seen that just in the last couple of days.


What is the Labor Party's promise in relation to school funding and school spending? They promise over the next decade to spend an extra $30 billion. They go well beyond the budget, because it is easier for them to fudge the figures that way. They promise that over a decade they will spend an extra $30 billion. In announcing that they would do that, they said that they would pay for it by increasing the tax on tobacco. They said that that would raise about $40 billion. That is fine. They say, 'This well and truly pays for our school funding commitment,' and this was the Labor commitment. Just yesterday in the House of Representatives Ms Ellis said that it was tobacco tax that was paying for school funding increases. As recently as yesterday she singled out one tax rise—one only. The tobacco tax was to pay for the school funding increase. Then what do we discover? We discover that Labor's tax rise in relation to school funding only raises half as much as they said. That in relation to the $30 billion that was going to be there for school funding, $20 billion of it will not be there. Two in every three dollars is actually missing. So we get the double whammy: we get the tax rise from Labor, if they are elected, and we also get the reality that we will end up with much bigger deficits into the future, because the tax they promise will not be there, just as it was not there for the mining tax. Classic Labor: higher taxes, higher deficit—higher debt to fuel higher spending. The real problem is that the spending is done with no real idea of how they want to see it used. No reforms are attached to the spending, just a desire to hand over billions of extra dollars to the states and territories.


We are committed, as I said at the outset and as I detailed in the figures, to growing school funding every single year into the future—growing it ahead of costs. We are determined that that funding will be distributed according to need. Let me make clear what we mean by that. We mean that schools in low socioeconomic areas should receive more funding than other schools. We mean that students with disability should receive adjustment funding more than other students. We mean that students of an Indigenous background should receive additional support. We mean that small schools in rural and regional areas should receive additional support. We are committed to needs-based principles in the distribution of school funding. That is exactly how we will make sure school funding is distributed into the future—not just when it comes to how a bureaucrat in Canberra carves up the funding, which is what happens at present. We want to make sure that flows through to how the states and territories distribute the money.


What many people do not appreciate, and what I do not think the Labor Party appreciate, is that the model they signed up to when they delivered so-called Gonski funding at the tail end of the Gillard government was actually 27 different funding agreements around the country. It was not a uniform model; it was 27 different agreements, with lots of different special deals built into that with different states and territories and different non-government jurisdictions. And once they write out a great big to cheque to a state or territory they cannot guarantee that the money is going according to need in any event. There is nothing in the way Labor has structured it that ensures states and territories deliver the moneys to schools according to need. The Commonwealth gives the money to the states, and states do what they want with it by and large. That is not good enough, and we will take a different approach to this in the future to ensure that we do fund according to need.


We will also make sure that we fund according to real reform for our schools. Over the last 20-odd years real funding for Australian schools has gone up by more than 100 per cent—it has more than doubled—and enrolments have only gone up by about 18 per cent in that time. So there is a lot of extra funding that has gone into our school system. Yet on good international measures, we see that our reading and literacy standards, our numeracy and mathematics standards, our science measures and our engagement in foreign language studies have all gone backwards. We have been spending a lot more and getting poorer results as a result. So it is not a question of how much money is being spent; it is a question of how well it is being spent. 


That is why we have detailed reforms that address, from the earliest years, the identification of reading deficiencies in young children; that ensure intervention occurs at those earliest years; that ensure that students who are completing high school should have minimum standards of mathematics, literacy and numeracy; that ensure that those going on to university are actually required to have ambitions in maths and science and in English and humanities; that, importantly, reward our most capable teachers—not performance-based pay, as some try to mislead in this debate, nor pay based on NAPLAN results or the like, but pay that recognises those most capable teachers, as independently assessed by their peers and by the experts; that ensures they get a reward, an encouragement to stay in the teaching profession; and that provides greater incentives to go and work in the most disadvantaged schools. We want to ensure we get the best teachers into those most disadvantaged schools. 


These are real reforms that can make a real difference to lift the outcomes for Australian students. They can ensure we actually turnaround the decline in performance and give us the best possible chance to raise our education standards in the future. It is real change rather than the hollow promises about more spending that we hear from those opposite.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-05-03,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:31):  The Greens do not regard education funding as a cost. We regard education funding as an investment. We are proud to take to the Australia people a fully costed, fully funded platform that puts those offerings to date from either of the establishment parties represented in this place completely in the shade. We have said very clearly we will reverse the Liberals' $30 billion cuts to education over the next decade. We have said, and committed, to fully funding year 5 and 6 of the Gonski reforms. We have recently announced a package of $4.8 billion to support students with disability in our schools based on the nationally consistent collection of data which that minister is still sitting on and refusing, with his colleagues from around the country on the ministerial council, to release so the Australian people can have a look at it. 


I well remember the infamous unity ticket promised by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott prior to the 2013 election, where he said, in effect, there was not a wafer of difference between the coalition on one side and Labor and the Greens on the other side on school funding. I well remember the actual unity ticket that emerged after the 2013 election, when then Commonwealth Minister Christopher Pyne went back on the commitment given prior to the election by former PM Mr Abbott and attempted to walk away in totality from the Gonski funding. 


I well remember the ministerial council that I attended as a Greens minister on behalf of Tasmania, along with my Labor colleagues, a Liberal colleague and even a National Party colleague, when together we formed the real unity ticket on education. We rolled Mr Pyne at that meeting and forced him very soon afterwards to come out and at least commit to four years of Gonski funding on behalf of the Commonwealth. That was the real unity ticket on education. It was a Labor Liberal National Greens unity ticket on education, and that was the unity ticket that at least delivered the Commonwealth to a four-year Gonski funding commitment. It is worth putting on the record that two-thirds of the Gonski funding was due in year 5 and 6, and that is what the Commonwealth have walked away from in the context of the current debate and in the lead-up to this election.


We have costed our Gonski at $3.5 billion over the budget out years, over and above the coalition's current school's budget. That is about making sure that our kids who go to school have the supports they need, the resources they need and the investment in to teachers and school leaders that is so critical to delivering improved educational outcomes in Australia. But we have also committed $4.8 billion to students with disability in Australian schools, putting in the shade the just over $100 million recently announced by the Commonwealth in the lead-up to the budget and, quite frankly, the pittance of $375 million over the budget out years that Labor are offering students with disabilities. 


We want to invest in extra supports for students with disabilities, but we do not regard this as a disability policy; we regard it as an ability policy. Our goal is to allow students who have a disability to maximise their ability, so that they can achieve what they have dreams to achieve in their lives, to maximise their potential, to maximise their abilities and to give them every opportunity to put back into our community and to be constructive members of our society and of our economy. 


This is an investment unprecedented in Australian political history that the Greens are proposing to make. It is the single biggest investment into supporting students with disabilities and we are absolutely proud that we will back those kids and the people who teach and support those children in our schools to maximise their abilities. 


This funding will assist with the provision of teacher assistance, which parents of students with disabilities will know is an absolutely crucial way that schools can support students with disabilities. But it is not just about extra teacher assistance. It is not just about training up teachers. It is not just about training up school leaders and ensuring that school communities and school associations understand the challenges and the potential solutions for those challenges. It is also about ensuring proper infrastructure in our schools. That can be anything from wheelchair accessibility around a school through to accessibility for transport for students with disabilities. 


We are proud to have announced that funding. I was proud to announce it with our leader, Richard Di Natale, a few weeks ago in Melbourne. It is important because the NCCD data on students with disability has identified 467,000 students with disability across Australia. On the most recent figures, which are 2013 figures, 190,000 students received extra funding for their disabilities in Australian schools. That means we are currently directly supporting less than half of the students who have been identified through the NCCD process as needing supports due to their disabilities. Less than one in two students across all schools sectors in Australia are being recognised and appropriately resourced by governments. That is a shameful statistic. It is a national shame that we are not supporting those students to the degree that they need and deserve.


It is worth pointing out that nine out of 10 students with disability attend a mainstream school in our country and around three out of every four attend a public school. Nearly one in two come from families that live in or near poverty in Australia. They are 33 per cent more likely not to study beyond year 10 than students without a disability and they are nearly twice as likely not to complete year 12 than students without a disability. Again those are shameful statistics. It is truly a national shame the way we do not support students with disabilities to the extent that they need and deserve in our schools.


We are also proposing the development of a national strategy to improve the education of students with disability. That has been recommended by a Senate inquiry. The key features of our proposal around a national strategy include recognising all students with disability as learners, ensuring all students with disability benefit from evidence-based, best-practice programs, having best-practice ongoing professional development for teachers and school leaders—that is a critical part of our package, and funding announced in our $4.8 billion can be used for the professional development of teachers and school leaders—and, crucially, including students with disabilities and their parents and carers in the development of individual education plans for students with disabilities.


We have put together and released to date the most comprehensive funding commitments of any party represented in this Senate—much broader and more detailed than the establishment political parties represented in this place. That is because we do not regard funding education as a cost. We regard it as an investment not only in the future of our country but in the children and the families that have students in our schools today. We are proud to take these policies to the Australian people at this election. We will debate any time anywhere representatives of the establishment parties in this place. We will put up our policies before the Australian people and ask them to give them due consideration as they consider how they are going to vote in the election, which is coming up in a couple of months time.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2016-05-03,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:41):  I rise to speak on the Turnbull government's broken promises on school funding. What is it with this government? They cannot make up their mind from one day to the next. As was said on ABC's Lateline recently, 'Between lunchtime and Lateline this government changes its agenda.' Whether it be on workplace relations, the economy, tax policy or education, all the government care about is theatrics. They are not interested in governing and they are not interested in ensuring our children get a quality education that will set them up for the future. 


The Turnbull government's inaction on the economy and taxation has been alarming. Last weekend we also saw alarming inaction when it comes to education. I might add that the only plan or strategy that Prime Minister Turnbull has is for his own re-election. With the election quite literally around the corner, let me remind those on the other side about the promise that they made to the Australian people at the last election. I suggest they listen because this is a really good one. 


This was a promise that we all saw plastered in polling booths around the country during the 2013 election. It was a promise that the Liberals have ignored for the past 2½ years. The promise that the Liberals made was to match Labor on education funding dollar for dollar. That was the election commitment that they gave in 2013 and the reminder they gave people as they went into the polling booths. But this was, quite frankly, a lie. At the first opportunity the Liberals cut funding for our schools by $30 billion. It was the biggest single cut to education in Australia's history. 


The community may be a little confused if they had listened to the contribution by the minister in this chamber a little while ago. They no longer trust this government when it comes to education. They no longer trust this government when they are looking to the future of their children. They do not trust this government. They know the government will not fund their children's education and make sure that the levers are in place to ensure that our economy grows in the future.


Over the weekend and as recently as yesterday Mr Turnbull and his Liberals changed their tune once again. This is what we have learnt: one, the Turnbull government does not have an education policy; two, if voters vote for the Liberal Party Australian schools will receive $3.5 billion less by 2020 than if Labor is elected; and, thirdly, the Abbott-Turnbull government cut $30 billion from Australian schools. Then on Sunday they went, 'Oops,' and they promised to reverse that funding cut by $1 billion. Surely not even the learned, agile 21st century Prime Minister could not possibly think that the Australian community are going to be fooled and sucked in to believing that that $1 billion reversal is going to wipe away the other $29 billion that they took out of education.


This is an arrogant out-of-touch government that cannot help themselves. The minister had ample opportunity in this chamber a little while ago to clarify where this government is heading and to reassure the Australian community, but he failed. This government has no policy and no agenda for anything more than getting themselves re-elected, and that will be borne out. I guarantee those listening and those who are in the chamber that tonight's budget will do nothing except try to buy them enough time to get themselves re-elected. That is what this budget will be about. But the choice at the election is going to be so clear. What the government say today and what they will deliver tomorrow will be extremely different. We know that, because that has been their track record. This is not just what we are saying; it is what they have delivered over the last 2½ years.


If the Australian people are, as I believe, concerned about their kids' future, they will vote Labor at this election—because they know we will deliver. It is a historic fact that Labor always delivers to the Australian people when it comes to education. We put people first. We put kids first. What we will not do is cut education funding.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2016-05-03,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:46):  It gives me great joy to stand in this chamber and be very, very proud of my government's commitment to the future of our young people here in this country through the investment we are making into their education, into their improved literacy and numeracy standards, into improved engagement with STEM and into the skills and knowledge that will provide us a strong foundation for our future economy—because, Senator Polley, we actually care about young people and their futures. It is about the future the deserve.


What those of you who have been listening to the debate have heard thus far from the Greens and Labor has been about the battle for the hearts and minds of the AEU and United Voice—'Okay; the election is coming up and we need a little bit of mullah here and we need a little bit of help on the ground; who is going to win the hearts and minds of the AEU, the NTEU and United Voice?' That is the battle here. But what I think we should be inserting into this debate are some facts. I do not think some facts ever hurt a good debate in the Senate, and I am very, very happy to provide the chamber with some facts around this issue going forward.


What we have in this country around the debate on education and investment in our children is a national dialogue that is completely split. The research internationally shows that, if you actually want to make a difference, you get on the same page; you do not use the future of our young people as a plaything to score cheap political points. You will not win on this issue. That is what the research says. That is how Finland did it. If we want to argue about how they did it, that is what they did.


I go to the campaign that the Labor Party are running out there about Gonski. They take that man's name in vain. They take David Gonski's name and what he attempted to do in vain day after day at school gate after school gate. What did David Gonski want? He wanted a needs based funding model. That is what he suggested. But, instead, the Gillard government delivered 27 different models across different sectors and different states, buying votes here and buying union support there. Ultimately that experimented failed, because—hey, sorry—we won that election.


We are absolutely focused on ensuring that we focus on the facts and that we use the very best research, international research, about what works. It is not tipping a bucket of money; it is actually targeting funding. Senator McKim mentioned investing in our children's future. I am sure somebody on the opposite side will use the word 'investment' at some point in the debate. What you have to remember about investment is that it all about your return, Senator Polley. The return on investment is the important factor when you are putting money into an investment. If I want to focus on return on investment when it comes to education funding, when I invest in a young person's education, I want to ensure that, when they leave school, they can read and write. I want to ensure that, when they stand in front of a camera and do some rounding of numbers, there is not a $20 billion dip in those numbers. I want to ensure that our young people are numerate and literate. That is exactly what we are doing. We are focusing our funding where the facts and the research tell us to.


Another little fantasy line that Labor and the Greens like to trot out is that there are cuts to funding. What a joke! It just shows that Ms Macklin's faux pas at the front doors today was not the only innumerate statement that those opposite want to make. They say there are cuts. Let's go to the figures and see whether there is a cut. In 2014 it was $13.7 billion—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Wait for it, Senator Polley. In 2015 it was $14.9 billion. I reckon a year 3 maths—




Senator Smith:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I cannot hear Senator McKenzie's excellent contribution about the budget through Senator Polley's interjections.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  I remind the chamber that interjections are disorderly and speakers are entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator Polley:
  I would like to take a point of order. It is also in the standing orders that it is against standing orders to mislead the Senate, as the good senator is doing with her contribution.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Polley again shows her inability to read a budget paper and inability to actually understand numbers. As to funding put forward by successive governments, Senator Polley—not just my government; your former government as well—the Commonwealth as a proportional funder of state education in this country has improved education funding year on year. You might not think it is enough, but to say there have been cuts is a downright lie—an absolute lie. So, if anyone is misleading the Senate, it is anybody from the opposition who has spoken on this particular motion before us.


As I said, despite the rhetoric that you hear in this place, the states and territories are the major funders of state schools. They are also the majority funders and governors of recruitment direction, employment of teachers and accreditation. They are the ones getting the increased money from the government. When you look at Commonwealth government after Commonwealth government, budget after budget, pouring more and more money into and focusing on state education, I would argue that the states have been derelict in their responsibility. In my home state of Victoria, nearly one-third of our schools are non-government and 36 per cent of all students attend them. It is a higher proportion in years 11 and 12. I call on the Premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, who was wrapped to announce a $9 billion surplus over the forward estimates, to choose to invest some of that money into state schools, to choose to spend more of that money educating the 36 per cent of Victorian students who do not attend a state school, and to invest in their future, skills and knowledge that our state will need going forward.


Quality schools and quality outcomes mean improving literacy and numeracy, increasing engagement with STEM, enhancing teacher quality and ensuring students leave school equipped with the skills necessary for the jobs of the future. Our economy in the 21st century needs that type of citizen. I might also say that is exactly what parents want. They expect that when young people leave our schools they have been engaged and enriched and can read and write. It is not rocket science, but the sad fact in this country is that so many cannot. When you talk to employers about why they have to knock back young people and, indeed, even knock back people who are a little older, it is the lack of literacy and numeracy skills. So that is what parents want, and I would argue that it is absolutely what our Australian students deserve.


We have developed a needs based funding model. We are improving quality educational outcomes. We are seeking to make sure that we get a return on our investment, as our parents want, as our students deserve and as our economy needs. The total Commonwealth funding in my home state of Victoria will increase by $390.7 million by 2019-20. That is a 28.7 per cent increase. Sorry about that! Get you calculators out and work it out. It is actually an increase. Senator Polley, for you to stand up and claim that I misled the Senate—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ketter—is an absolute joke and just shows how much Labor is prepared to treat our students and our education of them as a political tool and a political football. It is not good enough. They deserve better.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2016-05-03,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:55):  I, too, rise to speak on this matter of public importance on the Turnbull government's broken promise on school funding. I know the government senators do not like to be reminded of what happened prior to the last election. I know they do not like to be reminded that they said that there would be no cuts to education. I know they do not like to be reminded that they also said that they would match Labor on education funding dollar for dollar. They also said, famously, that they were on a unity ticket with Gonski funding. That is the reality; that is the truth of what we are talking about here today.


It really saddens me that the government senators, including Senator McKenzie, have stood up in their contributions and tried to say that this government is actually increasing education funding. It is absolutely a falsehood to assert that. It is absolutely wrong. We only have to look at the New South Wales state minister, who is up in arms about the cuts that have been levelled at his state. We only have to look at my home state of Tasmania, where the state minister is also crying out about the funding cuts to investment in education. That is what is happening. If we look at Tasmania, $660 million has been cut from schools in Tasmania. These are the facts. It does not matter how loud you carp on or shout about what you say you are doing in government, you have, with this new funding arrangement, cut $29 billion from the commitment you gave that there would be no cuts to education, and that you would match Labor dollar for dollar. Quite frankly, I think you knew from the very outset, when you said it in the election campaign, that you were never going to meet it. You had no intention of ever meeting that.


And then we have Mr Turnbull, who does not even want to put any money into public education. It is an absolute disgrace. The policy you put together on education is an absolute disgrace. Of course, we have heard in the contributions from this side that this is seen as a bandaid measure to get those opposite through the election. I would like to say that you are better than that, but, actually, you are not. It took a moment's notice for you to go back on your commitment during the last election, and this time around you have cobbled something together that is not about investment in our schools. It is not about investment in our children and it is not about investment in our teachers; it is about getting you past the next federal election. The mums and dads out there are not going to fall for it. They know that you committed to Gonski. They know that this policy is a short-term political fix.


Senator McKenzie talked about investment in literacy and numeracy, which really galled me. She could not be further from the truth about what their policy is. It is not about investment in literacy and numeracy. The Labor Party policy is an investment. It will mean more classroom support for students, it will mean early intervention programs in schools, it will mean additional literacy and numeracy programs and it will mean that teachers get the resources and tools to better track student achievement.


And we need this. This is what we need: we need to enable our children with this investment so they are able to have every opportunity to achieve. What we have from the government is a mean-spirited, short-term fix to get them through an election. It is a disgrace, and they should be ashamed.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-05-03,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:00):  There is certainly one area in this place where there needs to be investment of the money—particularly in mathematics—and that is in the Labor Party, their leader, their shadow Treasurer, the assistant shadow Treasurer and, of course, Senator Carr!


I always start with the famous $100,000 degrees. The very renowned Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia, Professor Paul Johnson, made the comment that there would not be more than $16,000 needed per annum for the cost of degrees. Now, for a three-year degree, that is 16 times three. If our Labor colleagues could only get out their calculators and take their socks off they will see that it is only $48,000. Sixteen times four, as my good colleagues know very well, is $64,000.


My good Western Australian colleague, Senator Pat Dodson, on his first day and in his first question was drawn into the $100,000 degrees. But that was not enough, was it, because we have only learned in the last 24 hours about the $20 billion blow-out! Of course, the $20 billion blow-out has blown out all of Labor's money for what they said they would have been doing. They go on about Gonski, but they never ever funded Gonski—we all know that.


And then I come to the Gillard memorial halls and Building the Education Revolution. This was the one that was going to cost about $13 billion or $14 billion. Senator Ruston here remembers it quite well. I was on that committee with Senator Cash and it was not until we started putting a lot of pressure on the government of the day and pointing out their financial errors to them that they actually appointed Mr Brad Orgill to have a look into the squalid waste that went on with the Gillard memorial halls.


The principals were saying, 'We don't need new classrooms, thank you very much. We want toilet blocks.' The answer was, 'No, you're getting new classrooms! Rip the old ones out and away you go!' That is the pattern of the Labor Party. And now we have come to a point of congratulations, in my view, to Senator Birmingham, because he has been able to lay out so clearly where the government is increasing its investment in education.


In 2012-13 I chaired a Senate inquiry into teaching and learning—not the Gonski-level stuff, but why kids are not learning and why teachers cannot teach. I remember that the predecessor of Senator Simms was on that committee—Senator Wright—plus Senator Gallacher and, of course, my excellent education colleague, Senator McKenzie. The areas that we came up with were really interesting: engagement of parents, particularly from the youngest age; the actual capacity of the universities to turn out competent graduate teachers; the need for literacy and numeracy assessment of teachers—new teachers and others; professional development of teachers themselves—developing the excellence of teachers; and literacy and numeracy in the children—back-to-basics.


As I recall, this was indeed a unanimous report in its recommendations and added rural, remote and regional students to those disadvantaged, along with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups, lower socioeconomic groups and disabled children. I am very proud to say that in government we have seen the recommendations of that report find their way into the coalition's policy on education.


So what do we have today? We have remarkable figures. I will just concentrate on those from our own home state of Western Australia, if I may, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson. Commonwealth funding to government schools across Australia will grow by $1.9 billion by 2019-20. That is an increase—an increase!—of 33 per cent. That is for government schools across Australia. For non-government schools it will be a growth of $2.2 billion by 2019-20, a 22.7 per cent increase. In the case of Western Australia, of which I am very proud, we will see total Commonwealth funding to all schools increase by $600 million between 2015-16 and 2019-20. That is a 38 per cent increase. Where is the decrease in funding to education?


Let me break that down a bit further, if I can. For government schools in the West there will be an increase of $367 million by 2019-20, an increase of 65 per cent—65 per cent! And for the non-government school sector there will be an increase of $229 million, or 23 per cent. These are the sorts of statistics that we are talking about.


But in our inquiry, when we looked at teaching and learning we went to look at what Finland was doing. Our committee, which included my colleague, Senator Bilyk, the now Deputy President and Senator McKenzie—




Senator Bilyk:
  I never went to Finland!




Senator BACK:
  We went up to China and spoke to people in the primary, secondary and tertiary education sectors. When you examine closely the performance of those who are excellent in their delivery of education services you see that it is not just money. It is not just a question of throwing extra dollars. It is a question of parental engagement, it is a question of motivation of children and it is a question of teachers in front of children who themselves are qualified in the discipline that they are teaching, and that they have adequate resources to actually undertake that teaching. Do we know that these children and their teachers must be literate and they must be numerate before those children are going to learn? That is where the incentives are and that is where the needs lie. Just throwing money as a solution never works, as we know. It did not work in the Gillard memorial halls, as we know, and it certainly will not work if—well, Labor do not have the $20 billion now that they thought they had because it went up in smoke last night!


What we need to focus on is just where the coalition is taking education in this country. In the few moments left available to me I will just refer the Senate to Dr Jennifer Buckingham from the Centre for Independent Studies. She has praised the work that Senator Birmingham is leading in early phonics checking. Children who are deaf cannot learn: if you cannot hear you cannot learn. Only in the last few days, the Independent Schools Council of Australia—Ms Collette Colman—welcomed the coalition's plan. She said it ensured the ongoing affordability and sustainability of independent schools. And, of course, the National Catholic Education Commission executive director said:


… future funding that reflects real costs for schools.


The cost of educating a child in a Catholic school is 10 per cent less than in a government school. Where is the difference in that performance? It is not money, it is quality.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:07):  At the last election, at polling booths across the country, the Liberal government erected corflute posters saying, 'Liberals will match Labor's school funding dollar for dollar.' They went out of their way to say that they were on a unity ticket with Labor. We know that that was untrue. We know that they have comprehensively broken that promise. In fact, their promise on education was broken at the first opportunity. I suggest that maybe the government was not serious about school funding in the first place. After the election, Mr Turnbull's government decided to dump the Gonski reforms and rip over $30 billion from our schools. It is really interesting to sit here and listen to the contributions from the other side. They were out there saying, 'Gonski is evil, Gonski is bad, Gonski is no good. But they said they were on 'a unity ticket', and the corflute posters said the Liberals would 'match Labor school funding dollar for dollar'. I do not think the people of Australia are likely to forget that. 


What does $30 billion ripped from our schools mean for my home state of Tassie? Over 10 years, it will mean $682 million will be ripped out of classrooms in Tasmania—$295 million in the greater Hobart region, $116 million in the electorate of Franklin, $154 million in the electorate of Bass, $142 million in the electorate of Braddon, $178 million in the electorate of Denison and $90 million in the electorate of Lyons.


Yesterday's announcement by the government was truly pathetic. We have had so many thought bubbles about education. They said, 'We're not going to fund public education.' It might not be parliamentary to say this, but I was gobsmacked by that. Both of my kids went through the public school system in Tasmania—a state primary school, a state high school and the University of Tasmania—and they had an absolutely great education. My son has worked overseas for a few years. He came back and, a few months later, was able to pick up work. My daughter has never not worked.


I am astounded that the government could have so little regard for public education that they would actually say, 'We won't fund public education.' But then, oops-a-daisy, they realised what they had said. But I do not trust them not to do it. That was a little slip of the tongue, but my big concern is about what they will do in cutting money to public schools if they are re-elected. Having decided to rip $30 billion out over the next 10 years, they have committed to return just $1.2 billion over three years and they are trying to claim that they are heroes. It is absolutely astounding. It is not a genuine attempt to properly fund schools or education. It is a cynical attempt to make them look like they are providing extra funding to education when they have really walked away from it. They have walked away from the funding commitments that they promised the Australian people at the last election. It is an utter betrayal of the 81,132 students in government schools and the 39,798 students in non-government schools throughout Tasmania and their parents and their carers. Those opposite should truly be ashamed. 


The failure of the Turnbull government to fully fund years 5 and 6 of the Gonski education model is going to have a devastating impact on Tasmania's budgetary position and educational outcomes for all of Tasmania's school children. Even the Tasmanian education minister understands the importance of this funding, the short-sightedness of the Turnbull cuts and the need for it to be maintained. I think there is a bit of angst happening there between the state minister and Mr Turnbull, because the state minister has said that he will actually fund it. That is money he is going to have to find somewhere that he will be cutting out of other services—and where that goes is anybody's business. But he will have to find the money and, obviously, that is money Tasmanians will not have to spend on health care or other essential services.


Mr Turnbull's belief that Australians will not notice the $30 billion cut if they return $1.2 billion is condescending and it is arrogant, which is pretty typical of what we have come to expect— (Time expired)

That the Senate take note of the reports.

The first project is the fit-out of the new leased premises for the Australian Taxation Office in Gosford, New South Wales. The estimated cost of the project is $20.8 million. The ATO will lease the new building in Gosford consisting of approximately 7,350 square metres and occupying around 27 per cent of the site of the former Gosford School of Arts and the Gosford Primary School. The new building will be constructed by DOMA, with the ATO responsible for the internal fit-out only. At the public hearing, the ATO reassured the committee that the tender process for the project had been rigorous. The ATO also outlined some of the benefits for the local community, including the creation of jobs during the construction and fit-out works and employment opportunities for around 600 staff delivering ATO services when the offices are operational. The committee notes that the ATO has a reputation of leadership and excellence in property portfolio management and has a sound track record of delivering projects on time and within budget. This is ably illustrated by fit-out works in Dandenong, Box Hill, Melbourne Docklands, Albury and Wollongong. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed.


Two of the proposed projects considered by the committee in report 4 are to be delivered by the Department of Defence. The first Defence project is the upgrade of the Puckapunyal Military Area high-voltage power supply. The committee heard that the existing electrical distribution network at Puckapunyal has been developed in a piecemeal fashion over many years. In the event of a partial system failure, the network does not provide an alternate power supply route, and some parts of the network have now reached end of life. Also, looking forward to 2028, Defence has predicted that the demand for electrical power will exceed the available power. The estimated cost of the project is $32.7 million.


The second Defence project is the Air 5428 Phase 1 Pilot Training System Facilities Project. The main objective of the project is to deliver fit-for-purpose facilities to support a new pilot training system. The works will be conducted at RAAF bases in East Sale, Edinburgh, Williamtown and at Pearce and Gin Gin in my home state of Western Australia. The estimated cost of the project is $329.8 million.


The committee is satisfied that both these Defence projects have merit in terms of need, scope and cost and has recommended that both projects proceed. The committee made two additional recommendations for the Air 5428 Phase 1 Pilot Training System Facilities Project, requiring the Department of Defence to, first, provide updates in relation to the contamination levels detected at any sites associated with the project and, secondly, to provide an update on the outcome of the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast conducted at RAAF Base East Sale.


The final project in report 4 addresses the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and its waste management facilities extension upgrade. Increasing domestic and international demand for the nuclear medicines produced at ANSTO as well as the need to decommission end-of-life nuclear facilities mean that ANSTO's available waste storage will be at capacity in early 2017. This is well before the new national radioactive waste management facility is expected to be completed in the year 2020. The proposed works will provide additional temporary storage of both low- and immediate-level solid waste at ANSTO's Lucas Heights campus. The estimated cost of the project is $22.3 million. Submissions from the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Medical Association for the Prevention of War and the Public Health Association of Australia supported the allocation of funds for extended interim storage capacity at Lucas Heights pending site selection for the new national facility. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed. In addition, the committee requires that ANSTO provide it with an update on any regulatory requirements, as sought by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office, which may affect the scope and cost of the project.


I commend report 4 of 2016 to the Senate.


Report 5 of 2016 addresses the proposed fit-out of new lease premises for the Australian Federal Police at 45 Commercial Road, Newstead in Queensland. This project was referred to the committee in March 2016. The lease for the AFP's Queensland state headquarters at 203 Wharf Street expires on 31 March 2017 and will not be renewed. The AFP intends to fit out newly leased premises at Commercial Road, Newstead, at an estimated cost of $25 million.


At the public hearing the committee queried the procurement process that led to the final selection of the Commercial Road premises. The committee was told that the process had started in May 2013. By May 2014 the AFP had shortlisted six of the 14 proposals received. This shortlist was further reduced to two options, and in September 2014 the Commercial Road site building was selected as the preferred site. In 2015 the project was suspended to reassess risks associated with a heightened security environment. Additional mitigations to the works were required, including the construction of bollards and treatments to the building perimeter and facade. These mitigations escalated the estimated costs of security treatments from $1.2 million to $9.1 million, representing a 650 per cent cost increase. The committee was told that the building security considerations had not been given significant attention until the later stages of the procurement process. The committee considers that earlier consideration of security needs could have led to a different outcome in terms of selection of the preferred building and may have reduced the security measures' cost escalation.


As lease approval has been finalised, the committee understands continuing with the Commercial Road premises, albeit with enhanced security, is the most appropriate way forward. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that the project proceed. The committee requires that the AFP review and amend as necessary its procurement processes to ensure the early identification and assessment of security requirements. The review should include consideration of site selection processes to ensure that it is not unnecessarily constrained.


I commend the report No. 5 of 2016 to the Senate.


Finally, report 6 of 2016 addresses the C17 maintenance facility, aircraft apron and associated infrastructure project at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland which was referred to the committee in March of this year. Thirty-Six Squadron is located at Amberley and is responsible for operating eight C17A aircraft. These heavy aircraft assist with strategic air transport, military operations and humanitarian efforts conducted both domestically and abroad. The Department of Defence is seeking approval to supply new facilities at RAAF Base Amberley in order to support the C17A aircraft. The estimated cost of the project is $219.4 million.


Defence advised that Amberley's existing heavy aircraft maintenance facilities, which are currently shared, supporting both the C17A and KC30A aircraft, are insufficient. Acquisition of additional aircraft will place further pressure on existing facilities. New facilities, including a new maintenance hangar, aircraft apron and explosive ordnance and countermeasures facility, would improve efficiency. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and costs and recommends that it proceed.


As this is likely to be the last report of the committee for the current parliament, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the work of the committee since I became its chair in March 2015. 2015 was an extremely busy year for the committee, which held more meetings and dealt with more referrals than in any of the proceeding five years. During 2015 the committee reported on 22 referrals, with a combined value of $3.1 billion. By comparison, in 2014 the committee dealt with 13 referrals an in 2013 just 14 referrals. In addition, in 2015 the committee approved 37 medium works, with a combined value of $253.3 million. The committee held a total of 44 meetings, comprising private meetings, inspections, and public and in camera hearings. Of these meetings, 26 were in Canberra and 17 were interstate, with the remaining meetings conducted via teleconference. The first part of 2016 is shaping up to be another very busy year for the committee. In the first four months of 2016, the committee has reported on 10 referrals, with a combined value of $1.37 billion, and approved 29 medium works, valued at $130 million.


In closing, I would like to extend my thanks and those of my fellow committee members to committee secretary Alison Clegg and all the staff in the committee secretariat for their continuing hard work, professionalism and dedication to the ongoing work of the Public Works Committee.

Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



FINANCIAL SYSTEM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RESILIENCE AND COLLATERAL PROTECTION) BILL 2016


Today I introduce the Financial System Legislation Amendment (Resilience and Collateral Protection) Bill 2016(the 'Bill'). 


This Bill will create a more resilient and stable financial system, and provide for the continuing participation of Australian entities in international capital markets. 


In doing so, the Bill amends six existing pieces of legislation: the Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998 ('Netting Act'), Banking Act 1959 ('Banking Act'), Financial Sector (Business Transfer and Group Restructure) Act 1999 ('Business Transfer Act'), Insurance Act 1973 ('Insurance Act'), Life Insurance Act 1995 ('Life Insurance Act')and Private Health Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2015 ('PHI Act').


In response to the global financial crisis (GFC), the Group of Twenty (G20) committed to improve transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse in derivatives markets. Significant progress has already been done in pursuit of these aims, in Australian and international over-the-counter derivatives markets. 


However, there is still work to do. The international over-the-counter derivatives market is large, and requires further regulation. The Bank of International Settlements reports that the notional amount of outstanding over-the-counter derivative contracts was US$553 trillion (at end-June 2015).


The next significant stage in the post-GFC reform of over-the-counter derivatives is to establish margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Board of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have agreed on an international framework, to be implemented by national regulators. These margin requirements are expected to be phased in from 1 September 2016.


However, under existing law, Australian entities may not be able to comply with all of the relevant requirements. Without this Bill, they will likely face increasing costs and other barriers to participation in international markets.


This Bill creates a facilitative regime which will allow Australian entities to comply with the new requirements, and in so doing, remain globally competitive and efficient traders. The Bill does not establish the margin requirements per se, but will complement and support any margin requirements for derivatives and risk mitigation standards set by Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, in accordance with the international framework, and by international regulators.


This Bill also resolves other issues of concern to regulators and industry participants in Australian financial markets. For example, this Bill strengthens the protection of certain payment systems, settlement systems, exchanges and central counterparties. These are fundamentally important to the stability of the Australian financial system and it is critical that they benefit from robust legal protections in all market conditions.


This Bill is a result of careful and rigorous consultation with the Council of Financial Regulators (the Council, which is comprised of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and the Australian Treasury); as well as a range of industry bodies, market participants and their advisers.


The Government has consulted the public on various forms of the measures in this Bill, and made a call for submissions on the entire reform package following the release of the draft Bill. Submissions primarily came from the financial services sector, including from Australian and international industry bodies and other market participants. As a whole, they were highly supportive of the reforms. 




THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK



This Bill will ensure Australian law continues to provide a strong foundation for modern, and truly international financial markets; and for the effective participation of Australian entities within them.


This Bill establishes a functional and protective framework which is flexible enough to cope with a range of sophisticated financial market structures and inevitable changes in market practice. 


It contains reforms which are technically sophisticated and which are expected to provide a pragmatic and practical regime for market participants and their advisers. 


This Bill does not impose onerous regulation. Rather, it allows entities which are subject to Australian law to provide and enforce rights in respect of, margin provided under derivatives transactions in accordance with internationally developed regulatory requirements. It does this by expanding the protections afforded to close-out netting, to cover the enforcement of security.


This Bill resolves an inconsistency in Australian law as to the circumstances in which a counterparty to an Australian regulated body may exercise its termination rights (i.e. when it can close-out transactions related to a contract). This brings Australian law into line with international best practice, and supports efficient resolution of Australian financial institutions in distress.


This Bill strengthens the protection of certain payment systems, settlement systems, exchanges and central counterparties. These are fundamentally important to the stability of the Australian financial system and require robust legal protections in all market conditions.


This Bill also contains a number of regulatory powers to allow the Government to move quickly to adapt to significant upheaval in financial markets and any events which could otherwise threaten systemic stability. 


In addition to the reforms I have described, the Bill also contains a number of more technical and consequential amendments to certain Australian Acts related to Australian financial markets. 


The new regime draws on a wealth of sources. It builds on lessons learned in other jurisdictions, including in the United Kingdom and European Union; the products of extensive consultation; and the input of technical experts.




MINCO APPROVAL



This Bill will alter the effect, scope or operation of the Corporations Law. Accordingly, as required by clause 510 of the Corporations Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth has notified the States and the Northern Territory of the Bill. 




SUMMING UP



This Bill advances the Australian Government's reform agenda for financial systems, by enhancing the integrity and safety of the derivatives markets in particular, and the financial system as a whole.


Passage of this Bill will complement other important reforms to the regulation of Australian over-the-counter derivatives markets, and corresponding international efforts. 


Passage of this Bill will ensure Australia maintains its position as a regional financial centre with a strong regulatory and legislative framework, and that Australian entities can continue to transact with domestic and international counterparties – supported by Australian law.


NATIONAL DISABILITY INSURANCE SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2016


This Bill amends the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 to increase the maximum number of members of the Board of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency (known as the NDIA).


Replacing the current provision for eight Board members, the Minister will now have capacity to appoint up to 11 members, aside from the Chair. As a minor consequence, quorum arrangements for Board meetings will also be clarified.


The National Disability Insurance Scheme (known as the NDIS) is a significant social reform, and the Government has an intense focus on its design, administration and implementation.


It is a significantly complex reform, with governance shared between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. It requires close oversight of financial sustainability, potential risks to scheme participants and providers, and delivery of the scheme across Australia.


The NDIA will be responsible for implementing the transition from trial to the full roll‑out of the NDIS across Australia, which, when fully established, is estimated to provide support to over 460,000 participants, with a full scheme budget of around $22 billion per annum.


Over the next four years, the NDIS will be moving into a rapid growth phase, where participant numbers will increase from 19,758 people across its trial sites as at 30 September 2015, to over 460,000 people across the country in 2019-20. As the NDIS enters the transition stage, the NDIA will commence increasing the size of its workforce, outsourcing arrangements for many NDIS functions and implementing its full scheme Information Communications Technology solution.


The NDIA Board is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the NDIS and its long-term sustainability. The Board manages the financial and delivery risk of the scheme, including maintaining an actuarial and insurance approach to decision making within the scheme. The Board develops the NDIA's business strategies, manages risks to the organisation and the NDIS and, through its Chief Executive Officer, handles the day-to-day management of the NDIA.


The Government, along with the states and territories, has therefore reached the view that the NDIA needs a Board with a broader range of skills and experience to manage the rapid increase in participants, and to address the emerging challenges that come with a reform of this scale.


Governments have agreed that the Board requires skills suited to the specific challenges of the transition phase, including strategy, risk, insurance, corporate governance and implementation, as well as experience in large enterprises of an equivalent national scale and complexity.


An independent review of the skills and experience required in the NDIA Board for the transition stage found that the next iteration of the Board should have strong ASX50 or large Government Business Enterprise-level experience in operation and financial systems and controls. The review identified a need for better representation of experience in change and financial management, and deep expertise in the management of insurance-based schemes.


Following this independent review and consultation with state and territory governments, the Commonwealth Government has concluded that a Board of eight members plus a Chair does not allow for the diversity and strength required of a Board that is managing the anticipated rapid increase of participants and administering a $22 billion insurance-based scheme.


A larger NDIA Board will ensure it has a balance of skills, knowledge and experience in disability services, financial management and corporate governance management of insurance or compensation schemes, to enable the Board to meet the challenges of the next phase of the NDIS effectively.


To implement this measure, a staged approach to changing the membership of the NDIA Board has been agreed with members of COAG's Disability Reform Council, to ensure continuity while also producing optimal governance outcomes during the transition to full scheme. Our view is that, until the NDIS reaches maturity, the Board should consist of 11 members and a Chair.


The size of the NDIA Board is set out in section 126 of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013. This Bill amends section 126 to change the number of members (aside from the Chair) from eight to up to 11, providing the Minister with the flexibility to decrease the size of the Board at a point when it is considered appropriate and prudent to do so.


As a minor consequence of this change, section 138, providing for a quorum for Board meetings, is also amended to ensure a quorum is constituted when a majority of the members are present.


This Government remains committed to the full roll-out of the NDIS, with its attendant benefits for people with disability, their families, their carers, and for the broader Australian community of which they are a valued part.


These changes ensure the NDIA Board overseeing this major social policy reform has the mix and diversity of skills, capabilities and leadership to bring the NDIS to full scheme within the timeframe agreed to with states and territories, and within the allocated Budget.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:20):  I move: 


That the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area—East Kimberley) Determination 2016, made under subsections 124PD(2) and 124PG(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1999, be disallowed.


I am standing yet again to draw the attention of this place to the impact of the cashless welfare card and give this place another opportunity to change their minds and realise that the evidence shows that this approach does not work.


It is clear that this is an ideological push from the government, supported by the ALP, to foist onto a community a particular means of control that will have significant impacts on those people who are affected and their communities. The evidence is really clear. I have read the evidence out to this place time and time again yet, still, in the face of the evidence, the government and the ALP refuse to acknowledge that income management—because that is what this is—does not work. That is what this is. I acknowledge it is not quite the same—it is in fact on steroids—but that is what this is.




Senator Sterle:
  You are on another planet, Rachel, you really are. The last thing they need is a white fella to tell them.




Senator SIEWERT:
  If I could please not be interrupted that would be appreciated, Deputy President.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes. Thank you.



Senator Sterle interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator SIEWERT:
  If Senator Sterle would stop interrupting, I will describe what the Aboriginal community in Geraldton is saying about the attempt to foist the cashless welfare card upon them. They are at least being afforded the opportunity to have a significant debate about this particular issue, whereas other communities are not.



Senator Sterle interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Siewert has asked to be heard in silence. As she has made such a request, I require the Senate to hear her in silence.




Senator SIEWERT:
  As I was saying, this is essentially income management. The evidence clearly shows that it does not work. Yes, communities are desperate to find some ways forward on the issues of drug and alcohol abuse and gambling. I share their very deep concerns. I have been in many communities and I have seen the impact on them. The point is that this particular approach does not work. Income management does not work. The Northern Territory evaluation showed that. It shows it in other places. Voluntary income management in some places and on some things can work. Again, I have acknowledged that many times in this place. But foisting this cashless debit card—some people call it a welfare card—on communities is the wrong way to go.


In Ceduna, where this card has been rolling out for about a month, we are already seeing examples of some significant problems, going way beyond the initial teething problems that people have been talking about. I am getting a lot of emails from people in community over there that the problems with the card are more than teething problems. Just yesterday, I received another email from someone who was trying to use the card. Their partner has been unable to use the BPAY option on the card, so they are unable to pay their water bill. I have heard an account of someone being unable to pay their other bills. This person has had to rely on their neighbours' help to buy groceries, because they have not been able to pay their bills. She has not been able to pay for her car registration or her insurance bills. These are just a few of the types of problems that people are facing every day because of the government's unfair and inefficient cashless welfare card.


When I raised the issue that people have to pay an EFTPOS cost at particular merchant places to use EFTPOS, the minister said: 'It's okay. Contrary to the evidence that we gave in estimates, or since the information that we gave in estimates'—where they said, very clearly, that they had not been able to achieve an agreement with the merchants in Ceduna about EFTPOS costs—'we've now reached an agreement. That's not happening.' On the same day the minister said that, I received a message that said: 'I'm one of those merchants. I charge a cost on my EFTPOS, and the government hasn't been anywhere near me.' Clearly, there were merchants in Ceduna, at that point in time, who were still charging for the use of EFTPOS even for small purchases. So I do not accept that these issues are plain sailing.


There has also been much made during the debate on this particular card about the community panel: 'It's okay. You can go to the community panel, and you can get the amount that is quarantined reduced from 80 per cent down to the minimum of 50 per cent.' The most you can take it down to is 50 per cent. People have talked to me about the excessive length of time required to achieve any agreement—that is if you feel like going to the people on the panel, who may be your neighbours or people in the community that you do not get along with or people with whom you have had no say about them being on the so-called community panel.


Things are not going swimmingly with this particular card. People in the Kimberley have talked to me about not being consulted about the card rolling into town in the first place. People from the department are going round talking to people—in the park, for example—about the possible introduction of the card, but they are talking to people whose first language is not English, and to some people for whom English is not their second language. People think they are enabled to opt out: when they were first told about the card, it was done in such a manner that they understood they would be able to opt out. In Geraldton, the member for Durack is telling people they can opt out, so I am not surprised if the message is going through to the East Kimberley that perhaps people could opt out of this particular card. But you are not able to opt out of this card if it applies to you in the trial sites—that is, if you are on a range of working age income support payments. But I have also heard it said for the Geraldton that maybe the government could change it and it would just apply to people on Newstart, whereas in Ceduna and in East Kimberley, if this disallowance does not go ahead, people on DSP—disability support pension—on Newstart, on other working age payments are forced onto this particular card, which quarantines 80 per cent of their income support payments.


I have also talked extensively in this place about the impact that has on people's ability to make their own funding decisions. Clearly, for the examples that I have just articulated from Ceduna, people are having trouble being able to manage their money—exactly what they were warned about is in fact happening. People are not able to manage their money effectively; the card is not working. I do not know if anybody has seen one of these cards. Andrew Forrest, the major proponent of this particular card, said in evidence to the committee of inquiry into this bill: 'This will just be like anybody else's debit card. Nobody will be able to tell the difference. It will be operating just like normal.' Well, clearly, it is not operating just like a normal debit or credit card; it is simply not. It is a particular type of card with Indue on there, so anybody in community or in your town knows that you are on income support because you use that card. You have to use that card. It is the only way that you can make purchases. So it is simply not true to say, 'This will operate like anybody else's debit card.' I will tell you what, with my debit card—

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:20):  I move: 


That the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area—East Kimberley) Determination 2016, made under subsections 124PD(2) and 124PG(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1999, be disallowed.


I am standing yet again to draw the attention of this place to the impact of the cashless welfare card and give this place another opportunity to change their minds and realise that the evidence shows that this approach does not work.


It is clear that this is an ideological push from the government, supported by the ALP, to foist onto a community a particular means of control that will have significant impacts on those people who are affected and their communities. The evidence is really clear. I have read the evidence out to this place time and time again yet, still, in the face of the evidence, the government and the ALP refuse to acknowledge that income management—because that is what this is—does not work. That is what this is. I acknowledge it is not quite the same—it is in fact on steroids—but that is what this is.




Senator Sterle:
  You are on another planet, Rachel, you really are. The last thing they need is a white fella to tell them.




Senator SIEWERT:
  If I could please not be interrupted that would be appreciated, Deputy President.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes. Thank you.



Senator Sterle interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator SIEWERT:
  If Senator Sterle would stop interrupting, I will describe what the Aboriginal community in Geraldton is saying about the attempt to foist the cashless welfare card upon them. They are at least being afforded the opportunity to have a significant debate about this particular issue, whereas other communities are not.



Senator Sterle interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Siewert has asked to be heard in silence. As she has made such a request, I require the Senate to hear her in silence.




Senator SIEWERT:
  As I was saying, this is essentially income management. The evidence clearly shows that it does not work. Yes, communities are desperate to find some ways forward on the issues of drug and alcohol abuse and gambling. I share their very deep concerns. I have been in many communities and I have seen the impact on them. The point is that this particular approach does not work. Income management does not work. The Northern Territory evaluation showed that. It shows it in other places. Voluntary income management in some places and on some things can work. Again, I have acknowledged that many times in this place. But foisting this cashless debit card—some people call it a welfare card—on communities is the wrong way to go.


In Ceduna, where this card has been rolling out for about a month, we are already seeing examples of some significant problems, going way beyond the initial teething problems that people have been talking about.

"Lindgren, Sen Joanna",LP,2016-05-03,"



Senator LINDGREN
 (Queensland) (20:32):  On 25 April every year since World War I, Australians have gathered to remember those who lost their lives in war and those who served this great country. So I thought it was fitting that I also speak about the contribution animals have made to our Anzac story.


A short time after midnight on 2 March 1942, after fierce fighting, HMAS Perth, along with USS Houston, were sunk in the Battle of the Sunda Strait. Of the 354 lives lost from the Perth, one was the ship's cat, Red Lead. We know this, because at the end of the war those survivors who lived through Japanese imprisonment were able to confirm this.


It is not known if he survived the battle to drown as the ship went down, struggling to stay afloat, or if he had lain there on the deck, injured and dying with his shipmates, or was killed outright. Like so many sailors, we just will never know what this cat's final minutes were like. But we do know that he shared death with many of his shipmates.


Interestingly, the log of HMAS Perth showed that Red Lead had tried to leave, or 'desert', ship three times just prior to sailing to its fate. Each time a sailor stopped him and returned him to the ship. The log reads:


Red Lead, ship's kitten, endeavoured to desert, but was brought back on board, despite vigorous protests.


Today's HMAS Perth has a painting of Red Lead on the bridge, a fitting memorial to an animal who shared the life and dangers of a sailor.


Animals have been with our armed forces either as working animals or as mascots, and many a time they have shared the same fate as their human mates. We all know the story of Simpson and his donkey, Murphy, but he was not the only donkey that carried wounded to the beach. We know of at least two others: one with Bert Latrobe of the 1st Australian Field Ambulance and the other with Dick Henderson of the New Zealand Medical Corps.


There were horses and considered fit enough to be sold to the Indian Army after World War I. There are plenty of stories of the stress felt by the Light Horsemen, leaving the horse that had faithfully carried them. One of our former senators, Major General Harold 'Pompey' Elliott left behind his trusted mount in England; after it served him well in Europe during World War I. He was so distressed that he had done this that he left a note with his horse, Darkie, outlining his service as a trusted mount. He was delighted later to receive a letter from the new owner assuring him that Darkie was being well cared for.


At the end of Australian involvement in Vietnam, the Australian Army left behind 11 labrador tracking dogs due to quarantine regulations and attitudes of the time. I am, like most Australians, happy to see that today's animals, such as Sabi, are returned to Australia. And we no longer see other shameful acts, such as animals being treated badly due to quarantine issues back home. Some animals, such as a small dog called Horrie, did not serve as either a working animal or mascot but became a pet of some soldiers during the North African campaign in World War II.


Why do servicemen and woman become attached to animals while on the battlefield? Well, no doubt, some were taken in by soldiers out of sheer human decency, because they were hungry and abandoned. But what did they offer in return? Often cats and kittens were adopted by troops on the battlefield, and cats have performed other essential roles, such as raising morale. With their amusing and affectionate behaviour, they helped remind men and women far from Australia of 'normal' life, and the comforts of home.


I could name many other animals that went to war as working animals, mascots or pets. There are the names of animals that are known to us, but there are many more who are unknown but which were no less important to those who they served with.


I have been fortunate to have met a man called Nigel Allsopp, who leads an organisation called the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation. I congratulate Nigel on his efforts to share the stories of our war animals, and I support his endeavours to ensure Australians appreciate and understand their contribution to our war efforts.


I will conclude with words from the Australian War Animal Memorial Organisation:



Throughout history, in war and in peacetime, animals and mankind have worked alongside each other. As beasts of burden, messengers, protectors, mascots, and friends …
