That—
the Senate notes that:
the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that:
the sea level would rise by between 0.18 metres to 0.59 metres by the end of the century and that these projections do not include the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow because a basis in published literature was lacking,
there is medium confidence (that is a 50 per cent chance) that at least partial deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet, and possibly the West Antarctic ice sheet, would occur over a period of time, ranging from centuries to millennia for a global average temperature increase of 1° to 4°C (relative to 1990-2000), causing a contribution to a rise in sea level of 4 to 6 metres or more, and
many millions more people are projected to be flooded every year due to a sea level rise by 2080 and the numbers affected will be largest in the mega-deltas of Asia and Africa, while small islands are especially vulnerable,
recent scientific research, published too late for inclusion in the IPCC reports, suggests that the sea level is rising more quickly than previously thought and many eminent climate scientists, including Dr James Hansen, Head of Atmospheric Research for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, warn that a warming of 2o to 3oC could melt the ice sheets of West Antarctica and parts of Greenland, resulting in a sea level rise of 5 metres within a century,
assessing the impact of even a moderate rise in sea level in Australia remains inadequate for adaptation planning,
assessing the vulnerability of low coastal and estuarine regions requires not only mapping height above sea level but must take into account factors such as coastal morphology, susceptibility to long‑shore erosion, near shore bathymetry and storm surge frequency,
delaying analysis of the risk of the rise in sea level exacerbates the likelihood that such information may affect property values and investment through disclosure of increased hazards and possible reduced or more expensive insurance cover, and
an early response to the threat of rising sea levels may include avoiding investment in long-lived infrastructure in high risk areas; and
the following matter be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee for inquiry and report by 3 December 2007:
An assessment of the risks associated with the rise in sea level in Australia, including an appraisal of:
recent science relating to projections on the rise in sea level,
ecological, social and economic impacts for the full range of projections,
adaptation and mitigation strategies,
knowledge gaps and research needs, and
options to communicate risks and vulnerabilities to the Australian community.
I rise today to seek the support of the Senate in referring a matter relating to sea level rise in Australia for assessment by a Senate committee. The reason for this referral is that global warming is proceeding at a rate faster than anyone has anticipated. In fact, sea level rise is now proceeding 50 per cent faster than was predicted by the 2001 report of the IPCC. That is an extraordinarily frightening idea. I will repeat it: the most recent information reveals that sea levels are rising 50 per cent faster than levels predicted in that 2001 IPCC report.
In recent days we have had reports from many highly regarded scientific institutions telling us that the drought is going to be much worse because we are not going to get the rains that people had thought were coming. Overnight from the International Institute for Strategic Studies we have had a report saying that climate change could have global security implications on a par with nuclear war unless urgent action is taken. Yet yesterday we had the Prime Minister in waiting, the current Treasurer, Peter Costello, rushing out to tell us about his future agenda for Australia—and he did not mention climate change! It is completely unthinkable that anyone seeking a leadership position anywhere could not be considering climate change.
Unfortunately, we have got to a situation where a level of complacency has set in again. It is as if it is enough to say, ‘I now believe climate change is real and I’ll get around to doing something about it in the next 50 years.’ That is where we are up to at the moment—flexible targets for reducing energy intensity, not targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions overall. Since I got into the Senate I have been warning about the implications of sea level rise not only for Australia but for the whole world. But I have not gone as far as the International Institute for Strategic Studies. They say the global security implications of climate change are ‘on a par with nuclear war unless urgent action is taken’. They say global warming would hit crop yields and water availability everywhere, causing great human suffering and leading to regional strife. They say the effects would cause a host of problems, including rising sea levels, forced migration, freak storms, droughts, floods, extinctions, wildfires, disease epidemics and so on and so forth.
It is as if the discussion is now about whose target is the relevant one. But let us get back to the substance of the debate. We are talking about a catastrophe for humankind and the ecosystems on which we depend. We have to take action now. When I first moved this motion for a reference to examine the impact of sea level rise on coastal Australia it was defeated in this place by both the major parties. I hope that today I will at least be able to secure the support of the Labor opposition for this motion, because sea level rise and its impacts around Australia are likely to be dramatic. We are not just talking about sea level rise from thermal expansion of the oceans; we are talking about storm surges and we are talking about increased ice melt in the west Antarctic shelf and Greenland.
I would remind the Senate that scientists from around the world have just recently been telling us that the estimates of sea level rise are completely out of date. We know that the Greenland icecap is melting so quickly that pieces of ice several cubic kilometres in size are breaking off and triggering earthquakes. The chairman of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment says we have seen a massive acceleration of the speed with which these glaciers are moving into the sea. He was in Greenland looking at the problem of the melting icecap. He said the ice is moving at two metres an hour on a front five kilometres long and 1,500 metres deep. He said that means that this one glacier—at Ilulissat in Greenland—puts enough fresh water into the sea in one year to provide drinking water for a city the size of London for a year. The melt-water is pouring through to the bottom of the glacier, creating a lake 500 metres deep, which causes the glacier to float on land. He said these melt-water rivers are lubricating the glacier, like applying oil to a surface, and causing it to slide into the sea. It is causing a massive acceleration which could be catastrophic. And nobody is listening! I cannot believe the level of studied ignorance that is going on.
Since I first moved a very similar motion in the Senate some months ago, the government has moved to start the process of looking at sea level rise around Australia. I welcome that and I recognise that the Australian Greenhouse Office is coordinating some work with Geoscience Australia. They are looking at areas around Australia that are potentially vulnerable to sea level rise. By late next year they will have a first-pass national coastal vulnerability assessment. By the end of 2008 we are going to have the very first preliminary analysis of which areas of Australia are extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. Of course, we know from the Natural Hazards Research Centre at Macquarie University—just talking about the wider Sydney region, including the Central Coast and the South Coast—that there are almost 13,000 dwellings that are less than two metres above mean sea level and there are over 140,000 dwellings that are less than six metres above mean sea level. The reason that is significant is that, if the Greenland and west Antarctic icesheets go, we are talking about a five- to seven-metre sea level rise. But even a sea level rise of less than one metre would have huge ramifications for estuaries, for coastal Australia, and certainly for our Pacific island neighbours. Millions of people around the world are living in such vulnerable areas, so we have to do something.
When we have floods around Australia, as occurred recently in Tasmania, we see what happens when that is linked with strong and high seas, heavy rain and the highest tide we have seen in a long time. We get extensive flooding. We know that this is going to occur, yet there is no planning for it. Local government around Australia has been extremely slow to change local government planning schemes to accommodate sea level rise and the implications of coastal vulnerability. We still get local government giving planning permission for people to build right on the coast in areas that are vulnerable to flooding. Who is going to pick up the bill? The insurance industry has already said that it will not be responsible in the longer term for insuring properties that are built in areas that are known to be vulnerable to flooding. Is local government going to be sued by people who get planning permission and then have their places flooded? Who is going to compensate those properties and people? It is an issue that is certainly not going to go away. In fact, I would argue that the reason the government—and, in fact, state and local governments—have refused to look at the issue of vulnerability to sea level rise is that they are afraid that property prices on the coast will collapse and angry communities will start demanding answers as to who is going to compensate them if they cannot get insurance as a result of storm surges and flooding.
This is an extremely critical issue, and I can understand why property councils and local, state and federal governments are not interested in addressing it. But they have to get onto it. They have to do something about it. I am arguing that what the government has done by having this first-pass assessment of coastal vulnerability is not good enough and that is why this Senate inquiry is needed. It is not good enough because it is based on the assumptions that came out in the IPCC report earlier this year. Let me say at this point that I support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change processes absolutely, but I also recognise that they are extremely conservative in their estimates of sea level rise. That is because scientists are by nature conservative, and they have been under such scrutiny and criticism by governments, with the IPCC process also being a political process, that they have made predictions of sea level rise which are, in my view, the most conservative scenario. Several leading scientists have come out recently and said that. In fact, James Hansen, who is known as the father of climate change scientists, recently said that scientific reticence is inhibiting communications of a threat of potentially large sea level rises and that delay is dangerous because of a system inertia that could create a situation with future sea level changes out of our control. He is arguing for the calling together of a panel of scientific leaders to hear evidence and issue a prompt, plain-written report on current understanding of sea level change. He is saying that it is far more serious, that it is accelerating at a far greater rate, that the IPCC in 2001 got it wrong to the extent of 50 per cent—that is, there will be a 50 per cent greater sea level rise than they predicted. So if you go to the most recent report of the IPCC, which said that the sea level rise this century would be between 0.18 metres and 0.59 metres, and if you think that is 50 per cent wrong, then at the higher level you are talking about a 1.2-metre sea level rise. That is a more likely scenario, in my view, given the accelerated melt of the glaciers and what we know about sea level rise.
In August we had a visit to Australia of leading scientists from around the world. Professor Rahmstorf from Germany was here releasing a report saying the same thing, that the risks were not properly represented in the most recent IPCC report. At the time that report came out, Australia’s own Professor John Church said his research on the speed of the melt in the Antarctic and the extent of sea level rise had not been adequately taken into account by the IPCC. So let us assume that these scientists from all over the world are correct and that the IPCC’s report is the most conservative. It is then not good enough for the government to have set up a first pass over Australia’s coastline for a vulnerability analysis that is based on the IPCC’s figures. We should assume that is the absolute baseline, but we should be expanding the capacity of that assessment. We need to look not only at the recent science relating to projections on the rise of sea level but also at the knowledge gaps and the research needs. I believe we should be looking at setting a range of assumptions for this vulnerability to sea level rise analysis that includes the work of these other scientists, such as Professor Church, James Hansen and others around the world, so we get a much broader analysis of sea level rise.
Of course, governments will not want to do that because that will mean a greater number of Australian coastal communities are going to be seen to be in the vulnerable category. But surely it is better for us to err on the side of saying, ‘We need to know what we estimate to be the worst-case scenario, and work back from that,’ rather than saying, ‘Let’s not scare the horses and let’s just look at the minimal impacts of sea level rise.’ We know what happens when you get it wrong. We saw what happened when they got it wrong in New Orleans: they had been told that those levees were inadequate but, no, they thought they were okay based on what they knew from the last 100 years—and the place was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. We know, for example, that with sea level rise and global temperature increases the storm belt around Australia will move south. We know that Brisbane is going to be vulnerable to cyclones. Where is the adequate planning in south-east Queensland for the devastation from events that will occur because of global warming? We have also had recent studies looking at the thermohaline conveyor, the ocean conveyor that controls temperature in so many parts of the planet, including in Europe, where it controls the climate and makes northern Europe liveable because of its modifying effect. We now know that that is slowing down.
All of these trends are indicating that the world is facing a major crisis. Yet in Australia the best we can do is have a Prime Minister who is a sceptic; a Prime Minister in waiting who cannot even remember that climate change is an issue when he sets out his agenda for the future; and a government in waiting, in the opposition, who say they acknowledge climate change but will not set a short-term target and keep supporting expansion of the coal industry and the logging of high-conservation-value forests, which are huge carbon sinks. The opposition say they have a target but they will not say how they are going to meet it because two of the ways of meeting it—coal and forests—are off their agenda in terms of any reduction of ongoing activity. Australians deserve better. Australians deserve some honesty from government and an opportunity to have input. That is why a public inquiry, like a Senate inquiry, is essential. We need the scientists to come forward and tell us what their views are about whether the IPCC’s predictions are adequate and whether the terms of reference for the vulnerability analysis that is currently being conducted are adequate or should be expanded to include this new science, which is so very frightening, about how fast the glaziers are melting, how fast the temperatures are rising and how dramatically that is impacting climate and ecosystems.
Overnight from Europe we have had the release of the IUCN red list of threatened species for 2007. Once again we are being told that species are being lost at a far greater rate than before. Once you lose species and ecosystems you lose ecosystem services, which provide clean water and clean air to communities. We have a planet on which there are millions of people vulnerable at this very moment to sea level rise. Our Pacific island neighbours are sitting there, begging for assistance to deal with adaptation to known sea level rise and with concerns about planning for the future.
We need to mitigate increased global temperatures. We need to underpin all our policies with a commitment to constraining a rise in global temperature to less than two degrees. We need to have an honest discussion with the Australian people about the latest science on sea level rise, the vulnerability of coastal communities and the adequacy of planning in those coastal communities. We need to recognise that in some places we will be able to adapt to climate change by a range of engineering solutions but in other places we will not. In many areas, like Kakadu, for example, we will see the loss of large parts of the ecosystem because of saltwater incursion.
There will be coastal communities around Australia which will be tagged, as they have been in Britain, for managed retreat. It is shocking for Australians to hear, I am sure, that the British government, having analysed sea level rise and vulnerability around the UK, have said, ‘We cannot save the entire coastline of the UK. So there will be communities which we must assist in managed retreat.’ They now have a series of strategies to do that.
Australia is not even at first base. We cannot produce a map today that tells us what are the likely implications of sea level rise for vulnerable coastal communities. That is a disgrace when we know the science of climate change. So I urge the Senate and the ‘Prime Minister in waiting’ to get realistic about climate change, to stop obfuscating, to recognise that we are facing the greatest crisis that we have known in our lifetime. This is a much bigger issue than terrorism. Climate change and the earth’s vulnerability are in our face right now. We, as elected leaders, must respond to that. (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-09-13,"—I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Milne. I indicate that the opposition will be supporting this motion. I came in for the conclusion of Senator Milne’s speech. I may have misheard her, but I think she was being critical of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, as not being realistic about climate change. I have to say that that is yet another extraordinary example of Green hyperbole in this chamber, which I am getting a little tired of, given that the federal Labor Party has made its position in relation to climate change very clear. We have said for some time that this is a critical issue. I challenge people on the crossbenches to find a time in Australia’s history where there has been a leader of one of the major political parties, one of the parties capable of government, who has made an environmental issue such as this such a central political issue in their agenda for the future.
Labor absolutely understands the reality of climate change. We recognise that this is one of the key challenges facing Australia. This is one of the critical issues a government must face and must tackle. Unlike the Howard government, we accept the science. We say the science is in. We are not, unlike the government, in the game of pretending that this does not exist. What we see on the other side is Mr Howard belatedly recognising that climate change is a political issue, belatedly recognising that he has to be seen to be responding and putting forward a whole range of pretend policies, aspirational target type policies through APEC and so forth, to look as if he is doing something about it.
We on the other side know that this is a government filled with people who deny the reality of climate change. That is not verballing them. All you have to do is listen to some of the speeches given by Senator Minchin, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Read some of what he has said, or read the recent article by Senator Cory Bernardi, from my own state of South Australia, who yet again put forward the view that the jury in the case for human activity having impacted on climate change is still out. I think the Australian electorate is tired of that debate. I think the Australian electorate is tired of politicians who, for ideological reasons, want to hide their heads in the sand and run away from one of the critical, central challenges that this country faces, that the globe faces and that humanity faces.
We on this side of the chamber understand how important this issue is. We recognise that it is important not just in environmental terms but in economic and social terms. This is one of the issues that Senator Milne’s motion goes to. That is why Mr Rudd has made this a central aspect of Labor’s agenda for change, a central aspect of Labor’s plan for the future. We believe that any future government has to realistically and practically tackle climate change. We have put forward a range of policies to deal with that.
We saw the Leader of the Opposition hold a climate change summit which was instrumental in progressing the discussion about how to deal with this. We have said we would commission the equivalent of the Stern report, to be done by Professor Garnaut, to look at some of the economic impacts. This is the issue that the government seems to misunderstand. Senator Minchin, Senator Bernardi and Mr Macfarlane seem to think that this is some sort of fringe issue. They cannot get over their blind prejudices when it comes to this issue. The reality is that this is a central economic issue. This is a key economic issue, as well as a social and environmental one. You cannot assert that you are prudent and good economic managers if you are hiding or refusing to acknowledge the extent of the consequences of climate change on the Australian economy and the Australian community.
We on this side understand absolutely that climate change will have a dramatic impact on our nation and, in relation particularly to the sea level rise which was flagged in the IPCC fourth assessment report, obviously climate change will have a dramatic impact on Australia’s coastal communities. The federal government knows this. They may like to try to obfuscate and have various ministers and backbenchers write about it—and I see Senator Bernardi has come in. I acknowledge, Senator Bernardi, that I probably did not give you any warning that I was going to mention you in this debate, but I am glad that you are here to respond. Senator Bernardi, like Senator Minchin, is another one of those on that side who deny or are sceptical about the reality of climate change and whether human activity has in fact affected it. You are entitled to that view. I have to say I find it extraordinary given the weight of scientific agreement about this.
—Why didn’t you quote it in your rebuttal?
—Senator Bernardi, you can continue to come in here and run this hardline ideological position that is out of step with the Australian community and the South Australian community if you wish—that it is entirely your decision—but the reality is that Australians understand the reality of climate change. Those of us from South Australia are actually in the grip of an extraordinarily bad drought. Senator Bernardi knows that. People understand that we have had—and I cannot recall the statistics—something like nine of the driest years on record in the last 10. We understand the reality of climate change, unlike the government, who continues to deny it. It is quite extraordinary. It really demonstrates who the ideologues are in this chamber.
Who are the ideologues in this chamber? Are the ideologues the people who talk about choice, while putting forward radical and extreme industrial relations laws which make life harder for working people, or those who recognise that balance in the workplace is a good idea and having a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work is an Australian value? Who is the ideologue in the chamber who says that the science is still out in relation to human activity actually affecting climate change? Who are the ideologues? We know: they are Senator Bernardi, Senator Minchin and various others on the government benches who are still, in the face of all this scientific agreement, standing there saying, ‘Well, we’re not sure this is true.’
It is an extraordinary thing, isn’t it? It is like King Canute, but the other way around. It is saying, ‘No, we don’t believe this is really happening,’ as the evidence of climate change continues to grow, and it flies in the face of the government asserting that they are prudent economic managers. This is one of the largest economic challenges, if not the largest economic challenge, Australia will face in the years to come. This is one of the most central economic, social and environmental challenges this government or any government will face.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—It is interesting. Senator Bernardi keeps interjecting. I assume he will have some time to speak in the debate if he wishes, and the government can yet again get up and say, ‘Look, we are doing all these things.’ But do you know what? The Australian community understand you have not done anything. You have been in power for 11 years. You have been all over the shop when it comes to climate change and policies to tackle it. You were dragged kicking and screaming to an emissions trading regime which you only moved on, despite the fact that the industry minister ruled it out, because business and the community were ahead of you.
People understand the Howard government have only moved to look as if they are doing something about climate change because they are worried about the fact that they are out of touch with the community. You are only doing it because there is an election coming; you are not doing it because you believe in it. If you think the Australian people do not know that, go out and have a chat to them. They understand this is all about clever politics from the Howard government. It is not about actually believing this is an issue, because you have got form. You have been here for 11 years, and what have you done? You have dithered; you have denied; you have been sceptical; you have not acted. Now, before an election, when it becomes a major issue, all of a sudden the Senator Minchins put their heads down and everyone says, ‘Actually, we are going to do things,’ and what do you do? You say, ‘We have aspirational targets out of APEC,’ and you trumpet that as your big achievement.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—Senator Bernardi, you can keep interjecting, but I assume you are actually going to participate in this debate.
—No, I am not, actually.
—So he is not going to participate in this debate? He is happy to sit on the sidelines and have a go at me but he is not going to participate in the debate. How typical of the Howard government! You sit there knocking and saying, ‘This is not good,’ but what do you actually do? You have been in power for 11 long years. Where is the evidence that this government has ever seriously understood the enormity of the challenge that climate change represents to the Australian community, to the Australian environment and to the Australian economy? The government know about it because their 2005 report Climate change: risk and vulnerability suggests that as a result of climate change our country is likely to see an increase in annual average temperatures of between 0.4 and two degrees by 2030 and between one and six degrees by 2070.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, I do not mind people interjecting, but Senator Bernardi actually has not stopped interjecting for the last five minutes. If he wants to do that for the entirety of my speech, I am happy to continue to talk over him, but I would suggest that if he has something worthwhile to say—which is very unlikely in this debate—perhaps he could get up and give his own speech on it, because I would quite like to hear from Senator Bernardi, one of Senator Minchin’s acolytes, who does not believe that climate change has been impacted by human activity.
I would like to get him to stand up in the Senate and say that, because if it does not have anything to do with human activity, if human activity has not impacted on climate change, tell me what the Prime Minister was doing at APEC, Senator Bernardi. Why did he do that? If your thesis is correct and human activity has had nothing to do with global warming, which is the thesis of you and Senator Minchin, what was the Prime Minister doing? Because on that basis, the Prime Minister was just engaged in a huge PR exercise to deal with voters’ concerns.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—I welcome your interjection. You have the opportunity to speak in this debate subsequently, if you wish to, and you can explain exactly what the Prime Minister was doing at APEC, given that you do not believe that human activity actually has anything to do with climate change.
I will return now to the federal government’s own 2005 report, which I referred to earlier, which outlined some major threats to our marine environment and coastal communities. These include rising sea levels; more severe cyclones, storm surges and storms; possible reductions in average rainfall and run-off in southern and much of eastern Australia; rainfall increases across the tropical north; a reduction in rainfall in south-west Australia of a further 20 per cent—which is really quite chilling for those of us who live in South Australia—and a change in ocean currents affecting our coastal waters. These are amongst the consequences that the government’s own 2005 report, Climate change: risk and vulnerability, identified. Of course, we did not see action from the Howard government in response to that.
As Senator Milne’s motion outlines, one of the most significant consequences of global warming will be rising sea levels. The total observed sea level rise over the 20th century was in the order of 10 to 20 centimetres. Whilst there will be regional and local variations in that rise, there is clear scientific agreement—which Senator Bernardi obviously does not agree with—that sea levels are rising in response to past greenhouse gas emissions and that they will continue to rise during the 21st century.
The IPCC report published in February this year, about which there has been much discussion, projected a sea level rise of between 0.18 metres and 0.59 metres by 2100. Since that report was released, a number of reports have suggested that in fact that was an underestimation of the possible sea level rise as a result of melting glaciers and polar ice sheets. America’s leading climate change scientist, James Hansen, and five other leading scientists have suggested that sea level rises could be as much as several metres by the same date. As a consequence, it is generally accepted that the coastline will retreat horizontally 50 to 100 times the vertical sea level rise. Dr Barrie Pittock, a leading Australian climate change scientist, has stated:
There’s a crude rule of thumb which applies theoretically just to straight sandy beach, which suggests for every metre rise in sea level the coastline will retreat or go inland by 100m.
Similarly, Dr John Church of CSIRO argues that for every one centimetre of sea level rise you get about a metre of coastal erosion. The IPCC’s April report, Climate change 2007: impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, stated that, with regard to coastal impacts, coasts are projected to be exposed to increasing risks including coastal erosion; corals will be vulnerable to thermal stress; increases in sea surface temperature will lead to more frequent coral-bleaching events and widespread mortality; and, of course, there will be an effect on coastal wetlands such as salt marshes and mangroves—especially where they are constrained on the landward side. Any rise in sea levels will have an impact on coastal communities, which will face a significant challenge in the future. They already face one now as they prepare for the dramatic impacts of climate change. The fact is that the Commonwealth government must help them to meet this challenge.
The 2007 report of the Prime Minister’s Science, Innovation and Engineering Council, entitled Climate change in Australia: regional impacts and adaptation: managing the risk for Australia, nominated cities and coastal communities as one of the six key sectors at risk in the nation. Five priority coastal regions were identified for particular attention: the Brisbane-Gold Coast-Tweed Heads coastline, the Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong coastline, Melbourne-Geelong, and Adelaide and Perth. Continuing on the point I made at the outset, which is that climate change is an economic challenge as well as a social and an environmental one, one of the areas in which this has already started to occur is in relation to insurance costs. We know that insurers have to factor in the additional cost of various events which are predicted to increase as a result of climate change. I outlined some of these earlier: increased cyclones, storms and so forth. Obviously sea level rise is another one. This is one of the areas where we see that the Howard government lags behind not only community sentiment but also business sentiment. If you go and talk to many of Australia’s leading insurance companies, you will find that these companies have been pricing into their forward projections for some time the likelihood of increased weather disruption, severity of storms and so forth, as a result of climate change. My recollection is that Insurance Australia Group is one of the companies which were part of the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change. These are companies that recognise, as prudent corporate entities, that they have to manage the risk of climate change just as they manage any other business risk. It will have a financial impact, and that is why these companies want the government to do its part to set the framework to enable them to more effectively meet it. What we know is that insurers and other leading Australian companies have been factoring the cost of climate change into their business risk management plans. It is unfortunate that the government has not factored it in over 11 years and continues to simply engage in window dressing.
As I said, rising insurance costs and issues of compensation and appropriate zoning will need to be factored into Australia’s future coastal planning and management. Climate change pressures, particularly the threat of increases in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events, have led to reconsideration of existing actuarial assessments of extreme weather risks. A potential outcome of these impacts is an increase in the cost of insurance cover, higher excesses and even possibly withdrawal of coverage in some areas as insurance companies would not be able to provide insurance at a reasonable cost or at all. Mr Bruce Thomas of Swiss Re stated:
Houses built on the coast and rivers, in areas that have a larger than one-in-100-year flood events, would find insurance too prohibitive.
Frankly, what we have is a change in the earth’s weather patterns that is of extraordinary proportions over time. It is the largest and most significant economic, social and environmental challenge that any future government should face. What is regrettable is that the Howard government, after 11 long years, has done nothing to prepare Australia for this. What we have instead is a government that is stacked with climate change sceptics. This has impacted on its ability to reasonably respond. It has no plans for the future when it comes to climate change; what it has is a plan until the next election. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-09-13,"—Senator Milne’s motion points to the important and serious role that the Greens take, and have taken over the last decade and more, in trying to bring to the attention and the notice of government and this parliament the incredible impact that climate change is going to have on every Australian’s life over the coming centuries. The motion from Senator Milne is notable for its conservatism. It is a motion to have a Senate inquiry look at the impact of sea level rises on Australia—to gather from the scientific community, the planning community, the business community and from all Australians information about the impact that climate change, through sea level rises, is having and will have on every Australian.
It needs to be reiterated, if I may short-hand it, that Sir Nicholas Stern said in this city, in Canberra, earlier this year, that if we are not prepared to have a one per cent diversion of our wealth now to tackle climate change then the impact on our grandchildren may be a 20 per cent diversion of wealth. With that will come a massive disruption to the psychology of peace and happiness for this planet as it tangles with mass migrations and, potentially, civil conflicts and wars, huge impacts on business and on the general sense of wellbeing on the planet as the environmental catastrophe overtakes us in all areas of living on the planet. I congratulate the opposition, by the way, it having rejected Senator Milne’s earlier move for an inquiry three months ago, for now seeing the sense in our proceeding with an inquiry and agreeing with Senator Milne that this is the responsibility of the Senate, that this is the proper function of the Senate.
The question now comes onto the government. This is again a very big test of the Howard government’s commitment to using its numbers in the Senate with prudence and in the interests of all Australians. There is no way the government can use its numbers to prevent this inquiry and stick with that commitment. Yesterday the Prime Minister reasserted his authority in government. He said he is about to reveal goals for the future and he will see them through before handing the reins to his Prime Minister-in-waiting, Mr Costello. One of the challenges for Mr Howard is to throw off the inhibition, if not the scepticism, of the last decade and to not only make this nation prepared to deal with the reality of the impact of climate change but also put us back in the forefront of the world in legislating to minimise that impact, which is coming down the road on our children, our grandchildren and their offspring for many generations to come. This is a prime responsibility of us as parliamentarians. It is a responsibility that Prime Minister Howard has failed to meet and which now challenges him as Prime Minister of this country. If the direction from the Prime Minister’s office to this Senate, through the government, is to squash an inquiry to look into the fundamentals of the impact of climate change on Australia’s coastlines, it will be a clear statement by the Prime Minister that he is still unable to rise to the Australia of the 21st century, that he is still back in last century’s thinking.
As Senator Milne has pointed out, even the scientists have been too conservative on the matter. Anybody watching our television programs in the last week will have seen the astonishing and extremely frightening break-up of the Greenland icecap. Senator Milne is talking about massive glaciers, which were almost static just a few decades ago, now moving at two metres per hour. We know about the loss of glaciers around the world. In Glacier National Park in the United States 30 glaciers that were there just a century ago are now non-existent. They are rapidly melting in the Himalayas, in the Andes, in tropical West Papua and in Papua New Guinea. Right around the world this is happening. And now there are grave fears for the west Antarctic icecap. The sea level rises that Senator Milne is talking about, of four to six metres, as a result of the Greenland and west Antarctic icecap events, are again conservative measures. To bring this into focus, when you put the tip of a measure at four to six metres on the historic buildings of the Salamanca waterfront in Hobart, the tip is up at window level on the first floor. We have to face the reality of that prospect—
—So why is your office on the ground floor?
—Senator Bernardi—with a little bit of humour—asks why our offices are on the ground floor. They are not. It is a humorous interjection from an arch sceptic. But he should pay some attention to the reality and seriousness of this matter, because he is going to be here long enough to see worse coming down the line.
It is an extraordinarily serious burden of duty on every senator to consider this motion brought forward by Senator Milne this morning in the Senate. This inquiry should be set up. To oppose the inquiry is simply to say that we wish the parliament, the Senate and ipso facto the Australian community, including the business community, to be denied the information that will allow us to make the decisions to (a) mitigate, as best we can, the causes of climate change and (b) meet the massive disruption to our environment, our economy, employment prospects and the quotient of human happiness that is coming down the line from a climate change impact which the former Prime Minister of Britain, Tony Blair, pointed out could relegate the spectre of terrorism.
Senator Milne said earlier that the effects of climate change have been likened by the International Institute for Strategic Studies—which normally studies the nuclear threat around the world and has been a leader in looking at the nuclear threat around the world—to the catastrophic level of a nuclear war. The International Institute of Strategic Studies said the effects from climate change would cause a host of problems, including rising sea levels, forced migration, freak storms, droughts, floods, extinctions, wildfires, disease epidemics, crop failures and famines. Australia is right in the firing line. We are not an island unto ourselves. In fact, because we have a 12,000 kilometre coastline we are more vulnerable to this coastal impact than almost any other country on the planet.
And yet there is the frightening possibility for us here this morning—and we will know in a minute, when Senator Eggleston gets up to speak on behalf of the government—that the government will vote down an inquiry into the impact on Australia’s massive coastline, where the majority of Australians live and where all our big cities except this one are situated, and opt for no inquiry. I have no doubt we will hear that somebody has been asked to study this and some group has been asked to study that, but this Senate and its inquiry system has the primary responsibility on issues just like this for coordinating the state of knowledge and converting that into a call for action or study to the body politic. We will wait and see, but, if the government is going to say no to this inquiry, it will echo the failure of Prime Minister Howard in dealing with this enormous issue for Australia in the last weeks or months of his prime ministership.
Senator Wong said, ‘I’m getting a little tired of Green hyperbole on this matter.’ If only Senator Wong and the Labor Party had listened to the Greens over the last decade, we would be a long way further down the line. Senator O’Brien is shaking his head. Senator O’Brien is the shadow minister for forests in this country. He agrees with Prime Minister Howard that we should keep logging and burning the great carbon banks, the great natural forests, of Tasmania, Victoria and southern New South Wales. This is a completely irresponsible act of sabotage of the environment by the government and the Labor Party at this stage of the nation’s debate about climate change. How can you be knocking down these great wild forests, which hold carbon back out of the atmosphere, and then burn them? To be in Tasmania and see the Senator Kerry O’Brien outcome—huge columns of greenhouse gases—
—I would rather it go into power plants; but you do not like that!
—Senator O’Brien says he would prefer that the wood goes into power plants. He says the Greens do not like that—he has been listening to something! What an extraordinary thing! He is talking about Gunns pulp mill. They are creating a forest furnace—
—You are wasting your time.
—I see he is leaving the chamber. At least he is retreating! The retreating Senator O’Brien supports a Gunns pulp mill which will have a forest furnace attached to it, which will burn 500,000 tonnes of forest wood per annum, next to a pulp mill which at the outset is going to have 80 per cent of its resource stock of native forests. In other words, they are going to create a massive factory to burn the carbon banks or chemically break up the carbon banks now sitting there in the Tasmanian valleys and mountains holding back climate change and they are going to promote the transformation of those great saving forests into an added hit on the global climate change phenomenon.
The Rudd opposition have to come to grips with the destruction of Australian forests if they are going to be seen as responsible on climate change. This simply cannot be allowed to proceed. It is not good enough to support an APEC move to reforest or to prevent the destruction of 20 million hectares of forest outside Australia while promoting the destruction through that pulp mill of 200,000 hectares of native forest here in Australia. I would have thought an opposition would have very quickly taken up what the public knows to be true: that there is a need for us to protect these great living carbon banks in Australia in the age of climate change emergency that we are now in.
The second factor here is the burning of coal. We know that that is having the most prodigious impact on the global climate. Australia is the biggest coal-exporting country in the world. When I made a call earlier this year that in the next three years of government we should look at how we are going to reduce the impact on climate change of burning vast amounts of coal, some sectors of the press went into orbit about it and misrepresented what I said. We Greens say that we must move to energy efficiency and to renewable energy. It is not as if we are talking about an unreality here. If Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, in California, can set short-term goals—which the Greens, here in Australia, want to see in Australia—why can’t the Rudd opposition do that, let alone the Howard government? Why is it that these two great parties cannot meet the challenge of climate change?
I congratulate the Labor Party on supporting the Greens’ move for an inquiry to help give us the sensible information upon which this parliament can make better decisions, and I hope the government will, on this occasion, change its mind block on climate change—its obfuscation, as Senator Milne put it—of the last decade. We will test here this morning whether Mr Howard—now that he has confirmed his leadership of the government into the next election—is up to it. He can do that with a single act: by supporting this call for a Senate inquiry into the impact of climate change on Australia’s coasts, its cities, its concentrated areas of population and its magnificent environments. There can be no excuse that warrants saying no to this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,15,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2007-09-13,"—Nobody denies the reality of climate change, and we have said this many times before in debates here in this very chamber—I must say with the same players: Senator Brown, Senator Milne and Senator Wong. It is almost as though everybody is reading off a script and not listening to what the government has said and not paying any attention to what the government has done in respect of greenhouse, climate change and renewable energy.
We cannot deny climate change. In the south-west of Western Australia, where I come from, there has been a massive decrease in rainfall over the last 20-odd years. That is climate change, and it is very evident in Western Australia. Senator Brown has talked about the melting of Greenland’s icecaps. It is happening. it is real, and that is climate change. I have a brother who lives in Munich, in Germany. He loves skiing, but he could not ski very much last winter in Europe because there was not very much snow. And that is climate change. We hear of icebergs floating off Auckland, suggesting that the Antarctic icecap is melting. Well, that is climate change too. So it is there, it is real and it is all around us, but it has been going on for centuries. That is the other point that cannot be denied.
Europe was, once upon a time, a tropical area. There is evidence of tropical vegetation over most of southern Europe, and the Sahara was once fertile—so more evidence of long-term climate change. I heard a program on Radio National not so long ago about coral core samples being taken off the coast of Java which suggested that there has been cyclical climate change on earth for the last 10,000 or 20,000 years. Thus the issue of climate change is not new. We have to be fair and recognise that.
I looked up on the web causes of climate change—and I have said this in another speech as well—and the listed causes of climate change include continental drift, volcanic eruptions and changes in the orbit of the earth. The earth sometimes just slightly changes its axis and inevitably that brings climate change, because the seasons are related to the position of various parts of the world on the globe—therefore, if the axis of the globe changes, then obviously there will be climate change. Most importantly, there seems to be a correlation between climate change and episodes of sunspots. That has been going on for thousands and thousands of years.
More recently: there have been increases in world’s greenhouse gases since the 1700s and the industrial revolution. It is true that there have been increases in the levels of CO2 and methane in our atmosphere and that those emission levels have accelerated, particularly in this century. In the opinion of many people greenhouse gases do contribute to climate change, but they are not the whole story. There are other things to consider, such as changes in the earth’s orbit and sunspot activity. I do not think the Greens or the ALP can rationally deny that those are factors in climate change.
Another thing that is very evident, and totally and absolutely undeniable, is the fact that, since it first came into office in 1996, the Howard government has been very proactive about dealing with greenhouse issues and with recognising the need for us to change from the use of fossil fuels and move to other energy sources. In fact, the Howard government has a very proud record of having set up the world’s first government greenhouse office, back in 1996. That is undeniable. I think this is about the fifth speech I have given on this subject where Senator Wong has participated in the debate and where she comes in here and criticises and lambastes the Howard government for its failure to do anything about greenhouse, when she knows—it is a simple fact—that this government established the world’s first greenhouse office when it first came into office 11 years ago.
As part of the government’s comprehensive climate change strategy, the government has committed some $2 billion to the management of environmental issues. That commitment of $2 billion has leveraged something like $6.5 billion from private sector sources for environmental programs. The government’s climate change strategy—which, as I said, has involved a commitment of over $2 billion—has recognised our reliance on fossil fuels at the moment and our need to change to renewable and other energy sources. The government’s strategy provides a pathway for moving Australia’s energy sector to a low-emissions future. That is something undeniable. It is a simple reality of this government’s history in office. It shows that the comments that Senator Wong, in particular, keeps making are totally wrong. She knows they are wrong. She comes into the Senate repeating her allegations about the government not doing anything about greenhouse emissions when in fact we have a long history of having been very concerned about it.
Our policies have included the $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, the $100 million Renewable Energy Development Initiative, the $75 million Solar Cities trial, the $20 million advanced electricity storage technology initiative and the $14 million wind energy forecasting program. The government has explored lots of areas or sources of energy which are not going to emit greenhouse gases. That is something that Senator Wong, the Greens and perhaps the Democrats—who may claim otherwise—simply cannot deny. The runs are on the board. This government has been very conscientious and concerned about climate change during its whole period of office.
People like talking about Kyoto—and I am surprised it has not got a run so far. But I guess it will; there is still time.
—Toyoto? Did you say ‘toyoto’?
—Kyoto. I went to a private school, so I have a different sort of accent—but there we are. I am just surprised that it has not had a run and the fact that Australia has not signed the Kyoto treaty has not been mentioned. Kyoto is really just symbolic. It is symbolic of the world’s concern about climate change, and it really would do very little to reduce CO2 levels or alter climate change around the globe.
Although the ALP swears on a stack of bibles that it is an important treaty and should be signed, I note that Mark Butler, who Senator Kirk and anyone involved in the left wing of the ALP in South Australia might know—not that I believe that Senator Kirk is involved in the left wing—is on record as saying that Kyoto is nothing more than symbolic. So much for Senator Wong’s point of view! The government strategy on climate change was endorsed by APEC only a week or so ago when some of the world’s greatest emitters—the Chinese government and the United States government—agreed to work towards setting achievable greenhouse gas emissions targets. So there is no question that this government does not have a great record. It is simply nonsense for the opposition parties to keep coming back in here alleging that this government has a poor record on climate change.
I will now turn to the specific issue of the rise in sea levels. Senator Milne said that the government was not listening, that there was a studied ignorance of what is going on, and that this government seemed to be totally indifferent to the implications of rising sea levels. May I assure the Senate, and Senator Milne in particular, that the government is aware of recent research and reports on rising sea levels and of the risks that such sea level rises could pose to coastal properties and infrastructure around Australia. We have a lot of very low-level communities close to oceans—only a metre or so above sea level. I came from Busselton, down in the south-west of Western Australia. The whole of Geographe Bay is really just a metre or two above sea level. Very large areas of places like Dunsborough, which is a very popular holiday resort down in the south-west, and Quindalup are only a metre or two above sea level.
So sea level change is a very important consideration for Australia. In every part of this country, in a similar way, there are towns, ports and roads which could be affected by rising sea level. Anybody coming in here and alleging that the federal government is not concerned about the implications of that, knowing full well that that there is already a government agency at work looking into the implications of rising sea level change, is, at one end of the scale, being quite unfair to the government and, at the other end of the scale, perhaps being deliberately misleading to those assessing the comments.
Australian scientists are world leaders in research into the area of sea level rise, and the government is supporting research into the causes of sea level rise which has occurred over the last century. We are also supporting research into the contribution of melting ice sheets to future sea level rise around the globe. Accordingly, we do not think there is a need for an inquiry by a Senate committee into the risks associated with sea level rise in Australia, because assessment of these risks is already underway by an agency sponsored by the Australian government. The Australian government is leading work to assess the vulnerability of the coastal zone to climate change through the Natural Resources Management Ministerial Council. This council, which has been set up under the jurisdiction of not only the Commonwealth but also, perhaps, other bodies, is charged with the assessment of coastal vulnerability to sea level rise, and it is due to report in 2002.
The terms of reference include analysis of the risks from erosion in the coastal zone exacerbated as a result of climate change. Erosion of course is very important because it changes the ecology. The second reference is analysis of the risks to infrastructure and coastal ecosystems from climate change. The third includes assessment of the changing vulnerability of the coastal zone as a result of changing demographic and other socioeconomic trends. Those two points cover Senator Milne’s concerns about local government, because obviously if towns are going to be flooded that involves socioeconomic and demographic change. We also have to think about infrastructure like ports, which is a very important point. There are a lot of ports that would be very adversely affected by a three- or four-metre rise in sea level, let alone a six- or 10-metre rise, and there are roads which run along seafronts, and parks. In many places, such as in Kwinana in Western Australia, there are large industrial plants right on the seafront. The impact of sea level rise on facilities such as all of those needs to be given careful consideration and, under this program, the Australian government is undertaking research into the impact of sea level change on those sorts of facilities. The last point of reference is development of information and other tools for managers and planners of the coastal zone to better incorporate the risks of climate change in decision making. In other words, having assessed what the impact will be on infrastructure, on towns and on the ecology of the area, they will provide the basis for decision makers to make decisions about dealing with the prospect of sea level rise.
Senator Milne referred to the fact that we did not have adequate maps and tools available to work out what the impact of sea level rise would be. But the government does recognise the need for better tools and maps to enable more adequate assessment of risks from climate change and sea level rise. To accompany and support the national coastal vulnerability assessment, the Spatial Information Council, ANZLIC, is developing for the first time a national digital elevation model, a three-dimensional picture of the earth’s surface, which will enable modelling of inundation at a resolution that will be useful for decision makers to work upon. In other words, computer modelling is being developed based on data from around the world on what the impact of sea level rise will be.
All of this work will be supported by the new Australian Centre for Climate Change Adaptation, announced by the Prime Minister in April this year, which has a budget of $126 million over five years. That is quite a lot of money and should enable a good job to be done. This centre will be working with the new CSIRO adaptation flagship to improve the science underpinning adaptation, provide better information on climate change to decision makers and support the development of targeted adaptation strategies, including those for the coastal zone as a result of climate change and sea level rise.
So, with all of that being done, the government’s view is that there is no need for a Senate inquiry at this point of time, because, to some degree, it will only duplicate the work of this centre for climate change and in fact may not do the work as thoroughly or as comprehensively as the centre which the government has set up. All it will really do is call attention to the fact that sea level rise is a risk, a potential adverse outcome of climate change. I think there has been plenty of evidence here in the Senate today that all political parties are aware that sea level rise is a risk. Therefore, on that ground, I do not think there is anything to be gained by setting up a Senate committee and advise the Senate that the government will be opposing this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,15,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-13,"—The Democrats support this proposal for a Senate inquiry into this particular component of serious climate change regarding the rise in sea level. It should be noted at the start that it is no particular secret that there is a federal election very much in the air. It is quite probable, in my view, that next week will be the final sitting week of the parliament before the election is announced, although that is not a certainty.
The motion before us has a reporting date of 3 December, which could be two days after a 1 December election or a few days before an 8 December election—to go as late as is practically possible. In my view, that is not a sufficient reason not to support an inquiry. As senators probably know, but for those who do not, an inquiry can be initiated to start and, whilst it might be suspended or prorogued during an election campaign, it is quite possible to then pick up and continue to run with it after the election. Of course, the composition of the current Senate will stay the same until 30 June next, so in some respects you could argue that the reporting date is probably a bit short for this inquiry. In any case, the initial part of the inquiry of seeking public submissions and input could well be done and, indeed, could continue whilst the rest of us are off doing our campaigning. So I do not think the election should be seen as a reason not to go ahead with this.
If there is one issue this Senate needs to grapple with and really pressure the next government on, whether it is a Liberal or a Labor government, then it has to be climate change. I could list a few other issues, but climate change has to be right up there at the top of the pile. It is an area in which the current government has failed dismally. The current opposition has shown some signs belatedly of treating the issue with some greater degree of seriousness. But, frankly, both alternative governing parties still have a long way to go to be really grappling with the finer detail on the specifics.
Because we have had such an era of wasted opportunity, of culpable negligence, from the current government the time frame is short. The need to pull together comprehensive, wide-ranging action in a vast array of areas is much more urgent. It is unfortunate that significant, complex and comprehensive measures will be needed to be pulled together in quite a short space of time. But, unfortunately, because of the neglect of the issue for 20 years, that is the situation we are in: we cannot afford the luxury of more drawn out, considered assessments about how best to go about this. It is urgent and that is a reason why this inquiry is appropriate at this point in time, despite the pending election. We can get on with the job now by starting to pull that information together and build on that momentum in the new parliament.
That is not to say that the inquiry before us deals with every single aspect of what needs to be done about climate change. Indeed, to some extent this particular proposed inquiry to do with the risks associated with the rise in sea level in Australia is in part looking at dealing with the consequences of climate change that is likely to happen and, in some cases, is already happening. The separate issue of how to reduce the risks of climate change, the extent of it and the impact of it is something that we also need to be working on.
Frankly, whoever are in government, I do not think that is a task where the rest of us can just sit back and hope they get it right. We all need to be working on it together across the political spectrum and across all parts of the community as cooperatively as possible. It is worth noting that one of the benefits of Senate committees in the vast majority of cases—but not in all—is that once they get underway most of the time people from across the political spectrum will seek to work together to develop a range of solutions.
I should take the opportunity to point out that it was the Democrats that initiated the first comprehensive Senate committee inquiry into issues relating to climate change. We did that back in 1988, I think. The report, tabled in 1991, was called Rescue the future: reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect. It was a unanimous report. It is a real tragedy that, despite the urgings and concerns of the Democrats and the recognition of the need for action, the recommendations for action that were put forward by people across the parties in 1991 were not meaningfully and genuinely picked up by the then Labor government. It is just one of the earlier examples of a terribly long list of missed opportunities.
There was a further comprehensive inquiry by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee—again initiated by the Democrats, in the parliament before this one. It produced a report called The heat is on: Australia’s greenhouse future. From memory, I do not think that report was unanimous but it certainly still produced a comprehensive range of recommendations. That inquiry was not just initiated but also chaired by the Democrats, and its recommendations received support from the majority of senators on that committee. Again, that was a missed opportunity on the part of the government in failing to respond to those recommendations.
There are many other examples, such as the missed opportunity of the government by failing to fulfil its promise to look at inserting a greenhouse treaty in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act back in 1999. The then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill, backed down and totally acquiesced to the resource lobby within cabinet and the government, totally pushing aside any direct mechanism in our federal environment laws for assessing greenhouse impacts in particular proposals—despite his concrete pledge to do so to this very Senate in this very chamber. So there have been a range of missed opportunities on the part of the current government, and it must bear enormous responsibility for that.
It must be said in passing that, despite the overnight emergence of Mr Costello as the Prime Minister in waiting who is suddenly going to reinvigorate us with a new vision and a new agenda that he has not yet articulated, he has been absolutely in lock-step with every single component of this government’s actions, including Iraq, Work Choices and its absolute failure to take any action or responsibility for the housing affordability crisis, and Mr Costello has also been up-front and centre in the government’s strategy of refusing to act on climate change. He not only refused to act but actually set about actively and deliberately sabotaging efforts in the global arena to get action with regard to climate change.
There has been no indication at any single step along the way that Mr Costello has been anything other than an enthusiastic advocate of that policy of culpable negligence on the part of the federal government with climate change. As far as I am aware, the words ‘climate change’ have not escaped Mr Costello’s lips since he started talking again in the last 12 hours or so. As we all know, it took until this year for him to even mention the words ‘climate change’ in any of his 10 or 11 budget speeches, so forgive me if I do not have a great deal of confidence that we will see any major leap forward. I do not see any sign that Mr Costello has exercised a single synapse on this issue in all the time he has been Treasurer.
That is all the more reason why collectively we need to work on this to overcome the intellectual and political shortcomings of some in positions of influence within the government. There is no doubt that there is a wide range of expertise and ability, including from among many in the coalition who would contribute enormously by being able to engage with this debate rather than leaving it up to a few that have shown they do not have the capacity or an interest in the issue.
The other point I would like to make in speaking to this motion is about the issue of sea level rises. It is a serious problem. It is already happening and there is evidence with regard to some Pacific island nations and parts of Papua New Guinea of the damage that has already been done. It is important to emphasise that sea level rises do not just mean people finding the tide creeping up bit by bit and eventually lapping around their doorstep and around their ankles in a nice, gentle, slow rise. The real danger is not so much that, although that over time is obviously not a good thing, but the greater vulnerability of communities close to the coast to extreme weather events and to storm surges and the impact on rising water tables harming the viability of agricultural land and bringing up saline water into water sources that the people use for drinking water or for watering crops, and there is also the damage to foundations of buildings and infrastructure as well. So it is a lot more than just homes or land being flooded or drowned over time. These things can come on quite quickly and it is devastating for many communities.
I should point out, as a Queensland senator, that it is already a serious concern for Australians living in the Torres Strait, for example. One of the Torres Strait Islands particularly has experienced a number of serious storm surges in recent times. One could argue about whether that is or is not directly related to climate change. To some extent it does not matter: they are experiencing it and have to deal with it. I do not think that there is any doubt that climate change is making the risks from such things as storm surges and the loss of potable water supplies more and more of an issue. The amount of arable land on some islands including those in the Torres Strait and the amount of available fresh water on some islands is a serious problem already, and it is likely to become more serious.
Those sorts of valuable issues would be useful to put to an inquiry like this. It is not just an intellectual exercise with a bunch of scientists giving some theories and different scenarios; it is an opportunity to actually hear from people directly. The point needs to be made as often as possible that these sorts of inquiries and debates are not just intellectual exercises. We are actually examining an issue and the consequence of its direct impact on human beings, on Australians and, in some cases, on some of the poorest people living in our immediate vicinity in the wider region around Australia. We need to be looking at what this means for people at community level as well as what it means for the natural environment with the risks it brings to biodiversity.
Again, as a Queenslander, I have to emphasise the grave concern about the impact on the Great Barrier Reef and the marine park more broadly. It might sound like sea level rises should not matter for a reef because it is under water anyway. But obviously sea level rises can impact on the viability of the reef in different areas, particularly when accompanied by changes such as extreme weather events and changes in the temperature of the water in particular. That can certainly happen with sea level rises and it can also happen with changes in currents. All of these things can impact significantly and rapidly on the reef. Of course, there have been changes in sea level rises over time in the past, and sometimes in the fairly recent past, but the real issue with climate change and sea level rises is the rapidity of the likely changes.
So this is about forward planning and trying to prevent or minimise damage. It is a serious issue, and for those who want to say that it is too close to the election it should be pointed out that it would have been helpful if the government had not blocked previous inquiries into these sorts of areas. Once again it appears we are trying to have an inquiry that the government is blocking. It should be pointed out in passing that this is now one of a very long list of substantive and substantial proposed inquiries the Senate has put forward where the government is using its numbers in this place to block that from happening. I am not saying that governments should support every single proposed inquiry that is put forward—although, having said that, I think that the growing habit of blocking inquiries even into legislation is setting a very dangerous precedent.
One thing that the government should recognise is that they are not going to be in government forever—they might not be in government for much longer at all, depending on what happens at the election. All of the precedents that they put in place now when it seems like a good idea while they have the power are ones that the next mob will look at and say: ‘That’s not too bad an idea at all, actually. We might do the same thing.’ If the coalition does not regain government, then clearly the Labor Party is not going to control the Senate after the next election. But it does nonetheless create a circumstance where the precedents have been set. There is no doubt that the number of Senate inquiry proposals that have been not passed by the Senate in the last couple of years is at a level unprecedented for decades, as a direct result of the government’s use and abuse of their Senate majority.
As I said, there is no obligation to support every proposed inquiry that is put up. The Democrats do not support every inquiry that is put up. It may be that we should be a bit more judicious with regard to the inquiries that we adopt, the workloads that committees bring on and those sorts of things. I am happy to indicate my interest and preparedness to in the future look at considering ways to make sure that any inquiries that are put forward are as effective as possible. But that is a long way from the approach that the government are taking, which is just blocking anything that is politically inconvenient. They have done it time and time again. There have been more blocked than agreed to. Over periods of time, we have had committees sitting there with no work before them at all. That might sound like a nice idea, particularly given that both chairs and deputy chairs get paid allowances these days for those positions, even when in some cases the committees have not had a lot of work to do.
I should emphasise, because it is almost forgotten in this place, that there was a convention which was around for quite a period of time that there would always be one or two—and often more—Senate select committees going. These committees would be put together specifically and solely for the purpose of examining a particular issue, which is different from how the standing general purpose committees that we have are put together. We have not had a select committee initiated in this chamber for a prolonged period of time. That also indicates the clear attitude of the government that they will let a few inquiries go forward if it is in their interest but they do not want to have focused, rigorous and independent examination of any issues. They do not want to divert any attention or any power away from themselves. That has degraded the role of the Senate quite significantly.
The problem with trashing conventions is that they become much harder to restore. We have had a high turnover of people in this chamber in recent times, and we will have some more at the next election. It does not take long before the corporate knowledge and corporate memory disappears and people will not realise that select committees, rather than being out of the ordinary, were very much part and parcel of the day-to-day work of this Senate. There were select committees stretching over the life of a number of parliaments, like the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Previous to that, there was the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. We had the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health, which was chaired by the Democrats. That produced an incredibly valuable, comprehensive and unanimous non-partisan report. That provided a catalyst for big advances in the area of mental health.
The government should not be afraid of Senate committee inquiries. They actually give them a hand. They help; they assist. They also assist the community in being able to have a say and in being able to access the resources and information that gets tabled and put on the public record through the process. It is not just about what suits the government. One day, perhaps, there will be a recognition that parliament and politics are not just about the immediate contest for political advantage for each of us but about trying to do what is best for the community and about trying to provide more avenues for their expertise to be engaged and used and for people to have a say. It is real tragedy that once again that opportunity is being denied by the government’s refusal to support this proposal.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,15,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-09-13,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate. I welcome the support of the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats for this reference for the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to investigate the implications of sea level rise in Australia as a result of climate change. It would have particularly looked at the recent science relating to projections of sea level rise; the ecological, social and economic impacts; adaptation and mitigation strategies; knowledge gaps in research; and options to communicate risks and vulnerabilities to the Australian community. It is appalling that the government is using its numbers to block a Senate inquiry into this absolutely vital issue.
We heard from Senator Eggleston that the reason that the government is opposing this is because there is a government agency at work looking into it. There are government agencies at work looking into lots of things. That is not a reason for the Senate not to investigate this. In fact, as James Hansen, the climate scientist, said—regarding the US, but it is equally applicable here—government science agencies have public affairs offices which are now staffed with political appointees and those political appointees have a big impact on what science gets reported and how it is reported. I am very disturbed about that. Public affairs officials should be helping scientists speak in a language that the public can understand; they should not be massaging the information. But that is exactly what has gone on after 11 years of this government. There has been suppression of information and massaging of information. Government agencies look into what governments tell them to look into and report accordingly. What we want is an inquiry without fear or favour.
Let us assume for a moment that the work that is currently being done by the Greenhouse Office and Geoscience Australia into coastal vulnerability in Australia is completely open-ended and reasonable. The point that I made earlier which Senator Eggleston failed to appreciate is that the assumption underlying the work that is currently being done is the IPCC projection. As I indicated, the IPCC has said that it expects sea level rise to be between 18 centimetres and 59 centimetres this century. That is the assumption that is being fed into all the work that is currently being done in Australia.
My point is that those assumptions are wrong or are very likely to be wrong. That is why I have said we need to look at the recent science relating to projections of sea level rise, because when the IPCC report came out the work of those scientists who are working particularly in the area of icecaps and the melting of glaciers, on Greenland and on the west Antarctic iceshelf, was not adequately included in that report. If you take on board what they are saying, that in addition to the thermal expansion of the oceans and storm surges you have to take into account that ice melt, then the predictions will be of a sea level rise of between 50 centimetres and 1.4 metres this century. If you extrapolate that out taking account of what Barrie Pittock has said, that for every metre of sea level rise the coast will retreat or go inland by 100 metres, we are talking about large parts of the world, Australia included, that are going to be significantly impacted by sea level rise.
Senator Eggleston, on behalf of the government, says: ‘It’s all under control. We’re looking into it. We’re going to have a map.’ Well, the Insurance Council has been asking for a map for a long time. Everybody wants a digital elevation map of Australia’s coastline. Everyone who buys a house should be able to go online and look at that digital elevation map and see where the property they are going to buy sits on that map so that they know about the vulnerability of that property to sea level rises, storm surges and flooding, whether the property is on an estuary or on the coast or on a river. We need to know that. Instead of that, we have a government agency looking into it, and by the end of 2008 it will only have the first cut of areas in Australia which have vulnerability to sea level rise. We will not have the digital elevation maps. We still do not have the maps of the result of the recent Newcastle and Hobart floods. We do not have the capacity at this stage to inform the community of what they need to know and of how to adapt.
It is interesting that Senator Eggleston talks about ports. In 1993 the Japanese did this very study of their own ports. Why has it has taken Australia until 2007 to start the first cut? What the Japanese found was that the costs of protecting port facilities and coastal structures in the Japanese coastal zones against a one-metre rise in sea level were massive: with a one-metre sea level rise, the total costs for protection were estimated at $US115 billion. That was in 1993. Japan then said, ‘Okay, what are we going to do?’ and then started looking at a process involving three strategies. They looked at whether they should go into adaptation and whether, as part of their adaptation strategy, they should go into managed retreat. They also looked at a range of engineering solutions, as I indicated before, such as building seawalls, changing facilities and so on. Other things are being done in other places in the world. In the Netherlands, for example, they are considering putting out to tender the building of a whole new coastline because they realise that their current strategies are not going to work. They are also moving people from low-lying areas and vulnerable floodplains to other areas. So they are virtually saying they are going to let some areas go because they recognise they can no longer protect them.
Those are the kinds of strategies that are already underway in other countries where this work was done more than a decade, even 15 years, ago. But in Australia we have sat here listening to a government say it is not happening. I am appalled to hear Senator Eggleston continue with the absolute climate sceptic behaviour that is so entrenched in the government, saying time and time again that he is still not persuaded that the current rate of global warming is human induced. He said, ‘There is a reasonable view that greenhouse gas emissions have a role in climate change.’ No. There is a scientific view held by the world’s leading scientists, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that says they are more than 90 per cent certain it is human induced global warming. That report came out on 2 February this year, and the government is still clinging to the nonsense and scepticism being put out through the Great Global Warming Swindle program, which obviously government members have all watched and decided to cling to. When is the government going to get beyond climate scepticism? When is it going to realise that not only is climate change real but it is urgent?
There is another point I want to make about the claim that there is ‘a government agency looking into it’. The IPCC has said that global emissions must peak by 2015. We are in 2007. That does not give us very much time. Talking about nuclear reactors that are 20 or 30 years away and about energy intensity reduction by 2030 is just pie in the sky. We have got less than a decade to take radical action here in Australia to significantly reduce our emissions and to assist our Pacific neighbours to do so as well. Next week we are going to have here in the parliament a delegation of people from the Carteret Islands, off Bougainville, in Papua New Guinea. I hope some of the government members are going to come and listen to those people, who will tell them that they are in danger of losing their land and their culture because their islands are disappearing under the sea. What are we going to do about that? We still have a government that says it will not accept a definition of environmental refugee. Why? Because Australia does not want to take people from the Pacific island nations or from Papua New Guinea or anywhere else when they are driven from their communities because of climate change. We are in danger of losing not only the places where those communities live but the cultures and languages that go with those communities. New Zealand has opened its arms to many of its Pacific island neighbours and has entered into some transition strategies in some of those communities, but not Australia. Is it any wonder those neighbouring countries are increasingly sceptical about Australia’s role in global geopolitics?
I return to the issue of sea level rise and Senator Eggleston’s view. He says that, yes, they have started the mapping. Show me the maps. I cannot go now—neither can the insurance industry nor any person in the community—and get an elevation map of the area I live in which tells me, if the IPCC is right and there is an 18- to 59-centimetre sea level rise in the next 100 years, what it means for my property. If they are wrong and the other scientists are correct and it is going to be more like a 1.4-metre rise, I cannot find out what that means for me, and that is a disgrace.
What the government is currently doing will not provide that information either, because it is based on the most conservative assumptions. That is why this Senate inquiry is important. We need to hear from scientists like Dr John Church who can come and tell us whether the assumptions behind the mapping, behind the assessments that are currently going on, are adequate. I do not believe those assumptions are adequate. In fact, as I said a while ago, Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, in his latest work, is making very serious warnings.
We know that the United Nations estimates that 150 million people live less than one metre above the high tide level and 250 million live within five metres of it. We are talking about massive global dislocation. Even with the most conservative measurements, we know that 700,000 people are already vulnerable to sea level rise in coastal communities around Australia right now. They do not even know it. That is why the final point of this reference to a Senate committee for inquiry is so important—because it is looking at options to communicate risks and vulnerability to the Australian community.
I thought it was very telling that Senator Eggleston said at the end of his speech that all such an inquiry will do will ‘draw attention to the risk and potential adverse impact’. We would not want people to know what risks they were facing, would we? We would not want to tell the people of Cairns that they are extremely vulnerable to cyclone induced sea level rise because of the changes to global temperature and because of the low-lying nature of the area around Cairns. We would not want to tell that to the people in south-east Queensland or south-west Western Australia, an area which Senator Eggleston acknowledged. There are areas right around Australia which today are extremely vulnerable to these risks. Also, people who live there probably have not checked their insurance policies to find that they are not covered for any damage as a result of storm surge and flooding, because insurance policies do not recognise the risks from the sea in many cases.
We are dealing with a crisis situation here, and we are told that we do not need to look into it because a government agency is looking into it. I would like to read some words from James Hansen. As I said, he is the father of climate change science globally. He is sending out a very strong warning to scientists around the world about their reticence to speak out. He is calling for plain communication with people so that they know how serious climate change is.
We know that neither the government nor the opposition is going to really level with Australians about the urgency of the risk, because if you have an urgent risk it means you have to take drastic action and take it quickly. Neither the government nor the opposition is prepared to do that. I say that because, again, we have heard from the Labor opposition that in government it will do an assessment of how much it costs to deal with climate change and will make decisions accordingly. At the same time it is saying that there will be ongoing coalmining, ongoing coal-fired power stations and ongoing logging of carbon sinks. So, again, my question to the Labor Party is: how are you going to meet emissions reduction targets if you are going to continue to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through the logging of forests and through coalmining and coal-fired power stations? Where are your wedges to get serious reductions? The Greens have said we need a 30 per cent reduction in 1990 levels by 2020. How is Labor going to get anywhere near that?
I would like to read to the Senate what James Hansen has said about the melting of the ice sheets. It is something which has not been taken into account yet, and it is horrific. You only have to see, as Senator Bob Brown said, the television pictures of those huge chunks, kilometres wide, coming off the glaciers of Greenland and west Antarctica to start realising how serious this issue is. James Hansen says:
Under [business as usual] forcing in the 21st century, sea level rise undoubtedly will be dominated by a third term ... ice sheet disintegration. This third term was small until the past few years, but it is has at least doubled in the past decade and is now close to 1 mm/year, based on gravity satellite measurements ... As a quantitative example, let us say that the ice sheet contribution is 1 cm for the decade 2005-2015 and that it doubles each decade until the West Antarctic ice sheet is largely depleted. That time constant yields sea level rise of the order of 5 m this century. Of course I can not prove that my choice of a 10 year doubling time for non-linear response is accurate, but I am confident that it provides a far better estimate than a linear response for the ice sheet component of sea level rise.
There is one of the world’s leading scientists saying that that is what is happening and that is the level of sea level rise we can expect. He goes on to talk about the legacy of scientists in this regard. He says:
The broader picture gives strong indication that ice sheets will, and are already beginning to, respond in a nonlinear fashion to global warming. There is enough information now, in my opinion, to make it a near certainty that IPCC [business as usual] climate forcing scenarios would lead to disastrous multi-meter sea level rise on the century time scale.
There is, in my opinion, a huge gap between what is understood about human-made global warming and its consequences, and what is known by the people who most need to know, the public and policy makers. IPCC is doing a commendable job, but we need something more. Given the reticence that IPCC necessarily exhibits, there need to be supplementary mechanisms. The onus, it seems to me, falls on us scientists as a community.
Important decisions are being made now and in the near future. An example is the large number of new efforts to make liquid fuels from coal, and a resurgence of plans for energy intensive “cooking” of tar-shale mountains to squeeze out liquid hydrocarbon fuels. These are just the sort of actions needed to preserve a [business as usual] greenhouse gas path indefinitely. We know enough about the carbon cycle to say that at least of the order of a quarter of the CO2 emitted in burning fossil fuels under a [business as usual] scenario will stay in the air “forever”, the latter defined practically as more than 500 years. Readily available conventional oil and gas are enough to take atmospheric CO2 to a level of the order of 450 ppm.
He goes on to say that he thinks that, unfortunately, that will be achieved. So the world’s leading scientists are now saying it is almost over. We are going to get to that critical limit of 450 parts per million. We are going to go over the two degrees and, once we go over, there is no going back, because of the self-fulfilling loops that we know about climate. He goes on to say:
In this circumstance it seems vital that we provide the best information we can about the threat to the great ice sheets posed by human-made climate change. This information, and necessary caveats, should be provided publicly, and in plain language.
He goes on to say that the National Academy of Sciences should report on that. He poses a question. He says:
Reticence is fine for the IPCC. And individual scientists can choose to stay within a comfort zone, not needing to worry that they say something that proves to be slightly wrong. But perhaps we should also consider our legacy from a broader perspective. Do we not know enough to say more?
And that is the opportunity I want to give scientists and the community through this Senate inquiry. I want them to be able to come and tell the Australian people exactly how much at risk this coastal community is and how vulnerable we are to climate change.
I think it is disgraceful that the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister in waiting do not want Australians to know and will not address climate change seriously. If you do not address climate change seriously, you have no future agenda. There is no more important future agenda than addressing climate change and the vulnerability of Australians, our Pacific neighbours and the world generally, and farmers, fishermen and community people will tell the government that at this election because people out there in the community know, as I do, just how critical this issue is.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Milne’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,15,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-09-13,"—I move:
That—
the Senate notes that:
the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that:
the sea level would rise by between 0.18 metres to 0.59 metres by the end of the century and that these projections do not include the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow because a basis in published literature was lacking,
there is medium confidence (that is a 50 per cent chance) that at least partial deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet, and possibly the West Antarctic ice sheet, would occur over a period of time, ranging from centuries to millennia for a global average temperature increase of 1° to 4°C (relative to 1990-2000), causing a contribution to a rise in sea level of 4 to 6 metres or more, and
many millions more people are projected to be flooded every year due to a sea level rise by 2080 and the numbers affected will be largest in the mega-deltas of Asia and Africa, while small islands are especially vulnerable,
recent scientific research, published too late for inclusion in the IPCC reports, suggests that the sea level is rising more quickly than previously thought and many eminent climate scientists, including Dr James Hansen, Head of Atmospheric Research for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, warn that a warming of 2o to 3oC could melt the ice sheets of West Antarctica and parts of Greenland, resulting in a sea level rise of 5 metres within a century,
assessing the impact of even a moderate rise in sea level in Australia remains inadequate for adaptation planning,
assessing the vulnerability of low coastal and estuarine regions requires not only mapping height above sea level but must take into account factors such as coastal morphology, susceptibility to long‑shore erosion, near shore bathymetry and storm surge frequency,
delaying analysis of the risk of the rise in sea level exacerbates the likelihood that such information may affect property values and investment through disclosure of increased hazards and possible reduced or more expensive insurance cover, and
an early response to the threat of rising sea levels may include avoiding investment in long-lived infrastructure in high risk areas; and
the following matter be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee for inquiry and report by 3 December 2007:
An assessment of the risks associated with the rise in sea level in Australia, including an appraisal of:
recent science relating to projections on the rise in sea level,
ecological, social and economic impacts for the full range of projections,
adaptation and mitigation strategies,
knowledge gaps and research needs, and
options to communicate risks and vulnerabilities to the Australian community.
I rise today to seek the support of the Senate in referring a matter relating to sea level rise in Australia for assessment by a Senate committee. The reason for this referral is that global warming is proceeding at a rate faster than anyone has anticipated. In fact, sea level rise is now proceeding 50 per cent faster than was predicted by the 2001 report of the IPCC. That is an extraordinarily frightening idea. I will repeat it: the most recent information reveals that sea levels are rising 50 per cent faster than levels predicted in that 2001 IPCC report.
In recent days we have had reports from many highly regarded scientific institutions telling us that the drought is going to be much worse because we are not going to get the rains that people had thought were coming. Overnight from the International Institute for Strategic Studies we have had a report saying that climate change could have global security implications on a par with nuclear war unless urgent action is taken. Yet yesterday we had the Prime Minister in waiting, the current Treasurer, Peter Costello, rushing out to tell us about his future agenda for Australia—and he did not mention climate change! It is completely unthinkable that anyone seeking a leadership position anywhere could not be considering climate change.
Unfortunately, we have got to a situation where a level of complacency has set in again. It is as if it is enough to say, ‘I now believe climate change is real and I’ll get around to doing something about it in the next 50 years.’ That is where we are up to at the moment—flexible targets for reducing energy intensity, not targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions overall. Since I got into the Senate I have been warning about the implications of sea level rise not only for Australia but for the whole world. But I have not gone as far as the International Institute for Strategic Studies. They say the global security implications of climate change are ‘on a par with nuclear war unless urgent action is taken’. They say global warming would hit crop yields and water availability everywhere, causing great human suffering and leading to regional strife. They say the effects would cause a host of problems, including rising sea levels, forced migration, freak storms, droughts, floods, extinctions, wildfires, disease epidemics and so on and so forth.
It is as if the discussion is now about whose target is the relevant one. But let us get back to the substance of the debate. We are talking about a catastrophe for humankind and the ecosystems on which we depend. We have to take action now. When I first moved this motion for a reference to examine the impact of sea level rise on coastal Australia it was defeated in this place by both the major parties. I hope that today I will at least be able to secure the support of the Labor opposition for this motion, because sea level rise and its impacts around Australia are likely to be dramatic. We are not just talking about sea level rise from thermal expansion of the oceans; we are talking about storm surges and we are talking about increased ice melt in the west Antarctic shelf and Greenland.
I would remind the Senate that scientists from around the world have just recently been telling us that the estimates of sea level rise are completely out of date. We know that the Greenland icecap is melting so quickly that pieces of ice several cubic kilometres in size are breaking off and triggering earthquakes. The chairman of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment says we have seen a massive acceleration of the speed with which these glaciers are moving into the sea. He was in Greenland looking at the problem of the melting icecap. He said the ice is moving at two metres an hour on a front five kilometres long and 1,500 metres deep. He said that means that this one glacier—at Ilulissat in Greenland—puts enough fresh water into the sea in one year to provide drinking water for a city the size of London for a year. The melt-water is pouring through to the bottom of the glacier, creating a lake 500 metres deep, which causes the glacier to float on land. He said these melt-water rivers are lubricating the glacier, like applying oil to a surface, and causing it to slide into the sea. It is causing a massive acceleration which could be catastrophic. And nobody is listening! I cannot believe the level of studied ignorance that is going on.
Since I first moved a very similar motion in the Senate some months ago, the government has moved to start the process of looking at sea level rise around Australia. I welcome that and I recognise that the Australian Greenhouse Office is coordinating some work with Geoscience Australia. They are looking at areas around Australia that are potentially vulnerable to sea level rise. By late next year they will have a first-pass national coastal vulnerability assessment. By the end of 2008 we are going to have the very first preliminary analysis of which areas of Australia are extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. Of course, we know from the Natural Hazards Research Centre at Macquarie University—just talking about the wider Sydney region, including the Central Coast and the South Coast—that there are almost 13,000 dwellings that are less than two metres above mean sea level and there are over 140,000 dwellings that are less than six metres above mean sea level. The reason that is significant is that, if the Greenland and west Antarctic icesheets go, we are talking about a five- to seven-metre sea level rise. But even a sea level rise of less than one metre would have huge ramifications for estuaries, for coastal Australia, and certainly for our Pacific island neighbours. Millions of people around the world are living in such vulnerable areas, so we have to do something.
When we have floods around Australia, as occurred recently in Tasmania, we see what happens when that is linked with strong and high seas, heavy rain and the highest tide we have seen in a long time. We get extensive flooding. We know that this is going to occur, yet there is no planning for it. Local government around Australia has been extremely slow to change local government planning schemes to accommodate sea level rise and the implications of coastal vulnerability. We still get local government giving planning permission for people to build right on the coast in areas that are vulnerable to flooding. Who is going to pick up the bill? The insurance industry has already said that it will not be responsible in the longer term for insuring properties that are built in areas that are known to be vulnerable to flooding. Is local government going to be sued by people who get planning permission and then have their places flooded? Who is going to compensate those properties and people? It is an issue that is certainly not going to go away. In fact, I would argue that the reason the government—and, in fact, state and local governments—have refused to look at the issue of vulnerability to sea level rise is that they are afraid that property prices on the coast will collapse and angry communities will start demanding answers as to who is going to compensate them if they cannot get insurance as a result of storm surges and flooding.
This is an extremely critical issue, and I can understand why property councils and local, state and federal governments are not interested in addressing it. But they have to get onto it. They have to do something about it. I am arguing that what the government has done by having this first-pass assessment of coastal vulnerability is not good enough and that is why this Senate inquiry is needed. It is not good enough because it is based on the assumptions that came out in the IPCC report earlier this year. Let me say at this point that I support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change processes absolutely, but I also recognise that they are extremely conservative in their estimates of sea level rise. That is because scientists are by nature conservative, and they have been under such scrutiny and criticism by governments, with the IPCC process also being a political process, that they have made predictions of sea level rise which are, in my view, the most conservative scenario. Several leading scientists have come out recently and said that. In fact, James Hansen, who is known as the father of climate change scientists, recently said that scientific reticence is inhibiting communications of a threat of potentially large sea level rises and that delay is dangerous because of a system inertia that could create a situation with future sea level changes out of our control. He is arguing for the calling together of a panel of scientific leaders to hear evidence and issue a prompt, plain-written report on current understanding of sea level change. He is saying that it is far more serious, that it is accelerating at a far greater rate, that the IPCC in 2001 got it wrong to the extent of 50 per cent—that is, there will be a 50 per cent greater sea level rise than they predicted. So if you go to the most recent report of the IPCC, which said that the sea level rise this century would be between 0.18 metres and 0.59 metres, and if you think that is 50 per cent wrong, then at the higher level you are talking about a 1.2-metre sea level rise. That is a more likely scenario, in my view, given the accelerated melt of the glaciers and what we know about sea level rise.
In August we had a visit to Australia of leading scientists from around the world. Professor Rahmstorf from Germany was here releasing a report saying the same thing, that the risks were not properly represented in the most recent IPCC report. At the time that report came out, Australia’s own Professor John Church said his research on the speed of the melt in the Antarctic and the extent of sea level rise had not been adequately taken into account by the IPCC. So let us assume that these scientists from all over the world are correct and that the IPCC’s report is the most conservative. It is then not good enough for the government to have set up a first pass over Australia’s coastline for a vulnerability analysis that is based on the IPCC’s figures. We should assume that is the absolute baseline, but we should be expanding the capacity of that assessment. We need to look not only at the recent science relating to projections on the rise of sea level but also at the knowledge gaps and the research needs. I believe we should be looking at setting a range of assumptions for this vulnerability to sea level rise analysis that includes the work of these other scientists, such as Professor Church, James Hansen and others around the world, so we get a much broader analysis of sea level rise.
Of course, governments will not want to do that because that will mean a greater number of Australian coastal communities are going to be seen to be in the vulnerable category. But surely it is better for us to err on the side of saying, ‘We need to know what we estimate to be the worst-case scenario, and work back from that,’ rather than saying, ‘Let’s not scare the horses and let’s just look at the minimal impacts of sea level rise.’ We know what happens when you get it wrong. We saw what happened when they got it wrong in New Orleans: they had been told that those levees were inadequate but, no, they thought they were okay based on what they knew from the last 100 years—and the place was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. We know, for example, that with sea level rise and global temperature increases the storm belt around Australia will move south. We know that Brisbane is going to be vulnerable to cyclones. Where is the adequate planning in south-east Queensland for the devastation from events that will occur because of global warming? We have also had recent studies looking at the thermohaline conveyor, the ocean conveyor that controls temperature in so many parts of the planet, including in Europe, where it controls the climate and makes northern Europe liveable because of its modifying effect. We now know that that is slowing down.
All of these trends are indicating that the world is facing a major crisis. Yet in Australia the best we can do is have a Prime Minister who is a sceptic; a Prime Minister in waiting who cannot even remember that climate change is an issue when he sets out his agenda for the future; and a government in waiting, in the opposition, who say they acknowledge climate change but will not set a short-term target and keep supporting expansion of the coal industry and the logging of high-conservation-value forests, which are huge carbon sinks. The opposition say they have a target but they will not say how they are going to meet it because two of the ways of meeting it—coal and forests—are off their agenda in terms of any reduction of ongoing activity. Australians deserve better. Australians deserve some honesty from government and an opportunity to have input. That is why a public inquiry, like a Senate inquiry, is essential. We need the scientists to come forward and tell us what their views are about whether the IPCC’s predictions are adequate and whether the terms of reference for the vulnerability analysis that is currently being conducted are adequate or should be expanded to include this new science, which is so very frightening, about how fast the glaziers are melting, how fast the temperatures are rising and how dramatically that is impacting climate and ecosystems.
Overnight from Europe we have had the release of the IUCN red list of threatened species for 2007. Once again we are being told that species are being lost at a far greater rate than before. Once you lose species and ecosystems you lose ecosystem services, which provide clean water and clean air to communities. We have a planet on which there are millions of people vulnerable at this very moment to sea level rise. Our Pacific island neighbours are sitting there, begging for assistance to deal with adaptation to known sea level rise and with concerns about planning for the future.
We need to mitigate increased global temperatures. We need to underpin all our policies with a commitment to constraining a rise in global temperature to less than two degrees. We need to have an honest discussion with the Australian people about the latest science on sea level rise, the vulnerability of coastal communities and the adequacy of planning in those coastal communities. We need to recognise that in some places we will be able to adapt to climate change by a range of engineering solutions but in other places we will not. In many areas, like Kakadu, for example, we will see the loss of large parts of the ecosystem because of saltwater incursion.
There will be coastal communities around Australia which will be tagged, as they have been in Britain, for managed retreat. It is shocking for Australians to hear, I am sure, that the British government, having analysed sea level rise and vulnerability around the UK, have said, ‘We cannot save the entire coastline of the UK. So there will be communities which we must assist in managed retreat.’ They now have a series of strategies to do that.
Australia is not even at first base. We cannot produce a map today that tells us what are the likely implications of sea level rise for vulnerable coastal communities. That is a disgrace when we know the science of climate change. So I urge the Senate and the ‘Prime Minister in waiting’ to get realistic about climate change, to stop obfuscating, to recognise that we are facing the greatest crisis that we have known in our lifetime. This is a much bigger issue than terrorism. Climate change and the earth’s vulnerability are in our face right now. We, as elected leaders, must respond to that. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-09-13,"—I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Milne. I indicate that the opposition will be supporting this motion. I came in for the conclusion of Senator Milne’s speech. I may have misheard her, but I think she was being critical of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, as not being realistic about climate change. I have to say that that is yet another extraordinary example of Green hyperbole in this chamber, which I am getting a little tired of, given that the federal Labor Party has made its position in relation to climate change very clear. We have said for some time that this is a critical issue. I challenge people on the crossbenches to find a time in Australia’s history where there has been a leader of one of the major political parties, one of the parties capable of government, who has made an environmental issue such as this such a central political issue in their agenda for the future.
Labor absolutely understands the reality of climate change. We recognise that this is one of the key challenges facing Australia. This is one of the critical issues a government must face and must tackle. Unlike the Howard government, we accept the science. We say the science is in. We are not, unlike the government, in the game of pretending that this does not exist. What we see on the other side is Mr Howard belatedly recognising that climate change is a political issue, belatedly recognising that he has to be seen to be responding and putting forward a whole range of pretend policies, aspirational target type policies through APEC and so forth, to look as if he is doing something about it.
We on the other side know that this is a government filled with people who deny the reality of climate change. That is not verballing them. All you have to do is listen to some of the speeches given by Senator Minchin, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Read some of what he has said, or read the recent article by Senator Cory Bernardi, from my own state of South Australia, who yet again put forward the view that the jury in the case for human activity having impacted on climate change is still out. I think the Australian electorate is tired of that debate. I think the Australian electorate is tired of politicians who, for ideological reasons, want to hide their heads in the sand and run away from one of the critical, central challenges that this country faces, that the globe faces and that humanity faces.
We on this side of the chamber understand how important this issue is. We recognise that it is important not just in environmental terms but in economic and social terms. This is one of the issues that Senator Milne’s motion goes to. That is why Mr Rudd has made this a central aspect of Labor’s agenda for change, a central aspect of Labor’s plan for the future. We believe that any future government has to realistically and practically tackle climate change. We have put forward a range of policies to deal with that.
We saw the Leader of the Opposition hold a climate change summit which was instrumental in progressing the discussion about how to deal with this. We have said we would commission the equivalent of the Stern report, to be done by Professor Garnaut, to look at some of the economic impacts. This is the issue that the government seems to misunderstand. Senator Minchin, Senator Bernardi and Mr Macfarlane seem to think that this is some sort of fringe issue. They cannot get over their blind prejudices when it comes to this issue. The reality is that this is a central economic issue. This is a key economic issue, as well as a social and environmental one. You cannot assert that you are prudent and good economic managers if you are hiding or refusing to acknowledge the extent of the consequences of climate change on the Australian economy and the Australian community.
We on this side understand absolutely that climate change will have a dramatic impact on our nation and, in relation particularly to the sea level rise which was flagged in the IPCC fourth assessment report, obviously climate change will have a dramatic impact on Australia’s coastal communities. The federal government knows this. They may like to try to obfuscate and have various ministers and backbenchers write about it—and I see Senator Bernardi has come in. I acknowledge, Senator Bernardi, that I probably did not give you any warning that I was going to mention you in this debate, but I am glad that you are here to respond. Senator Bernardi, like Senator Minchin, is another one of those on that side who deny or are sceptical about the reality of climate change and whether human activity has in fact affected it. You are entitled to that view. I have to say I find it extraordinary given the weight of scientific agreement about this.
—Why didn’t you quote it in your rebuttal?
—Senator Bernardi, you can continue to come in here and run this hardline ideological position that is out of step with the Australian community and the South Australian community if you wish—that it is entirely your decision—but the reality is that Australians understand the reality of climate change. Those of us from South Australia are actually in the grip of an extraordinarily bad drought. Senator Bernardi knows that. People understand that we have had—and I cannot recall the statistics—something like nine of the driest years on record in the last 10. We understand the reality of climate change, unlike the government, who continues to deny it. It is quite extraordinary. It really demonstrates who the ideologues are in this chamber.
Who are the ideologues in this chamber? Are the ideologues the people who talk about choice, while putting forward radical and extreme industrial relations laws which make life harder for working people, or those who recognise that balance in the workplace is a good idea and having a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work is an Australian value? Who is the ideologue in the chamber who says that the science is still out in relation to human activity actually affecting climate change? Who are the ideologues? We know: they are Senator Bernardi, Senator Minchin and various others on the government benches who are still, in the face of all this scientific agreement, standing there saying, ‘Well, we’re not sure this is true.’
It is an extraordinary thing, isn’t it? It is like King Canute, but the other way around. It is saying, ‘No, we don’t believe this is really happening,’ as the evidence of climate change continues to grow, and it flies in the face of the government asserting that they are prudent economic managers. This is one of the largest economic challenges, if not the largest economic challenge, Australia will face in the years to come. This is one of the most central economic, social and environmental challenges this government or any government will face.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—It is interesting. Senator Bernardi keeps interjecting. I assume he will have some time to speak in the debate if he wishes, and the government can yet again get up and say, ‘Look, we are doing all these things.’ But do you know what? The Australian community understand you have not done anything. You have been in power for 11 years. You have been all over the shop when it comes to climate change and policies to tackle it. You were dragged kicking and screaming to an emissions trading regime which you only moved on, despite the fact that the industry minister ruled it out, because business and the community were ahead of you.
People understand the Howard government have only moved to look as if they are doing something about climate change because they are worried about the fact that they are out of touch with the community. You are only doing it because there is an election coming; you are not doing it because you believe in it. If you think the Australian people do not know that, go out and have a chat to them. They understand this is all about clever politics from the Howard government. It is not about actually believing this is an issue, because you have got form. You have been here for 11 years, and what have you done? You have dithered; you have denied; you have been sceptical; you have not acted. Now, before an election, when it becomes a major issue, all of a sudden the Senator Minchins put their heads down and everyone says, ‘Actually, we are going to do things,’ and what do you do? You say, ‘We have aspirational targets out of APEC,’ and you trumpet that as your big achievement.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—Senator Bernardi, you can keep interjecting, but I assume you are actually going to participate in this debate.
—No, I am not, actually.
—So he is not going to participate in this debate? He is happy to sit on the sidelines and have a go at me but he is not going to participate in the debate. How typical of the Howard government! You sit there knocking and saying, ‘This is not good,’ but what do you actually do? You have been in power for 11 long years. Where is the evidence that this government has ever seriously understood the enormity of the challenge that climate change represents to the Australian community, to the Australian environment and to the Australian economy? The government know about it because their 2005 report Climate change: risk and vulnerability suggests that as a result of climate change our country is likely to see an increase in annual average temperatures of between 0.4 and two degrees by 2030 and between one and six degrees by 2070.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, I do not mind people interjecting, but Senator Bernardi actually has not stopped interjecting for the last five minutes. If he wants to do that for the entirety of my speech, I am happy to continue to talk over him, but I would suggest that if he has something worthwhile to say—which is very unlikely in this debate—perhaps he could get up and give his own speech on it, because I would quite like to hear from Senator Bernardi, one of Senator Minchin’s acolytes, who does not believe that climate change has been impacted by human activity.
I would like to get him to stand up in the Senate and say that, because if it does not have anything to do with human activity, if human activity has not impacted on climate change, tell me what the Prime Minister was doing at APEC, Senator Bernardi. Why did he do that? If your thesis is correct and human activity has had nothing to do with global warming, which is the thesis of you and Senator Minchin, what was the Prime Minister doing? Because on that basis, the Prime Minister was just engaged in a huge PR exercise to deal with voters’ concerns.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—I welcome your interjection. You have the opportunity to speak in this debate subsequently, if you wish to, and you can explain exactly what the Prime Minister was doing at APEC, given that you do not believe that human activity actually has anything to do with climate change.
I will return now to the federal government’s own 2005 report, which I referred to earlier, which outlined some major threats to our marine environment and coastal communities. These include rising sea levels; more severe cyclones, storm surges and storms; possible reductions in average rainfall and run-off in southern and much of eastern Australia; rainfall increases across the tropical north; a reduction in rainfall in south-west Australia of a further 20 per cent—which is really quite chilling for those of us who live in South Australia—and a change in ocean currents affecting our coastal waters. These are amongst the consequences that the government’s own 2005 report, Climate change: risk and vulnerability, identified. Of course, we did not see action from the Howard government in response to that.
As Senator Milne’s motion outlines, one of the most significant consequences of global warming will be rising sea levels. The total observed sea level rise over the 20th century was in the order of 10 to 20 centimetres. Whilst there will be regional and local variations in that rise, there is clear scientific agreement—which Senator Bernardi obviously does not agree with—that sea levels are rising in response to past greenhouse gas emissions and that they will continue to rise during the 21st century.
The IPCC report published in February this year, about which there has been much discussion, projected a sea level rise of between 0.18 metres and 0.59 metres by 2100. Since that report was released, a number of reports have suggested that in fact that was an underestimation of the possible sea level rise as a result of melting glaciers and polar ice sheets. America’s leading climate change scientist, James Hansen, and five other leading scientists have suggested that sea level rises could be as much as several metres by the same date. As a consequence, it is generally accepted that the coastline will retreat horizontally 50 to 100 times the vertical sea level rise. Dr Barrie Pittock, a leading Australian climate change scientist, has stated:
There’s a crude rule of thumb which applies theoretically just to straight sandy beach, which suggests for every metre rise in sea level the coastline will retreat or go inland by 100m.
Similarly, Dr John Church of CSIRO argues that for every one centimetre of sea level rise you get about a metre of coastal erosion. The IPCC’s April report, Climate change 2007: impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, stated that, with regard to coastal impacts, coasts are projected to be exposed to increasing risks including coastal erosion; corals will be vulnerable to thermal stress; increases in sea surface temperature will lead to more frequent coral-bleaching events and widespread mortality; and, of course, there will be an effect on coastal wetlands such as salt marshes and mangroves—especially where they are constrained on the landward side. Any rise in sea levels will have an impact on coastal communities, which will face a significant challenge in the future. They already face one now as they prepare for the dramatic impacts of climate change. The fact is that the Commonwealth government must help them to meet this challenge.
The 2007 report of the Prime Minister’s Science, Innovation and Engineering Council, entitled Climate change in Australia: regional impacts and adaptation: managing the risk for Australia, nominated cities and coastal communities as one of the six key sectors at risk in the nation. Five priority coastal regions were identified for particular attention: the Brisbane-Gold Coast-Tweed Heads coastline, the Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong coastline, Melbourne-Geelong, and Adelaide and Perth. Continuing on the point I made at the outset, which is that climate change is an economic challenge as well as a social and an environmental one, one of the areas in which this has already started to occur is in relation to insurance costs. We know that insurers have to factor in the additional cost of various events which are predicted to increase as a result of climate change. I outlined some of these earlier: increased cyclones, storms and so forth. Obviously sea level rise is another one. This is one of the areas where we see that the Howard government lags behind not only community sentiment but also business sentiment. If you go and talk to many of Australia’s leading insurance companies, you will find that these companies have been pricing into their forward projections for some time the likelihood of increased weather disruption, severity of storms and so forth, as a result of climate change. My recollection is that Insurance Australia Group is one of the companies which were part of the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change. These are companies that recognise, as prudent corporate entities, that they have to manage the risk of climate change just as they manage any other business risk. It will have a financial impact, and that is why these companies want the government to do its part to set the framework to enable them to more effectively meet it. What we know is that insurers and other leading Australian companies have been factoring the cost of climate change into their business risk management plans. It is unfortunate that the government has not factored it in over 11 years and continues to simply engage in window dressing.
As I said, rising insurance costs and issues of compensation and appropriate zoning will need to be factored into Australia’s future coastal planning and management. Climate change pressures, particularly the threat of increases in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events, have led to reconsideration of existing actuarial assessments of extreme weather risks. A potential outcome of these impacts is an increase in the cost of insurance cover, higher excesses and even possibly withdrawal of coverage in some areas as insurance companies would not be able to provide insurance at a reasonable cost or at all. Mr Bruce Thomas of Swiss Re stated:
Houses built on the coast and rivers, in areas that have a larger than one-in-100-year flood events, would find insurance too prohibitive.
Frankly, what we have is a change in the earth’s weather patterns that is of extraordinary proportions over time. It is the largest and most significant economic, social and environmental challenge that any future government should face. What is regrettable is that the Howard government, after 11 long years, has done nothing to prepare Australia for this. What we have instead is a government that is stacked with climate change sceptics. This has impacted on its ability to reasonably respond. It has no plans for the future when it comes to climate change; what it has is a plan until the next election. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-09-13,"—Senator Milne’s motion points to the important and serious role that the Greens take, and have taken over the last decade and more, in trying to bring to the attention and the notice of government and this parliament the incredible impact that climate change is going to have on every Australian’s life over the coming centuries. The motion from Senator Milne is notable for its conservatism. It is a motion to have a Senate inquiry look at the impact of sea level rises on Australia—to gather from the scientific community, the planning community, the business community and from all Australians information about the impact that climate change, through sea level rises, is having and will have on every Australian.
It needs to be reiterated, if I may short-hand it, that Sir Nicholas Stern said in this city, in Canberra, earlier this year, that if we are not prepared to have a one per cent diversion of our wealth now to tackle climate change then the impact on our grandchildren may be a 20 per cent diversion of wealth. With that will come a massive disruption to the psychology of peace and happiness for this planet as it tangles with mass migrations and, potentially, civil conflicts and wars, huge impacts on business and on the general sense of wellbeing on the planet as the environmental catastrophe overtakes us in all areas of living on the planet. I congratulate the opposition, by the way, it having rejected Senator Milne’s earlier move for an inquiry three months ago, for now seeing the sense in our proceeding with an inquiry and agreeing with Senator Milne that this is the responsibility of the Senate, that this is the proper function of the Senate.
The question now comes onto the government. This is again a very big test of the Howard government’s commitment to using its numbers in the Senate with prudence and in the interests of all Australians. There is no way the government can use its numbers to prevent this inquiry and stick with that commitment. Yesterday the Prime Minister reasserted his authority in government. He said he is about to reveal goals for the future and he will see them through before handing the reins to his Prime Minister-in-waiting, Mr Costello. One of the challenges for Mr Howard is to throw off the inhibition, if not the scepticism, of the last decade and to not only make this nation prepared to deal with the reality of the impact of climate change but also put us back in the forefront of the world in legislating to minimise that impact, which is coming down the road on our children, our grandchildren and their offspring for many generations to come. This is a prime responsibility of us as parliamentarians. It is a responsibility that Prime Minister Howard has failed to meet and which now challenges him as Prime Minister of this country. If the direction from the Prime Minister’s office to this Senate, through the government, is to squash an inquiry to look into the fundamentals of the impact of climate change on Australia’s coastlines, it will be a clear statement by the Prime Minister that he is still unable to rise to the Australia of the 21st century, that he is still back in last century’s thinking.
As Senator Milne has pointed out, even the scientists have been too conservative on the matter. Anybody watching our television programs in the last week will have seen the astonishing and extremely frightening break-up of the Greenland icecap. Senator Milne is talking about massive glaciers, which were almost static just a few decades ago, now moving at two metres per hour. We know about the loss of glaciers around the world. In Glacier National Park in the United States 30 glaciers that were there just a century ago are now non-existent. They are rapidly melting in the Himalayas, in the Andes, in tropical West Papua and in Papua New Guinea. Right around the world this is happening. And now there are grave fears for the west Antarctic icecap. The sea level rises that Senator Milne is talking about, of four to six metres, as a result of the Greenland and west Antarctic icecap events, are again conservative measures. To bring this into focus, when you put the tip of a measure at four to six metres on the historic buildings of the Salamanca waterfront in Hobart, the tip is up at window level on the first floor. We have to face the reality of that prospect—
—So why is your office on the ground floor?
—Senator Bernardi—with a little bit of humour—asks why our offices are on the ground floor. They are not. It is a humorous interjection from an arch sceptic. But he should pay some attention to the reality and seriousness of this matter, because he is going to be here long enough to see worse coming down the line.
It is an extraordinarily serious burden of duty on every senator to consider this motion brought forward by Senator Milne this morning in the Senate. This inquiry should be set up. To oppose the inquiry is simply to say that we wish the parliament, the Senate and ipso facto the Australian community, including the business community, to be denied the information that will allow us to make the decisions to (a) mitigate, as best we can, the causes of climate change and (b) meet the massive disruption to our environment, our economy, employment prospects and the quotient of human happiness that is coming down the line from a climate change impact which the former Prime Minister of Britain, Tony Blair, pointed out could relegate the spectre of terrorism.
Senator Milne said earlier that the effects of climate change have been likened by the International Institute for Strategic Studies—which normally studies the nuclear threat around the world and has been a leader in looking at the nuclear threat around the world—to the catastrophic level of a nuclear war. The International Institute of Strategic Studies said the effects from climate change would cause a host of problems, including rising sea levels, forced migration, freak storms, droughts, floods, extinctions, wildfires, disease epidemics, crop failures and famines. Australia is right in the firing line. We are not an island unto ourselves. In fact, because we have a 12,000 kilometre coastline we are more vulnerable to this coastal impact than almost any other country on the planet.
And yet there is the frightening possibility for us here this morning—and we will know in a minute, when Senator Eggleston gets up to speak on behalf of the government—that the government will vote down an inquiry into the impact on Australia’s massive coastline, where the majority of Australians live and where all our big cities except this one are situated, and opt for no inquiry. I have no doubt we will hear that somebody has been asked to study this and some group has been asked to study that, but this Senate and its inquiry system has the primary responsibility on issues just like this for coordinating the state of knowledge and converting that into a call for action or study to the body politic. We will wait and see, but, if the government is going to say no to this inquiry, it will echo the failure of Prime Minister Howard in dealing with this enormous issue for Australia in the last weeks or months of his prime ministership.
Senator Wong said, ‘I’m getting a little tired of Green hyperbole on this matter.’ If only Senator Wong and the Labor Party had listened to the Greens over the last decade, we would be a long way further down the line. Senator O’Brien is shaking his head. Senator O’Brien is the shadow minister for forests in this country. He agrees with Prime Minister Howard that we should keep logging and burning the great carbon banks, the great natural forests, of Tasmania, Victoria and southern New South Wales. This is a completely irresponsible act of sabotage of the environment by the government and the Labor Party at this stage of the nation’s debate about climate change. How can you be knocking down these great wild forests, which hold carbon back out of the atmosphere, and then burn them? To be in Tasmania and see the Senator Kerry O’Brien outcome—huge columns of greenhouse gases—
—I would rather it go into power plants; but you do not like that!
—Senator O’Brien says he would prefer that the wood goes into power plants. He says the Greens do not like that—he has been listening to something! What an extraordinary thing! He is talking about Gunns pulp mill. They are creating a forest furnace—
—You are wasting your time.
—I see he is leaving the chamber. At least he is retreating! The retreating Senator O’Brien supports a Gunns pulp mill which will have a forest furnace attached to it, which will burn 500,000 tonnes of forest wood per annum, next to a pulp mill which at the outset is going to have 80 per cent of its resource stock of native forests. In other words, they are going to create a massive factory to burn the carbon banks or chemically break up the carbon banks now sitting there in the Tasmanian valleys and mountains holding back climate change and they are going to promote the transformation of those great saving forests into an added hit on the global climate change phenomenon.
The Rudd opposition have to come to grips with the destruction of Australian forests if they are going to be seen as responsible on climate change. This simply cannot be allowed to proceed. It is not good enough to support an APEC move to reforest or to prevent the destruction of 20 million hectares of forest outside Australia while promoting the destruction through that pulp mill of 200,000 hectares of native forest here in Australia. I would have thought an opposition would have very quickly taken up what the public knows to be true: that there is a need for us to protect these great living carbon banks in Australia in the age of climate change emergency that we are now in.
The second factor here is the burning of coal. We know that that is having the most prodigious impact on the global climate. Australia is the biggest coal-exporting country in the world. When I made a call earlier this year that in the next three years of government we should look at how we are going to reduce the impact on climate change of burning vast amounts of coal, some sectors of the press went into orbit about it and misrepresented what I said. We Greens say that we must move to energy efficiency and to renewable energy. It is not as if we are talking about an unreality here. If Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, in California, can set short-term goals—which the Greens, here in Australia, want to see in Australia—why can’t the Rudd opposition do that, let alone the Howard government? Why is it that these two great parties cannot meet the challenge of climate change?
I congratulate the Labor Party on supporting the Greens’ move for an inquiry to help give us the sensible information upon which this parliament can make better decisions, and I hope the government will, on this occasion, change its mind block on climate change—its obfuscation, as Senator Milne put it—of the last decade. We will test here this morning whether Mr Howard—now that he has confirmed his leadership of the government into the next election—is up to it. He can do that with a single act: by supporting this call for a Senate inquiry into the impact of climate change on Australia’s coasts, its cities, its concentrated areas of population and its magnificent environments. There can be no excuse that warrants saying no to this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2007-09-13,"—Nobody denies the reality of climate change, and we have said this many times before in debates here in this very chamber—I must say with the same players: Senator Brown, Senator Milne and Senator Wong. It is almost as though everybody is reading off a script and not listening to what the government has said and not paying any attention to what the government has done in respect of greenhouse, climate change and renewable energy.
We cannot deny climate change. In the south-west of Western Australia, where I come from, there has been a massive decrease in rainfall over the last 20-odd years. That is climate change, and it is very evident in Western Australia. Senator Brown has talked about the melting of Greenland’s icecaps. It is happening. it is real, and that is climate change. I have a brother who lives in Munich, in Germany. He loves skiing, but he could not ski very much last winter in Europe because there was not very much snow. And that is climate change. We hear of icebergs floating off Auckland, suggesting that the Antarctic icecap is melting. Well, that is climate change too. So it is there, it is real and it is all around us, but it has been going on for centuries. That is the other point that cannot be denied.
Europe was, once upon a time, a tropical area. There is evidence of tropical vegetation over most of southern Europe, and the Sahara was once fertile—so more evidence of long-term climate change. I heard a program on Radio National not so long ago about coral core samples being taken off the coast of Java which suggested that there has been cyclical climate change on earth for the last 10,000 or 20,000 years. Thus the issue of climate change is not new. We have to be fair and recognise that.
I looked up on the web causes of climate change—and I have said this in another speech as well—and the listed causes of climate change include continental drift, volcanic eruptions and changes in the orbit of the earth. The earth sometimes just slightly changes its axis and inevitably that brings climate change, because the seasons are related to the position of various parts of the world on the globe—therefore, if the axis of the globe changes, then obviously there will be climate change. Most importantly, there seems to be a correlation between climate change and episodes of sunspots. That has been going on for thousands and thousands of years.
More recently: there have been increases in world’s greenhouse gases since the 1700s and the industrial revolution. It is true that there have been increases in the levels of CO2 and methane in our atmosphere and that those emission levels have accelerated, particularly in this century. In the opinion of many people greenhouse gases do contribute to climate change, but they are not the whole story. There are other things to consider, such as changes in the earth’s orbit and sunspot activity. I do not think the Greens or the ALP can rationally deny that those are factors in climate change.
Another thing that is very evident, and totally and absolutely undeniable, is the fact that, since it first came into office in 1996, the Howard government has been very proactive about dealing with greenhouse issues and with recognising the need for us to change from the use of fossil fuels and move to other energy sources. In fact, the Howard government has a very proud record of having set up the world’s first government greenhouse office, back in 1996. That is undeniable. I think this is about the fifth speech I have given on this subject where Senator Wong has participated in the debate and where she comes in here and criticises and lambastes the Howard government for its failure to do anything about greenhouse, when she knows—it is a simple fact—that this government established the world’s first greenhouse office when it first came into office 11 years ago.
As part of the government’s comprehensive climate change strategy, the government has committed some $2 billion to the management of environmental issues. That commitment of $2 billion has leveraged something like $6.5 billion from private sector sources for environmental programs. The government’s climate change strategy—which, as I said, has involved a commitment of over $2 billion—has recognised our reliance on fossil fuels at the moment and our need to change to renewable and other energy sources. The government’s strategy provides a pathway for moving Australia’s energy sector to a low-emissions future. That is something undeniable. It is a simple reality of this government’s history in office. It shows that the comments that Senator Wong, in particular, keeps making are totally wrong. She knows they are wrong. She comes into the Senate repeating her allegations about the government not doing anything about greenhouse emissions when in fact we have a long history of having been very concerned about it.
Our policies have included the $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, the $100 million Renewable Energy Development Initiative, the $75 million Solar Cities trial, the $20 million advanced electricity storage technology initiative and the $14 million wind energy forecasting program. The government has explored lots of areas or sources of energy which are not going to emit greenhouse gases. That is something that Senator Wong, the Greens and perhaps the Democrats—who may claim otherwise—simply cannot deny. The runs are on the board. This government has been very conscientious and concerned about climate change during its whole period of office.
People like talking about Kyoto—and I am surprised it has not got a run so far. But I guess it will; there is still time.
—Toyoto? Did you say ‘toyoto’?
—Kyoto. I went to a private school, so I have a different sort of accent—but there we are. I am just surprised that it has not had a run and the fact that Australia has not signed the Kyoto treaty has not been mentioned. Kyoto is really just symbolic. It is symbolic of the world’s concern about climate change, and it really would do very little to reduce CO2 levels or alter climate change around the globe.
Although the ALP swears on a stack of bibles that it is an important treaty and should be signed, I note that Mark Butler, who Senator Kirk and anyone involved in the left wing of the ALP in South Australia might know—not that I believe that Senator Kirk is involved in the left wing—is on record as saying that Kyoto is nothing more than symbolic. So much for Senator Wong’s point of view! The government strategy on climate change was endorsed by APEC only a week or so ago when some of the world’s greatest emitters—the Chinese government and the United States government—agreed to work towards setting achievable greenhouse gas emissions targets. So there is no question that this government does not have a great record. It is simply nonsense for the opposition parties to keep coming back in here alleging that this government has a poor record on climate change.
I will now turn to the specific issue of the rise in sea levels. Senator Milne said that the government was not listening, that there was a studied ignorance of what is going on, and that this government seemed to be totally indifferent to the implications of rising sea levels. May I assure the Senate, and Senator Milne in particular, that the government is aware of recent research and reports on rising sea levels and of the risks that such sea level rises could pose to coastal properties and infrastructure around Australia. We have a lot of very low-level communities close to oceans—only a metre or so above sea level. I came from Busselton, down in the south-west of Western Australia. The whole of Geographe Bay is really just a metre or two above sea level. Very large areas of places like Dunsborough, which is a very popular holiday resort down in the south-west, and Quindalup are only a metre or two above sea level.
So sea level change is a very important consideration for Australia. In every part of this country, in a similar way, there are towns, ports and roads which could be affected by rising sea level. Anybody coming in here and alleging that the federal government is not concerned about the implications of that, knowing full well that that there is already a government agency at work looking into the implications of rising sea level change, is, at one end of the scale, being quite unfair to the government and, at the other end of the scale, perhaps being deliberately misleading to those assessing the comments.
Australian scientists are world leaders in research into the area of sea level rise, and the government is supporting research into the causes of sea level rise which has occurred over the last century. We are also supporting research into the contribution of melting ice sheets to future sea level rise around the globe. Accordingly, we do not think there is a need for an inquiry by a Senate committee into the risks associated with sea level rise in Australia, because assessment of these risks is already underway by an agency sponsored by the Australian government. The Australian government is leading work to assess the vulnerability of the coastal zone to climate change through the Natural Resources Management Ministerial Council. This council, which has been set up under the jurisdiction of not only the Commonwealth but also, perhaps, other bodies, is charged with the assessment of coastal vulnerability to sea level rise, and it is due to report in 2002.
The terms of reference include analysis of the risks from erosion in the coastal zone exacerbated as a result of climate change. Erosion of course is very important because it changes the ecology. The second reference is analysis of the risks to infrastructure and coastal ecosystems from climate change. The third includes assessment of the changing vulnerability of the coastal zone as a result of changing demographic and other socioeconomic trends. Those two points cover Senator Milne’s concerns about local government, because obviously if towns are going to be flooded that involves socioeconomic and demographic change. We also have to think about infrastructure like ports, which is a very important point. There are a lot of ports that would be very adversely affected by a three- or four-metre rise in sea level, let alone a six- or 10-metre rise, and there are roads which run along seafronts, and parks. In many places, such as in Kwinana in Western Australia, there are large industrial plants right on the seafront. The impact of sea level rise on facilities such as all of those needs to be given careful consideration and, under this program, the Australian government is undertaking research into the impact of sea level change on those sorts of facilities. The last point of reference is development of information and other tools for managers and planners of the coastal zone to better incorporate the risks of climate change in decision making. In other words, having assessed what the impact will be on infrastructure, on towns and on the ecology of the area, they will provide the basis for decision makers to make decisions about dealing with the prospect of sea level rise.
Senator Milne referred to the fact that we did not have adequate maps and tools available to work out what the impact of sea level rise would be. But the government does recognise the need for better tools and maps to enable more adequate assessment of risks from climate change and sea level rise. To accompany and support the national coastal vulnerability assessment, the Spatial Information Council, ANZLIC, is developing for the first time a national digital elevation model, a three-dimensional picture of the earth’s surface, which will enable modelling of inundation at a resolution that will be useful for decision makers to work upon. In other words, computer modelling is being developed based on data from around the world on what the impact of sea level rise will be.
All of this work will be supported by the new Australian Centre for Climate Change Adaptation, announced by the Prime Minister in April this year, which has a budget of $126 million over five years. That is quite a lot of money and should enable a good job to be done. This centre will be working with the new CSIRO adaptation flagship to improve the science underpinning adaptation, provide better information on climate change to decision makers and support the development of targeted adaptation strategies, including those for the coastal zone as a result of climate change and sea level rise.
So, with all of that being done, the government’s view is that there is no need for a Senate inquiry at this point of time, because, to some degree, it will only duplicate the work of this centre for climate change and in fact may not do the work as thoroughly or as comprehensively as the centre which the government has set up. All it will really do is call attention to the fact that sea level rise is a risk, a potential adverse outcome of climate change. I think there has been plenty of evidence here in the Senate today that all political parties are aware that sea level rise is a risk. Therefore, on that ground, I do not think there is anything to be gained by setting up a Senate committee and advise the Senate that the government will be opposing this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-13,"—The Democrats support this proposal for a Senate inquiry into this particular component of serious climate change regarding the rise in sea level. It should be noted at the start that it is no particular secret that there is a federal election very much in the air. It is quite probable, in my view, that next week will be the final sitting week of the parliament before the election is announced, although that is not a certainty.
The motion before us has a reporting date of 3 December, which could be two days after a 1 December election or a few days before an 8 December election—to go as late as is practically possible. In my view, that is not a sufficient reason not to support an inquiry. As senators probably know, but for those who do not, an inquiry can be initiated to start and, whilst it might be suspended or prorogued during an election campaign, it is quite possible to then pick up and continue to run with it after the election. Of course, the composition of the current Senate will stay the same until 30 June next, so in some respects you could argue that the reporting date is probably a bit short for this inquiry. In any case, the initial part of the inquiry of seeking public submissions and input could well be done and, indeed, could continue whilst the rest of us are off doing our campaigning. So I do not think the election should be seen as a reason not to go ahead with this.
If there is one issue this Senate needs to grapple with and really pressure the next government on, whether it is a Liberal or a Labor government, then it has to be climate change. I could list a few other issues, but climate change has to be right up there at the top of the pile. It is an area in which the current government has failed dismally. The current opposition has shown some signs belatedly of treating the issue with some greater degree of seriousness. But, frankly, both alternative governing parties still have a long way to go to be really grappling with the finer detail on the specifics.
Because we have had such an era of wasted opportunity, of culpable negligence, from the current government the time frame is short. The need to pull together comprehensive, wide-ranging action in a vast array of areas is much more urgent. It is unfortunate that significant, complex and comprehensive measures will be needed to be pulled together in quite a short space of time. But, unfortunately, because of the neglect of the issue for 20 years, that is the situation we are in: we cannot afford the luxury of more drawn out, considered assessments about how best to go about this. It is urgent and that is a reason why this inquiry is appropriate at this point in time, despite the pending election. We can get on with the job now by starting to pull that information together and build on that momentum in the new parliament.
That is not to say that the inquiry before us deals with every single aspect of what needs to be done about climate change. Indeed, to some extent this particular proposed inquiry to do with the risks associated with the rise in sea level in Australia is in part looking at dealing with the consequences of climate change that is likely to happen and, in some cases, is already happening. The separate issue of how to reduce the risks of climate change, the extent of it and the impact of it is something that we also need to be working on.
Frankly, whoever are in government, I do not think that is a task where the rest of us can just sit back and hope they get it right. We all need to be working on it together across the political spectrum and across all parts of the community as cooperatively as possible. It is worth noting that one of the benefits of Senate committees in the vast majority of cases—but not in all—is that once they get underway most of the time people from across the political spectrum will seek to work together to develop a range of solutions.
I should take the opportunity to point out that it was the Democrats that initiated the first comprehensive Senate committee inquiry into issues relating to climate change. We did that back in 1988, I think. The report, tabled in 1991, was called Rescue the future: reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect. It was a unanimous report. It is a real tragedy that, despite the urgings and concerns of the Democrats and the recognition of the need for action, the recommendations for action that were put forward by people across the parties in 1991 were not meaningfully and genuinely picked up by the then Labor government. It is just one of the earlier examples of a terribly long list of missed opportunities.
There was a further comprehensive inquiry by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee—again initiated by the Democrats, in the parliament before this one. It produced a report called The heat is on: Australia’s greenhouse future. From memory, I do not think that report was unanimous but it certainly still produced a comprehensive range of recommendations. That inquiry was not just initiated but also chaired by the Democrats, and its recommendations received support from the majority of senators on that committee. Again, that was a missed opportunity on the part of the government in failing to respond to those recommendations.
There are many other examples, such as the missed opportunity of the government by failing to fulfil its promise to look at inserting a greenhouse treaty in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act back in 1999. The then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill, backed down and totally acquiesced to the resource lobby within cabinet and the government, totally pushing aside any direct mechanism in our federal environment laws for assessing greenhouse impacts in particular proposals—despite his concrete pledge to do so to this very Senate in this very chamber. So there have been a range of missed opportunities on the part of the current government, and it must bear enormous responsibility for that.
It must be said in passing that, despite the overnight emergence of Mr Costello as the Prime Minister in waiting who is suddenly going to reinvigorate us with a new vision and a new agenda that he has not yet articulated, he has been absolutely in lock-step with every single component of this government’s actions, including Iraq, Work Choices and its absolute failure to take any action or responsibility for the housing affordability crisis, and Mr Costello has also been up-front and centre in the government’s strategy of refusing to act on climate change. He not only refused to act but actually set about actively and deliberately sabotaging efforts in the global arena to get action with regard to climate change.
There has been no indication at any single step along the way that Mr Costello has been anything other than an enthusiastic advocate of that policy of culpable negligence on the part of the federal government with climate change. As far as I am aware, the words ‘climate change’ have not escaped Mr Costello’s lips since he started talking again in the last 12 hours or so. As we all know, it took until this year for him to even mention the words ‘climate change’ in any of his 10 or 11 budget speeches, so forgive me if I do not have a great deal of confidence that we will see any major leap forward. I do not see any sign that Mr Costello has exercised a single synapse on this issue in all the time he has been Treasurer.
That is all the more reason why collectively we need to work on this to overcome the intellectual and political shortcomings of some in positions of influence within the government. There is no doubt that there is a wide range of expertise and ability, including from among many in the coalition who would contribute enormously by being able to engage with this debate rather than leaving it up to a few that have shown they do not have the capacity or an interest in the issue.
The other point I would like to make in speaking to this motion is about the issue of sea level rises. It is a serious problem. It is already happening and there is evidence with regard to some Pacific island nations and parts of Papua New Guinea of the damage that has already been done. It is important to emphasise that sea level rises do not just mean people finding the tide creeping up bit by bit and eventually lapping around their doorstep and around their ankles in a nice, gentle, slow rise. The real danger is not so much that, although that over time is obviously not a good thing, but the greater vulnerability of communities close to the coast to extreme weather events and to storm surges and the impact on rising water tables harming the viability of agricultural land and bringing up saline water into water sources that the people use for drinking water or for watering crops, and there is also the damage to foundations of buildings and infrastructure as well. So it is a lot more than just homes or land being flooded or drowned over time. These things can come on quite quickly and it is devastating for many communities.
I should point out, as a Queensland senator, that it is already a serious concern for Australians living in the Torres Strait, for example. One of the Torres Strait Islands particularly has experienced a number of serious storm surges in recent times. One could argue about whether that is or is not directly related to climate change. To some extent it does not matter: they are experiencing it and have to deal with it. I do not think that there is any doubt that climate change is making the risks from such things as storm surges and the loss of potable water supplies more and more of an issue. The amount of arable land on some islands including those in the Torres Strait and the amount of available fresh water on some islands is a serious problem already, and it is likely to become more serious.
Those sorts of valuable issues would be useful to put to an inquiry like this. It is not just an intellectual exercise with a bunch of scientists giving some theories and different scenarios; it is an opportunity to actually hear from people directly. The point needs to be made as often as possible that these sorts of inquiries and debates are not just intellectual exercises. We are actually examining an issue and the consequence of its direct impact on human beings, on Australians and, in some cases, on some of the poorest people living in our immediate vicinity in the wider region around Australia. We need to be looking at what this means for people at community level as well as what it means for the natural environment with the risks it brings to biodiversity.
Again, as a Queenslander, I have to emphasise the grave concern about the impact on the Great Barrier Reef and the marine park more broadly. It might sound like sea level rises should not matter for a reef because it is under water anyway. But obviously sea level rises can impact on the viability of the reef in different areas, particularly when accompanied by changes such as extreme weather events and changes in the temperature of the water in particular. That can certainly happen with sea level rises and it can also happen with changes in currents. All of these things can impact significantly and rapidly on the reef. Of course, there have been changes in sea level rises over time in the past, and sometimes in the fairly recent past, but the real issue with climate change and sea level rises is the rapidity of the likely changes.
So this is about forward planning and trying to prevent or minimise damage. It is a serious issue, and for those who want to say that it is too close to the election it should be pointed out that it would have been helpful if the government had not blocked previous inquiries into these sorts of areas. Once again it appears we are trying to have an inquiry that the government is blocking. It should be pointed out in passing that this is now one of a very long list of substantive and substantial proposed inquiries the Senate has put forward where the government is using its numbers in this place to block that from happening. I am not saying that governments should support every single proposed inquiry that is put forward—although, having said that, I think that the growing habit of blocking inquiries even into legislation is setting a very dangerous precedent.
One thing that the government should recognise is that they are not going to be in government forever—they might not be in government for much longer at all, depending on what happens at the election. All of the precedents that they put in place now when it seems like a good idea while they have the power are ones that the next mob will look at and say: ‘That’s not too bad an idea at all, actually. We might do the same thing.’ If the coalition does not regain government, then clearly the Labor Party is not going to control the Senate after the next election. But it does nonetheless create a circumstance where the precedents have been set. There is no doubt that the number of Senate inquiry proposals that have been not passed by the Senate in the last couple of years is at a level unprecedented for decades, as a direct result of the government’s use and abuse of their Senate majority.
As I said, there is no obligation to support every proposed inquiry that is put up. The Democrats do not support every inquiry that is put up. It may be that we should be a bit more judicious with regard to the inquiries that we adopt, the workloads that committees bring on and those sorts of things. I am happy to indicate my interest and preparedness to in the future look at considering ways to make sure that any inquiries that are put forward are as effective as possible. But that is a long way from the approach that the government are taking, which is just blocking anything that is politically inconvenient. They have done it time and time again. There have been more blocked than agreed to. Over periods of time, we have had committees sitting there with no work before them at all. That might sound like a nice idea, particularly given that both chairs and deputy chairs get paid allowances these days for those positions, even when in some cases the committees have not had a lot of work to do.
I should emphasise, because it is almost forgotten in this place, that there was a convention which was around for quite a period of time that there would always be one or two—and often more—Senate select committees going. These committees would be put together specifically and solely for the purpose of examining a particular issue, which is different from how the standing general purpose committees that we have are put together. We have not had a select committee initiated in this chamber for a prolonged period of time. That also indicates the clear attitude of the government that they will let a few inquiries go forward if it is in their interest but they do not want to have focused, rigorous and independent examination of any issues. They do not want to divert any attention or any power away from themselves. That has degraded the role of the Senate quite significantly.
The problem with trashing conventions is that they become much harder to restore. We have had a high turnover of people in this chamber in recent times, and we will have some more at the next election. It does not take long before the corporate knowledge and corporate memory disappears and people will not realise that select committees, rather than being out of the ordinary, were very much part and parcel of the day-to-day work of this Senate. There were select committees stretching over the life of a number of parliaments, like the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Previous to that, there was the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. We had the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health, which was chaired by the Democrats. That produced an incredibly valuable, comprehensive and unanimous non-partisan report. That provided a catalyst for big advances in the area of mental health.
The government should not be afraid of Senate committee inquiries. They actually give them a hand. They help; they assist. They also assist the community in being able to have a say and in being able to access the resources and information that gets tabled and put on the public record through the process. It is not just about what suits the government. One day, perhaps, there will be a recognition that parliament and politics are not just about the immediate contest for political advantage for each of us but about trying to do what is best for the community and about trying to provide more avenues for their expertise to be engaged and used and for people to have a say. It is real tragedy that once again that opportunity is being denied by the government’s refusal to support this proposal.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-09-13,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate. I welcome the support of the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats for this reference for the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to investigate the implications of sea level rise in Australia as a result of climate change. It would have particularly looked at the recent science relating to projections of sea level rise; the ecological, social and economic impacts; adaptation and mitigation strategies; knowledge gaps in research; and options to communicate risks and vulnerabilities to the Australian community. It is appalling that the government is using its numbers to block a Senate inquiry into this absolutely vital issue.
We heard from Senator Eggleston that the reason that the government is opposing this is because there is a government agency at work looking into it. There are government agencies at work looking into lots of things. That is not a reason for the Senate not to investigate this. In fact, as James Hansen, the climate scientist, said—regarding the US, but it is equally applicable here—government science agencies have public affairs offices which are now staffed with political appointees and those political appointees have a big impact on what science gets reported and how it is reported. I am very disturbed about that. Public affairs officials should be helping scientists speak in a language that the public can understand; they should not be massaging the information. But that is exactly what has gone on after 11 years of this government. There has been suppression of information and massaging of information. Government agencies look into what governments tell them to look into and report accordingly. What we want is an inquiry without fear or favour.
Let us assume for a moment that the work that is currently being done by the Greenhouse Office and Geoscience Australia into coastal vulnerability in Australia is completely open-ended and reasonable. The point that I made earlier which Senator Eggleston failed to appreciate is that the assumption underlying the work that is currently being done is the IPCC projection. As I indicated, the IPCC has said that it expects sea level rise to be between 18 centimetres and 59 centimetres this century. That is the assumption that is being fed into all the work that is currently being done in Australia.
My point is that those assumptions are wrong or are very likely to be wrong. That is why I have said we need to look at the recent science relating to projections of sea level rise, because when the IPCC report came out the work of those scientists who are working particularly in the area of icecaps and the melting of glaciers, on Greenland and on the west Antarctic iceshelf, was not adequately included in that report. If you take on board what they are saying, that in addition to the thermal expansion of the oceans and storm surges you have to take into account that ice melt, then the predictions will be of a sea level rise of between 50 centimetres and 1.4 metres this century. If you extrapolate that out taking account of what Barrie Pittock has said, that for every metre of sea level rise the coast will retreat or go inland by 100 metres, we are talking about large parts of the world, Australia included, that are going to be significantly impacted by sea level rise.
Senator Eggleston, on behalf of the government, says: ‘It’s all under control. We’re looking into it. We’re going to have a map.’ Well, the Insurance Council has been asking for a map for a long time. Everybody wants a digital elevation map of Australia’s coastline. Everyone who buys a house should be able to go online and look at that digital elevation map and see where the property they are going to buy sits on that map so that they know about the vulnerability of that property to sea level rises, storm surges and flooding, whether the property is on an estuary or on the coast or on a river. We need to know that. Instead of that, we have a government agency looking into it, and by the end of 2008 it will only have the first cut of areas in Australia which have vulnerability to sea level rise. We will not have the digital elevation maps. We still do not have the maps of the result of the recent Newcastle and Hobart floods. We do not have the capacity at this stage to inform the community of what they need to know and of how to adapt.
It is interesting that Senator Eggleston talks about ports. In 1993 the Japanese did this very study of their own ports. Why has it has taken Australia until 2007 to start the first cut? What the Japanese found was that the costs of protecting port facilities and coastal structures in the Japanese coastal zones against a one-metre rise in sea level were massive: with a one-metre sea level rise, the total costs for protection were estimated at $US115 billion. That was in 1993. Japan then said, ‘Okay, what are we going to do?’ and then started looking at a process involving three strategies. They looked at whether they should go into adaptation and whether, as part of their adaptation strategy, they should go into managed retreat. They also looked at a range of engineering solutions, as I indicated before, such as building seawalls, changing facilities and so on. Other things are being done in other places in the world. In the Netherlands, for example, they are considering putting out to tender the building of a whole new coastline because they realise that their current strategies are not going to work. They are also moving people from low-lying areas and vulnerable floodplains to other areas. So they are virtually saying they are going to let some areas go because they recognise they can no longer protect them.
Those are the kinds of strategies that are already underway in other countries where this work was done more than a decade, even 15 years, ago. But in Australia we have sat here listening to a government say it is not happening. I am appalled to hear Senator Eggleston continue with the absolute climate sceptic behaviour that is so entrenched in the government, saying time and time again that he is still not persuaded that the current rate of global warming is human induced. He said, ‘There is a reasonable view that greenhouse gas emissions have a role in climate change.’ No. There is a scientific view held by the world’s leading scientists, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that says they are more than 90 per cent certain it is human induced global warming. That report came out on 2 February this year, and the government is still clinging to the nonsense and scepticism being put out through the Great Global Warming Swindle program, which obviously government members have all watched and decided to cling to. When is the government going to get beyond climate scepticism? When is it going to realise that not only is climate change real but it is urgent?
There is another point I want to make about the claim that there is ‘a government agency looking into it’. The IPCC has said that global emissions must peak by 2015. We are in 2007. That does not give us very much time. Talking about nuclear reactors that are 20 or 30 years away and about energy intensity reduction by 2030 is just pie in the sky. We have got less than a decade to take radical action here in Australia to significantly reduce our emissions and to assist our Pacific neighbours to do so as well. Next week we are going to have here in the parliament a delegation of people from the Carteret Islands, off Bougainville, in Papua New Guinea. I hope some of the government members are going to come and listen to those people, who will tell them that they are in danger of losing their land and their culture because their islands are disappearing under the sea. What are we going to do about that? We still have a government that says it will not accept a definition of environmental refugee. Why? Because Australia does not want to take people from the Pacific island nations or from Papua New Guinea or anywhere else when they are driven from their communities because of climate change. We are in danger of losing not only the places where those communities live but the cultures and languages that go with those communities. New Zealand has opened its arms to many of its Pacific island neighbours and has entered into some transition strategies in some of those communities, but not Australia. Is it any wonder those neighbouring countries are increasingly sceptical about Australia’s role in global geopolitics?
I return to the issue of sea level rise and Senator Eggleston’s view. He says that, yes, they have started the mapping. Show me the maps. I cannot go now—neither can the insurance industry nor any person in the community—and get an elevation map of the area I live in which tells me, if the IPCC is right and there is an 18- to 59-centimetre sea level rise in the next 100 years, what it means for my property. If they are wrong and the other scientists are correct and it is going to be more like a 1.4-metre rise, I cannot find out what that means for me, and that is a disgrace.
What the government is currently doing will not provide that information either, because it is based on the most conservative assumptions. That is why this Senate inquiry is important. We need to hear from scientists like Dr John Church who can come and tell us whether the assumptions behind the mapping, behind the assessments that are currently going on, are adequate. I do not believe those assumptions are adequate. In fact, as I said a while ago, Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, in his latest work, is making very serious warnings.
We know that the United Nations estimates that 150 million people live less than one metre above the high tide level and 250 million live within five metres of it. We are talking about massive global dislocation. Even with the most conservative measurements, we know that 700,000 people are already vulnerable to sea level rise in coastal communities around Australia right now. They do not even know it. That is why the final point of this reference to a Senate committee for inquiry is so important—because it is looking at options to communicate risks and vulnerability to the Australian community.
I thought it was very telling that Senator Eggleston said at the end of his speech that all such an inquiry will do will ‘draw attention to the risk and potential adverse impact’. We would not want people to know what risks they were facing, would we? We would not want to tell the people of Cairns that they are extremely vulnerable to cyclone induced sea level rise because of the changes to global temperature and because of the low-lying nature of the area around Cairns. We would not want to tell that to the people in south-east Queensland or south-west Western Australia, an area which Senator Eggleston acknowledged. There are areas right around Australia which today are extremely vulnerable to these risks. Also, people who live there probably have not checked their insurance policies to find that they are not covered for any damage as a result of storm surge and flooding, because insurance policies do not recognise the risks from the sea in many cases.
We are dealing with a crisis situation here, and we are told that we do not need to look into it because a government agency is looking into it. I would like to read some words from James Hansen. As I said, he is the father of climate change science globally. He is sending out a very strong warning to scientists around the world about their reticence to speak out. He is calling for plain communication with people so that they know how serious climate change is.
We know that neither the government nor the opposition is going to really level with Australians about the urgency of the risk, because if you have an urgent risk it means you have to take drastic action and take it quickly. Neither the government nor the opposition is prepared to do that. I say that because, again, we have heard from the Labor opposition that in government it will do an assessment of how much it costs to deal with climate change and will make decisions accordingly. At the same time it is saying that there will be ongoing coalmining, ongoing coal-fired power stations and ongoing logging of carbon sinks. So, again, my question to the Labor Party is: how are you going to meet emissions reduction targets if you are going to continue to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through the logging of forests and through coalmining and coal-fired power stations? Where are your wedges to get serious reductions? The Greens have said we need a 30 per cent reduction in 1990 levels by 2020. How is Labor going to get anywhere near that?
I would like to read to the Senate what James Hansen has said about the melting of the ice sheets. It is something which has not been taken into account yet, and it is horrific. You only have to see, as Senator Bob Brown said, the television pictures of those huge chunks, kilometres wide, coming off the glaciers of Greenland and west Antarctica to start realising how serious this issue is. James Hansen says:
Under [business as usual] forcing in the 21st century, sea level rise undoubtedly will be dominated by a third term ... ice sheet disintegration. This third term was small until the past few years, but it is has at least doubled in the past decade and is now close to 1 mm/year, based on gravity satellite measurements ... As a quantitative example, let us say that the ice sheet contribution is 1 cm for the decade 2005-2015 and that it doubles each decade until the West Antarctic ice sheet is largely depleted. That time constant yields sea level rise of the order of 5 m this century. Of course I can not prove that my choice of a 10 year doubling time for non-linear response is accurate, but I am confident that it provides a far better estimate than a linear response for the ice sheet component of sea level rise.
There is one of the world’s leading scientists saying that that is what is happening and that is the level of sea level rise we can expect. He goes on to talk about the legacy of scientists in this regard. He says:
The broader picture gives strong indication that ice sheets will, and are already beginning to, respond in a nonlinear fashion to global warming. There is enough information now, in my opinion, to make it a near certainty that IPCC [business as usual] climate forcing scenarios would lead to disastrous multi-meter sea level rise on the century time scale.
There is, in my opinion, a huge gap between what is understood about human-made global warming and its consequences, and what is known by the people who most need to know, the public and policy makers. IPCC is doing a commendable job, but we need something more. Given the reticence that IPCC necessarily exhibits, there need to be supplementary mechanisms. The onus, it seems to me, falls on us scientists as a community.
Important decisions are being made now and in the near future. An example is the large number of new efforts to make liquid fuels from coal, and a resurgence of plans for energy intensive “cooking” of tar-shale mountains to squeeze out liquid hydrocarbon fuels. These are just the sort of actions needed to preserve a [business as usual] greenhouse gas path indefinitely. We know enough about the carbon cycle to say that at least of the order of a quarter of the CO2 emitted in burning fossil fuels under a [business as usual] scenario will stay in the air “forever”, the latter defined practically as more than 500 years. Readily available conventional oil and gas are enough to take atmospheric CO2 to a level of the order of 450 ppm.
He goes on to say that he thinks that, unfortunately, that will be achieved. So the world’s leading scientists are now saying it is almost over. We are going to get to that critical limit of 450 parts per million. We are going to go over the two degrees and, once we go over, there is no going back, because of the self-fulfilling loops that we know about climate. He goes on to say:
In this circumstance it seems vital that we provide the best information we can about the threat to the great ice sheets posed by human-made climate change. This information, and necessary caveats, should be provided publicly, and in plain language.
He goes on to say that the National Academy of Sciences should report on that. He poses a question. He says:
Reticence is fine for the IPCC. And individual scientists can choose to stay within a comfort zone, not needing to worry that they say something that proves to be slightly wrong. But perhaps we should also consider our legacy from a broader perspective. Do we not know enough to say more?
And that is the opportunity I want to give scientists and the community through this Senate inquiry. I want them to be able to come and tell the Australian people exactly how much at risk this coastal community is and how vulnerable we are to climate change.
I think it is disgraceful that the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister in waiting do not want Australians to know and will not address climate change seriously. If you do not address climate change seriously, you have no future agenda. There is no more important future agenda than addressing climate change and the vulnerability of Australians, our Pacific neighbours and the world generally, and farmers, fishermen and community people will tell the government that at this election because people out there in the community know, as I do, just how critical this issue is.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2007-09-13,"—I will conclude the remarks that I was making last evening in summing up the debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Democratic Plebiscites) Bill 2007. My remarks were in reference to some of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration’s recommendations in respect of this bill. The committee noted that in 2006 both houses of the Australian parliament passed a resolution recognising local government as an integral part of the governance of Australia. The committee also recommended that the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport conduct an inquiry into the social impacts and other impacts of the amalgamation processes at a suitable time after the council amalgamations are implemented. This, however, is a matter for the Senate. That said, the government notes that the structure and regulation of local government are the responsibility of the states and territories and that the states and territories are responsible for addressing the impacts of any amalgamations that they pursue.
Local government itself has the opportunity to draw any adverse impacts to the attention of the state and territory governments through its close relationships with the respective state local government associations. Local government is also represented through the Australian Local Government Association, the Local Government and Planning Ministers Council and the Council of Australian Governments, COAG. In addition, COAG has agreed to consider local government funding agreements in 2008 once the Productivity Commission has reported on the results of its study into local government revenue-raising capacity. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration carried out an extensive inquiry into local government and tabled its report Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible local government in November 2003. The government is still in the process of implementing the initiatives it agreed to in response to the committee’s recommendations. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-13,"—I do not know whether I can be as brief and erudite as Senator Mason in his contribution. I do want to go into the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Amendment Bill 2007 in some small detail but I will not be too long. The Democrats support this legislation. It is very straightforward and basic. But I do want to take the opportunity to speak on the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust in general and to note the Democrats’ role, and my role, in the initial implementation of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001 and to draw attention to the enormous success that it has turned out to be in the five or six years since it came into operation.
The legislation before us will extend the life of the trust. The original reality in the act as it stands was for the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to be a transitional body to manage Commonwealth land in and around the Sydney Harbour region, to work on rehabilitating those lands—former Defence Force lands predominantly—and maximise public access into those areas until 2011 when the land was to be transferred across to the New South Wales government for inclusion in their national parks and reserve system.
This legislation extends the life of the trust to 2032, for another 20 years or so, which is a pretty big expansion, and that is as a consequence of a recent agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments to transfer crown land at North Head in Sydney to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust until the year 2032. That basically means that the act needs to be amended to recognise that agreement and also to increase the time for which a minister’s written approval for a lease or a licence of trust land must be provided. Any of the lands under the trust’s management that they wish to put a lease upon has to have ministerial approval. There was previously a limit to the length of that lease of 10 years; it can now be up to the length of the life of the trust, or until 19 September 2033, to be precise. As I said, that is because, with the land at North Head of Sydney Harbour being transferred into Commonwealth jurisdiction, there was some uncertainty about who actually had title or oversight of it.
I want to emphasise the crucial role that the Senate played in setting up the trust in a way that has enabled it to work so successfully and, indeed, the crucial role the Democrats played—and, if I say so myself, the crucial role I played. When the proposal was originally put forward—and indeed when the legislation was originally put forward—following an election promise, from memory, by the Prime Minister, it was with regard to these former Defence Force lands around Sydney Harbour foreshore in, not surprisingly, some spectacular locations and some very significant historic locations as well. There was no protection originally against those lands being sold off once they were taken out of Defence Force control and put under the management of the trust. Potentially they could have been sold off down the track, particularly after they were handed back to the New South Wales government, which does not have a very good record in managing lands on the shores of Sydney Harbour. A lot of terrible developments have degraded badly both the environment and the public amenity along the Sydney Harbour foreshore.
The original legislation put forward by the government also did not provide adequate protection against some of the assets or lands that would come under the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust management from being leased for inappropriate activities. I am not saying that this was planned but examples floated around of high-class commercial hotels for high rollers being set up through leasing existing buildings or lands on some of these places. Many people would know North Head in Sydney Harbour and the old Quarantine Station around there. It is an absolutely spectacular location, as are some of the others. Cockatoo Island is a magnificent and extraordinary island in the middle of Sydney Harbour and there are other defence facilities such as Chowder Bay around near Middle Head and Georges Heights. These places have absolutely beautiful scenery and are very important historically as well in some respects.
There were not adequate protections against those sites being leased out. Indeed, it was almost going to be mandated, because part of what was required was a lot of expenditure to make some of these sites suitable for public access. With regard to Cockatoo Island, that meant decontaminating significant parts of it, which was very expensive. There was no guarantee of an adequate budget being provided to do that work to make the sites accessible to the public, to do the restoration work and to undertake some of the other activities that were needed on the sites, let alone to do the other activities of the trust—which, I might say, have also been part of the reason for their success, particularly their public consultation processes. The amendments that the Democrats were able to negotiate put in place guarantees against sell-offs, even when the sites were handed back to the New South Wales government. Indeed, as this explanatory memorandum notes, when the land is handed back it will now be required to be transferred into the national parks and reserves system of the New South Wales government. That protection was not there until the Democrats got involved.
We also managed to ensure that much greater protections against long-term commercial leases for inappropriate purposes were inserted into the legislation. That is why ministerial approval is required and there are time limits on the lengths of leases. It is also why we were able to get much greater community involvement, both in the actual management of the trust and in ongoing consultation mechanisms with stakeholders—local councils, local communities and those with relevant expertise and interest. It is a real tribute to the trust and to the federal government and the relevant minister that it has been able to operate in a way which has provided enormous success.
Until this legislation came along back in 2000 or somewhere around there, I was not aware of many of these places beyond North Head. The history and industrial heritage of Cockatoo Island are quite extraordinary. ‘Industrial heritage’ is not a phrase that people talk about too much. It does not imply nice scenery or even nice buildings, and some of the buildings are not overly pretty. But they are very significant in terms of the industrial development and history of the working harbour of Sydney Harbour. Indeed, it was not until after the legislation had been put in place that I discovered that my father had done a three-year traineeship working on Cockatoo Island when he was developing his skills as an engineer. There is some amazing history there, and not just because of my father’s involvement—it goes back much longer than that. Some of the original convict work was done there. There are some extraordinary underground grain silos and all sorts of hidden treasures. There is also some extraordinary military history in the military facilities around Chowder Bay. Some of the things are perhaps slightly better known, such as the cannons that were put up on Middle Head in years gone by.
It is not automatic that this history gets protected, particularly when the body managing it has an imperative to try and find money from somewhere. The inevitable temptation is to sell off a bit of it or to lease out a chunk of it to the highest bidder rather than for the most appropriate use. It was not until the Senate and the Democrats were able to strengthen this legislation that those protections were put in place. The government and the former environment minister, Senator Robert Hill, to their credit, were able to reach agreement within whatever the arcane processes are that are required within government to get approval for most of what we wanted—not all of it but most of it. We really got a good outcome.
I make that point not just to blow the trumpet of the Democrats but to emphasise the positive role that the Senate can play for the government’s benefit. Frankly, there is no doubt that, if the current circumstance had applied and the government had controlled the Senate, it probably would have been railroaded through at first go without any amendment, or at best perhaps a few little token changes to address some of the many concerns that were put forward. The outcome would have been less good for the government, for this is a real success story that the government can point to. Not surprisingly, it very rarely mentions the role that the Democrats or the Senate played in that success story—that is life. That is why I have to mention it: because nobody else does. But it has nonetheless provided a great result for the benefit of the government and a great legacy.
Far more importantly than whether it provides a good political legacy for the government, the Democrats or anybody else, it provides a great legacy for the people of Australia and the people of Sydney in particular. As a Queenslander, providing a great legacy for the people of Sydney is not necessarily my No. 1 priority, but I am quite happy to do it when the opportunity arises. Sydney Harbour—particularly with some of those areas that have that enormous history attached to them—is an asset and a great icon for all Australians, not just the people of Sydney. I wanted to take the opportunity to emphasise that.
I mention in passing that the efforts of the Democrats were opposed both by the Labor Party and by the Greens at the time. We were accused of all sorts of things, such as putting all of this at risk of being sold off, even though what we did was precisely the opposite. The Labor Party did not support it because they wanted it all to be just handed back to the New South Wales Labor government, although quite why anybody would want to hand it back to the New South Wales Labor government, given the mess that they had made of the Sydney Harbour foreshores, is beyond me. It is always frustrating when you get those sorts of attacks.
I can recall the press release that the Greens put out at the time saying that we were risking this fabulous piece of land that should be put in the Sydney Harbour National Park. It was actually a suburban street—Markham Close—that had a lot of Defence Force housing. It was never going to be put into a national park or anything else like that. All we did was single it out as the one part that could be sold off, with appropriate controls, to raise revenue for management of the park. I am pleased to say that it was sold off, netting an enormous financial windfall of $18 million or something. Certainly over $10 million was raised just from selling off 10 or 12 Defence Force houses that just happened to be in Mosman, where the land goes pretty well. As part of that, they were able to rearrange the title on a couple of blocks to improve the amenity of the open space right at the peak of the ridge. That really helped with the visual line across that area. Even that was a positive outcome for the trust in particular. They raised some revenue by selling off a bunch of houses that were of no practical relevance to the work of the trust and, in the process, were able to improve the use of the adjoining open space in that region.
This is a case study of how the Senate can work very effectively. It took a fair period of time. I think Senator Hill sat off on the side for six months or so before he eventually came back and we worked through the final agreement. As I said, there were still some gripes from others suggesting all sorts of terrible consequences, but the result has, I believe, been a real tribute.
I do not have to say that a lot of credit should go to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust management and staff, particularly Geoff Bailey, who has been the executive director from day one and has done a really good job involving the community and opening up these areas to the public. That is part of what it is about. Also, part of it is about preserving the heritage and the natural environmental values, and the extraordinary historic values of the region, having discovered some of the history that we were not sure about. He has opened that up to Australians and indeed to the global community. We have not always been terribly good at protecting our heritage in Australia and we have not been good at opening up to the wider community. I think the trust has done a magnificent job and they should get a lot of credit for it. It is a good opportunity to note that via debate in this chamber.
The fact that the legislation is not controversial is a sign of just how successful it has been. Extending the life of the trust for the purpose of overseeing the management of North Head does not raise a ripple, compared to the strident opposition five or six years ago to the original legislation from Labor and the Greens. Again, I do not think I can make the point strongly enough that this is an example of how, when the Senate is not controlled by anybody, the government can work constructively to the government’s benefit as well as to the community’s benefit. Of course, that happens only when parties other than governing parties in the Senate are interested in engaging constructively, as opposed to scoring political points. That is certainly where the Democrats’ record differs and stands out above all the others. More than that, the key part is delivering results for the community. This not overly well-known and well-recognised area—one can be pretty much unequivocal—has delivered a very positive outcome.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-09-13,"—The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Amendment Bill 2007 facilitates the extension of the life of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust from 19 September 2011 until 19 September 2033. Since the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust was first established in 2001, it has gained significant experience in transforming and managing seven important sites in the Sydney Harbour region and has also gained strong public support for its role. The extension of the life of the trust until 19 September 2033 supports a recent agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments to transfer title in the land situated at the former North Head Artillery School to the trust until 2032. The extension of the date by which the act is to be repealed will ensure that the trust will continue to manage this iconic site until it is transferred back to New South Wales and will also enable the trust to continue its work of remediating and making available to the public these magnificent former Commonwealth sites for another 26 years.
I would like to put on record the parliament’s thanks to Senator Bartlett and the Australian Democrats for their constructive engagement, particularly their comments on industrial heritage. I live in an area in Brisbane which has great industrial heritage, which is protected. I thank Senator Bartlett for bringing that up. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-13,"—The International Trade Integrity Bill 2007 amends the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945, the Customs Act 1901, the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to implement the Australian government’s response to three of the five recommendations from the Cole inquiry report. Changes to the latter two acts were also in response to some recommendations from the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions. The bill creates new offences for individuals or corporations who engage in conduct that contravenes a United Nations sanction in force in Australia or who provide false or misleading information in connection with United Nations sanctions or who import or export goods sanctioned by the United Nations without valid permission. It requires a person who applies for a licence or other authorisation order under a United Nations sanction to retain all documentation relating to that application for five years. It requires a person who is granted authorisation under United Nations sanction enforcement law to retain all documentation relating to compliance with any conditions to which authorisation is subject for five years. It provides for approvals granted in respect of the expectation of United Nations sanctions to be invalidated if the application contains false or misleading information or omits any relevant matter. It clarifies the circumstances in which a payment to a foreign public official is not a bribe and it aligns the definition of facilitation payment in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 with that in the Criminal Code Act 1995.
This bill is the culmination of a long and expensive period of high contention and political and public agitation. The Australian Democrats wholeheartedly and warmly welcome it and are glad it is going to progress into law. However, I would say that, while the bill implements the first three recommendations of the Cole inquiry, there are still two obvious weaknesses which I would like to bring to the government’s attention. I hope in due course that they will pay attention to them and correct them. Given the high stakes in bribery and corruption, there is a case for arguing that the monetary penalties for corporations remain extremely low at $330,000.
I draw the attention of the government to the fact that Transparency International—a very credible, high-profile international organisation with a very strong Australian chapter populated by extremely worthy individuals—has indicated that, in its view, the penalty should more realistically be close to $10 million, especially when you are talking about major corporations with huge financial resources for which $330,000 is just a sniff and does not matter much at all. So I draw your attention to that.
Further, we know from the Cole inquiry how difficult it has been to uncover material matters, even with recently enhanced royal commission powers, which the Democrats fully supported, and particularly when such material is offshore. The public disclosure laws for Commonwealth offences—otherwise known as whistleblower laws, in popular parlance—are of two types. There are those that affect the public sector under section 16 of the Public Service Act and there are those that affect the private sector, principally in the Corporations Act but also in the Workplace Relations Act. They are different in application, process and effect, but both private and public sector whistleblowing are very important in this particular context. Australia’s whistleblowing or public disclosure laws are weak. It is unlikely that these changes will strengthen the resolve of whistleblowers to come forward about corrupt practices. Frankly, your greatest chance of dealing with corruption where it is offshore is in fact to encourage whistleblowers.
This bill does not address other recommendations from the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention or the shortcomings of Australian law in respect of them. The Senate committee that looked into this bill was advised that the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions will not consider Australia’s response before January 2008, which is extremely slow. Corruption and bribery is a matter which needs constant, urgent and immediate attention. With those remarks, which I hope the government will take on board as a constructive recommendation for further effort in this area, the Democrats strongly support this bill.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL TRADE INTEGRITY BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-09-13,"—I would like to thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for their work inquiring into and reporting on the bill. I note that Senator Murray was a participating member on that inquiry and I thank him for his service. The International Trade Integrity Bill 2007 will improve the way in which Australian agencies administer United Nations sanctions and introduce harsher penalties and tighter restrictions for any who attempt to contravene these sanctions.
The bill stems largely from the first three recommendations, as Senator Murray said, made in the report of the inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the Iraq oil for food program, better known as the Cole inquiry. This response, tabled only six months after Commissioner Cole published his report, indicates the government’s continued commitment to addressing the issues raised in the inquiry and ensuring lawful, ethical dealings in all Australian trade.
The government remains committed to ensuring Australian businesses uphold our country’s international obligations in relation to trade sanctions and combating foreign bribery. This bill re-affirms the government’s commitment to these goals and sends a clear message that contravention of United Nations sanctions and bribery of foreign officials simply will not be tolerated. In conjunction with other efforts by the government to raise awareness of international trade obligations, these amendments will encourage a culture of ethical dealing in Australian business that will improve Australia’s excellent reputation in international trade. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-13,"—The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007 and its related bill, the Corporations (National Guarantee Fund Levies) Amendment Bill 2007, bring to some conclusion another contentious, costly and extremely important public issue, namely that arising from the collapse of the HIH Insurance Group. Broadly, the bill aims to bring direct offshore foreign insurers, known as DOFIs, under prudential regulation. It enables information to be collected and collated to determine the nature and scope of discretionary mutual funds operations. The question is whether the added regulation is going to have adverse or positive effects.
DOFIs are foreign insurers that can conduct business either directly, by establishing a subsidiary and applying to APRA for a licence, or indirectly, through the use of Australian insurance brokers with an Australian financial services licence. Discretionary mutual funds are insurance-like funds which retain discretionary power over the payment of insurance in the event of a claim. These DMFs are generally used in circumstances where mainstream contractually secured insurance is either not available or unaffordable.
Several key issues were identified through the consultation process for this bill. These are the need to protect consumers of insurance and insurance-like products to ensure that Australian businesses remain internationally competitive, to minimise administration costs of compliance, to ensure that the industries and professions in Australia faced with more complex risks have access to adequate types and levels of cover, and to ensure that the implementation of proposed provisions of the bill is not overly burdensome. The bill does address recommendations by Justice Owen at the royal commission into the failure of the HIH Insurance Group. He recommended prudential regulation be extended to all discretionary insurance-like products to the extent possible within constitutional limits. He also commented on insurance cover written offshore, but made no specific recommendations. Whilst this proposes prudentially regulating DOFIs with the Insurance Act, DMFs, who offer insurance-like products, will remain unregulated, contrary to commission recommendations. The government has instead opted to empower APRA to collect data on the nature and scope of DMF businesses in Australia over the next 12 months, and this indicates a concern as to possible effects of introducing regulation without further understanding the detail and the nature of DMFs.
In response to Justice Owen’s comments, the government did commission a review of discretionary mutual funds and direct offshore foreign insurers, headed by Mr Gary Potts. Potts made a number of key recommendations, and the proposals for DMFs in the bill do not match the recommendations of the Potts review or the HIH royal commission recommendations, as I said earlier. It should be noted that the data collection recommendation of the Potts review pertains to DMF business that is deemed of no contingent risk. Clearly a contingent risk arises in a predominant amount of business underwritten by DMFs.
The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, on which I sit, for inquiry and report. While most of the submissions indicated support for the bill, concerns were expressed regarding the ability of professions to obtain adequate levels of professional indemnity insurance, the access of Australian companies to DOFIs and the lack of clarity regarding exemption provisions in the bill. The committee also noticed evidence that Treasury is planning further consultation with stakeholders regarding exemptions, and it aims to achieve a balance between maintaining prudential standards with exemptions that are practical and of minimal cost to government and consumers as well as being flexible in adapting to insurance market cycles. In its report, the Senate committee stated it is:
... satisfied that the consultative mechanism to be implemented by Treasury with regard to DOFI exemptions will produce a set of regulatory provisions that will satisfy the requirements of Australian businesses for access to suitable insurance products, while still maintaining the required prudential standards for the insurance industry. The Committee supports the closure of regulatory gaps identified by the HIH Royal Commission, and the International Monetary Fund. The Committee does not share the fears expressed by some witnesses as to possible significant negative market effects from changes to regulation. Nonetheless, Treasury and APRA should actively monitor market effects to be certain of this.
The point of me emphasising that quote and making the remarks I have is that this is a contentious and difficulty policy area with market effects which are very difficult to ascertain and it requires ongoing analysis and observation by Treasury. The Australian Democrats and I support the committee’s conclusions but we would urge government, in the light of the fact that these policy decisions are contrary in some respects to the HIH royal commission and the Potts review, to continue to monitor this area and to report on this area periodically, as required, to the Senate and to the markets as a whole. The Democrats do, of course, support a financial framework that protects Australian consumers from unregulated and therefore high-risk insurers. A strong, efficient regulatory framework would ensure underwriters are accountable and consumers are protected.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-13,"—The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007 is to amend the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. It will change the process of appointing federal safety officers. It will extend the application of the Australian Government Building and Construction Occupational Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme to cover situations where building work is funded by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority. It will ensure that persons are accredited under the scheme at the time of entering into a contract for building work and also take the necessary steps to see that such persons are accredited while the work is being carried out. It will extend the accreditation requirement to funding arrangements beyond those currently contemplated by the legislation. It will clarify that section 35(4) of the act only overrides Commonwealth provisions to the extent of any inconsistency and it allows the federal safety commissioner and persons working in that office to disclose protected information on the scheme to the minister.
Considering these provisions focus on improving occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry, the Democrats will be supporting the bill. Few would deny worrying safety problems in this industry. Overall, though, we must keep in mind that the unions mostly address workplace health and safety measures on a practical and necessary basis. We must also remember that problems in building and other industries are best addressed by the enforcement of existing law through a well-resourced and independent regulator.
On this point, I would like to take this opportunity to again emphasise that the Democrats’ industrial relations platform supports a single, national, strong independent regulator, which we do not have. We have a multiplicity of regulators in this country, and that is not to the advantage of the efficient, effective and safe operation of workplace law. The Democrats do not support industry specific regulators such as the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The single, national regulator the Democrats envisage is one that would absorb the regulatory functions of the state departmental inspectorates as well as the regulatory functions of the new Workplace Authority and the Building and Construction Commission. Importantly, the creation of a well-resourced, independent, single national workplace relations regulator would put an end to a federal minister’s discretion and interventionism.
Australia also needs a well-resourced, national, independent workplace relations regulator to properly regulate and oversee a single, national unitary system. Other sectors of the economy have regulators—like ASIC, APRA and the ACCC—and so should work arrangements. The existing regulators include federal and state departmental inspectorates and task forces. These diverse regulators are diffused, dispersed, underresourced and, importantly, insufficiently independent. One properly resourced national regulator to enforce national workplace law would be a significant improvement on the existing situation and a significant advance for the Australian economy and society.
I want to take the opportunity in debating this bill, which covers workplace law, to comment briefly on the coalition’s current and constant attack on the union dominance of the Labor Party and specifically of CFMEU influence on Labor. All that the coalition attack has shown is the cowardice, opportunism and lack of principle of the Liberal Party. Why do I say that? I say it because the Liberals tomorrow could introduce a one vote, one value requirement to electoral law. At a stroke, that would give power in the Labor Party back to their financial members and end it for union members who are not party members. The ALP has internal voting systems that result in exaggerated factional voting and the block power of union officials, who are allowed to use the large numbers of union members—the great majority of whom are not party members—to achieve and exercise power within the political party.
The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters took the first step with its recommendation to introduce one vote, one value in political parties in its report on the integrity of the roll. Some ALP reformers aim to make the process of trade union affiliation to political parties more transparent and democratic, so it does have support within the movement as a whole. Unions affiliate on the basis of how many of their union members, the great majority of whom are not party members, their committee of management chooses to affiliate for. The more members a union affiliates for, the greater the number of delegates that union is entitled to send to an ALP state conference. Individual members of that union have no say as to whether they wish to be included in their union’s affiliation numbers or not. Affiliation fees paid to the ALP by the union are derived from the union’s consolidated revenue.
I have outlined detailed amendments to address these issues in my Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters 2004 election minority report, which repeats remarks I have made over the last decade. But, as I say, because the coalition think union influence in Labor is good for the Liberals politically, they continue to attack a situation that is in their power to correct. The Liberals are unwilling to change electoral law and take Labor on, the journalists are unwilling to ask the hard questions of the Liberals as to why they will not do so and, in my view, the Liberals lack the ethics, integrity and principle required to introduce good political governance into the party system. I am of the belief that outsiders should not have the ability to influence political parties and the way in which they operate, and that is why I oppose the way in which the unions are able to exercise undue influence, over and above that of financial members of the Labor Party.
This is not news for anyone who has followed what I have said in this chamber over the last decade, and people know my advocacy in it, but I am extremely irritated by the constant reiteration by the Liberals of their views about union bosses when in fact it is their very own policy which allows the situation to continue. I think that is contrary to good policy and I wish they would stop it. Until they decide to change it and until the Labor Party decides to face up to that issue, the influence of unions will continue in the Labor Party in its current construction. One vote, one value, which gives power back to financial members of a political party—any political party—would end this.
The other reason I want to remark on this bill is with respect to Work Choices. This chamber knows that I and my party are opposed to the Work Choices legislation. We wish it had not passed and we wish to get rid of it. Because we have that view, I have been paying great attention to the various policies that have been put out with respect to the federal election that is forthcoming. I have had a look at the policies of the coalition, Labor, Democrats, Greens and so on across a range of issues, and a very interesting thing emerges, in my view. What emerges is that the result of Labor’s movement across to the centre in industrial relations matters is that they, the coalition and the Democrats all are pretty well talking on the same page.
That may seem surprising to those who have seen the ACCI’s remark that there are 30 major differences between the coalition and Labor. So what do I mean? I mean that, broadly speaking, in the areas of safety nets, awards, agreement-making, industrial relations machinery and so on, the parties have similar concepts and language but differ in application and proposal. I will not minimise the effects of that, because the effects are significant, but we are, broadly speaking, on the same page.
That leads to an ability to compromise and negotiate. For instance, the Labor Party had never signed up to a unitary system but now do, as have the Democrats. We have long promoted this. In fact, we promoted it ahead of the coalition. The coalition is obviously on that page.
With respect to the right to strike, the coalition, the Democrats and Labor are on the same page, in that it should be restricted to protected action. With respect to union rights of entry, we are all on the same page in terms of restrictions to the time and place, and on issues such as notice periods. For instance, the Labor Party’s policy with respect to right of entry refers to 24 hours notice, the place of meeting determined by the employer, the retention of the fit and proper test, and so on. With respect to secondary boycott laws, the parties—the coalition, Labor and the Democrats—want to retain them.
Why do I draw attention to this? I draw attention to this because of an irony that has emerged. I am very glad that Senator Siewert is here to respond to my remarks because she may be able to spell it out a little more clearly. There is one party that is not on the same page—the Greens. The Greens oppose Work Choices. They support a state system, not a unitary system. They support an open-ended right to strike; we, Labor and the Liberals do not. The Greens support free right of entry and open-ended awards. I am content, as always, for them to have their own point of view, because that contributes very well to the debate, but the point that I am making is that a vote for the Greens is a vote to keep Work Choices.
If you hold a position which is so far distant from Labor’s, and you also have a history of not negotiating or compromising in this place, how on earth are you ever going to come together in the Senate to agree on a package which will pass? If that is so, Work Choices will stay. The Greens cannot negotiate or compromise because they are not on the same page as the rest of us. It amuses me vastly, and I think it is a great irony, that the left-wing unions have arrived at a position to support a party—because that party strongly opposes Work Choices and a return to an old federal system, an open-ended right to strike and an open-ended right of entry—which will not be able to agree with Labor’s new position, and therefore Work Choices will stay. That is why we have the odd circumstance where a vote for the Greens will end up keeping Work Choices. You can correct me if you like, but I cannot see the Greens and Labor coming together, given how far apart their policies are.
—It is very cunning.
—It is amazing, and it is an irony. I thought I would take a non-controversial moment in our legislative program to put what I would suggest is quite a controversial situation. By the way, I have mentioned this to others and people seem remarkably unwilling to come close to this extraordinary conundrum. How can the Greens and Labor ever get together in the Senate after 1 July 2008 to get rid of Work Choices when they are so far apart and when they are not on the same page?
I ask the question of you, Senator Siewert. I hope that you can indicate that you are able to move toward a unitary system, that you will restrict the right to strike and that you will restrict the right of entry. I hope that you will address these issues which make the Greens so far apart from Labor that we will not be able to get rid of Work Choices.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-09-13,"—I will address, a little bit later, some of the issues raised by Senator Murray. I have to say at the outset, though, that I think some of his comments were quite disingenuous given the debate that has been going on in the media recently. However, first off I will deal with the bill.
The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007 deals with a very important issue. It deals with safety in the building and construction industry. There is no question that the building and construction industry is one of the most dangerous industries in Australia, and this is recognised across the board. When introducing this bill the minister acknowledged that fatalities in this industry make up one-third of all workplace fatalities, and that there are over 30 injuries per day. The Australian Greens will not be opposing this bill. This is because the bill contains much needed provisions for a health and safety accreditation scheme for building contractors.
However, we believe it is important to recognise that this scheme exists within the context of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act. We have, in the past, put on record our opposition to this act, and to the Australian Building and Construction Commission that it creates. This is an act that the Australian Greens are steadfastly opposed to, and we will continue to oppose it. It is an act which we believe has seriously undermined the health and safety gains made in recent decades for workers within the building and construction sector.
We do not want to see a return to the bad old days of Australian construction sites when you had 17-year-olds falling off buildings on their first day of work, or when there were no toilets or sheds on worksites, and when there were few safety rules and even less enforcement to ensure that there were no unsafe work practices.
There are a number of reasons for our opposition to the BCII Act, one of which is the way it has undermined the health and safety of workers in the building industry. The primary purpose of the act, we believe, is to intimidate building workers and stop them from doing what are otherwise considered their lawful duties in our democratic society. We have grave concerns that the restriction of legitimate union activity, whether directly or indirectly, will impact adversely on health and safety at building sites across Australia.
In a previous speech in this place, I outlined our concerns about this act and how the ABCC have been operating, particularly the way these laws remove basic civil and democratic rights of workers. The ABCC have been given what are very clearly coercive powers, and I have heard worrying stories about the way in which they have been using them. Due to this act, ordinary Australian workers have no right of silence, limited access to bona fide legal representation and a threat of six months jail for being involved in or possibly having knowledge of industrial actions that were not illegal at the time that they were said to have occurred.
The workers caught up by these laws are being denied basic democratic rights to procedural fairness and natural justice that all of us normally take for granted. These workers are being treated with fewer rights than someone who has committed a very serious criminal offence. It is all very well for the government to use the sphere of ‘union bosses’ in an attempt to justify this act, but the reality is that this act is hurting ordinary Australian workers. There are now well over 100 workers who have been prosecuted—some would say persecuted—under the act. The arbitrary and extreme way in which the ABCC operates has led, as I understand it, to people being prosecuted, even in circumstances where they were not present at a site to take the industrial action that is the subject of the prosecution.
That is extraordinary. These people have been put through extraordinary distress in a period of their lives, with prosecutions, legal bills and court hearings as part of what effectively amounts to an ideological assault. Imagine being on leave or working on a different site, then something happens at work—which you are not involved in and may not even know anything about—and the next thing that happens is that you are prosecuted.
Some of the stories of people affected by this act can be seen in a new film that is available on DVD entitled Constructing Fear: Australia’s Secret Industrial Inquisition. It is a very apt title. Fear is what this act is about. I have also heard other stories about what practices this act is leading to: breaches of safety regulations, very unsafe work practices, which workers are in fact starting to document and which will, I think, come to light in the near future. We need to take a serious look at the impact of this act on workers’ health and safety.
Recently I was contacted by a constituent who has been prosecuted under these laws. I will not go into the details of his case because it is still ongoing, but I wish to read to the chamber how this person described his experiences. He is now having difficulty finding work, which has led to him going into increasing debt. He says:
I was a contributing member of society and am now threatened with jail, fines and a huge bill even if I win. I have not recovered from my debts but I am finding little bits of work, most of which is outside my trade as a carpenter.
I believe that these workers are courageously facing an assault from a government which is pursuing an ideological agenda and they need our support. He goes on to say:
I cannot on my name leave such a mess for future generations. I will get some comfort from the fact that I will be able to sleep with a clear conscience and can only hope that those that use workers as political pawns lose theirs.
These are emotive words, but they reflect the reality of the effect of these laws on people’s lives. It is simply not sufficient to justify laws that are hurting ordinary working people in the way these laws are purely on the grounds of profitability and economic returns.
The Greens’ point is simple: we should not be allowing bosses in this or any other industry to gamble with workers’ lives. Cutting corners on workplace health and safety is clearly a form of gambling: a few bucks saved and a few extra minutes worked here and there in the hope that an accident will never happen. The costs of losing this gamble are enormous not only in the loss of lives—which is a reality—and injuries but also in terms of down time and lost productivity, which occurs when things go wrong. The odds are that, if you are dropping occupational health and safety standards, sooner or later something will go wrong. This is the kind of gamble that we should not be letting anyone even attempt.
Previously in this place I have told stories of Perth’s construction boom, which illustrates this culture of cutting corners—for example, where crane drivers have been threatened with prosecution if they take longer than five minutes each morning with their pre-start safety checks and of construction workers on the railway working 13 long days without a break and then being told they have no choice but to work the following weekend. Behind each of these stories was the threat from the boss that they would bring in the ABCC.
We are told by the government that they want to move us into a less adversarial industrial relations environment, yet there is no more adversarial body than the ABCC and its modus operandi. These comments are relevant to the bill before this place today because the Greens, like many others, hold grave concerns that a consequence of this act and the activities of the ABCC will be to intimidate workers into silence on occupational health and safety issues and, further, that they will intimidate workers into not wanting to be an occupational health and safety representative on site, which will hinder the very important role unions play in ensuring safe workplaces. This will, potentially, lead to even worse health and safety outcomes on building sites and even more workers and their families suffering injury. We believe this is unacceptable.
I now turn briefly, because I am aware of the time allotted to me, to some of the issues which Senator Murray has just raised. We believe that the Greens have the best industrial relations policies of all the parties, as I think Senator Murray articulated in his way. We want to see the end of Work Choices. This issue has been raised publicly. For your benefit, Senator Murray, in case you missed Lateline last week or the week before last, the leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Brown, articulated our position on Work Choices. We are unequivocally opposed to it and want to get rid of it. We will not vote to see it retained, but we will push the ALP to improve their policy.
We have made no secret of the fact that we are extremely concerned about the ALP’s policy, we will do everything we can to encourage them to improve their policy and we will negotiate with them to try and achieve some amendments, but we will not let Work Choices stand if we can do a single thing about it. Does that clarify matters for you, Senator Murray?
—I wanted to know if you were going to vote for the ALP bill.
—We will look at the bill when it comes through and we will try to amend it to improve it. However, as I said, we are unequivocally opposed to Work Choices and will do everything we can to move to a fairer and more just industrial relations system in this country.
Moving back to the bill, the Greens do not oppose the bill, but we seek to put on record our extreme concerns with the BCII Act and the modus operandi of the ABCC. We do not think it should continue to operate in its manner of intimidating workers, with its coercive powers. We believe it has no place in a democratic Australia and we will seek to do everything we can to have it disbanded as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENT (OHS) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-09-13,"—I thank senators who have contributed to the debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007, as well as those broader issues canvassed this afternoon—they are perhaps even more interesting. This government is committed to workers’ safety. This bill is about saving lives, improving the occupational health and safety performance of the construction industry and developing a culture where work is performed safely as well as on budget and on time. This bill strengthens the Australian Government Building and Construction OHS Accreditation Scheme by implementing changes to the scheme. The bill enables the government to increase its influence as a client and provider of capital to improve the building and construction industry’s occupational health and safety performance. The bill also contains some technical amendments concerning the appointment of federal safety officers and the disclosure of information to the minister. These amendments strengthen what is already a strong base for improving the occupational health and safety culture of the building and construction industry. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-09-13,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Is the minister aware that Australians now owe a total of $40.8 billion on credit cards? Doesn’t this mean an average of $3,000 is owed on every one of the 13½ million credit cards in Australia? Is the minister further aware that, since interest rates went up for the ninth time in a row last month, banks like Westpac, NAB, BankWest and St George have increased credit card rates by up to 1.25 percentage points—that is, 1.25 per cent in just one month? If interest rates keep going up, how will families ever be able to pay off the $3,000 they already owe on each of their credit cards and meet their mortgage repayments? Doesn’t this again show why families are angry with the Howard government, which broke its promise to them that it would ‘keep interest rates at record lows’?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,28,1,question
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-09-13,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Five interest rate increases in a row since the last election! Keeping interest rates low—that was your promise. Minister, given an extra $1,200 is being put onto every credit card in Australia every month, how will families ever be able to afford to pay off their credit cards, cope with rising childcare, grocery and petrol prices, and deal with the government’s attack on their working conditions? Is the Prime Minister really so out of touch that he thinks this shows ‘working families in Australia have never been better off’ and keeping interest rates at record lows?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,28,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2007-09-13,"—This is the weekly trailing out of a tired old interest rates question with a false premise. The false premise, of course, is what we said to the Australian people at the last election. We said to the Australian people at the last election that they could be confident that a coalition government would ensure that interest rates were lower than they would be under a Labor government. We have honoured that pledge. It remains astounding that interest rates today are lower than they ever were in the 13 years of the Labor government.
Interest rates are lower today than they were when we came into government. The average mortgage interest rate under us is much lower than it ever was under the last Labor government. There is an obvious answer as to why that is. It is the responsible economic management of this government which has kept interest rates low, unlike that of the previous Labor government, which lost control of the economy and brought on the recession we had to have and the 17 per cent interest rates that threw people out of their houses and their businesses and threw hundreds of thousands of people onto the dole. It was a disgraceful period of government.
We are proud of our record in government of keeping interest rates much lower than they were under the previous Labor government. We will again go to the people pledging honestly that they can be sure that under a coalition government interest rates will be lower than they ever would be under a Labor government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,28,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2007-09-13,"—Under this government, real wages have risen 20 per cent in real terms. How much did they rise under the Labor government? They did not rise at all in 13 years; there was no increase in real wages. Under us they have gone up 20 per cent. Inflation is contained. Unemployment is at record lows. Australians are in jobs. They have decided that, with the confidence they have in our economic management, they can afford to borrow money and get the things that they want. And they can afford to do so because real wages are rising and they have got jobs. Under our government that will continue to be the case, unlike if you elect a Labor government, when we will see a return to the bad old days of businesses closing, interest rates rising, people out of jobs. We do not want that for the Australian people.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I do so with particular attention paid to answers given by Senator Minchin and Senator Scullion in relation to the cost of living and the increase in the cost of living and with particular reference to my question to Senator Scullion about the increased pressure on first home buyers and homeowners in Australia and the rise in the cost of their mortgages as a result of interest rate hikes. But perhaps I should start my comments today by referencing new data released showing that many families are facing cost of living pressures that are well in excess of what is implied by the average consumer price growth.
Today’s ABS data shows that the living costs of families have increased by some 3.1 per cent over the last 12 months, one whole percentage point higher than growth in the consumer price index. Over the last five years, we know that the CPI has increased by 14.5 per cent, but according to today’s Australian Bureau of Statistics data the living costs have increased by 18 per cent for employee households, 15.8 per cent for aged pensioners and 16.6 per cent for households receiving government benefits, showing that all of these groups of people—families, pensioners and people receiving benefits and everyone in the mix there—are enduring far greater costs of living than is recognised by the CPI increase.
Over the same five-year time frame, prices for many household essentials have also skyrocketed. Fruit and vegetable prices have increased by 41.9 per cent, education costs have increased by 32.6 per cent, health costs have increased by 31 per cent, housing costs have increased by 20.6 per cent and child-care costs have risen by a massive 88 per cent. Apart from these steep increases in costs of living, one of the reasons why the cost of living pressures are outstripping the CPI is that the CPI does not include mortgage interest repayments.
Today’s data partly reflects the impact on household budgets of Mr Howard’s broken interest rate promise following nine rate rises despite his promise to keep rates at record lows. This data, of course, shows even more evidence of how deeply out of touch Mr Howard and his government are with the realities of many household budgets. It is for that reason that I was surprised to see the very aggressive, arrogant and desperate response by Senator Minchin and Senator Scullion to questions asked by the Labor opposition today in question time. I think such a rant would have been found to be offensive by anyone listening who is enduring these cost pressures within their household and struggling to manage their household budget.
I think the questions asked by Labor today really do highlight that this government is living in a different universe, a universe that has no connection with the reality of Australian households. There is no possible way you can equate all of those increases in the cost of living with the general rhetoric emanating from the Howard government saying that workers and families have never been better off. That is not how the working people of Australia—and, indeed, pensioners and those in need of our support—are feeling at all. They are feeling the pinch, and the cost of living is making their lives harder and harder.
I think it is very interesting when you add in even more stresses on the household budget—a 53 per cent increase in petrol prices over the last five years, a 25 per cent increase in bread prices, a 60 per cent increase in the price of butter and, as I said, a 41.9 per cent increase in the price of fruit and vegetables. All these things start to really compound on the household pressure. The Labor Party is the only party that has some practical suggestions and policies that go to the heart of reducing inflationary pressures in the Australian economy and, indeed, specific programs to improve things like household affordability and far greater scrutiny by the ACCC on things like grocery and petrol prices to hopefully bring into check some of those unreasonable price hikes that have occurred because of the Howard government’s failure to pay any interest at all to what can be done by government to shine a spotlight on increases of that nature.
It is very easy to relate the cost of this increased pressure to the impact of Work Choices. We now know, based on information received today, that workers in retail and hospitality—some of our most vulnerable—have been worst hit by the effects of the government’s extreme industrial relations.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-09-13,"—It is always very interesting when senators opposite talk about pressures on households. They only ever talk about one side of the household budget. They talk about the expenditures in a household—which do have to be taken into account. What you never hear the Labor Party talk about is the income side of a household budget. You never hear how real wages have increased under this government. You never hear how household assets have increased under this government. When looking at a household budget, you have to look at both sides of the ledger: you have to look at the outgoings and you also have to look at the incomings.
In my remarks this afternoon I would particularly like to focus on interest rates, which Senator Lundy touched on. There are a range of factors that determine the interest rate environment. The government has within its power the ability to set a range of policies conducive to lower interest rates. One of the most significant of those is government borrowing and government debt.
When this government came to office, we—as most of us here know—inherited a $96 billion debt from Labor. This debt and the interest repayments required to support it were putting upward pressure on interest rates. That is a fact. When this government came to office, not only did we have a $96 billion debt but there was also a $12 billion budget deficit. This government determined to do something about that. We introduced a tough budget in 1996. It was not popular and it was not easy but it was necessary. We set about the task of balancing the budget and paying down Labor’s debt. We set about the task of creating an environment conducive to lower interest rates.
But guess what. Every single measure that this government introduced to pay down the debt, to balance the budget or to help take pressure off interest rates, Labor senators opposite opposed. Time and again they knocked back our measures. Fact: every program we put up, Labor knocked back. But, despite that opposition and despite the fact that for a majority of our time in government we have not had a majority in this chamber, we managed to balance the budget. We managed to pay down Labor’s debt without their help on one single day. In fact, the government is now a net saver, helping take pressure off interest rates.
In contrast, the collective of state and territory Labor governments is forecast to accrue something in the order of $70 billion of debt. These state Labor governments are putting upward pressure on interest rates. It does not matter whether it is a state Labor government that borrows or some other level of government that borrows; that puts pressure on interest rates. Federal Labor have the opportunity to do something to help relieve the pressure on householders. They have the opportunity to do something to take pressure off interest rates. They can talk to their state Labor colleagues and say: ‘Do something about releasing more land. Do something about stamp duty.’
Senators opposite need to learn something about the basics of economics. They need to learn about supply and demand.
—You haven’t got long enough to teach them.
—Indeed. They need to learn that increasing the supply of something lowers the price. If you increase the supply of land, that will lower the price of houses. If you cut stamp duty, more money will remain in the pockets of householders, which means that they will be in a better position to afford their mortgages. That is something that they can do today. But they will not. We know from their track record that they will not. We know from local government amalgamations in Queensland that federal Labor dare not argue a case with state Labor governments.
If you are after independent verification as to the efficacy of our policies, you need look no further than the International Monetary Fund’s public information notice from today, which praises the Australian government’s monetary policies, fiscal policies and structural policies. They give us a huge tick. They commend our fiscal policies and monetary policies. If you want independent confirmation of the robustness of our policies and how they are helping Australian living standards, you need look no further than the IMF. You certainly should not look to the other side of this chamber. (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2007-09-13,"—I too would like to take particular note of answers given by Senators Scullion and Minchin to questions without notice asked today. If ever we wanted more evidence that senators opposite are out of touch with working Australians and Australian families, we heard it today in the answers of Senator Minchin and Senator Scullion. We already know that government members are out of touch. We learnt that when the Prime Minister came out with that cracker of a comment that working families in Australia have never been better off. What an absolute purler that was. But the government’s arrogance and ignorance about what is happening out there in the real world of Australia was on display again here today.
Those opposite like to forget that they have a Prime Minister who has presided over a government that has delivered Australia such things as the highest ever petrol prices, the highest ever rates of credit card debt—which currently averages around $3,000—five interest rate rises since the Prime Minister promised to keep interest rates low and nine increases in a row under the Prime Minister and his henchman Mr Costello. They have plunged the nation into a housing affordability crisis. As we heard from Senator Lundy, average family incomes in South Australia, for example, fall $10,000 short of what is needed to pay off an average size housing loan. In 10 years, the annual income needed to afford mortgage repayments on an average priced house has risen from $31,000 to $85,000.
Senator Fifield made some comments about some economic statistics that were released today. I have some too. Mine are from Dun and Bradstreet. This came out just before question time. In their report, they make mention of the fact that household debt in Australia has risen dramatically over the past 1½ decades and is now just over 150 per cent of household disposable income.
There are more statistics that are damning for this government and which highlight its incompetence and heartlessness when it comes to caring for ordinary working Australian families. ABS statistics show that living costs for working families have increased by 3.1 per cent over the past 12 months. There has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of families using services for the homeless. Half a million Australians are paying 30 per cent or more of their income on rent. In the southern suburbs of Adelaide in the electorate of Kingston, 77 per cent of renters are paying more than 30 per cent of their income in rent. The cost of child care is rising at the rate of about 12 per cent per year. As we have also heard, the price of fruit and vegetables has risen by 41.9 per cent over the past five years—and that is when the nation is facing a crisis of obesity among our children. Those are the statistics. That is the legacy of the 11 long years of this government.
Senator Fifield made mention in his comments just then about how we need to take account of both sides of the household budget. I agree with that. I am going to take account of both sides of the household budget and make reference to a new report that was released today. This report was prepared by the University of New South Wales and gives us the most disturbing evidence to date about this government’s Work Choices legislation and the impact that it has had on wages and conditions.
That report into the centrepiece of this government’s term of office and the Prime Minister’s ideological vendetta against unions has shown that Work Choices has delivered to hapless workers in the retail and hospitality sectors who were forced onto non-union collective agreements incomes that were in many instances reduced by as much as 31 per cent. So when Senator Fifield lectures us about taking account of both sides of the household budget you can bet your bottom dollar we are taking account of both sides of the household budget, and so are working Australian families. That is why this government is on the nose. Australian working families have seen their cost of living go up and their wages either not keeping pace with the cost of living or going down. The statistics that are quoted, as we know, are inflated because some workers are doing well in the current boom in the resources sector, but ordinary working Australians, particularly in sectors like retail and hospitality, are going backwards in terms of wages.

"Fisher, Mary Jo",LP,2007-09-13,"—The key to maintaining a responsible economy and increasing housing affordability is having the experience and responsibility to run a prosperous economy. The Howard government in 11½ years has delivered unemployment at an all-time low, low interest rates and low inflation. The key to housing affordability is the release of affordable land by state governments. It is the reduction of the impost placed upon the cost of housing by state governments. The Howard government has both the experience and the policies to make a difference in the foreseeable future. On top of the Howard government’s experience, the Howard government has already talked about an audit of Commonwealth lands. The Howard government has talked about seeking expressions of interest in respect of public housing.
What is the alternative? Is there really one? The Rudd opposition would have the Australian electorate believe that there is one. But the Rudd opposition is a team of inexperience backed by, infiltrated by and dictated to by a union movement. What Rudd opposition policy will deliver a difference in terms of interest rates? What Rudd opposition policy will deliver a difference in terms of housing affordability? The Rudd opposition, and Kevin Rudd in particular, would have you believe that he cares. But Kevin Rudd and the Rudd opposition care about one thing—they care about winning. I do not see that they care about governing because I do not see their policies to deliver low interest rates. I do not see their policies to deliver affordable housing. Instead, I see a Rudd opposition that would turn to their union bosses to look for policy to take Australia forward, were there ever to be that very horrifying prospect of a Rudd government.
To see this writ large you only need to look at my home state of South Australia where, as has been outlined earlier today, new homebuyers—mum and dad buying their first home costing about $300,000—face a state stamp duty impost, straight to the Rann Labor government, of some $11,000. They have to scrimp and save for it in addition to the $300,000 purchase price. What does a Rann Labor government do with the money that it takes from taxpayers? It finds a way to funnel part of that money back to its mates in the union movement. Look no further than the Rann Labor government’s so-called initiatives to increase safety in South Australia’s workplaces. I am talking about the South Australian Rann government’s recent granting of some $3 million over three years to South Australian unions—to some 12 unions—supposedly to increase safety in South Australian workplaces, with no evidence that this would be the case.
Have a look at the 12 unions to whom this money has been given. Interestingly, five of those 12 unions were amongst the top 10 donors to the Rann-led Labor Party in South Australia in 2005-06. So it is a take from taxpayers by a Labor government that finds its way in terms of finances back to the union movement so that the Labor Party can ensure that it looks after its union mates and so that it can ensure, whether at state or federal level, that it focuses on winning rather than governing. The Labor Party focuses upon returning favours to its union mates so that when they are looking for some policy direction they know where to go, and they go straight to their union mates. We need look no further than what is happening in South Australia. It would appear that the Labor Party is set to welcome a Mark Butler from the LHMWU. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2007-09-13,"—I too rise to take note of answers by Senators Minchin and Scullion to various questions relating to economic matters, the cost of living and the like. One must say at the outset that there is not any doubt that in the last 12 months or so the cost of living and the costs to families have been spiralling out of control. You only have to look at the latest CPI figures, recently released, to see the price hikes in food, education and health. You cannot consider a more basic package of the three items for ordinary families than food, health and education, and the latest figures show their costs rising up and up and, it is fair to say, heading out of control. Just to put this in a bit of context and to set the environment: vegetables are up by six per cent, petrol is up by an astonishing nine per cent and medical services are up by nearly four per cent. These are staple items for every ordinary working family in Australia.
To address the other side of the ledger, an independent study report from the University of Sydney shows how millions of Aussie workers are facing another cost, and that is their reducing wages intake. This report released today and reported in the press today shows how Work Choices has cost thousands and thousands of battlers in the retail and hospitality industries a third—30 per cent—of their salaries. In other words, we pay more, we take home less. So much for the Prime Minister’s flippant remark, oft quoted, that we have ‘never had it so good’ in this country. The only good thing coming up in the immediate future is the likelihood of an election. Then, hopefully, this government will pay the ultimate price for its draconian Work Choices legislation.
Let us look at that study more carefully. Twenty researchers examined the wages and working conditions of thousands of sales assistants and bar staff. After scrutinising, examining, studying and analysing every collective agreement in their industries registered in the first nine months of Work Choices, they found that that group of workers had lost up to 30 per cent of their income under these draconian new laws. These new laws have seen basic conditions of employment stripped away and they have stripped workers of both penalty rates and overtime.
But it is not just the academics, the researchers from Sydney University, who have this terrible news for the current government. Leaked data from its own departments show that 45 per cent of individual contracts, AWAs, have stripped away all of the conditions the government promised to protect, 52 per cent of workers lost public holiday pay and 51 per cent of workers lost overtime pay. What standards does that show this government has brought to ordinary working people over the last 12 months? Very low standards—that is the obvious and only answer. Indeed, there is now a mountain of evidence showing how Work Choices has ripped off and continues to harm Australian families. That is how the Prime Minister and his cohort of conspirators, Mr Hockey and Mr Costello, treat the average battler doing it tough out in the suburbs. Their unfair and extreme workplace laws have gone too far this time. They have cut the conditions, take-home pay and working standards of ordinary families.
Earlier this year, Labor, to get on top of the matter, was forced to start a Senate inquiry into the cost of living. We were concerned then and we remain concerned now at how hard older Australians are finding it to make ends meet. Mr Deputy President, you and I both know that if Labor is elected we will get the balance right. (Time expired)

Australian Government Response


Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee


Senate Committee Report


Turning back the tide – the invasive species challenge

Report on the regulation, control and management of invasive species and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Invasive Species) Bill 2002.

Australian Government response to the Senate Committee Report


By the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee:


Turning back the tide – the invasive species challenge


Recommendation 1


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government strengthen its leadership role in the national effort to combat invasive species by developing a robust national framework, in consultation with state, territory and local governments, to regulate, control and manage invasive species. [see paragraph 8.12]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 1.
The Australian Government submitted a paper and recommendations on invasive species to the April 2004 meeting of the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council. Council agreed on the need
“…to develop a robust national framework for a co-ordinated and strategic approach to preventing significant new invasive species establishing in Australia, and to reducing the impacts of major pests and weeds already present.”
A Task Group, comprising senior representatives from all jurisdictions, the Natural Resource Management and Primary Industries Standing Committees and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), was established under the Council and charged with investigating options to establish such a framework.  The Task Group’s recommendations were considered by the Natural Resource Management and Primary Industries Ministerial Councils in October 2005.  The Councils agreed that further development of a comprehensive national approach to managing biosecurity risks for primary production and the environment would be progressed by a joint Natural Resource Management and Primary Industries Standing Committee Steering Group.  The recommendations from the Invasive Species Task Group, and work undertaken by the Primary Industries Standing Committee in the development of a National Biosecurity Strategy, are forming the basis for the ongoing policy enhancement process.
The work of the joint Steering Group to enhance the Australian Biosecurity System for Primary Production and the Environment (AusBIOSEC) has two key elements.  The first is bringing together all biosecurity-related activities being undertaken by the Australian Government, states and territories, industry, landholders and other key stakeholders to achieve an integrated and collaborative national system.  The second is drawing on existing arrangements for primary industry to establish more formal biosecurity measures for invasive species that have predominantly environmental or social impacts.
The Australian Government is also leading the development and implementation of an integrated national system for invasive marine pests.  Through participation in the National Introduced Marine Pest Coordination Group, relevant Australian Government agencies are working with state and territory government agencies in collaboration with industry stakeholders, the marine science research community and representatives of conservation groups.
The Australian Government’s response to the report by the Agriculture and Food Policy Group, Creating Our Future: agriculture and food policy for the next generation (the Corish Report) – released in November 2006 – demonstrated the Australian Government’s support for a coordinated national approach to biosecurity.

Recommendation 2


The Committee recommends that as part of developing a list of invasive plant species of national importance, the Commonwealth, states and territories develop an agreed national alert list. [see paragraphs 5.36 and 8.15]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 2 (refer to Recommendation 5).

Recommendation 3


The Committee recommends that those states and territories that have failed to legislate a prohibition on the sale of WONS within their jurisdictions should act to do so as a matter of priority. [see paragraphs 5.25 and 8.19]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 3.
Progress towards this outcome is reported against recommendation 7.

Recommendation 4


The Committee recommends that the species listed on the WONS list be reviewed and that other significant threatening species be included as part of a new national control list of invasive plant species. [see paragraphs 5.28 and 8.20]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 4 (refer to Recommendation 5).
At its meeting in April 2005, the Australian Weeds Committee (AWC) of the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council endorsed a proposal to prepare an integrated national weeds priority list.  The AWC agreed that there is a need to review serious weeds in addition to the 20 species currently listed as Weeds of National Significance (WONS), and in doing this, consider appropriate arrangements for their management.  The task will implement a key objective of the Australian Weeds Strategy.

Recommendation 5


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth, states and territories provide funding to enable the Australian Weeds Committee to engage the CRC for Australian Weed Management to produce a scientifically credible and robust national list of invasive plant species. [see paragraphs 5.51 and 8.21]

The Australian Government agrees with the objective of Recommendation 5.
The Australian Government is working with states and territories, through the Australian Weeds Committee of the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, in developing priority lists of nationally significant invasive non-native plant species using scientific and management-based criteria. The Cooperative Research Centre for Australian Weed Management has been involved in the process being undertaken by the Australian Weeds Committee that is considering methods to identify and allocate weeds to particular categories, including consideration of listings of Weeds of National Significance and environmental alert weeds.   The Australian Government has also made new funding available for weed research under its Defeating the Weed Menace fund. This includes rigorous prioritisation of weed species as a priority activity.

Recommendation 6


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth, in consultation with the states and territories, promulgate regulations under section 301A of the EPBC to prohibit the trade in invasive plant species of national importance, combined with state and territory commitment to prohibit these same species under their respective laws. [see paragraphs 5.51, 5.107 and 8.22]

The Australian Government disagrees with Recommendation 6 (refer to Recommendation 7).
While the EPBC Act is one mechanism for the control of weeds that pose a threat to Australia’s biodiversity, the Australian Government considers that in the first instance states and territories should improve the management and control of weeds within their jurisdictions.

Recommendation 7


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth, in consultation with the states and territories, produce a list in legislation of taxa that prevents their sale and spread for each state or region. Nominations for each taxon on a state or regional basis can be developed in consultation with natural resource management agencies, state herbaria and members of the general public. [see paragraphs 5.51 and 8.23]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 7 to the extent it applies to listing selected invasive plant species in state and territory legislation.
Consistent with the National Weeds Strategy, the Australian Government is working, through the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, to identify and resolve weed issues at a national level. The strategy provides a national approach and framework to reduce the impact of weeds on the sustainability of Australia’s productive capacity and natural ecosystems, through the establishment of a number of goals, objectives for action and outcomes. This process will provide a cooperative approach to reduce the sale and trade of nationally significant weeds.
The former Australian Government Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator the Hon. Ian Macdonald, wrote to his state and territory counterparts in June 2005 noting that several plant species classified as Weeds Of National Significance (WONS) remained for sale in a number of states and territories. Responses by states and territories indicated that legislation to prevent the sale of all WONS was in place or was in the process of being implemented.  For almost all WONS, primary legislation has been enacted in all states and territories to prevent their sale.  There is one exception: in Victoria, three of the willow species are still under consideration for action.  It is expected that this outstanding issue will be resolved in 2007.

Recommendation 8


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government investigate the imposition of a ‘polluter pays’ principle where importers pay for the cost of control and repair should a plant become a weed. [see paragraphs 5.58 and 8.25]

The Australian Government disagrees with Recommendation 8.
The Australian Government has arrangements that minimise the risk of a potentially weedy plant/seed being imported into Australia and therefore minimise the risk of a potentially weedy plant/seed from establishing in the country. This includes the imposition of penalties under the Quarantine Act 1908 for those who import prohibited plants/seeds.
A successful ‘polluter pays’ system, designed to recover the cost of control and repair of the damage caused by a plant should it become a weed, is dependent on a number of conditions:
the ability to identify the source of pollution;
the ability to identify the polluter;
being able to establish causality between damage and polluting activity or action; and
the ability to determine, assess and redress damage from the weedy plant.

In the case of a weed incursion or establishment of a weed, it is very difficult to determine the original point source and therefore identify who is responsible. There are numerous possible pathways for entry to Australia, apart from deliberate and accidental importation by travellers and traders of plants or plant products that subsequently become weeds. These include migratory birds, ocean currents, and illegal fishing boats. There may also be a lengthy lag-time between the importation and identification of a plant as an invasive species, making trace-back and the establishment of causality to the source very difficult.
  


Recommendation 9


The Committee recommends that the National Weeds Strategy better clarify responsibility for funding eradication of ‘sleeper weeds’ with purely an environmental or social impact. [see paragraphs 5.33 and 8.29]

The Australian Government agrees with the objective of Recommendation 9. 
Clarity in funding responsibility for weed management is desirable.  However, the National Weeds Strategy is not an appropriate vehicle for this clarification, as it is a policy framework. Decisions on funding responsibilities would be better addressed through the Australia Weeds Committee and the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council.

Recommendation 10


The Committee recommends that investment in early warning systems be increased for the detection and eradication of sleeper weeds. [see paragraphs 5.32 and 8.30]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 10.
The Australian Government is involved in several initiatives to ensure nationally coordinated arrangements for the early detection, identification and eradication of Australia’s most serious weeds, including sleeper weeds.
The Australian Weeds Committee (AWC), established under the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, recently revised the National Weeds Strategy.  The revised strategy, the Australian Weeds Strategy, identifies opportunities for common approaches and linkages in agreed national policy responses for early detection and management of weeds.  The Australian Weeds Strategy is available at www.weeds.org and will be formally published in 2007.
In addition, the AWC has established a Weed Incursion Working Group which is designing a framework for dealing with all weed incursion issues including sleeper weeds. 
Research by the Bureau of Rural Sciences of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has identified up to 17 priority agricultural sleeper weeds for potential eradication.  The research is summarised in the 2006 report Managing the menace of agricultural sleeper weeds.  The research concluded that eradication is likely to be feasible for several potential sleeper weeds and these weeds are being considered for priority action through the AWC.

Recommendation 11


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government place on the agenda of the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, as a matter of urgency, the issue of progressing development of a national strategy for vertebrate pests. [see paragraphs 5.40, 5.48 and 8.32]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 11.
In 2004 the Vertebrate Pests Committee, under the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, established a working group that developed an Australian Pest Animal Strategy.  The Strategy mirrors the Australian Weeds Strategy. The Vertebrate Pests Committee released a discussion paper in January 2005 and held a stakeholder workshop in Brisbane in April 2005 to identify key issues and approaches.  The Natural Resources Management Ministerial Council approved the Strategy in April 2007.

Recommendation 12


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government take a lead role in ministerial councils and other appropriate forums to accelerate progress on the development, implementation and funding of a national system to deal with marine invasive species. [see paragraphs 6.123 and 8.37]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 12.
The Australian Government is taking a lead role in the development and implementation of the National System for the Prevention and Management of Marine Pest Incursions (National System) through the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, and in consultation with the Australian Transport Council. Significant progress has been made to accelerate the progress on the development, implementation and funding of the National System. 
All jurisdictions have agreed in principle to an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) for the National System.  The IGA has been signed by the Australian Government and the governments of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory.  New South Wales has indicated it has concerns with a population based formula for emergency management cost sharing and need more details on legislation and implementation cost before they will consider signing the IGA.  The IGA sets the high-level policy objectives for the National System and provides authority for development of the detailed implementation arrangements. It is based on and formalises the recommendations of the High Level Officials Group established under the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, and in consultation with the Australian Transport Council, regarding roles and responsibilities for legislation, governance and funding arrangements for the National System.
The Australian Government is leading the national coordination and is working with the states, the Northern Territory and relevant industry and conservation stakeholders to develop the National System. The recommendations of the High Level Officials Group and the IGA provide the basis for developing the detailed measures for the National System. 
On 27 May 2005, Australia signed, subject to ratification, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments 2004 (the Convention) that was developed through the International Maritime Organization.  The Convention aims to provide uniform international ballast water management arrangements for the shipping industry to protect the marine environment from pest incursions stemming from ballast water. For approximately fifteen years, Australia has been active in seeking the development of international measures for reducing the risks posed by introduced marine pests and diseases through ships’ ballast water.
The formal process for consideration of Australian ratification of the Convention includes completion of a national interest analysis, a regulation impact statement, consultation with relevant stakeholders and the development of any necessary domestic legislation by the Australian, state and territory governments.
Arrangements for ballast water management on journeys between Australian ports are being developed as part of the National System, including the necessary legislation and cost recovery measures, in consultation with the states, Northern Territory and industry. These arrangements will be given force by legislation in each of the states and Northern Territory that will follow model legislation described in the IGA (Victoria currently has its own legislation on ballast water). These arrangements will be consistent with the Convention and will be integrated with the existing management requirements for international ballast water under the Quarantine Act 1908. 
Additionally, mitigation measures are being developed to address biofouling risks in a number of industry sectors including fishing vessels, trading and non-trading commercial vessels, and the aquaculture industry. The measures will provide best practice management options for biofouling management of vessel hulls, gear and niche areas.
An emergency response framework has been developed under the Intergovernmental Agreement comprising a Consultative Committee on Introduced Marine Pest Emergencies (CCIMPE) and a National Management Group (NMG), which has the capability to oversee the response to a marine pest outbreak under the Emergency Marine Pests Plan (EMPPlan).  Such plans would usefully be supported by a defined process or assistance for integrating detailed operational guidelines and practical incident experience into existing Australian, state and territory government emergency management legislation. Such guidelines would assist in clarifying the roles and responsibilities of both government and non-government stakeholders, associated coordination networks and operational skills to effectively handle the specific problems encountered in an emergency marine pest outbreak.
The EMPPlan provides an agreed framework to guide emergency response actions. Emergency preparedness and response efforts in Australia are coordinated by the CCIMPE. The decision to activate the EMPPlan is based upon a trigger list of target species (CCIMPE Trigger List), however, the contingency is available to consider other marine pests that also meet relevant criteria to warrant an emergency response.  Cost sharing arrangements for emergency preparedness and response arrangements have been in place for three and a half years and have been formalised in the IGA. Under the cost-sharing arrangements for the Australian, state and territory governments, funding of eradication responses is divided 50:50 between the Australian Government and the states and Northern Territory governments. The contribution of each state/territory is to be calculated on a per capita basis. 
Under the National System, planning and implementation of prevention and management measures focusing on specific marine pest species will take place under individual National Control Plans for those species.  A National Control Plan for the Northern Pacific Seastar (Asterias amurensis), is already in operation.  In 2006 the Natural Resources Management Ministerial Council and the Australian Transport Council agreed to the development of National Control Plans for an additional five species.  
The Australian Government has provided $3.7 million to support the development of the National System over the three years to 2006-07 and over the same period has supplied an additional $4.5 million Natural Heritage Trust funding to provide the research and development necessary for the development of the National System.  The Australian Government has announced funding of  $14.8 million  from the Natural Heritage Trust  over the four years to 2010-11 to implement the National System.  An additional Natural Heritage Trust funding of $190,000 per year over two years (2006-07 and 2007-08) has been allocated specifically for the emergency preparedness and response component of the National System.
The Australian, state and Northern Territory governments agreed the key elements of the National System in October 2006.  Implementation plans, including development of legislation and agreement on funding, are currently being developed to enable the National System to be rolled out progressively over the next eighteen months.

Recommendation 13


The Committee recommends that, as a matter of urgency, the Commonwealth Government should develop programs to minimise the threat of invasive marine species entering Australia’s waters via hull fouling or as a result of the mariculture industries. [see paragraphs 6.100, 6.104 and 8.38]

The Australian Government agrees with the objective of Recommendation 13.
This issue is addressed under the National System for the Prevention and Management of Marine Pest Incursions (National System) that was described in the response to Recommendation 12. Development of the National System is being led by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and is being undertaken in collaboration with the states, Northern Territory, relevant Australian Government agencies, industry, conservation and research representatives through the National Introduced Marine Pests Coordination Group (NIMPCG). Managing biofouling (including hull fouling) risks is a key component of the National System.
Best practice protocols for the management of biofouling on all types of vessels have been developed through NIMPCG to reduce the rate of translocation of marine pests within Australian waters. The sectors addressed include fishing vessels, trading and non-trading commercial vessels, domestic recreational vessels, the aquaculture industry and petroleum and gas activities. The protocols will provide options for managing and treating biofouling of vessel hulls and niche areas such as sea chests, internal seawater systems, sea intake grates, bow tunnels, transducers, docking support block areas, propellers, shafts and rudders as well as fishing and aquaculture gear. The Natural Resources Management Ministerial Council and the Australian Transport Council agreed to the protocols for fishing vessels, trading and non-trading commercial vessels and domestic recreational vessels in 2006.
In order to address the risks posed by aquaculture and mariculture industries, best management practices are being developed in line with the National Policy on the Translocation of Live Aquatic Organisms (the National Policy). The National Policy was signed by all jurisdictions in 1999 and was adopted directly by most states and territories. Those jurisdictions which did not directly implement the National Policy have developed policies which are aligned with it. The National Policy addresses the potential translocation risks of live aquatic organisms within Australia primarily in aquaculture and the live bait, live seafood and aquarium trades.   
Supporting the progress on managing biofouling risks is the National System’s ongoing research and development program. A number of projects developed through and agreed by NIMPCG are currently underway to ensure that biofouling management measures effectively target marine pest risks:
Treatment of internal water systems project – investigating the development of an effective, efficient and environmentally sound treatment for internal seawater systems on international small vessels.
Commercial vessels risk assessments – assessment of niche areas, such as internal seawater systems, associated with commercial shipping and development of guidelines to minimise the introduced marine pest risks from biofouling of these areas.
Fishing project – information gathering and hazard analysis for the fishing industry to inform the development of best practice guidelines to manage the marine pest risks associated within the industry.  This involves an assessment of the risk of marine pest entrainment and translocation by the vessels, gear and practices of the fishing industry.
Aquaculture project – investigating managing marine pest translocation risks associated with niche areas of stock, equipment and infrastructure for the aquaculture industry to inform guideline development processes.

Protocols to minimise the risks of pests being brought to Australia as biofouling on small international vessels, such as yachts, and apprehended vessels, for instance suspected illegal entry vessels, have been developed.
 
 A voluntary compliance period commenced in October 2005 for relevant vessels before the introduction of mandatory requirements through legislation subordinate to the Quarantine Act 1908.
 
 A review of the voluntary period has been completed, and the protocol is being refined.
 
 Consultation with affected stakeholders on the legislation changes is underway.


Recommendation 14


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government should provide long-term funding for research aimed at identifying and combating marine invasive species, particularly those which may threaten marine parks such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and those that are in the ports of Australia’s trading partners and could be translocated to Australia. [see paragraphs 6.105 and 8.39]

The Australian Government agrees with the objective of Recommendation 14.
The Commonwealth Environment and Research Facilities (CERF) Programme is a five year $100 million Australian Government initiative which runs to 2009-10. The CERF Programme funds high priority research to support better management of public environmental assets. CERF is directing $40 million towards the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility (MTSRF) over five years. The MTSRF addresses environmental issues of national significance for the Great Barrier Reef, Torres Strait and the Wet Tropics, including the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. $1.3 to $1.5 million has been specifically identified under the MTSRF Programme for improving the understanding of the threat from invasive pests, their impacts upon ecosystems, and developing options for prevention and control.
The Australian Government has also allocated Natural Heritage Trust funding of $6 million over four years for research and development (R&D) to inform the progress of a National System for the Prevention and Management of Marine Pest Incursions (National System).
A key component of the National System is the provision of long-term funding for each element of the National System, including R&D, aimed at identifying and combating all invasive marine species. Funding will be provided by the Australian, state and territory governments, in addition to contributions from stakeholders and beneficiaries. 
As part of the development of the National System, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), supported by Natural Heritage Trust funding, has carried out risk assessments to identify the most threatening marine species based on economic, environmental and human health criteria. These species were selected from a CSIRO database of 1,593 marine and estuarine species that have been transported by anthropogenic activities or have invasion histories around the world. This work forms part of the ongoing strategy that supports the risk management approach of the National System and the development of each component, ensuring that decisions are scientifically based. In particular, the strategy aims to reduce the risk and thereby improve the cost to benefit ratio of marine pest prevention and management measures. The strategy also provides ongoing research to feed into the evaluation and review of the National System and its processes.
Ongoing research and development is a pivotal supporting component of the National System.  The Research and Development Strategy for the National System is in place to ensure that priorities are in line with the development of the National System.  Long-term funding is the responsibility of the Australian, and state and territory governments, added to by contributions from stakeholders and beneficiaries.

Recommendation 15


The Committee recommends that the Threat Abatement Process (TAP) be reviewed to enable threatening processes to be listed prior to threatened species reaching a critical stage. [see paragraphs 5.106 and 8.41]
The Australian Government agrees with the objective of with Recommendation 15.
Implementation of Threat Abatement Plans is an important means of abating the impacts on threatened species but this process needs to be considered within the broader range of actions undertaken by the Australian Government and others to protect threatened species. 
State and territory governments have primary responsibility for land management, including invasive species control and biodiversity conservation. The Australian Government considers its role is to provide leadership on issues of national significance. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the Act) reflects this in its focus on matters of national environmental significance, such as nationally threatened species.
The Australian Government acknowledges the importance of preventing species reaching threatened status, and has therefore led the development and adoption of a range of national policies to prevent the decline of species, particularly to support maintenance of habitat. The Australian Government has also provided considerable support for on-ground biodiversity conservation projects through the Natural Heritage Trust since 1996.
In addition, the Australian Government has supported the development and implementation of national Threat Abatement Plans for key threatening processes. The absence of a key threatening process listing or a Threat Abatement Plan does not prevent the Australian Government acting promptly to address assessed threats. An example is the Australian Government’s 2004 commitment of $2 million to address Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumour Disease. Similarly, the Australian Government has provided over $14 million since 1996 towards finding solutions to address cane toads.
Under the Act (s188(4)), a threatening process that meets one or more of the following criteria is eligible for treatment as a key threatening process:
it could cause a native species or an ecological community to become eligible for listing in any category, other than conservation dependent; or
it could cause a listed threatened species or a listed threatened ecological community to become eligible to be listed in another category representing a higher degree of endangerment; or
it adversely affects 2 or more listed threatened species (other than conservation dependent species) or 2 or more listed threatened ecological communities.

The Act provides for the listing of key threatening processes (KTP) prior to threatened species reaching a critical stage. Criterion (a) provides for a threatening process to be eligible for listing as a KTP if it could cause a native species to become eligible for listing as threatened. It is not therefore necessary for the affected species to be eligible for listing, but demonstrable that the affected native species could become eligible for listing as threatened because of the threatening process.


Recommendation 16


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government act urgently to ensure that:

all listings on Schedule 5 of the Quarantine Proclamation 1998 are made by species, not genera;

a mechanism be developed to ensure that species identified as weeds of national significance are automatically removed from Schedule 5; and
all listings and applications for the import of plants and seeds be standardised using the scientific names of species. [see paragraphs 6.69 and 8.44]

The Australian Government agrees with the objective of Recommendation 16.

The Australian Government accelerated the review of the permitted seeds list (Schedule 5 of the Quarantine Proclamation 1998) to remove all genus level listings from the permitted seeds list and replace them with species level listings.
Biosecurity Australia undertook a two-staged approach to the accelerated review, which has enhanced further Australia’s favourable pest and disease free status by seeking to ensure that species not already present in Australia, and that have exhibited weedy characteristics overseas, are not permitted entry into the country. 
The first stage of the review was completed in 2005.  This involved the consideration of approximately 4,000 potentially weedy species for removal from Schedule 5 of the Quarantine Proclamation 1998.  Over 700 species were determined to be present and/or commonly traded in Australia and not under official control.  On 30 May 2005, Schedule 5 was amended to remove 3,335 species that were identified as being potentially weedy overseas and not present in Australia. 
The second stage of the review, which was completed in December 2006, involved the removal of 2,913 genus level listings previously on the permitted seeds list and replacing them with the species within those genera that were already present, and/or commonly traded, in Australia. 
Mechanisms already exist to ensure that seeds of a species identified as a Weed of National Significance (WONS) are not included on Schedule 5 of the Quarantine Proclamation 1998.  Seeds of species already present in Australia and under ‘official control’ (species which relevant governments have listed as noxious and for which governments have undertaken eradication actions or have ongoing management plans in place), including WONS, are excluded from Schedule 5 of the Quarantine Proclamation 1998. 
It is current Australian Government policy and practice that all plant listings in relevant legislation and applications made to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to import plant material use standard, internationally-recognised scientific nomenclature.

Recommendation 17


The Committee recommends that the import risk analysis process be modified to guarantee greater independence in their preparation. [see paragraphs 6.18 and 8.46]

There are two distinct mechanisms for analysing risks associated with imports undertaken by the Australian Government in relation to invasive species.
Firstly, Biosecurity Australia administers the Import Risk Analysis (IRA) process to address issues of quarantine interest or concern for species exotic to Australia.  The IRA process utilises a science-based risk assessment methodology to provide quarantine policy advice and recommendations to the Director of Quarantine (or delegate) regarding requests for the import of animals, plants and products.  This assessment is undertaken with complete independence from the proponent.  Decisions made by the Director of Quarantine involve the independent exercise of powers pursuant to the provisions of the Quarantine Act 1908.  The independence of the IRA process is explained clearly in the Import Risk Analysis Handbook, published by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in 2003. 
In July 2004, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced measures to further strengthen the independence of the IRA process and increase confidence in its administration. These included the establishment of Biosecurity Australia as an agency separate from the agricultural market access area of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and the appointment of an ‘Eminent Scientists Group’, to review independently final IRA draft reports.
In October 2006, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced reforms to the IRA process. The reforms will improve stakeholder consultation, further enhance independent scientific scrutiny and increase transparency. Timeframes for the compilation of IRAs will be regulated, improving timelines and predictability for stakeholders. The new system took effect in September 2007 following an update to  regulations made under the Quarantine Act 1908.
Secondly, the Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) undertakes an environmental risk assessment for applications to import live specimens.  DEW does not permit the import of a species that does not appear on the list of specimens considered suitable for live import (live import list) established under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Before a species can be added to the live import list the potential risk to the environment of that species is rigorously assessed.  Current practice involves preparation, by the proponent, of a report against agreed terms of reference, followed by a fully transparent and independent evaluation of that report. This evaluation includes opportunities for public and jurisdictional comment and expert input. In addition, the DEW conducts its own analysis of the proponent’s report, which includes the use of the Bureau of Rural Science’s risk assessment models.
The Department of the Environment and Water Resources has, over the past two years, undertaken measures to further strengthen the independence of its environmental risk assessments for the import of live species. Working with the Bureau of Rural Sciences, DEW has developed a number of quantitative risk assessment models to guide its assessment of the potential risk that exotic species may establish in the Australian environment.

Recommendation 18


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth place on the agenda of the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council the need for arrangements to be implemented for environmental pest incursions in parallel with those currently in place for threats to primary industries. [see paragraphs 5.143 and 8.48]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 18 (refer to Recommendation 1).
The response to Recommendation 1 outlined that the Australian Government had taken a paper and recommendations to the April 2004 Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council on invasive species. The paper noted the opportunities for enhancing arrangements for addressing incursions of species with environmental impacts.
The Natural Resource Management and Primary Industries Ministerial Councils agreed that further enhancement of a national approach to managing biosecurity risks for primary industries and the environment would be progressed by a joint Natural Resource Management and Primary Industries Standing Committee Steering Group.  The recommendations from the Natural Resource Management Standing Committee Task Group on Invasive Species, and work undertaken by the Primary Industries Standing Committee in the development of a National Biosecurity Strategy, are forming the basis of the ongoing policy development.  One aspect of the enhancement of the Australian Biosecurity System for Primary Production and the Environment (AusBIOSEC) is the establishment of more formal biosecurity measures for invasive species that have predominantly environmental or social impacts.

Recommendation 19


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government take a leading role in relevant international forums to seek better recognition of the environmental consequences of invasive species, particularly in relation to current trade rules. [see paragraphs 6.22 and 8.51]

The principal thrust of Recommendation 19, that the Australian Government should engage in better recognition of the environmental consequences of invasive species, is noted.
The Australian Government is already active in a range of forums, including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) to improve surveillance and management of invasive alien species across international borders.
World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules allow for the adoption of measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health and relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources.  Moreover, recent WTO panel rulings have confirmed that countries can enact environmental measures even if they affect trade so long as they do not discriminate against producer countries as a disguised restriction on international trade.
Australia will continue to emphasise its commitment to promoting and enhancing the mutual complementarity of trade and environment, noting that this can and must be done in a way which recognises the integrity of the international system governing each.
Australia has also been at the forefront in seeking the development of international measures for reducing the risks posed by the introduction of exotic marine pests and diseases through ships’ ballast water.  The issue was first raised by Australia and embraced by the IMO in 1991.  An IMO Diplomatic Conference adopted the text of the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments in February 2004, partly reflecting Australia’s long-term efforts.  
Australia was a partner with Chile in a 2001-2004 APEC project to develop a Regional Management Framework for APEC economies for use in the control and prevention of introduced marine pests.  The 16th APEC Ministerial meeting, in Santiago, Chile in November 2004, agreed that “a shared awareness and understanding of the risks that invasive marine pests pose to regional growth and sustainability is urgently needed, along with coordinated regional action to help prevent their spread”.  The APEC ministers welcomed the progress on the development of the Regional Management Framework.

Recommendation 20


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government provide certainty of funding to research institutions, such as CSIRO and CRCs, to enable them to undertake long-term research projects. [see paragraphs 5.131 and 8.58]

The Australian Government agrees with the emphasis placed on long term research by Recommendation 20.
The ability of institutions like the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) to undertake long-term research projects is well supported by Government funding arrangements. CSIRO budget funding is committed on a continuing triennium basis providing a degree of certainty that supports planning and implementation of longer term projects. As part of Backing Australia’s Ability – Building our Future through Science and Innovation, the Australian Government also committed an additional $305 million funding to CSIRO over the  2004-05 to 2010-11 period to support the CSIRO Flagships programme.  In its science investment process CSIRO has recently indicated it will strengthen its focus on biosecurity.
The Cooperative Research Centres Programme provides up to seven years of funding to successful CRCs.  Successful CRCs are selected through competitive funding rounds held every two years.  Also, through Backing Australia’s Ability – Building our Future through Science and Innovation, the programme is guaranteed funding beyond 2010-11, including an additional $65 million over the six years from 2005-06.  Funding is included in the programme for a 2008 selection round.
The Australian Government’s support for Australian scientific research into environmental issues will be amplified through the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities (CERF) Initiative that commenced in the 2005-06 financial year. This initiative provides $100 million over five years to support research into public good environmental issues.  Of this total, $40 million has been allocated to the Marine and Tropical Science Research Facility to fund research to help sustain the health of North Queensland’s public environmental assets, which will include some funding of research for management of invasive species.  The balance of the CERF funding has been allocated nationally on a competitive basis. 
Funding for weeds research and development has been provided through the Defeating the Weeds Menace programme.  The focus of research, worth $5.4 million in the three years 2005-08, is to provide research and knowledge management to support the Defeating the Weeds Menace programme and to complement existing research on invasive weeds.
The primary emphasis of the Natural Heritage Trust is on the delivery of resource condition outcomes; Trust investments have supported scientific research where this, in turn, provides for such outcomes. However, Trust investments are applied against 10 areas of activity under the Framework for the Extension of the Trust agreed to by the Australian, state and territory governments. The scope of these demands means that the Trust’s capacity to contribute to certainty of funding for scientific research is limited.

Recommendation 21


The Committee recommends that, under the National Heritage Trust [sic], the Commonwealth Government initiate, develop and deliver national community education campaigns on invasive species. [see paragraph 8.71]

The Australian Government agrees with the objective of Recommendation 21.
The Australian Government recognises the importance of national community education campaigns in building public awareness of invasive pest issues. As the Inquiry noted, the Government has supported similar campaigns under the Natural Heritage Trust, including a grant to the CRC for Australian Weed Management to develop a web-based community information system. Community education programs also form an important element of the Government’s $44.4 million commitment to Defeating the Weed Menace, announced in the 2004 election campaign.   This initiative, which commenced in the 2004-05 financial year, is a four-year programme targeting Australia’s most serious and invasive weeds.
However, as noted in the response to Recommendation 20, the primary emphasis of the Natural Heritage Trust, and its companion natural resource management programs, is on the delivery of resource condition outcomes. While community education campaigns clearly contribute to these outcomes in many cases, a decision to allocate Trust funds to the initiation, development, and delivery of a campaign has to be balanced against the existing calls on Trust funds, and the support already provided through both the Trust and other Australian Government programmes for campaigns that address invasive species and related issues. These considerations weigh against sourcing a community education campaign on invasive species solely from Trust funds at this stage.
The Australian Government will await the outcomes of the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council’s consideration of the further development of a national approach to invasive species management and the development of the National Pest Animal Strategy. These strategic processes, together with the recently revised Australian Weeds Strategy, will provide context for determining the need for national community education campaigns, and the Australian Government’s role in any such campaigns.

Recommendation 22


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government provide the relevant curriculum materials to enable invasive species to be included in relevant schools program across Australia. [see paragraph 8.72]

The Australian Government agrees with the objective of Recommendation 22.
The Australian Government currently funds a range of initiatives to raise awareness of invasive species in the community, such as the development of weeds lesson activities and worksheets for use in schools, and the development of interactive games to teach children about weeds.
As part of the Community and Industry engagement component of the Defeating the Weed Menace programme, work will be commissioned to further develop relevant curriculum material for use in schools throughout Australia.

Recommendation 23


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government continue to provide support through the NHT and Envirofund to community groups that deliver education and awareness campaigns. [see paragraph 8.73]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 23.
The Australian Government has supported education and awareness campaigns through the Envirofund and through the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) generally. However, this support has proceeded on the basis that these campaigns are a necessary adjunct to achieving resource condition outcomes. One of the minimum matters for which regional resource condition targets must be set under the regional stream of the NHT includes ‘ecologically significant invasive species’. Where a region has set such a target and considers that investment in education and awareness will significantly contribute to achievement of the target, it may submit a proposal for investment under its regional investment strategy. Australian and relevant state and territory governments will jointly consider funding such proposals alongside other funding priorities within regional investment strategies. Community groups may apply directly to the Australian Government Envirofund to fund education and awareness projects. There is a requirement to demonstrate clear environmental benefits and outcomes. 

Recommendation 24


The Committee recommends that all tiers of government immediately commit to an eradication program for all WONS and all locally significant invasive species within their formal plantings. [see paragraph 8.75]

The Australian Government disagrees with Recommendation 24.
The Australian Government is committed to the management of Weeds of National Significance (WONS) as a national weed management priority. As all WONS are now established, it is not economically viable to eradicate any of them nationally. Through the Australian Weeds Committee management options for WONS are focused on minimising their impacts and containing their spread, including with biological control agents where available.
The Australian Government manages weed problems on its own land and in cooperation with other land owners.

Recommendation 25


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth, states and territories, the Nursery and Garden Industry Association and other stakeholders, including conservation NGOs, establish a process under the proposed National Weeds Action Plan to examine the merits of a mandatory labelling scheme on invasive garden plants. [see paragraphs 5.76 and 8.77]


Recommendation 26


The Committee recommends that the nursery and gardening industry give consideration to labelling of all invasive plants which, while able to be sold legally, may have invasive characteristics and should be managed responsibly. [see paragraphs 5.76 and 8.78]

The Australian Government agrees with the objectives of Recommendations 25 and 26.
The Australian Government though the Defeating the Weed Menace Programme is working with the gardening industry and other stakeholders to improve industry and community awareness of the impacts of invasive plants. 
A National Weeds Advisory Group (NWAG) has been established to help determine priorities for funding for this Programme.  The Group’s members include the Nursery and Garden Industry Association, National Farmers Federation, World Wildlife Fund for Nature and other stakeholders.  The Australian Government sought advice from NWAG on the issue of plant labelling (whether voluntary or mandatory).  NWAG concluded that while product labelling generally has merit as a method for providing information and is accepted by the community in other settings, it is not a suitable tool for engaging the nursery and garden industry to participate in achieving consumer awareness.  In the absence of agreed weed lists, the cost to the industry would currently be too great and the task of identifying which plants to label would be too complex.

Recommendation 27


The Committee recommends that gardening and lifestyle programs should be encouraged to include warnings about the appropriateness of the plants suggested on their shows. Such warnings could require an indication of the country of origin of the plant, the areas it is indigenous to, and whether it has proven invasive elsewhere. [see paragraphs 5.82 and 8.80]

The Australian Government agrees with Recommendation 27
A National Weeds Awareness Coordinator appointed under the Defeating the Weed Menace programme will assist in developing partnerships with the key gardening and lifestyle media to inform gardeners about the threat of weeds.
 Australian Government Response to the Senate Inquiry into Australian Forest Plantations

Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE INQUIRY INTO AUSTRALIAN FOREST PLANTATIONS


27 July 2007


BACKGROUND


Following a review of the strategy ‘Plantations for Australia: the 2020 Vision’ (the Vision) by the Private Forestry Consultative Committee (PFCC) in 2002, Senator the Hon Ian Macdonald, the former Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, requested a Senate Inquiry on 27 June 2002 to investigate the issues related to plantation forestry in Australia, taking into account the findings of the PFCC review.
 
 The Senate Committee for Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport (the Committee) tabled its report on 2 September 2004, which addressed the following terms of reference:


Taking into account the findings of the Private Forests Consultative Committee’s review of ‘Plantations for Australia: The 2020 Vision’ which is due to report to the Primary Industries Ministerial Council in November 2002:

whether there are impediments to the achievement of the aims of ‘Plantations for Australia: The 2020 Vision’ strategy;
whether there are elements of the strategy which should be altered in light of any impediments identified;
whether there are further opportunities to maximise the benefits from plantations in respect of their potential to contribute environmental benefits, including whether there are opportunities to:
better integrate plantations into achieving salinity and water quality objectives and targets;
optimise the environmental benefits of plantations in low rainfall areas, and
address the provision of public good services (environmental benefits) at the cost of private plantation growers;
whether there is the need for government action to encourage longer rotation plantations, particularly in order to supply sawlogs; and
whether other action is desirable to maintain and expand a viable and sustainable plantation forest sector, including the expansion of processing industries to enhance the contribution to regional economic development.

ISSUES

The Committee’s report makes 17 recommendations for both governments and industry, covering the themes of:
The area target of the Vision (3 million hectares by the year 2020)
The plantation prospectus industry and its role in achieving the Vision
Market information for plantation growers and investors
Enhanced public reporting requirements for the Plantations 2020 Vision Coordinator
Environmental benefits of plantations
Water and plantations
The Mandatory Renewable Energy Target legislation
Taxation incentives to encourage investment in long-rotation plantations
Three-year funding for Private Forestry Development Committees
The Australian Government response to the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement 5‑year Review.
The Australian Government’s response to these recommendations is outlined below. 

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE COMMITTEE’S RECOMMENDATIONS


Recommendation 1


3.35
 
 The Committee therefore recommends that the revised 2020 Vision be amended by deleting all references to trebling the acreage by 2020 or plantation acreage of 3 million hectares.
 
 This should be replaced with the target of increasing the acreage of plantation forests at a sustainable and economic level.

The Australian Government does not support this recommendation. 
The area target is an aspirational target that reflects the desire to establish a major plantation resource. 
The area target provides one objective measure of progress in achieving the Vision.  The Australian Government acknowledges that the area target is only one way of measuring whether the Vision is being achieved.  Major expansion of the plantation estate is not an end in itself; the Vision is about governments and industry working together to achieve new investment in plantations for economic, social and environmental outcomes on a sustainable basis.
The Australian Government will examine with industry the development of other appropriate indicators to add value to the area target in terms of social, economic and environmental outcomes.

Recommendation 2


3.40
 
 The Committee recommends that the government commission an independent assessment of how the plantation prospectus industry relates to the 2020 Vision, including an evaluation of prospectus assumptions against returns likely to be achieved.

The Australian Government supports the intent of this recommendation, but not the need for an independent assessment of matters such as prospectus assumptions.
Plantation prospectus companies have been the key driver in the large plantation expansion seen over the last 10 years.  These companies raised over $700 million in investor funds in 2005-2006 and are expected to continue to be a key driver of plantation expansion in the future.  The plantation prospectus companies are therefore integral to the success of the Vision.
Reducing land availability may limit the ability of plantation prospectus companies to expand in the future.  Another factor will be the size and maturity of each company’s resource, with many now about to harvest their oldest plantations and replant this land, reducing their need for new land.
The Corporations Act 2001 contains requirements governing the content and presentation of disclosure documents, such as prospectuses and Product Disclosure Statements, provided to investors and potential investors.  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) have also published guidance on its approach to the use of prospective financial information (including financial forecasts and projections) in disclosure documents (see ASIC Policy Statement PS 170: Prospective Financial Information issued 6/9/2002).
Under the Corporations Act, prospectuses and Product Disclosure Statements must be lodged with ASIC.  However, lodgement does not imply that ASIC has approved the contents of the document, or that forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based are reasonable.  Investors themselves must bear some responsibility to decide whether forecasted returns are realistic.
ASIC does, however, conduct targeted surveillance campaigns to test the quality of information in disclosure documents, such as the use of long-range financial forecasts.  Where ASIC considers that a disclosure document is defective (for example, because it contains misleading information), it has various powers, including the ability to issue a stop order preventing any subscriptions being received from investors until the defects in the disclosure document are rectified.
The Australian Government favourably views industry initiatives that promote increased investor confidence and protection in relation to afforestation investments, noting for example the Australian Forest Growers Disclosure Code for Afforestation Managed Investments and accompanying Investors’ Guide to Afforestation Investment.
However, the Government does not endorse any particular investment and stresses that information given to investors and potential investors must meet the requirements of the Corporations Act and any policy guidance issued by ASIC.

Recommendation 3


3.70
 
 The Committee recommends that research and other studies to be carried out under Action 5 of Strategic Element 2, relating to codes of practice to support sustainable plantation development be the subject of a separate public report by the Coordinator, to be presented to the Primary Industries Ministerial Council and Federal and State Parliaments.

The government response to this recommendation is provided under the heading ‘Grouped Recommendations concerning the Plantations Coordinator’.

Recommendation 4


3.101
 
 The Committee recommends that Action 9 under Strategic Element 3 be amended to include as an expected outcome the establishment of a Market Information Centre, based on the model of the current New Zealand body (or service), which will make available full
 
 and up-to-date information on current and projected prices and returns on various types of timber, including plantation timber.

The Australian Government supports this recommendation in principle, subject to industry willingness to take up this task.
The forest and wood products industry, with assistance from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, has developed a proposal to establish a company limited by guarantee under the Corporations Act 2001 that will replace the existing Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. The new company will undertake R&D and Marketing and Promotion. The legislation to enable this new company has recently passed through Parliament and it is expected to commence operations before the end of 2007. One function under the proposed company’s ‘marketing stream’ could be the provision of up-to-date market data, information and analyses.

Recommendation 5


4.29
 
 The Committee therefore recommends that funding for Private Forestry Development Committees (PFDCs) be made over a 3 year period, subject to the delivery of outcomes against Action 13 of the 2020 Vision for plantation forests.

The Australian Government supports the intent of this recommendation, noting that funding is subject to budget processes.
The Natural Heritage Ministerial Board has approved funding for PFDCs from the Natural Heritage Trust until June 2008.
The PFDCs are the Australian Government’s main vehicle for delivering plantation outcomes.  There are 19 PFDCs across Australia, funded equally by the Australian Government through the Natural Heritage Trust and relevant State governments.  The PFDCs are community-based groups that work with all levels of government, industry, regional bodies, landholders and the community to foster sustainable and responsible forest industry development.
The Australian Government’s view is that PFDCs play an essential role in engaging with Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs) and the wider community to support new plantation investment.  The regional natural resource management (NRM) investment framework and the CMAs who are responsible for implementing it will be important to success of the Vision.

Recommendation 6


4.31
 
 The Committee recommends that the following matters be included in any


report prepared by the Coordinator:


Actions under Strategic Element 4 be reported against expected outcomes with regard to involvement of stakeholders in achieving the Strategic Element goals. Each report by the Coordinator should provide detail of how stakeholders have been involved in each year’s goal achievement and a measure of stakeholders’ satisfaction.


Assessment or report on Actions – especially Action 13 under Strategic Element 4 – should give details of consultation, contact or involvement with local governments and Regional Catchment Management Authorities in achievement of expected outcomes under the Action.


Details of current and proposed reviews and/or studies of social and community responses to further plantation development to be conducted by the Bureau of Rural Sciences and other bodies such as the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation.

The government response to this recommendation is provided under the heading ‘Grouped Recommendations concerning the Plantations Coordinator’.

Recommendation 7


4.32
 
 The Committee recommends that research and other studies to be carried out under Action 13 of Strategic Element 4 (which involve consultation with Catchment Management Authorities) be the subject of specific report by the Coordinator.

The government response to this recommendation is provided under the heading ‘Grouped Recommendations concerning the Plantations Coordinator’.

Recommendation 8


5.38
 
 The Committee therefore recommends that the plantation industry establishes joint ventures to encourage research to examine the environmental benefits that may be delivered by plantation forests, particularly in relation to the availability of water, salinity and water quality, and plantations in low rainfall areas.

The Australian Government supports this recommendation.
These recommendations are not directed at the Australian Government. 
The Australian Government notes the Primary Industries Ministerial Council resolution No. 4.11 (October 2003), whereby Council agreed to “seek to identify key government and market-based instruments to leverage private investment and/or internalise environmental values in primary industry economic settings”.
The National Market Based Instruments Pilot Program, funded under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAPSWQ), recognises the role of incentives and cost sharing arrangements.
In addition, the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has completed the Commercial Environmental Forestry (CEF) project, in conjunction with CSIRO and the National Association of Forest Industries (NAFI), to develop a model for targeted public and private investment in plantation forestry to achieve environmental and commercial outcomes.
Other joint ventures between governments and industry for forestry research and development are already in place.  Examples are:
Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation (FWPRDC), which is funded jointly by the Australian Government and the forest and wood products industry,
Joint Venture Agroforestry Programme (JVAP) managed through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation.

Recommendation 9


5.39
 
 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth urgently funds the conduct of a water audit in both the mainland and Tasmania, to assess the impact of plantation forests on both water quantity and quality.

The Australian Government has already undertaken measures to address this recommendation.
The Australian Government has undertaken significant work to date in examining the impact of plantations on water resources through the BRS report titled ‘Plantations and Water Use’ prepared for FWPRDC, while research is continuing to be carried out through CSIRO Land and Water and other research organisations. 
BRS is currently undertaking a number of projects addressing the information requirements of the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) on a National Water Initiative.  This includes assessment of the significance of water intercepting activities on catchments and aquifers based on an understanding of the total water cycle, and helping monitor the progress of catchments and aquifers towards either full allocation or the threshold level of interception.
To complement the BRS work, The River Catchment Water Quality Initiative, a component of the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement, provided $1 million for a river catchment water quality initiative.  The first priority is to assess the impact of chemical use on water quality in Tasmania’s river catchments.  The program builds on State chemical audit and water monitoring programs to assess the impact of chemical usage in Tasmania’s water catchments.
Under the Australian Government Water Fund, Tasmania has received $2.5 million to implement the Enhancing Water Planning in Tasmania project.  With a contribution of $690,000 from the Tasmanian Government, the $3.19 million project focuses on the collection of critical information on water catchments throughout Tasmania.  Information gathered under Enhancing Water Planning in Tasmania will help water managers understand and predict the fluctuations of surface and groundwater resources, and will guide future water planning decisions.

Recommendation 10


5.40
 
 The Committee recommends that the government review the application of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) legislation as it applies to the plantation woody crop industry.

The Australian Government has already undertaken measures to address this recommendation.
An Independent Panel reviewed the MRET legislation in 2003 and provided its report, Renewable Opportunities, A Review of the Operation of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (The Act), to the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Hon Dr David Kemp on 30 September 2003. 
The MRET Report was tabled in Parliament on 16 January 2004.  The Government responded in the context of its Energy White Paper, Securing Australia’s Energy Future in June 2004.  The Government agreed with the independent panel’s recommendation to make it easier for plantations to qualify for Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and improve access for plantation biomass by broadening the definition of energy crops as an eligible energy source.  Legislative amendments required to enable these changes came into effect in September 2006.    
Subsequent regulatory amendments have broadened the definition of energy crops and removed the requirement for energy crops to be grown for the ‘primary purpose’ of producing energy.  This amendment allows plantations to be eligible as energy crops.  Further regulatory amendments to clarify the conditions for eligibility of plantation biomass are being developed.
Recommendation 11


6.36
 
 The Committee recommends that the government investigate the possibility of introducing a taxation incentive related to the period of time a plantation is grown, however urges the government to keep in mind the necessity for the industry to meet environmental goals without significant subsidies and tax benefits.

On 10 May 2005, the Government announced a review of the application of taxation law to plantation forestry in the context of the Government’s broader plantation and natural resource management policies.  The terms of reference for the review included consideration of ‘whether the operation of the Income Tax Assessment Acts impedes investment in longer term forest rotations which produce higher value products’.  The Government received public submissions, and also conducted targeted consultation with forest industry representatives.
On 29 May 2006 the Government announced proposed taxation arrangements for plantation forestry.  A further round of submissions and consultations occurred. 
On 21 December 2006, the Government announced new arrangements for the taxation of investments in forestry managed investment schemes (MIS).  The Government noted that the new arrangements will ensure the continued expansion of Australia’s plantation forestry estate, so reducing Australia’s reliance on native forests and on overseas imports.  The new arrangements also recognise the critical role plantation forestry plays in sequestering greenhouse gases.   
Under the new arrangements, from 1 July 2007, investors in forestry MIS will be entitled to immediate upfront deductibility for all expenditure provided that at least 70 percent of the expenditure is expenditure directly related to developing forestry (‘direct forestry expenditure’).  There will be an integrity rule requiring that arm’s length prices be used in determining the value of expenditure directly related to forestry.  The arm’s length prices for purchased services would include the normal profit margin that an arm’s length supplier would require. 
On 8 May 2007, the Government announced that, from July 1 2007, initial investors in a forestry MIS will be allowed to trade their interests once they have been held for a period of at least four years.  The four-year restriction will apply only to the initial investors in a scheme.  The measure will apply to interests in a pre-existing scheme, meaning that taxpayers who invested in a forestry MIS prior to 1 July 2003 will be able to trade their interests as of 1 July 2007.  The legislation also contains rules to provide tax symmetry between investors’ costs and proceeds and to minimise tax arbitrage.  
While eligibility for the statutory deduction is not related to the length of time a plantation is grown, the Government believes that secondary market trading in forestry MIS interests should encourage investment in both short and long rotation plantations as investors will no longer be required to hold their interests until harvest. 

Recommendation 12


8.205
 
 The Committee recommends that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, as a matter of urgency, finalise and publish the Commonwealth’s response to the Final Recommendations Report on the Inquiry on the Progress and Implementation of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (1997).

 See response to Recommendation 13 below.

Recommendation 13


8.206
 
 The Committee recommends that, within 12 months of the publication of the Commonwealth’s response to the Final Recommendations Report on the Inquiry on the Progress with Implementation of the Tasmanian Forest Agreement (1997), that this Committee conduct a review of operations under, and the enforcement of, the Forest Practices Code. The Committee should be able to seek expert advice in the conduct of its inquiry and the Committee would expect the immediate co-operation of both State and Commonwealth Governments. In the absence of full co-operation, the Committee foreshadows that it will recommend an immediate independent review with more compelling and drastic powers.

On 13 May 2005 Prime Minister John Howard and Premier Paul Lennon signed The Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement.  Under this Supplementary Agreement the Parties Agree:
To fully implement the actions recommended in the Report of the Inquiry on the progress with Implementation of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (2002), subject to the exception outlined in relation to Recommendation 4.5 of the Report. 
 The Commonwealth Government acknowledges the value of Threatened Species Listing Statements in providing interim direction for many rare and vulnerable Tasmanian species currently without Recovery Plans.
 
 However, under its current legislation, the Commonwealth cannot accredit such Statements as an alternative to Recovery Plans for threatened species.
 
 Recovery Plans will continue to be the mechanism for compliance with the Commonwealth 
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
; and,

That this Supplementary Agreement represents a full and final response to the Report.

Recommendation 14


9.24
 
 The Committee recommends Strategic Element 5 be amended to provide that the National Plantation Strategy Coordinator prepare an annual report detailing the plantation industry’s performance against the expected outcomes of each of the 14 principal Actions required by the 2020 Vision program.

The government response to this recommendation is provided under the heading ‘Grouped Recommendations concerning the Plantations Coordinator’.

Recommendation 15


9.25
 
 The Committee recommends that the National Plantation Strategy Coordinator’s annual report also indicate the extent of research and/or assessment work (and results) carried out by the Coordinator, industry and other agencies, applicable to plantation development.

The government response to this recommendation is provided under the heading ‘Grouped Recommendations concerning the Plantations Coordinator’.

Recommendation 16


9.26
 
 The Committee recommends that the National Plantation Strategy Coordinator’s report is presented to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and to the Minister for Environment and Heritage, and to the Ministers equivalent in each State.

The government response to this recommendation is provided under the heading ‘Grouped Recommendations concerning the Plantations Coordinator’.

Recommendation 17


9.27
 
 The Committee recommends that the National Plantation Strategy Coordinator’s report is tabled in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments within a month of the relevant Minister receiving it, so as to allow scrutiny by the parliament and the community of the achievement of 2020 Vision goals.

The government response to this recommendation is provided under the heading ‘Grouped Recommendations concerning the Plantations Coordinator’.

Grouped recommendations concerning the Plantations Coordinator


Recommendation 3


3.70
 
 The Committee recommends that research and other studies to be carried out under Action 5 of Strategic Element 2, relating to codes of practice to support sustainable plantation development be the subject of a separate public report by the Coordinator, to be presented to the Primary Industries Ministerial Council and Federal and State Parliaments.


Recommendation 6


4.31
 
 The Committee recommends that the following matters be included in any


report prepared by the Coordinator:

Actions under Strategic Element 4 be reported against expected outcomes with regard to involvement of stakeholders in achieving the Strategic Element goals. Each report by the Coordinator should provide detail of how stakeholders have been involved in each year’s goal achievement and a measure of stakeholders’ satisfaction.
Assessment or report on Actions – especially Action 13 under Strategic Element 4 – should give details of consultation, contact or involvement with local governments and Regional Catchment Management Authorities in achievement of expected outcomes under the Action.
Details of current and proposed reviews and/or studies of social and community responses to further plantation development to be conducted by the Bureau of Rural Sciences and other bodies such as the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation.

 The Committee recommends that the National Plantation Strategy Coordinator’s report is presented to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and to the Minister for Environment and Heritage, and to the Ministers equivalent in each State.


Recommendation 17


9.27
 
 The Committee recommends that the National Plantation Strategy Coordinator’s report is tabled in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments within a month of the relevant Minister receiving it, so as to allow scrutiny by the parliament and the community of the achievement of 2020 Vision goals.

The Australian Government supports these recommendations in principle.
The Plantations 2020 Vision Coordinator Project continues to be supported by the Australian Government, the State and Territory Governments and the national plantation industry representative organisations - the Australian Plantation Products and Paper Industry Council and Australian Forest Growers.  The Australian Government continues to work with the other partners of the Vision to determine reporting requirements for the Coordinator. The Coordinator Project published a ‘2020 Vision Progress Report Against Actions’ in April 2005 and is in the process of preparing the 2007 update.
The Plantations Vision 2020 Coordinator’s annual report has primarily focussed on financial acquittal and activities undertaken for approval of the Vision partners via the Private Forestry Consultative Committee.
The practicality of Ministers tabling within a month of receiving reports would need to be examined.
There is merit in reports of the Plantations Vision 2020 Coordinator including where possible, information on research being undertaken as a means of disseminating this in a coordinated fashion, within the resources of the coordinator to undertake the task.  The Australian Government notes there are likely to be resourcing issues for the Vision partners in terms of funding should the Coordinator’s reporting requirements be expanded. 

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE INQUIRY INTO AUSTRALIAN FOREST PLANTATIONS


MINORITY REPORTS


SENATOR SHANE MURPHY


Recommendation 1


The Government must take steps to require the Australian Taxation Office to bring forward taxation measures that will allow for continuous trade in plantation timber.

This recommendation is addressed in the main response to Recommendation 11.

SENATOR BOB BROWN


Recommendation 1


Abolish special deductions for plantation establishment by managed funds (12 Month prepayment rule).

As mentioned in the response to Recommendation 11, the Australian Government has decided to introduce a specific statutory deduction for contributions to forestry managed investment schemes, provided the relevant requirements are met (including that at least 70 per cent of the expenditure is expenditure directly related to developing forestry).  Therefore, the Australian Government does not support this recommendation. 

Recommendation 2


Ensure that private sector investment in hardwood plantations is not commercially undermined by state government subsidies on chip logs from native forests.

While the Australian Government recognises the importance of equitable conditions for public and private forestry business operations, there is no evidence that the price of native forest pulpwood is affecting investment in hardwood plantations. Therefore, the Australian Government does not support this recommendation. 

Recommendation 3


That the Commonwealth act to bring Tasmania into line with other jurisdictions by prohibiting broad-scale clearing of native vegetation for plantation establishment.

Under the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement, signed on 13 May 2005 by the Prime Minister and the Tasmanian Premier, the Australian and Tasmanian Governments have agreed on an approach to phasing out broad scale clearing and conversion of native forest in Tasmania.  Clearing and conversion of state owned native forests will be phased out over 5 years and over 10 years on private land. A cap on clearing or conversion of native forest on both private and public land will be established to retain 95% of the 1996 area of native forest.  On 3 July 2007 Forestry Tasmania announced that conversion of native forest to plantations would cease immediately on Crown land. In addition, Gunns Limited, Tasmania’s largest private forest owner also announced an immediate end to native forest conversion on its properties.

Recommendation 4


That the Commonwealth Ministers for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Environment and Heritage commission an independent review of Tasmania’s forest management system, with the power to subpoena witnesses and evidence; it should be completed within 12 months.

Authority over the management of Tasmanian state-owned and privately-owned forests rests primarily with the legislature of Tasmania.  The Commonwealth’s primary involvement in forestry management by Tasmanians is through contractual agreements and undertakings with the Tasmanian Government and in particular, the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement and its supplementary agreement, the Tasmanian Community Forests Agreement.  The accountability of the Tasmanian Forest Practices System has already been reviewed through the 5-year review of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (the Tasmanian Community Forests Agreement represents a full and final response to the 5-year review).  The Australian Government is committed to supporting the RFA and to working within RFA processes with all stakeholders.  The Australian Government is committed to supporting the RFA going forward, including the review process set out in the Agreement. Therefore, the Australian Government does not support this recommendation. 

Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade


Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee


Government response to the report on Australia’s relationship with Malaysia


Recommendation 1

The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry promote in international fora the adoption of a transparent and efficient international Halal standard.
In Australia, Halal red meat production for export is governed by the Australian Government Muslim Slaughter Program (AGMS).  The Government and industry considers the AGMS to be both a transparent and efficient Halal standard when included in an establishment’s Approved Arrangement.
As Australia’s Halal red meat export program, the AGMS is incorporated into the arrangements of all Halal exporting red meat establishments.  The AGMS is underpinned by legislation and Australian Government involvement, through the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS).  These aspects contribute to the transparency and efficiency of the AGMS and assist in assuring Australia’s Halal export markets of the integrity of the system.
AQIS introduced the AGMS program in 1983 to underpin the production of Halal meat and meat products.  The AGMS is controlled by legal requirements in the Export Control (Meat and Meat Products) Orders under the Export Control Act 1982, and applies to red meat, edible offal and meat products.
The AGMS program has a number of elements to ensure the integrity of Halal products, including the inspection of establishments by both AQIS and an approved Islamic organisation.  Only approved Islamic organisations can certify Halal red meat and meat products for export.  AQIS maintains a list of all approved Islamic organisations responsible for the provision of Halal inspection, supervision and certification services for red meat and meat products and the specific countries they are listed for.  In addition, Halal red meat for export receives an official Halal meat certificate co-signed by AQIS and a recognised Islamic organisation.
The AGMS is an international Halal standard accepted by the majority of Australia’s Halal export markets.  Some countries, such as Malaysia, have requirements in addition to the AGMS.  The Government considers that these requirements should be addressed on a case by case basis in consultation with industry.  In such cases, industry has a commercial choice of whether or not to meet additional requirements in order to export to a particular market.
The AGMS is promoted widely in international markets by both industry and the Department.  For example, AQIS promotes the AGMS and its associated legislation to visiting government officials from Australian Halal export markets such as Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Brunei.
Australian industry, through the Australian Meat Industry Council (AMIC) and Meat and Livestock Australia, actively promotes the AGMS program, including in international fora.  An example is AMIC’s recent presentation on the AGMS at the World Halal Forum held 7-8 May 2007 in Malaysia.

Recommendation 2

The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in consultation with interested parties, provide options to the Minister for developing a single Halal certifying body within Australia.  The operations of the certifying body should conform to the principles of transparency and accountability.
The Government and red meat industry does not support this recommendation.  It is important that industry has a choice of approved Islamic organisations to facilitate the Halal certification of red meat and meat products under the AGMS program, including those establishments located in regional and remote areas.
In Australia there are a number of Islamic organisations that are approved by AQIS to certify Halal red meat and meat products for export, including in each state.  Some Islamic organisations are listed for specific countries, where this is a requirement of the Islamic authority of that importing country.
Having a number of approved Islamic organisations provides the Australian red meat industry with the flexibility and choice to work with a religious certifier it has a constructive working relationship with and that is in proximity to its place of business.
In addition, the development of a single Halal certifying body within Australia risks creating a potentially unfair and uncompetitive monopoly situation and would be inconsistent with the current legislation that underpins the AGMS program.

Recommendation 3

The Department of Immigration and Citizenship review:
the reasons for the increase in Malaysian overstayers; and
the reasons for the increase in the number of Malaysian passport holders being refused entry to Australia.
The Department should report to the Minister, providing strategies, with associated performance targets, for addressing the problem.
The Department has commenced a project to analyse the overstayer cohort to better target prevention and enforcement strategies. These strategies will focus on those offshore agents and onshore labour suppliers who support the entry of illegal workers to Australia, including Malaysian nationals. The Employer Sanctions legislation which commenced on 19 August 2007 makes it an offence to knowingly or recklessly employ or refer a person without authority to work in Australia. This is expected to deter the employment of people without work rights and act as a significant disincentive for a person to overstay their visa.
The Department regularly reviews compliance with Australian immigration law, with the aim of preventing and deterring breaches. The Department reports to the Minister, and to the Parliament through the Annual Report, on performance in this area.

Norfolk Island Act 1979
 (Cth) provides for the Administrator to appoint an auditor, for the auditor to report annually, for the speaker to table the auditor’s report and for the Administrator to forward this report to the Minister for Territories.


Recommendation 15


That subsection 8 (2), 
Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951
 (Cth) be amended to require the Federal Parliament’s Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts and Audit to examine the financial affairs of the Administration of Norfolk Island and review all reports of the Commonwealth Auditor-General on the Administration of Norfolk Island.

 (Cth) be amended to require the Norfolk Island Government to report annually to the Legislative Assembly within three months of the 
end of each financial year, and that:

Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978
).

, provides that the Administrator can end the terms of members of the Legislative Assembly by calling a general election and setting an election date (subsections 33 and 35).
 
 If the Administrator does not consider the subject matter being dealt with under subsections 33 and 35 to be a Schedule 2 matter, then those powers must be exercised in accordance with the Minister for Territories’ instructions.


However, if the Administrator does consider the exercise of subsections 33 and 35 powers for calling of elections and setting the date to be related to Schedule 2 matters, then these powers would need to be exercised in accordance with advice, if any, given by the Norfolk Island Executive Council.

Government Response to Report 81 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties

The Government thanks the Committee for its consideration of the treaties tabled, and gives the following responses to the Committee’s recommendations:

Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Transfer of Nuclear Material and Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the People’s Republic of China for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy


Recommendation 1

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government provide funding for intensive research and development in the area of energy generation using thorium reactors with the purpose of comparing its waste and energy generation capacity to conventional nuclear reactors.
The strategy includes a firm commitment to Australia’s participation in the Generation IV advanced nuclear research program.  The Government notes that a number of thorium reactor research projects have been conducted in several countries, but none of these projects has yet been brought successfully to mature commercialisation.  The thorium fuel cycle seems unlikely to be competitive against the uranium fuel cycle in the foreseeable future and the thorium fuel cycle is not included in the suite of reactor technologies under consideration by the Generation IV reactor research program.  The level of funding required for a national thorium power reactor R&D program would be very substantial, and this funding would have to be re‑directed from other areas.  For these reasons, the Government has no plans to fund intensive R&D in thorium power reactors.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government through its membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) calls for an urgent review of the IAEA’s funding requirements and that Australia sets a lead by increasing its voluntary contributions and lobbies other governments to do likewise
Australia supported the decision by the IAEA General Conference in September 2003 to increase the IAEA’s safeguards budget by approximately twenty per cent.  Australia was one of the first countries to provide support to the IAEA’s Nuclear Security Fund, and made further contributions totalling approximately $560 000 in 2006-07.  Australia consistently pays its annual share of the IAEA’s voluntary Technical Cooperation Fund.  Through its participation in the IAEA’s Programme and Budget Committee (a sub-committee of the Board of Governors), Australia plays an active role in reviewing the status of the IAEA’s budgeting and expenditure processes.  As a leading advocate of IAEA safeguards as an essential element of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, the Government will continue to monitor the IAEA’s funding requirements to carry out its mandated activities.  Further, during 2005-06 additional contributions in the form of research, assistance and consultancy services were made through the Australian Safeguards Support Program (ASSP) to the value of $457 146.  ASSP has been in existence for 26 years and is on-going.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government lobbies the IAEA and the five declared nuclear weapons states under the NPT to make the safeguarding of all conversion facilities mandatory.
Uranium conversion is not a primary point of proliferation concern, even less so in respect of nuclear-weapon states (NWS).  The IAEA has not made safeguarding of conversion facilities in NWS a priority.  Safeguarding of conversion facilities in NWS would not be an effective use of limited international safeguards resources.  The safeguards resource requirements would be substantial since most conversion facilities do not incorporate design features to facilitate application of safeguards.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government increases funding allocated to the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office’s safeguards support and international outreach programs to ensure that effective safeguards are being applied in regard to the treaties.
In 2006 the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office (ASNO) received supplementary funding of $1.4 million for a four year program dealing with nuclear security and counter-terrorism activities.
4 million for a four year program dealing with nuclear security and counter-terrorism activities.
Chinese officials regularly take part in ASNO’s training activities and have been invited to take part in an ASNO initiative to develop a regional safeguards association.

Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government continue its dialogue with the Chinese Government about governance and transparency issues with a view to the Australian Government offering practical support where appropriate.
Issues of press freedom raised in evidence to the inquiry, together with other human rights concerns that touch on issues of transparency and governance, are a regular subject of discussion in our annual human rights dialogue with China.  These issues are also raised regularly in high-level meetings.  Realistic about the capacity of dialogue alone to effect change, the Government recognises also the importance of developing and implementing practical measures to assist China to improve its governance regime, including corporate governance.  Australia’s current Development Cooperation Program in China is focused on efforts to improve governance and transparency in China, with a governance program worth $20.3 million between 2004 and 2010.

Recommendations 6 and 7

The Committee supports the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Transfer of Nuclear Material and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.
The Committee supports the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the People’s Republic of China for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.
These two Agreements came into force on 3 February 2007.

Government Response to Report 84 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties

The Government thanks the Committee for its consideration of the Agreement between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Framework for Security Cooperation (Lombok Treaty), and provides the following responses to the Committee’s recommendations:

Recommendation 1

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to address widely expressed concerns about human rights in Indonesia with the Indonesian Government and in appropriate international fora.
The Australian Government continues to register with the Indonesian Government at the highest levels the importance of upholding its commitment to an open, tolerant and pluralist society.  Australia strongly supports the Indonesian Government’s commitment to ensuring the human rights of all Indonesians are respected.
Australia has a strong track record of representations in urging the Indonesian Government to investigate alleged human rights abuses.
Through its development cooperation program, the Australian Government is making a practical contribution to strengthen the capacity of the Indonesian Government and civil society institutions to promote legal reform and the protection of human rights.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government increase transparency in defence cooperation agreements to provide assurance that Australian resources do not directly or indirectly support human rights abuses in Indonesia.
Australia has no defence cooperation agreements with Indonesia.
Defence is subject to a high degree of transparency, scrutiny and accountability in its defence engagement activities with Indonesia.  Authoritative information on Australia’s Defence Cooperation Program with Indonesia is available from a wide variety of sources.  Information on defence engagement activities and policy priorities of counter-terrorism, maritime security, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and governance, can be found in Defence strategic policy publications, such as successive Defence White Papers and Defence Updates, and ministerial and departmental speeches. The Minister responds to concerns raised in correspondence, which is an avenue open at all times to the members of the public, interest groups and Members of Parliament.  Senate Standing Committee hearings provide a further mechanism for accountability and transparency of the Defence Cooperation Program with Indonesia.  Official responses to Parliamentary Committees (most recently the public hearings of the JSCOT on the Lombok Treaty) make clear that we limit our cooperation to exclude those people we know to have been involved in serious human rights abuses.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government encourage the Indonesian Government to allow greater access for the media and human rights monitors in Papua.
The Australian Government raises regularly with Indonesia the importance of access to Papua for credible observers with appropriate visas.  A recent visit to Papua by the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders, Hina Jilani, was a welcome step in allowing access by the international community.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government engage in a campaign to increase public support for the Australia – Indonesia relationship. This campaign would have the goal of increasing awareness of the democratic reforms in Indonesia and the value to Australian security of strong relations with Indonesia.
The Australian Government will continue to foster greater understanding within Australia of developments in Indonesia, including democratic reforms and the value to Australian security of a strong relationship with Indonesia.
The Australia-Indonesia Institute has proved to be an effective tool in raising such awareness by promoting mutual understanding and increased contact between the people of Australia and Indonesia.  The Institute’s media programs encourage Australian journalists to report on Indonesia, including by exploring current issues in greater depth.  The Institute also aims to increase knowledge about Indonesia within Australia through people-to-people contact, especially among current and future opinion makers.  It achieves these goals through its regular exchange programs, which include the Australia-Indonesia Youth Exchange Program and the Muslim Exchange Program. 
The Australian Government will continue to explore further opportunities to enhance domestic awareness of the importance of the bilateral relationship.

Recommendation 5

The Committee supports the Agreement between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Framework for Security Cooperation (Mataram, Lombok, 13 November 2006) and recommends binding treaty action be taken.
The Australian Government is committed to bringing the treaty into force at an early date.  The Government understands that the treaty needs to be considered by Commission I (Defence, Foreign Affairs, Communication and Information) of the Indonesian Parliament.  The treaty will come into force following an exchange of diplomatic notes with the Indonesian Government stating that our respective national treaty ratification processes have been completed.
Dissenting Report
At the JSCOT public hearings on 26 February and 30 April 2007, the Government gave evidence on the matters raised in the dissenting report.

Government Response to the Supplementary Report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission “Inquiry into the trafficking of women for sexual servitude” released in August 2005


Introduction

People trafficking is a morally offensive and pervasive form of transnational crime and will not be tolerated in Australia. The Government remains committed to fighting this crime and has allocated a further $38.3 million over the next four years to the Whole of Government Strategy to Combat People Trafficking (the Strategy). The measures contained in the Strategy address the full trafficking cycle from recruitment to reintegration, and lend equal weight to the critical areas of prevention, prosecution and victim support.
In June 2003, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission (the Committee) commenced an inquiry into the work of the Australian Crime Commission in assessing trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual servitude in Australia. The Committee released its report in June 2004 and the Government’s response was tabled in 2006.
In June 2005, the Committee decided to revisit the issue of people trafficking and evaluate the progress of the implementation of its recommendations.  The Committee released a supplementary report in August 2005.  The Committee made three recommendations, which are addressed below.

RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS


Recommendation 1

The Committee recommends that the ACC continue its involvement in law enforcement on strategies against sexual servitude and trafficking in women.

Response:

Accepted.
In October 2003, the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) Board authorised a People Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation (PTSE) special intelligence determination. The primary aim of the PTSE determination was to contribute to law enforcement and government understanding and knowledge of issues relating to PTSE activity nationally.
Although the PTSE determination ceased operation on 30 September 2006, the ACC continues to gather information relating to PTSE through its intelligence gathering processes.  If a need to use coercive powers is identified this would be requested through ACC Board processes. The ACC’s coercive powers have been an important tool in gathering intelligence and identifying new lines of inquiry.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that a review of the new legislation take place a year after its implementation, and as part of that review, consideration be given to amendments to include the provision to the court of victim impact statements specific to these offences, similar to those contained in the NSW Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004.

Response:

Accepted in part.
The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Act 2005 inserted new trafficking-related offences into the Criminal Code that comprehensively criminalise trafficking in persons activity, fulfilling Australia’s legislative obligations under the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.  The Act came into force on 3 August 2005.
The new provisions provide a broad range of people trafficking-related offences for investigators and prosecutors to pursue.  While it is too early to undertake a formal review of the legislation, the Government will continue to monitor the offences to ensure they remain an effective deterrent to such conduct.
The Government is reviewing the use of victim impact statements as it considers its response to the Australian Law Reform Commission Report 103  - Same Crime, Same Time:  Sentencing of Federal Offenders.  The Report includes a number of recommendations on the use of victim impact statements which must be considered in the context the broader approach to federal sentencing.  This includes whether any legislative provision for the use of victim impact statements should apply more generally, beyond offences related to trafficking in persons.
Under existing arrangements, the impact that a Commonwealth offence has on victims can be taken into account by the Court when sentencing the offender.
The Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) provides that the personal circumstances of the victim and any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence must be taken into account when determining the sentence to be imposed on a federal offender (paragraphs 16A(2)(d) and (e)).
Commonwealth law also picks up State and Territory provisions regarding victims’ interests.  All States and Territories have legislative provisions or court rules providing for the interests of victims to be taken into account in sentencing.

Recommendation 3
 

The Committee recommends that the ANAO consider undertaking an evaluation of the results of the National Action Plan, after three years of operation.

Response:

The Auditor-General develops an Audit Work Program (AWP) annually which is published in July each year.  In developing the AWP, the Auditor-General pays high regard to the input of parliamentary committees. Having regard to the work already done on the subject of sex workers in Australia in Audit Report No. 7, 2006-2007, “Visa management: Working Holiday Makers, and other priorities”, the Auditor-General decided in June 2007 to carry out a Performance Audit of the National Action Plan early in 2008-2009.

Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security

Review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Sunna, JeM, LeJ, EIJ, IAA, AAA and IMU as terrorist organisations

Tabled 12 June 2007


Government Response to Committee’s Recommendation


Recommendation 1:

The Committee does not recommend the disallowance of the regulations made to proscribe the following organisations:  Ansar al-Sunna, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Islamic Army of Aden, Asbat al-Ansar and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.

Response:

The Government agrees with the recommendation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,32,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-13,"—Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the government response to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee report on invasive species entitled Turning back the tide: the invasive species challenge: report on the regulation, control and management of invasive species and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Invasive Species) Bill 2002.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
As the Minister for Community Services said when he tabled this document, there are 10 government responses to committee reports that have all just been tabled at once. If we do not speak to those documents straightaway they will be put off to the netherworld of even later on Thursday evenings, and I suspect these particular responses will probably not be debated before the election, so I want to speak to at least a couple of them.
I particularly want to speak to the response from the government to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts inquiry into invasive species. The report, which contained 25 unanimous recommendations—cross-party, constructive, non-partisan proposals to deal with the very serious environmental and economic challenge of invasive species such as weeds and other things—was tabled in this chamber on 8 December 2004. It has taken the government nearly three years to respond to that Senate committee report.
I am pleased with most of the response now that it has appeared. There are only three recommendations that the government have rejected out of the 25. Some of the others they have accepted in principle or have accepted the thrust of but have indicated other ways of achieving similar goals. That does not mean that the government have only just now started to act on those 22 things that they have agreed with; they have been doing those things. But it reinforces to me the growing degree of contempt that the federal government have. I know there have been a couple of ministers in the environment portfolio over that period of time, but there is no excuse for taking three years to respond to a report that has only 25 recommendations. Some of them were substantial and detailed recommendations but not that complex. The issue is complex—it is very difficult tackling invasive spaces—but the recommendations were not that complex.
To take almost three years to provide a response to the committee shows contempt for the Senate and for the committee. Even worse, in my view, it shows contempt for the many people who contributed to this inquiry. This inquiry was not some political stunt. It was a very considered, detailed and comprehensive inquiry into what is a very important issue. The threat to Australia’s environment posed by invasive species such as weeds is regularly cited as being in the top two or three environmental threats. It is not as glamorous as the crown of thorns starfish or whaling. Whether or not a particular type of grass is running wild or a type of weed has got into some remote national park or escaped from pastoral land into a national park is not as glamorous, but it is certainly as serious. Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity, and that includes marine environments, where they are even more likely to be neglected because they are less likely to be seen.
The fact that this is not glamorous does not mean it is not important. It is also a massive economic danger, both in the marine environment and on land. It costs billions of dollars a year in agricultural production in particular, as well as in lost economic opportunities. So it is a very serious issue. To take three years to respond is unsatisfactory. There were 78 submissions to this inquiry, many of them very comprehensive. There were four public hearings held in different parts of the country. It is very disappointing, frankly, that the response has taken so long.
I will go to the substance of the government response. As I said, it does agree with 22 of the 25 recommendations. There has been some progress in this area at federal level, as well as at state level. There has been some increased cooperation between the federal government and the states and territories since that time. That was a message that came out through the evidence provided to the committee during its hearings and in its report. I should emphasise that the inquiry was initiated by the Democrats. It was chaired by former Queensland Democrats Senator John Cherry, who, as people may know, now heads up the Queensland Farmers Federation and works on some of the issues that were identified in this report.
The committee considered, amongst other things, a private senator’s bill of mine that sought to put up a legislative proposal to assist in dealing with invasive species. The committee rejected my legislation as a suitable way forward. I have coped with that rejection. I can live with it. But I cannot cope and live quite so comfortably with the fact that the government has taken three years to respond to the recommendations in the committee report.
There were three recommendations the government did not agree to. They did not agree to recommendation 8 in terms of its practical applicability. As for their reasons for not agreeing with recommendation 24, I can see why they were put forward. I am disappointed that they disagreed with recommendation 6, which recommended that the Commonwealth, in consultation with the states and territories, promulgate regulations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, federally, to prevent the trade in invasive species of national importance. The Australian government took a different approach. Its response says:
While the EPBC Act is one mechanism for the control of weeds that pose a threat to Australia’s biodiversity, the Australian Government considers that in the first instance states and territories should improve the management and control of weeds within their jurisdictions.
I think it is a cop-out to say that the states and territories should improve the management and control of weeds within their jurisdiction. It is self-evident; of course they should, and they have to some degree. They need to do it better, particularly at points of entry into the country. But I believe that there is a clear role for the Commonwealth to play here, through federal environment protection laws and through the regulations, to proactively prohibit the trade in these species.
There has been some progress in general in that regard. The government’s response notes that former Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation Senator Ian Macdonald worked with state and territory counterparts from mid-2005 to try to prevent the further sale of plant species classified as weeds of national significance. There has been some progress in that regard. But, as this response itself notes, that has still not been fully addressed, in Victoria in particular. It has taken too long in some of the other states as well. It is simply ludicrous that we are identifying plant species as serious problems, in that they have the potential to become weeds, and yet they are still able to be sold. How could that even be a question for consideration?
I should emphasise that, whilst this part deals with plants, there is an issue with regard to the sale of ornamental or aquarium fish. I do not believe there are sufficient or adequate controls over the sale of some of those fish species that are sometimes released into the natural environment and present potential problems down the track. There are better controls in place now, in part due to the work of this committee and also due to the work that the Democrats have done through our implementation and strengthening of the federal environment protection act. The ability to better monitor and oversee the importation of plant and animals species into Australia and to assess in advance whether there is potential risk with regard to invasive species is a step forward, but we need to do more. There have been some advances, but the Commonwealth government can still take greater leadership in this area and can still make better use of the legislative tools and the financial resources that they have at their disposal. As we have seen with the equine virus, quarantine issues are always still very, very critical and can have a massive impact when they do not work. More needs to be done. The fact that it has taken nearly three years for the government to respond to this sends a bit of a signal that perhaps they still do not treat the issue with the seriousness and importance that it merits. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2007-09-13,"—I have a very brief oral report to make to the Senate on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges on the subject of unauthorised disclosure of committee proceedings. A sessional order on this subject was agreed to by the Senate on 6 October 2005, following a recommendation of this committee in its 122nd report and also following appropriate scrutiny of the drafting by the Procedure Committee.
The Privileges Committee has kept a watching brief on the operation of the order and notes that, since the order came into effect, not one new case of unauthorised disclosure has been raised as a matter of privilege. The committee also notes a small number of reports on committees’ use of the procedure to investigate their own cases of unauthorised disclosure and to determine whether further action is warranted.
In the committee’s view, the order appears to be operating effectively in conjunction with the 1996 order of continuing effect on this subject and should therefore be placed on the same footing. I therefore seek leave to give notice of a motion for the Senate to adopt the terms of the sessional order agreed to on 6 October 2005 as an order of continuing effect.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-13,"—I spoke to this document, which details the list of livestock mortalities for the second half of last year, July to December 2006, in the last sitting period. It includes one particular vessel with a very high degree of livestock mortalities. I spoke then about the significant difficulties there were in getting some transparent information about the reasons behind that high rate of mortality. It took a long period of time and a lot of persistence by Animals Australia, an animal welfare and rights organisation, to find the details. The basic explanation as to why there was this level of mortality was fairly perfunctory and, as it turned out, not particularly accurate. It took until the full information was released under FOI for some of the completely unsatisfactory reasons for the high livestock mortality on that particular vessel to become apparent. To me, apart from the problem of inadequate facilities and inadequate environments for livestock still persisting on some voyages, it also raises the wider concern that all the talk about greater transparency, openness and accountability in the industry continues to be belied by the inability to get to the full information and the full truth.
I have no doubt there have been some improvements on the way things used to be, but it is a simple fact that all the improvements that have occurred in the live export industry over the last couple of decades have come about as a result of persistent and consistent pressure from people in the community concerned about the animal welfare consequences, in particular, and problems. None of it has been generated by the industry itself, yet the industry continues to say that it is using best practice, that it is better than anywhere else, that it is in their own interest to have as good a standard as possible, et cetera. Each time there is enough information that gets out to highlight more inadequacies, there is another outcry, some more action happens, and then we are assured that everything is fine and could not be better until the next scandal and the next piece of information comes out to show that things still fall well short of the mark and well short of what should be satisfactory for a country like Australia that purports to be concerned about the welfare of animals.
The continuing reality is that live exports export jobs from Australia. While it is true that we have difficulty finding enough workers to staff a number of meatworks around Australia, that is a separate issue and simply a reflection of the wider skills and labour shortages in some regions and industries in different parts of Australia. We do not use that as an excuse to give up on any other industry but, for some reason, with live exports we seem to think that it is okay to keep exporting jobs as well as to align ourselves with and perpetuate an industry that has unacceptable animal welfare standards.
It should be emphasised that the continual reports and facts come to light not because of the industry being open but because of the continuing commitment of people in the community who are concerned about the immense, unnecessary and unacceptable levels of suffering of animals involved in the live export trade. There have been a number of pieces of footage shown of the absolutely appalling experiences that both Australian cattle and sheep go through when they are offloaded at ports in the Middle East, in places like Egypt. That is the fate that we as a nation are sending these animals to. The first time footage was produced of an abattoir in Egypt—at great personal risk to the people who arranged to shoot and get hold of that footage—we had the usual denials: ‘They are not Australian animals,’ ‘It is not even in Egypt,’ ‘It is all a beat-up,’ ‘It is all a stunt,’ and, ‘It is not real.’ Basically, a smokescreen was put up, so much so that people had to go back and do it again to show that, even after the Australian government had brought in place a memorandum of understanding with Egypt—which they said would fix everything up—the same problems existed. The minister finally admitted there was nothing they can do; it is not enforceable, and they will just keep plugging away. The federal government has basically given up on even pretending that there are adequate and acceptable animal welfare standards with regard to livestock when they reach their destination.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2007-09-13,"—This is a unanimous report of the Privileges Committee. It is a report that dealt with the inquiry into the possible false or misleading evidence and improper refusal to provide information to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee. This inquiry, conducted by the Privileges Committee, arose out of a referral by myself, as Deputy Chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, and Senator Murray. We jointly wrote to the President about what we felt may well have been the giving of false or misleading evidence to a Senate inquiry, whether there had been any improper refusal to provide information to a committee and whether any contempt had been committed.
The saga of events that led to this report from the Privileges Committee is fairly well known to senators, not just to those on the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. It arose out of the inquiry by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee into the operation of Regional Partnerships and the Sustainable Regions Program—also referred to as the ‘regional rorts inquiry’. I know government members would not accept that description.
I accept the report, and I endorse the motion moved by Senator Faulkner as chairman of the Privileges Committee. I have read the report a couple of times. The Privileges Committee recognised that it was dealing with a serious and complex issue. This was a major reason why Senator Murray and I referred it to the Privileges Committee. The issues before the Privileges Committee are set out on page 2 of its report, and I will read them into the Hansard:
Senators Forshaw and Murray then decided to raise Mr Maguire’s conduct as a matter of privilege on two counts:
first, that Mr Maguire refused to respond to the committee’s requests that he provide the information that he had undertaken to provide at the hearing, namely, a list of his companies; and
secondly, that in failing to corroborate his claim that his companies made substantial financial contributions to Mr Windsor’s political campaigns, a claim denied by Mr Windsor and his campaign chairman, Mr Stephen Hall, and unable to be substantiated by the AEC, Mr Maguire knowingly gave false or misleading evidence to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee.
What I have just read, in a very quick snapshot, summarises the issues that arose.
During the inquiry by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee into the Regional Partnerships program, Mr Greg Maguire gave evidence that he had made financial contributions to the campaign funds of Mr Tony Windsor, the current member for New England and a former member of the New South Wales parliament. He volunteered that evidence and he did so when the committee was testing assertions made by Mr Windsor regarding funding for an equestrian centre project to be built in Tamworth. There was a major difference of view about Mr Windsor’s role as a member and whether or not the project could be brought to fruition whilst he remained the member for New England. There is a lot more background to that, but Mr Maguire—who at the time was the chairman of the committee that was promoting this project—came along to demonstrate the veracity of his own submission and to refute other evidence. During his evidence Mr Maguire claimed that his companies had made contributions to Mr Windsor’s election campaigns. He said:
Mr Windsor is also aware that my companies have made substantial financial contributions to his political campaigns over the years.
I note that Senator Carr, who participated in the inquiry, is in the chamber. Mr Maguire was asked to provide some proof of what he had said—remembering that this is evidence that he volunteered—and he undertook to provide to the committee a list of companies that had made such contributions. Over many months—both up to the tabling of the committee’s report and subsequently—he refused to honour that undertaking. He refused to respond to requests and he refused to respond to letters from the secretary of the committee asking that he honour his obligation to provide the evidence. At the same time, the Australian Electoral Commission, which had examined the issue as well, apparently could find no evidence on their records of any disclosure of financial contributions.
So we had the situation where there was a direct conflict of evidence from Mr Windsor on the one hand, who denied that he had ever received such contributions, and Mr Maguire on the other hand, who said that he had made them. I note in the Privileges Committee report that they also requested that Mr Maguire provide the proof of financial contributions that he had undertaken to provide to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. At no stage did Mr Maguire comply. Rather, he engaged lawyers and adopted an approach where he was not going to cooperate and not going to respond. He made that clear in correspondence to both committees.
The problem that is noted in the Senate Privileges Committee report is that they reached an impasse because, in order to take the matter further, it would involve calling Mr Windsor, a member of the House of Representatives, before the Privileges Committee—something that is unable to be done due to the relationship between the two houses. As is stated in the report:
It is a well established rule that one House may not inquire into or adjudge the conduct of a member of another House.
So, unfortunately, the Privileges Committee reached the same dead-end that the Senate finance committee had reached, which was that we had no cooperation, no assistance and no response from Mr Maguire. To my mind, if you give evidence to a Senate committee and you make a statement and you offer to back that up with documentary proof and you fail to do so, there is only one conclusion that can be reached: that you do not have the evidence and it may have never existed. At all times, Mr Maguire has had the opportunity to comply but he has refused to do so. I note that the Senate Privileges Committee states:
This has been one of the more unsatisfactory inquiries of the committee. Conduct by a witness that would normally warrant the most serious criticism will remain unaddressed because jurisdictional issues prevent a full examination by the committee of all the circumstances. In other circumstances, a finding of contempt against Mr Maguire would appear to be almost a foregone conclusion. As a result of his conduct, Mr Maguire emerges from both this committee’s inquiry and that of the former Finance and Public Administration References Committee with little credibility.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2007-09-13,"—The topic of citizenship was high on the Senate’s agenda earlier this week and I would like to highlight a number of anniversaries and observances about to occur that are related to citizenship in Australia. Within the space of 11 days this month Australian citizens will mark an interesting series of events. These events, I believe, say a lot about our country and about our undoubted success as a country primarily of immigrants. They include: the sixth anniversary of the attacks in New York and Washington, which occurred on Tuesday this week; today, which is the beginning of the Muslim month of fasting, Ramadan; next Monday, which marks Australian Citizenship Day; and the following week, which has the Jewish Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, beginning at sunset on 21 September.
Today we see the start of Ramadan, an important time in the calendar for a great number of Australian citizens. I would like to extend to the Muslims of Australia best wishes for this month of fasting, a ritual that many of the 340,000 Muslims around this country will undertake over the next 30 days. During Ramadan Muslims will not partake of food or drink from sunrise to sunset and they will engage in extra prayers. The month of Ramadan marks the revelation of the Koran, the holy book of Islam, about 1,400 years ago.
The Muslims have been in Australia for more than 200 years, with some historians suggesting they were here before the First Fleet, with Macassan Muslims trading with Indigenous groups across Northern Australia. Since this time, Muslims have come from many different lands to make a contribution across many different areas in the development of Australia. We all know of the Afghani camel drivers who helped open up inland Australia, building the Overland Telegraph Line and the railways. There were Bosnian workers on the Snowy Mountains scheme and, in North Queensland, Muslims were pioneers of the sugarcane and tobacco industries. Their stories are sometimes overlooked but their contributions should never be forgotten.
Today, almost 40 per cent of Australian Muslims were born right here in Australia. And whether they are ‘new’ or ‘old’ Australians we see Muslim success at the highest level of business and sport, with people like John Ilhan, the owner of Crazy John’s phone company; Ahmed Fahour, the CEO of the National Australia Bank; Hazem El Masri, the great point-scoring rugby league player from the Canterbury Bulldogs; and Bachar Houli, the first Muslim playing in the AFL, for Essendon.
The Muslims are among our professors, surgeons, teachers, bakers and scientists. According to a Family and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs report released just last month, Muslims have an above-average proportion of postgraduate degrees compared with the rest of the Australian population, and one of the most common languages spoken in Australian Muslim homes is English. In Queensland, my home state, English is the most common language spoken in Muslim homes. In business, the halal meat industry contributes $5 billion annually to the Australian economy and employs more than 30,000 people.
All of Australia has had the opportunity to learn a little about Islam over the past six months with the Family and Community Services program Sharing our Achievements. Sharing our Achievements was a whole-of-government initiative that originally came out of the Prime Minister’s Muslim Reference Group established for the purpose of explaining to wider Australia the successes and contributions of Muslim people. Sharing our Achievements has now produced a report that showcases Australian Muslims in each state and their contributions to our country. FaCSIA has reported that the program was a great success with many thousands of non-Muslim Australians learning what their fellow Muslim countrymen and women have contributed over the past 200-plus years.
To the Jewish people of Australia I also offer my good wishes as they observe the holy day of Yom Kippur next week. From sunset on Friday, 21 September, to sunset on Saturday, 22 September, Jews around the world will fast. This day is considered one of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar. As you can see, this country was built by people from many different countries and religions, and next Monday when we celebrate Citizenship Day we should recognise and give thanks not just for the diversity, prosperity and richness these many cultures have brought to this country but also for the vibrancy and the tolerance of our nation.
I was privileged to officiate at my first citizenship ceremony as a senator for Queensland a few weeks back in Brisbane. This ceremony was hosted by the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland. The Ethnic Communities Council is the peak body of the multicultural community in Queensland and members of the council have contributed a great deal to the harmonious relations between the different cultures in Queensland. Stalwarts of the ECCQ include Nick Xynias, the honorary president, and the chairman, Serge Voloschenko. We are very proud of our community leaders in Queensland, and people like Nick and Serge, along with Eddie Liu, the ‘Father of Chinatown’, the Deen family, including Ray and Sultan, who have helped build most of the mosques in Brisbane, are the types of leaders that any community would be proud of—hard-working, committed and passionate about this country—and all have a background from outside Australia. They are the people that Citizenship Day is designed to remind us about.
At the Citizenship Ceremony in Brisbane I stood and looked at the variety of people that were undertaking their pledge to be loyal citizens and to respect the rights and liberties of this country. They came from 12 different countries and the oldest of them was 78. They came from Malaysia, Burma, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Germany and the UK, to name a few. I was deeply impressed by the strength and commitment these people had in pledging allegiance to a totally new country away from the country of their birth, their culture and their heritage.
For those who make a conscious decision to come to this country and then make a conscious decision to become a citizen, it must be a very special feeling—the feeling of deciding to really belong; to see your family prosper in this country; to see future generations take full advantage of what this country offers. It is a reminder for those of us born here not to take the rights and privileges of citizenship for granted. There are around one million eligible people in this country who have yet to take up citizenship and more than half of them come from the UK and New Zealand.
The dictionary meaning of ‘citizenship’ is the status of a citizen with its attendant duties, rights and privileges—and it is a privilege. To gain citizenship of a country means that you have made a conscious decision to be a connected, contributing member of the society, to enjoy the advantages of what being a citizen means and to participate in the future direction of the country.
As a citizen of Australia you are entitled to vote—a fundamental principle, and a democratic freedom that is still being fought for today, in the 21st century, by the peoples of a number of countries. This is something that we tend not to remember often enough. Voting gives you the opportunity to have your say in the government you want, on how you want to shape the future of the country, and to fully participate in the political direction of this country. Australia has a strong and favourable reputation in the world, and having a passport is one of the privileges of Australian citizenship. You can also stand for parliament, and I would like to point out that in the Senate right now we have senators from eight different national backgrounds, including the UK, New Zealand, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Malaysia and Belgium.
My message to those considering becoming Australian citizens is this: do it for the right reasons. Do it because you put Australia’s interests first and you want to see a vibrant, diverse and tolerant nation, with the wonderful strength that this brings us in these times of international divisiveness and sometimes fear.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Citizenship</title>,Adjournment,39,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-09-13," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 22 May 2007:
How many, or what proportion of, Australians with a severe or profound disability need no government-funded disability services.
Given the limited resources that the Government has available to provide disability services, how does the Government ensure that it provides essential services for the people who need them the most; and (b) is this outcome achieved through the Government’s policy of setting priority for service provision based on the ‘relative need’ of people with a disability.
What measures ensure the Government’s ‘relative need’ policy is effective.
Given that the inquiry by the Community Affairs Committee into the Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement (CSTDA) found that substantial numbers of people with disabilities do not receive essential services, will the Government increase CSTDA funding significantly in the 2008-09 Budget; if so, how much of the unmet need will the funding increase eliminate.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Services</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,41,1,question
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-09-13,"—The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question.
Data on the number of people with disability who do not need government-funded disability services is not collected.
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) has, as part of its Disability Series, published a number of reports on the demand for services provided under the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement (CSTDA). In June 2007, the AIHW released its fourth study on the topic of ‘Current and future demand for specialist disability services’.
A copy of this publication is available on the Institute’s website at www.aihw.gov.au.
(b), (3) and (4) There is an acknowledged level of unmet need for accommodation support for people with disability. While this is an area of state and territory responsibility, the Australian Government has injected an additional $704 million over the last two CSTDA Agreements to address this issue. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that this additional funding has had any impact on improving outcomes for people with disability by reducing unmet demand.
The recent announcement by the Australian Government of a $1.8 billion Disability Assistance Package over five years will provide a significant response to the key recommendations of the Senate Inquiry in the area of unmet need for disability accommodation, assistance for older carers and early intervention.
As part of the Disability Assistance Package, the Australia Government has allocated $1.5million to conduct a high level enquiry to identify the barriers to private sector involvement in the delivery of disability supported accommodation.
Further information on the Disability Assistance Package can be found at www.facsia.gov.au or alternatively the Disability Assistance Inquiry Line on 1800 101 888 or TTY 1800 260 402.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Services</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,41,1,answer
